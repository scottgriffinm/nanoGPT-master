Get your cash up, get your check up
The whole system’s a setup, it’s time we really get up
We been about this revolution from the time we met up
Take it back, I got my fist up, Malcolm X in ‘88
But revolution only work for those that will participate
You are great, they are fake
Yo, it’s time to demonstrate
Higher level mental states
Conscious people, congregate!
Show the love, not the hate
This is basic, no debate
But these people are debating and they hating, they should wait
It was bickering amongst ourselves that got us in this state
Yeah, the truth is inconvenient, but the truth is never late

[Chorus]
You can’t see what they be doing?
How they thinking? How they moving?
You can’t see what they pursuing?
Making claims, none are proven

Don’t fall for it, don’t fall for it
Don’t fall for it, don’t fall for it

We can see who is the enemy
Sovereignty’s the remedy
You don’t need telepathy
It’s white supremacy

Don’t fall for it, don’t fall for it
Don’t fall for it, don’t fall for it

[Verse 2]
Bringing it raw, doing a tour
Government officials breaking the law
You never see what you never saw
303, open the door
Knowledge reigns, that is the game
Ignorance, that is insane
Don’t fall for it, the Reps and the Dems are the same
This one's shooting us up, that one's locking us up
This one got us stuck, that one's outta luck
You could front if you need to, the cycle never ends
No justice, but in four years they hyping us again

[Chorus]
Don’t fall for it, don’t fall for it
Don’t fall for it, don’t fall for it

If you thinking that you earning
And you drinking and you burning
And you really not concerning
With the news and what they learning

Don’t fall for it, don’t fall for it
Don’t fall for it, don’t fall for it

If you love it, never hate it
You agree and don't debate it
HBCU educated
Your degree is highly rated

Don’t fall for it, don’t fall for it
Don’t you fall for it, don’t fall for it

[Verse 3]
Yo, me, I'm not a fake dude, I'ma keep it real real
They see through it all, that "America needs to heal" deal
America ain't really sick, this is what it really is
Gunshots and cages for black and brown little kids
Now they acting like they not the cause of how we live
Do not tell me what you gonna do, I can see what you did
Look at her, look at him, look at them, look at me
Do you see our interests represented in society?
No you don't, and you won't 'cause democracy's a joke
Every four years these same people asking us to vote
Nothing changed but the Range Rover switching lanes over
I remain the flamethrower, knowledge reigns, game over
Don't fall for it, don't you fall for it
Rodney King, George Floyd, man, we all saw it

[Chorus]
So don't protest with defiance
But don't move with self-reliance
While the soul is being silenced
For the religion of science

Don’t fall for it, don’t you fall for it
Don’t fall for it, don’t you fall for it

If you thinking that you earning
And you drinking and you burning
And you really not concerning
With the news and what they learning

Don’t fall for it, don’t you fall for it
Don’t fall for it, don’t you fall for it

There's no justice in the courts
We are always taking shorts
They can shoot us like a sport
And it's our trust that they want?

Don’t fall for it, don’t you fall for it
Don’t fall for it, don’t you fall for it

[Outro]
Take it up!
Take it low now

Don’t fall for it, don’t you fall for it
Don’t fall for it, don’t you fall for it

[Chorus]
You're a creep
You're such a fucking creep (I will find Out)

So we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin' what I want to
With nobody tellin' me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feelin' so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness?
But I'm feelin' kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And-and I gotta get back to-to her-her
Now-now I'm leavin' quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well it all-well it all down-down

Back to the crib, show you how I live
Let's get drunk, forget what we did

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'ma buy you a drank
And then I'ma take you home with me

Won't you meet me at the bar, respect big pimpin'
Tell me how you feel, mama tell me what you sippin'
A certified dime piece, deserve Louis one three
One fifty a shot, three for you and three for me
I'm checking your body language, I love the conversation
And when you lick your lips I get a tingling sensation
Now were both 'bout tipsy, you say you in the mood
All I need is 'bout a hour, better yet maybe two
Let me take you where I live, Ferrari switch gears
When I whisper in your ear, your legs hit the chandelier
Passion fruit and sex all in the atmosphere
I'ma let T-Pain sing it so he can make it clear

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'ma buy you a drank, woah, oh-ooh, woah
And then I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank

From the front, to the back I wanna make you feel good

I ain't never been a sucker for love
Never even had a gilrfriend 'til I started fuckin with her
Ain't never even knocked her down
And she hooked on awards tryin to lock me down
With one flick of the tongue I was sprung
And we didn't get done 'til fo' or five in the mornin
She had me deep in the zone (deep in the zone)
You get a brand new wardrobe but baby you ain't goin home
The new Jag and all the Louis bags
Chanel and Excata straight from Belle Harbor
I told my homeboys I'll holla
I got plans for a date, my girl want steaks
And she prefer Benihana's (Benihana's)
We can go from Monday to Sunday, don't even matter 'bout the money
I'm stuck on her, never shoulda let her suck on it
Shoulda hit her up and sent her home the next mornin

[Bridge 3: T-Pain]
She got me doin, what I won't do

Trucker hat from AWGE, you bastards
That's Chanel, my bag Chanel, my bitch Chanel
My bag Chanel, her rag Chanel, we match, Chanel
When I was younger, man, I wished that I was light-skinned
Now I wouldn't trade the world for my skin
I surpassed what you could do inside your life span
So just give me a little credit like a white man
That's good credit, hood credit, fuck credibility
Flacko loko, need my strength and meet my .44
Please, capeesh, my beats on hold (Hold)
Don't hold me up, she on her knees, the low blow (Low blow)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
On thе very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
(Evermore)

[Bridge 1: Justin Vernon]
Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

[Bridge 2: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again, if you think of all the costs)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves, being tossed)
(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)
You were there

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for
Evermore
Evermore
Evermore
This pain wouldn't be for evermore
Evermore

[Intro]
(Check, check, check)

[Verse 1]
If not now, then when?
When the forest's nearly gone
When the hole's in the ozone
When the bees are gone
If not now, then when?
When the ocean's coming up
When the rain just won't stop
When the fire's burning
If not now, then when?

[Verse 2]
If not now, then when?
When Big Pharma's ripping me
When my data's tracking me
When my phone is spying
If not now, then when?
When my choicе is monitored
When computers arе cleverer
When our food is poison
If not now, then

[Chorus]
This is an emergency
Need to act more quickly
This is no quandary
This is an emergency
Woo!

[Chorus]
This is an emergency
Need to act more quickly
This is no quandary
This is an emergency

[Verse 3]
When the oceans turn to black
When the animals are dead
When the birds are gone
If not now, then when?
When the blue sky turns to black
When Gaia hangs by a thread
When all the people die
If not now, then when?

[Verse 1]
How's one to know?
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand

[Pre-Chorus]
And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you

[Verse 2]
I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered

[Verse 3]
Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground
How's one to know?
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
And I'm covered in you

[Bridge]
So yeah, it's a fire
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah, it's a war
It's the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered
In you, in you
Now I'm covered in you
In you

[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Bridge]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 1]
If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

[Chorus]
So we could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

[Verse 2]
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
And thе school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

[Bridge]
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

[Outro]
It always leads to you and my hometown

[Verse 1]
Never be so kind
You forget to be clever
Never be so clever
You forget to be kind

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were talking to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around

[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

[Verse 2]
Never be so politе
You forget your power
Nevеr wield such power
You forget to be polite

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were listening to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around

[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

[Bridge]
The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me

[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

[Outro]
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were singing to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around
I know better
But you're still around

[Verse 1]
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

[Chorus]
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

[Verse 2]
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
"This dorm was once a madhouse"
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
"She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

[Chorus]
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

[Outro]
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

[Intro]
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in

[Chorus]
But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 1]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door

[Refrain]
At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 2]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore

[Refrain]
At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it will never be

[Outro]
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasn't right
The way it all went down
Looks like you know that now

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, your closure

[Verse 2]
Don't treat me like
Some situation that needs to be handled
I'm fine with my spite
And my tears, and my beers and my candles
I can feel you smoothing me over

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing bettеr
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your lеtter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, your closure
Your closure, your closure

[Bridge]
I know I'm just a wrinkle in your new life
Staying friends would iron it out so nice
Guilty, guilty, reaching out across the sea
That you put between you and me
But it's fake and it's oh so unnecessary

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, closure, your closure
Your closure

[Verse 1]
I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I

[Chorus 1]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Verse 2]
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn, I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
You're so much older and wiser and I

[Chorus 1]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Bridge]
While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I

[Chorus 2]
Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Outro]
I sit and watch you

[Intro: HAIM]
He did it
He did it

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losin' sleep
Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
She says, "I think he did it, but I just can't prove it"
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

[Post-Chorus: HAIM]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
At her job or anywhere
Hе reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

[Post-Chorus: HAIM & Taylor Swift]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift & Danielle Haim]
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me
(She was with me, dude)
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it

[Outro: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he—
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he—
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he died

[Verse 1]
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet

[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Verse 2]
Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
You haven't met the new me yet

[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Bridge]
I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too

[Verse 3]
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that

[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Verse 1]
Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this place is the same as it ever was
Ooh, but you won't like it that way

[Chorus]
It's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of bеing known for who you know
You know that you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)
Dorothea (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, you'rе a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines
Ooh, from you, I'd buy anything

[Verse 2]
Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I guess I'll never know
Ooh, and you'll go on with the show

[Chorus]
But it's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know
You know, you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)
Dorothea (Ah-ah)

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Dorothea (Ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah
Ooh

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Verse 2: Matt Berninger with Taylor Swift]
The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Matt Berninger]
'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Matt Berninger, Both]
Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
I'm on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
When the sun goes down
The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my, making you my
Making you my centerfold

[Verse 1]
And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, "Dancin' is a dangerous game"

[Verse 2]
Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

[Chorus]
I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

[Verse 3]
Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar

[Chorus]
You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

[Post-Chorus 1]
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me

[Post-Chorus 2]
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

[Chorus]
You're a cowboy like me

[Post-Chorus 1]
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me

[Post-Chorus 2]
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

[Bridge]
And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down

[Verse 4]
Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con

[Chorus]
I've had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

[Outro]
And I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again

[Verse 1]
Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break

[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready

[Chorus]
'Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you

[Bridge]
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
No more tug of war
Now I just know there's more (Know there's more)
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore

[Verse 3]
Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go

[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short, I survived

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
(And now) I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you
(And now) Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you

[Outro]
Long story short, it was a bad time
Long story short, I survived

[Verse 1]
When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not in fact what she seemed
Not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught

[Chorus]
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

[Verse 2]
Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse

[Chorus]
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing

[Verse 3]
Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
Begging 'til my knees bled
I gave it my all, he gave me nothing at all
Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass
But I've got me

[Chorus]
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
I know when it's time to go

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing

[Outro]
That will find you the right thing
And you know in your soul
You know in your soul
When it's time to go
You know, you know, you know, you know
When it's time to go
So then you go
Then you go
You just go

[Verse 1]
Ambulance, ambulance, ambulance
Are we dead? Are we dead? Are we dead?
Is there any, is there any life left in me?
Give my blood, give my lung I gave it all to him

[Pre-Chorus]
There’s an orange-ish yellowy orb
On a light-blue glass table
And I know that it could heal me
But instead, I feed it into your mouth, oh

[Chorus]
How am I always falling?
Why am I always reaching back for you?
Where did you put your loving?
I feel it happening again
I’m in love with nothing
I feel it happening again
I’m in love with nothing

[Verse 2]
Ambivalence, Ambivalence, Ambivalеnce
It’s all you had, it’s all you had, it’s all you had
All of this tendernеss was it in my hand
Who am I? Who am I? I gave it all to him

[Pre-Chorus]
There’s a pinkish-orange color
When I close my eyes to kiss him
And I know it’s going to blind me
But I just have to put him into my mouth, oh

[Chorus]
How am I always falling
Why am I always reaching back for you?
Where did you take your loving
I feel it happening again
I’m in love with nothing
How am I always falling
(How am I always falling)
Why am I always reaching back for you?
(I'm reaching back for you)
Where did you take your loving
(Where did you take your loving)
I feel it happening again
I’m in love with nothing
I feel it happening again
I’m in love with nothing

["Billie Jean"]:
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh)
Hey-ay
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!
Ah, hee-hee-hee!
Hee! Hoo!

["Black or White"]:
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the samе
Now, I believe in miraclеs
And a miracle has happened tonight
Hee!
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh!

They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
Hoo!
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Hoo!

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
Hee-hee!

But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Alright, alright
Alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo! (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

It's tough for you to get by (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo!

["We Are The World" by Children's Choir]:
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
It's true

[Spoken by Michael Jackson]:
Today, we stand together all around the world
Joined in a common purpose
To remake the planet into a haven of joy
And understanding and goodness
No one should have to suffer
Especially our children
This time, we must succeed
This is for the children of the world

["Heal the World"]:
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you will feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into
Ploughshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world (Heal the world)
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Intro]
Give it right back, daddy, give right back (Uh)
This look pretty, can I sit right back?
On it, give it right back
Baby, do ya like that? (Uh)
Take that from me when I give that back
Wait, give it right back, daddy, give right back (Uh)
This look pretty, can I sit right back?
On it, give it right back
Baby, do ya like that? (Uh)

[Verse 1]
Baby, I know you've seen it in my eyes
I got a lot for you, and deeper than you know
Never thought 'bout how you give so damn much
What I've taken from you, I can give right back, 'cause

[Chorus]
I feel like, I feel like you deserve me
I'm feeling generous, I'd give, give you whatever you want
No need to persuade, promise you're doing enough, so
I'm feeling gеnerous, I'd give, give you whatеver you want
Generous, I'd give, give you whatever you—
Generous, I'd give, give you whatever you want

[Bridge]
Take that from me when I give that back
Wait, give it right back, daddy, give it right back (Uh)
This look pretty, can I sit right back?
On it, give it right back
Baby, do ya like that? (Uh)
I, I, I, I can do many things, many things, many things (Yo)

[Verse 2]
I could probably cater to you
I might be lookin' like a waiter to you
And all them niggas I was talking to
I keep them off the radar for you
'Cause they do nothing they say they gon' do
And I be feelin' like a dog the way I'm pacin', sittin', waitin' for you
Just contemplating all the naughty shit I'm waitin' to do
And I can lay that out on the table for you
I want to fuck just like we came straight from the zoo
And they don't make them like him anymore
Feel bad for these niggas, competition's very strong
I bust the longest mission for some missionary raw
He could make a mess and tell me, "Lick it off the floor" (Shit)

[Chorus]
I feel like, I feel like you deserve me
I'm feeling generous, I'd give, give you whatever you want
No need to persuade, promise you're doing enough, so
I'm feeling generous, I'd give, give you whatever you want
Generous, I'd give, give you whatever you—
Generous, I'd give, give you whatever you want

[Verse 1]
Friends break up, friends get married
Strangers get born, strangers get buried
Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
But I'm right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I, I'm right where you left me

[Pre-Chorus]
Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, "What a sad sight"
I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared

[Chorus]
Right where you left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever

[Verse 2]
Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And you're sitting in front of me

[Bridge]
At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right
I, I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on

[Pre-Chorus]
Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, "What a sad sight"
I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
I'm sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware
'Cause I'm right where I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I can't bear witness
And it's been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong

[Chorus]
I'm right where
You left me
You left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me
You left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
I don't care what you do, don't care what you say
Don't care where you go, or how long you stay
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

You take my money and you turn me out
You fill me up with self-doubt
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

You made me eat a ton of dust
You're potentially dangerous and not worthy of trust
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

Little by little, bit by bit
Every day I'm becomin' more of a hypocrite
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

You've got my mind tied up in knots
I just keep recyclin' the same old thoughts
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

When I heard you was cold, I bought you a coat and hat
I think you must have forgotten 'bout that
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more
Gonna blow out your mind and make it pure
I've taken about as much of this as I can endure
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

You put me down from a haver creak
That's all right, to you i turn the other cheek
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

You say you need me, how would I know?
You say you love me, but it can't be so
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

I don't wanna brag, but I'll wring your neck
When all else fails, I'll make it a matter of self-respect
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

Livin' this way ain't a natural thing to do
Why was I born to love you?
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

Welcome back to Al TV! Right now, it's time for our exclusive interview with Mr Marshall Mathers, also known as Eminem, also known as The Real Slim Shady, also known as Missy "Misdemeanour" Elliott. We’ll follow his startling transformation from hardcore Alf fan to hardcore rapper. This is indeed a pleasure. Marshall, welcome to Al TV! I'm sorry, should I call you Marshall or Missy?

[EMINEM]
Marshall, y'know what I’m sayin'?

{AL}
Well, Marshall it is, then. Hope it wasn't out of line to ask.

[EMINEM]
No, it wasn't. Y'know what I'm sayin'?

[AL]
I know what you're saying. ’Cause, you know, I wouldn’t want you to be offended.

[EMINEM]
And I'm not. A’ight, y'know what I'm sayin'?

[AL]
I know what you’re saying.

[EMINEM]
Y'know what I'm saying?

[AL]
I know what you're saying.

[EMINEM]
Y'know what I'm saying?

[AL]
*sigh* Yes, I do.

[EMINEM]
Y'know what I'm saying?

[AL]
Yes.

[EMINEM]
Y'know what I'm saying?

[AL]
Yep.

[EMINEM]
Y'know what I'm saying?

[AL]
I know what you're saying.

[EMINEM]
Y'know what I'm saying?

{AL}
Yeah!

[EMINEM]
Y'know what I'm saying?

{AL}
Yes, yes!

[EMINEM]
Y'know what I'm saying?

{AL}
Yes!

[EMINEM]
Y'know what I'm saying?

[AL]
Yes!

[EMINEM]
Y'know what I'm saying? (x8)

[AL]
Yes, I - I told ya! Look, I said that I- What? I said I-
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

[EMINEM]
Y'know what I'm saying?

[AL}
Yеs, yes I know what you're saying, alright?

[EMINEM]
*sighs* Whatevеr...

[AL]
Anyway, thanks for being on the show. You know, we've had a lot of great guests dropping by. Have you ever met Celine Dion?

[EMINEM]
I have felt like killing her before.

[AL]
Well, obviously, we all have. Um, ever felt like killing anybody else?

[EMINEM]
Y'know, most of my family members.

[AL]
That's nice. Which reminds me, do you feel that you owe at least part of your success to the loving support that your family has given you over the years?

[EMINEM]
I don't owe nobody in my family nothin'.

[AL]
You don't owe nobody in your family nothing? Wow, that's a triple negative! Does that mean that you do owe somebody in your family something?

[EMINEM]
It's like, it's up to you to decide y'know?

[AL]
Oh, I almost forgot. I know it's your favourite, so I made you a Twinkie wiener sandwich.

[EMINEM]
I knew you'd make it, I knew you'd make it.

[AL]
But before I give it to you, I just want you to answer me one simple question: what is the mathematical formula used to determine the area inside a pentadodecahedron?

[EMINEM]
It's a simple formula, it's a simple formula.

[AL]
Alright, what is it?

[EMINEM]
You know.

[AL]
No I don't know(!). What is it?

[EMINEM]
It's-it's-it's easy. I mean, the formula is- first of all, the, y'know...

[AL]
Yeah, yeah, that's what I thought. You have no idea what you're talking about.

[EMINEM]
Yeah, so I'd better just shut up.

[AL]
Uh-huh. Um, what was the last time you were completely de-loused?

[EMINEM]
Um, *bleeped*. Last year?

[AL]
Hm. Well, I've been asking all the questions here. Are there any questions you wanna ask me?

[EMINEM]
You know, how many times can you rhyme...uh... tearing me apart, breaking my heart?

[AL]
Well, let's see. Homer and Bart, medical chart, strawberry tart, served on a cart, back to the start, post-modern art, plastic lawn dart, missing a part, Humphrey Bogart, lighting a fart and blue light special each day at K-Mart! Eleven!

[EMINEM]
You're being a *bleeped* *bleeped*.

[AL]
Jealous, much? Hey, d'ya know,I ha- I was wondering: why weren't you at the Academy Awards to pick up your Oscar? Was your macrame class that night?

[EMINEM]
Yeah.

[AL]
Bummer. But, I know this, but you did show up at the MTV Awards and you almost got into a fight with Triumph The Insult Comic Dog. Were you afraid that a sock puppet was gonna kick your butt?

[EMINEM]
Y'know, that was the way I felt at the time y'know?

[AL]
Well, have you two patched things up or is your rap war still going on?

[EMINEM]
Yeah, it's still going on.

[AL]
That's too bad. Y'know, I ran into Triumph recently and, uh, he wanted me to tell you that he thinks you're a really excellent rapper... for him to poop on. How does that make you feel?

[EMINEM]
I don't know, it's like... I don't know, it doesn't necessarily hurt my feelings because I kind of expect it, y'know what I'm saying?

[AL]
So, tell me, Marshall, how do you feel about censorship in music?

[EMINEM]
I feel like, um, y'know, I-I really believe in freedom of speech, I can't even stress that enough. I feel like, especially artistic expression, y'know, I believe an artist should be an artist and be able to say whatever he wants to say whether, whether you think it's good or bad, y'know.

[AL]
Uh-huh. So you think, for example, if somebody wanted to do, oh I don't know, a parody of somebody else's video they should be able to artistically express themselves and just do it?

[EMINEM]
Um...

[AL]
Oh, I'm just bustin' your chops. I know you said I couldn't do a video for my Lose Yourself parody but, hey, y'know, it's your choice.

[EMINEM]
Yeah, exactly. So-

[AL]
Just between you and me, though, don't you think my version of the song is just a little bit better than yours?

[EMINEM]
And that's kinda what pisses me off.

[AL]
I knew it! Well, now I don't have a video to promote my new album Poodle Hat, but y'know. As long as you're happy. You are happy, aren't you? You're happy, right? 'Cause I sure want you to be happy!

[EMINEM]
You're *bleeped* crazy! You're crazy, for real, you're crazy.

[AL]
Well, since I don't have a video for it, and since this is my stinkin' show, whaddaya say we just sit here and listen to the whole song right now?

[Couch Potato by" Weird Al" Yankovic plays. AL reads a newspaper while EMINEM sits, looking embarrassed]

[AL]
Aw, what's the matter? Don't you like it?

[EMINEM]
No, I, it's-it's just, it's ridiculous, it's repetitive and just, it gets on my nerves.

[AL]
Eh, give me a break. I could only change the words, I couldn't change the music too.

[EMINEM]
I just think that, um, it's sissy music.

[AL]
Really? Well, then I imagine you'd really like it.

[EMINEM]
No, you didn't just say that! You little bitch!

[AL]
Aw, come on, Marshall, you came out of the closet years ago. Don't be so coy.

[EMINEM]
That was my personal business, y'know what I'm saying?

[AL]
Marshall, it's okay, you can talk about it now. Do you remember what it was like when you first came out?

[EMINEM]
Um, like when I first came out, when I first came out, I noticed a difference, like, when I first came out, I came out, when I came out, not many people really understood me or understood where I was coming from.

[AL]
That must have been tough. H-hey, y'know, I have to admit, I- I was a little bit nervous about doing this interview. I-

[EMINEM]
Relax guy, I like gay men, y'know.

[AL]
That's great, but I-I'm not gay.

[EMINEM]
I don't believe that.

[AL]
Well, *laughs* sorry, but I'm not. What, do you find me attractive or something?

[EMINEM]
Maybe I do...

[AL]
Wait, I- are you hitting on me?

[EMINEM]
Yeah...

[AL]
Uh...

[EMINEM]
You don't have anything to say?

[AL]
Well, I'm flattered, I guess. but I'm just really not interested. Why don't you go hit on Brad Pitt or something?

[EMINEM]
Yeah, he's cute, but isn't he married though?

[AL]
Yeah, I guess so, but, look, I'm sorry if you got the wrong impression. I-I just asked you here so I could interview you, that's all!

[EMINEM]
Well what the *bleeped*,this is, you know, this is *bleeped* to me.

[AL]
Hey, calm down! I-I just wanted to talk to you about your music. Y-y'know, I happen to think you're very talented and, and you've got a lot of potential for growth. I-I see your talent as, as kind of a little acorn seed, and when that acorn seed is- is planted, and watered, and nurtured and allowed to grow, do you know what it eventually becomes?

[EMINEM]

*bleeped* tree!

[AL]
Yeah... do you think you might possibly have Tourette's syndrome?

[EMINEM]
Y'know, y'know if it's *bleeped* whatever, y'know.

[AL]
You've got a little potty mouth, don't you?

[EMINEM]
I don't believe that nobody can not swear.

[AL]
You don't believe that nobody can not swear? Wow, another triple negative! So does that mean that you do believe that somebody can- oh, nevermind. So, how do you feel about clean rappers like Will Smith?

[EMINEM]
I used to respect Will Smith, and when he came out and started talking about, you know, he-he dissed the whole gender of-of-of rap.

[AL]
The whole gender of rap? Are you sure you don't mean genre? I- I mean, I don't wanna second-guess you or anything, uh, you are the Oscar-winning, critically-acclaimed wordsmith and all. Um, so, you're a- you're a big fan of the gender of rap then, are you?

[EMINEM]
That is one of the most influential musics out there.

[AL]
Very well-spoken. Well, speaking of rap, we're gonna have to wrap up this little interview *laughs*. You know, I'm actually free after the show. You wanna maybe go out and do something later?

[EMINEM]
We'll get- we'll get- we'll get some decent-looking dudes and we'll-

[AL]
No, Marshall, I told you I'm not into that! How about if we just go bowling instead?

[EMINEM}
A'ight.

[AL]
Great, well thanks for coming on the show. And, by the way, in case you didn't know, *laughs* I'm just playin', Marshall, you know I love you.

[EMINEM]
Right.

[AL]
We'll be right back.

[EMINEM punches AL in the face. AL falls to the floor.]

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
I come through smellin' like sex
Ain’t no tellin', I flex
Fuck that, tell 'em I’m next
Bank emailin' my checks
ShadeRoom, tell 'em I flexed
You can never tell I'm stressed
Pack out the mail, it's fresh
Back out on bail, I'm blessed
I'm an original shooter, if you try to boot it, my niggas won't fail no test
I bought a hard piece
She wanna fuck on these Walmart sheets
Told her, "Take me to the mall, please"
This dick deservin’ a Moncler fleece
Brought my brand new bitch a Maltese
Upgraded her up from that Cromwell, peace
Shawty, she said that she love me, she thuggin’
No matter, no what and no budget
She ballin', she fuckin’, I got it regardless
She finna say I'm the hardest
He bet not play at the party
I make my way to his shawty, bop
She like the way that I walk, she say that I'm gnarly
All in that kitchen I'm cheffin’, I just done bought me an FN
Don't need no stepper, I'm steppin'
All in my drawer where I kept it
He thought he was sure but I left him
Ayy, damn, I'm goin' nuts on designer
None of my cuts are from China
Boy, where the fuck did you find 'em?
Fresh in this Dolce Gabbana, you'd think that I come with some powder
Hop in the Mase-rati then pop out like ta-da
You know my hoes buy the day to day Prada
Bitch, I'm a day to day shotta
I go do the race like I'm Tay-K, in case if I gotta, ayy

[Verse 2: VV$ Ken]
She say I'm way too conceited
I pull up and fuck on lil' mama and beat it
I go grab another lil' bitch and repeat it
She wanted to suck it as soon as we meetin', that's crazy
Just went and bought a Mercedes, I'm pullin' up smooth on the ladies
AMG Benz, it's the latest, I hit it like Ali, she said I'm the greatest
I fucked on that pussy but we never dated (Nah)
They say I look like I got it
Gucci on down to the wallet
I know they play 'fore they call it
Spinnin' out, dumpin', I'm shootin' the day that they thought it (Grr)
I used to swipe, I'm way too gangster to type it
I'm under his nose when I wipe it
She under my nuts, what she chewin'
Her boyfriend keep callin' her phone, tryna see what she doin', he lame
Ayy, it's all part of the game
I'm thuggin', you know how I came
I'ma stay true to the game, if a nigga get hot, I'ma put out a flame
I only spend bread on my main
I'm on a mission to kill 'em, I catch 'em, with lead, I'ma fill 'em
I know that he dead how I did 'em
They told 'em take off 'fore I hit 'em
I caught 'em, I shot 'em, I peel 'em, he dead (Grr)

[Intro]
Ayy

[Verse]
Except for when my baby mama think I'm scammin' her
I'm on the run from bein' broke and I got stamina
Said I'ma fuck some good pussy, I got stamina (Uh)
I'm goin' through some shit, you see the damages
My lil' niggas catchin' bullets and I can't balance it (Ayy)
.50 on that scope, I play the analyst
And if it's fuck boys in my squad, I'ma handle it (Uh)
Angels on my body, watch my back like analyst (Uh)
Learned that I can't trust her if she move too scandalous (Ayy)
Selfies in the trap, ayy, my dawg, who's mans is this? (Ayy)
We don't need no flicks of this cocaine or cannabis (Ayy)
I'ma hit the jeweler, ice my neck and my wrist (Ayy)
I'ma do my ears too, fuck it, and the fists (Uh)
Caught up on the stakeout, fuck, who's plan is this?
Cocaine in my ride, I know the cops done planted this
I had to lеave my main bitch for my side piecе
While I'm on this road, I need no emotions beside me
Only loyal bitches that ain't caught in shit besides me
You play, I'll probably leave you too, nigga, don't try me
Pray to God early in the mornin'
Then I make 230 off the corner
The trap house was singin' like Dino Spumoni
They almost caught me slippin', but I cut it like I'm Tony (Yeah, nigga)
I'm an all organic flexer, ain't no flexin' with me
Sexy bitches got alexa in the Lexus with me
I drop a block, the drug dealer's playin' Tetris with me
I got the ox in case you niggas got some tension with me
My main chick know I'm cheatin' and I'm lyin' too
Sometimes she call me out, like what you tryna do?
I told her I flew out, but I was lyin' too
I just had my other bitch fly in and she was slidin' thru
I don't want my bitch no more, I think I'm over it
How many times am I gon' slide off in her ovaries
How many times am I gon' take her on them same dates
Until she find some other guy that she put over me?
I'ma love that bitch for three months and then I'ma cut her off
And for that whole three, I swear that I'ma stunt her off (Uh)
New chain, new earring, fuck the cost
And when it's done, I give it to my next bitch, Boss

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh

[Verse]
Yeah, and I'm straight off the motorboat
I got bitches they goin' for goin' dope
Break it down and then sell the brick door to door
Pour a four on my bitch and then roll it up
I got the Act' in so you know I'm goin' up
I got rich and these niggas start actin' like bitches
But if it's a fade, we can throw it up
I got rich and my baby mama started trippin'
Like I did when she started throwin' up
Had to shine like the chain when it's glowin'
I’m gang and I'm goin'
You know that if I got the banger, I'm blowin'
I'm straight off the motorboat
Fuck the strip club, that shit had me goin' broke
Got a family to feed, I can't damage my seed
And be throwin' this money on so and so
I got niggas that's with me, they gang and the gangin'
We fuck with gorillas, no feelings, no hangers
Some niggas is talking that they don't fuck with us
But why is you niggas still chillin' and hangin'?
I'm back and we gang and we gangin'
Them monkeys orangun-a-tangin'
They look like the Klan with the bandanas hanging
I 'member the places they left me abandoned
I high dropped the top, now I'll never be stranded
I roll with my bitch and she realer than niggas
I roll up the Grabba Leaf thicker than Swishers
And I'ma get mine off the motorboat, you know we goin' gold
You know it's toe to toe
I got the .44, boy, you a baby, you know you lil' Jodie Joe
What the fuck you think I did on nights when I ain't had it?
I had to act like it was crack but I sold 'em soap
I had it hard for real, they don't know nights when I starved for real
Felt the rejection from all of my people, from all of them nights, I'm scarred for real
Nights that I slept in the stu with the partners, they'll never know what this shit took when we got it
Pussy niggas, I was steppin' to, takin' the revenue, but I clocked them at the box
I'd rather buy me a brick and then buss it before I go buy a random bitch a Birkin
I'm on the strip and I click it and clutch it, in case these niggas wanna try me in person
Tell me how you wanna go 'bout it?
Got the Bentley, I'm whippin' the soul out it
This the new one, your shit was the old body
Got the black youngstas with the money bags and the set in, I'm feelin' like Yo Gotti
I was down on my dick, spent all my time on the strip
I couldn't buy me a whip, but I had bitches to drive me and shit
Niggas they left me to die in this shit but I'm back to the corner, I'm buyin' this shit
I'm so rich that I fuck 'round and buy me a bitch
My left wrist on rocky, my right wrist on glacier, applyin' the drip
Go run the service up, I was raised 'round the killers and murderers
In the back of the X6, double R, you know that I'm raisin' the curtain up, we 'bout to burn it up
I got the plating inside the bitch and you know I'm gon' burn it up
We got to poppin' and lightin' the kernel up
I'm on a mission to get it, lil' bitch, I do not want to cuddle up, nah

[Chorus]
Uh, I just got tired of bein' fuckin' broke
I just got tired of sleepin' on the floor
I had to face it, I was all alone
I had to run and go and get the dough
Them shooters runnin', go and hit the floor
I want the Lamborghini truck
Switch the VIN and get this shit for the low, uh
I just got tired of bein' fuckin' broke
I just got tired of sleepin' on the floor
I had to face it, I was all alone
I had to run and go and get the dough
Them shooters runnin', go and hit the floor
I want the Lamborghini truck
Switch the VIN and get this shit for the low, uh

[Part I: Bohemian Rhapsody]

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Part II: Radio Gaga]

[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I hеard it on my radio
You gave them all those old timе stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio, everybody

[Chorus]
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

[Verse 2]
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio

[Chorus]
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you
Loves you
Leaves, watch them float
Ten degrees, passing boat
Take your time 'cause it's all over
You're a deadbeat doll loner
House, car, bed, trophy
Someone there to hold, if only

Leaves, watch them float
Ten degrees, passing boat
Take your time 'cause it's all over
You're a deadbeat doll loner
House, car, bed, trophy
Someone there to hold, if only

Smile is wide, your face is stone
Thе test, it came back, said you're pronе to
Chew yourself right to the bone
I guess you don't like to be alone

But that's just the way it goes
That's just the way it goes
That's just the way it goes
Leaves, watch them float
Ten degrees, passing boat
Take your time 'cause it's all over
You're a deadbeat doll loner
House, car, bed, trophy
Someone there to hold, if only

Leaves, watch them float
Ten degrees, passing boat
Take your time 'cause it's all over
You're a deadbeat doll loner
House, car, bed, trophy
Someone there to hold, if only

That's just the way it goes
That's just the way it goes
That's just the way it goes
That's just the way it goes (The way it goes)
That's just the way it goes (The way it goes)
How did I get in this predicament?
How did I get in this jam?
The person that they accuse me of being of
That's not the one I really am
I am the one that really loves you
With all my mind body and soul
With every stroke of my brush
I wanna paint a wall around you
So that you will never know

All the pain that a human has to go thru
In a planet that's so bitter and cold
Universal love awaits you baby
All you got to say is that you really really really wanna go
And we're outta here

The space
Do you wanna?
Do you want to go?
Where the Sun's go
Where the tеars flow
Where the lovе grows
Do you want to go?
How did I let you hypnotize me?
Did it have anything to do with your lips?
Did it have anything to do with your cool disposition?
Did it have anything to do with your kiss?
Where in the world did you learn to put your arms around me and cause my temperature to rise?
Sometimes I get the feeling this was all meant to be
Just like the sun and moon, you and I

All the pain that a human has to go thru
In a planet that's so bitter and cold (so cold)
Universal love awaits you
Baby all you gotta say is that you really really really wanna go
And we're outta here

The space
Do you wanna
Do you want to go
Where the Sun's go
Where the tears flow
Where the love grows
Do you want to go?

(Crooked letter, crooked letter, crooked letter I...)

This is the space where my love goes
Look up lay back and let the wild flow
This is the space where my hands go
If they're too hot the water should be cold
This is the space where the cream flows
Over my shoulder till my friend grows
On and on 'til we both know
Universal love in the '94
Do you wanna?

[Intro]
Jammin'

To think that jammin' was a thing of the past
We're jammin'

Uh-huh, uh-huh
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Bitch, I'm a big tipper
And you a big stripper
And I won't fuck a bitch unless she got a bitch with her
I Goyard, ho, look at the big zipper
Bitch, I'm a star, ho, just like the Big Dipper

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
I got 10 times, I fucked her 10 times
Lil' bitch, I told you I ain't paying for the 10th time
I go to Brooklyn and I fuck a bitch from Bedstuy
Can't fuck no bitch that be burning, this ain't no Left Eye
She got a boyfriend, but she don't love that nigga
She in my section drinking bottles saying, "Fuck that nigga"
He talking silly, let my shooter come and dust that nigga
His bitch was lookin' wonderin' why she even cuffed that nigga
Bitch, I can't fuck you, that pussy risk-ayy
But you been throwing it at me just like a frisb-ayy
Don't you evеr call yourself tryna diss me
You been on my dick since thе 10th grade
Look back at it, look full time
I been swimming on that pussy like the poolside
She just wanna fuck me and have a good time
I just wanna hit that pussy like a bullseye
I got tick tock, I got money on me
So much hunnids in my pocket, isn't funny on me
On the road, doing shows they be coming to see
And I'ma stunt on you hoes that done fronted on me
I got a lot of loose bills in my wallet nigga
Think about it, homie, you can't name a hotter nigga
Every time I'm on the track it's like I shot a nigga
Rich as fuck, a million dollars is a dollar, nigga

[Refrain: Tory Lanez]
Look back at it, look back at it
Go ahead, put the pussy in a crackmatic
I'ma hit it like a nigga tryna cat-daddy
Girl, you know a nigga love when you look back at it

[Verse 2: Melii]
I look back at it, look back at it
I watch that nigga eat the booty like a crack addict
I tell him beat the pussy up 'cause it's problematic
I got him shooting up the club with his automatic
And I'm riding on that dick like a road trip
He gon' feel the circle getting tighter like a mosh pit
Any bitch could get it, back it up if you gon' talk shit
Ho, get off your knees 'cause you know that you can't top this
It's a lot of blue bills in my wallet, nigga
Think about it, shorty, you can't even name a hotter nigga
Know I'm from the hood, I ain't playin' 'bout my guala, nigga
'Cause a million dollars just a dollar to a Harlem nigga
Yes indeed, he be trippin' 'cause that pussy slippery
He could barely believe it, you'd think that shit was Ripley’s
If he hitting me, he ain't dipping out, ain't quick to leave
He had to back up, ain't no Colin Kaepernick, he took a knee
Took the G5 straight to VLive
I done made it out the city like Diddy I'm screen-sized
These fly bitches only be hating and these guys, these lies
That these bitches be telling are flea-sized

[Refrain: Tory Lanez & Lil Wayne]
Look back at it (Yeah), look back at it (Yeah)
Go ahead, put that pussy in a crackmatic (Ooh)

Girl, you know a nigga love when you look back at it (Oh)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Look back at it, she got a fat fatty
She got her ass tatted, she just got more ass added
She got her pants sagging, and I'm a crack addict
That pussy glass house, she get her glass shattered
She say "Don't shoot cash at me, yo just Cash App me"
She make the pussy lips pout like it's mad at me
I'm a bad bunny, fuck you like you're Babs Bunny
Throw 50k at your face, that's just gas money
All the strippers love me, big tipper
I got strippers tippin' strippers for me
Big titties, if I listen they gon' pillow talk me
I'ma hit it then we practice social distance, homie
Lap dance while a pistol on me

[Chorus: Tory Lanez, Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne & Tory Lanez]
Bitch, I'm a big tipper (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you a big stripper
And I won't fuck a bitch unless she got a bitch with her
I Goyard, ho, look at the big zipper
Bitch, I'm a star, ho, just like the Big Dipper (Yeah)

[Refrain: Tory Lanez & Lil Wayne]
Look back at it (Yeah), look back at it (Yeah)
Go ahead, put that pussy in a crackmatic (Oh)

Many more will have to die
Don't ask me why
Things are not the way they used to be
I won't tell no lie

I can't tеll no lie
If you listen carefully now you will hear, yeah

I can't keep them down
If you listen carefully now you will hear
'Cause there's a natural mystic blowin' through the air

There's a natural mystic blowin' through the air
A-Such a natural mystic blowin' through the air

Hey mister, hey mister
I just want a dime
'Cause I need a cup of coffee
And a moment of your time
I can tell your raised in hell
The way I used to do
But I wish someone had to talked to me
Like I wanna talk to you
Listen

I've been to Georgia and California
And anywhere I could run
Stole a woman in Tennessee
(Stole a women, Tennessee)
And we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces
(freeee)
Because I had to be free
I've been to paradise (I've been to paradise)
But I've never been to me
Thanks mister, thanks mister
But please don't walk away
(I have this neeeeed)
'Cause I have this need to tell you
Why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me still living in your eyes
(I can see, so much of me still living in your eyes)
Won't you share a part of an old man's heart
Just once before he dies

I've been to China & Asia Minor
On any ship that would sail
Made some noise with some good old boys
(Made some noise with some good old boys)
And we wrecked southern jail
I've seen the best men crawl and some teardrops fall
There ain't nothing I didn't see
(Nothing I didn't see)
I've been to paradise (I've been to paradise)
But I've never been to me

I've even, been to marriage
Children cry for someone they couldn't find
Never knowing that I was searching
For things I left behind
I thought my heart could wait
But I learned too late
Only love can make people free
I've been to paradise (I've been to paradise)
I've been to paradise
But I've never been (never been)
Toooo meee

(Been to Georgia, California, anywhere I could run)
Oh yeah, can't you see?
(Stole a woman in Tennessee)
Listen to me
(Made love in the sun)
I don't want you to make the same mistakes I've made
(But I ran out of places, friendly faces)
Oh no, I've been to paradise
('Cause I had to be free)
I have even been there twice
(I've been to paradise)
Oooh weah, hey hey
I know you want to, you wanna be free
My son, please, please listen to me
I I I I I I
(I've been to paradise)
I wanna help you, huh
Oh no
I've never been to me
Don't walk away, oh no
(I've been to paradise)
I got more, I got more
I got more to say hey
I've seen the best man crawl and some teardrops fall
I've been all over the world
(I've been to paradise)
Oh, no no, oh yeah
So I can let you see
So you can have just a judgement of this time
I believe I can get older
(I've been to paradise)
I can get across
I can get through
I can get next to the man
Hey I got to, I got to talk to him
I didn't have the chance myself
I wish somebody would've
I wish they could've just talk to me
(I've been to paradise)
Like I want to talk to you
Hey hey, I know you've understood...

[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Bridge]
Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Intro]
Okay, so here we go

[Verse 1]
Packed with illusions, our world is turned around
This golden circle has a most harmonic sound
Harmonic sound

[Verse 2]
The kiss of Venus has got me on the go
She's scored a bullseye in the early morning glow
Early morning glow

[Chorus]
And in the sunshine where we stand alone
We came together with our secrets blown
Secrets blown

[Verse 3]
Now moving slowly, we circle through the square
Two passing planets in the sweet, sweet summer air
Sweet summer air

[Chorus]
And in the sunshine where we stand alone
We came together with our secrets blown
Our secrets blown

[Bridge]
Reflected mountains in the lake
Is this too much to take?
Asleep or wide awake?
Asleep or wide awake?

[Verse 1]
Packed with illusions, our world is turned around
This golden circle has a most harmonic sound
Harmonic sound

[Outro]
Harmonic sound
Harmonic sound

[Verse 1]
Hear me, women and wives
Hear me, husbands and lovers
What we do with our lives
Seems to matter to others
Some of them may follow
Roads that we run down
Chasing tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Many choices to make
Many chains to unravel
Every path that we take
Makes it harder to travel
Laughter turned to sorrow
Doesn't get me down
Chasing tomorrow

[Bridge]
Can you tell me when tomorrow comes around
That you set a good example to the children listening to you?
Well, you can help them keep their feet upon the ground
If you simply love them more than you ever loved before

[Verse 3]
Hear me, mothers and men
Hear me, brothers and sisters
Help the children and then
They'll discover new vistas
Some of them may borrow
Tales you hand them down
But they'll be chasing tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Hear me, women and wives
Hear me, husband and lovers
What we do with our lives
Seems to matter to others
Some of them may follow
Roads that we run down
Chasing tomorrow

[Outro]
Chasing tomorrow
Chasing tomorrow

[Intro]
One, two

[Verse 1]
Look out for Lavatory Lil
Look out for Lavatory Lil
You think that she's a winner when she's cooking you your dinner
But she's really moving in for the kill
Lavatory Lil

[Verse 2]
Watch out for Lavatory Lil
Watch out for Lavatory Lil
She says it's hunky-dory when she's telling you a story
But she really thinks you're making her ill
Lavatory Lil

[Bridge 1]
If you saw her coming at you, you could look the other way
It isn't always easy when she's rollin' in the hay

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
So much for Lavatory Lil
So much for Lavatory Lil
You think she's being friendly, but she's looking for a Bentley
And she'd rather go and swallow a pill
Lavatory Lil

[Bridge 2]
If you saw that she was coming, you could get up off the track
It isn't always easy when she hits you in the back
Oh yeah

[Verse 4]
Well, that's it for Lavatory Lil
That's it for Lavatory Lil
She's acting like a starlet, but she's looking like a harlot
As she's slowly heading over the hill
Lavatory Lil

[Outro]
Lavatory Lil
Economic markets are collapsing. People all over the world are suffering and people are afraid, and what happens when people are afraid? They become intolerant. They start pointing the finger at other people. They say, “You’re the reason. You’re the problem. You’re to blame. Get out!” The enemy is not out there. The еnemy is within.

All you need for a movie is a gun and a girl. - Jean-Luc Godard

I did my tour of duty this yеar, and it feels like I’ve been to hell and back. I saw many things I did not like. I saw apathy. I saw intolerance. I saw desperation and poverty. I saw discrimination and bigotry, and a kind of sinister black cloud of hypocrisy moving in on me, like a curtain of despair. Yeah, that’s right. I saw a lack of desire like a plague, putting everyone into a kind of a trance. And I looked into the eyes of people and I saw helplessness. I saw hopelessness. I saw humans searching for a way out. Another new and exciting distractio. An excuse to do nothing. An external enemy to blame.

But I also saw people desperate for a way in, looking for guidance, looking for inspiration, for hope. Looking for love. I keep telling everyone that I want to start a revolution, but no one is taking me seriously. If I had black skin and an afro, would you take me seriously? If I was an Arab waving a hand grenade, would you take me seriously? If I was wearing combat gear and I had an AK-47 strapped to my back, would you take me seriously?

Instead, I’m a woman. I’m a blonde. I have tits and an ass, and an insatiable desire to be noticed. “Come on, baby. Show us your ass. Shake it for us, baby. Do that dance you do so well for us, baby.” And some people like it when I show my ass. And some people think it’s obscene. Judgment over compassion, and fear over love. And that is obscene.

("Show us your ass.")

Ok, but I still want to start a revolution. Somebody’s got to. There’s too much beauty in the world going to waste. Too much talent going unnoticed. Too much creativity crushed beneath the wheel of corporate branding and what’s trending.

But it’s time to wake up before it’s too late. History’s repeating itself. Don’t you see a pattern here? We live in a very scary time. Or should I say, we don’t really live at all?

Democracy doesn’t seem to exist anymore. Freedom of expression sounds like a catchphrase. And if you want to be an artist in this day and age, you better have strong arms. You better be prepared to swim upstream in shark-infested waters. You better have thick skin. Because when those Fascist dictators posing as righteous men come for you with their big leather boots to shut you up, to put a gag in your mouth, to send you away to a penal colony, you better be prepared to fight for what you believe in. I used to think I had thick skin, but right now, it feels like I have no skin, like I have been skinned alive. You better be prepared to die for what you believe in.

[Martin Luther King Jr. - I Have a Dream]
“…in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand signed the Emancipation Proclamation…”

[Prisoner]
“I think… I think he has no one to … to help him. I guess I’m… I’m lost. I just feel I need to… to create some… some frame in my mind, you know? To not feel so lonely.”

I don’t sleep anymore. I’ve lost my appetite. I don’t feel safe. Lots of people don’t feel safe. That’s why I want to start a revolution. But this revolution will not be televised. It will not be on the Internet. It won’t be an app available on your iPhone. You won’t be able to download it.

This will be the revolution of thinking for yourself, of having your own opinion and not giving a damn what people say. This will be a revolution of inquiring further, of not worrying about winning other people’s approval, of not wishing you were someone else, but perfectly content to be who you are, someone unique and rare and fearless.

I want to start a revolution of love.

And this revolution will overcome all fear and all suffering and all separation. And it will include all people. Black, white, Christian, Chinese, Muslim, Jew, gay, straight, bisexual, fat, thin, handicapped, rich, poor, artistic and autistic. Fuck labels. I hate labels. We’re all in this ship together, sailing like a burning sphere across the sea. Burn, baby, burn.

"My country, ‘tis of thee. Sweet land of liberty. Land where my fathers died. Land of the pilgrim’s pride."

I feel that people are becoming more and more afraid of people who are different. People are becoming more and more intolerant!

We want to fight for the right to be free! To be who we are! Yes! Yes!

This is a very scary time, but we can make a difference! We can change this! We have the power! And we don’t have to do it with violence. We just have to do it with love. Jesus preached this. Muhammad preached this. Buddha preached this. Moses preached this. It’s in every holy book. Love thy neighbor as thyself, ok? So, you cannot use religion to treat other people badly. You cannot use God’s name to treat other people badly. We all deserve love.

I feel naked and alone. I’m sure you can relate. Sometimes I want to beat myself up. Sometimes I say to myself, “Why didn’t I wait? Why did I listen to all those voices in my head? Why didn’t I have patience? Why did I let all that doubt into my head? Into my belief system? Why?”

I know what you’re thinking. “If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.” But it’s too late. I am in the kitchen, and the burner’s on full blaze.

I want to start a revolution. Are you with me?

“Land where my fathers died. Land of the pilgrim’s pride. From every mountain side. Let freedom ring.”
Freedom is what you do with what’s been done to you. - Jean-Paul Sartre

This film is dedicated to those who have been persecuted, are being persecuted, or may be persecuted. For the color of their skin, their religious beliefs, their artistic expression, their gender. Or their sexual preferences. Anyone whose human rights have been violated.

(Buddah blessed this beat)
It's Boat!

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Why this bitch so obsessed with taking all these trips?
Same reason I’m so obsessed with makin' money flip
I'm gon see if she fuckin’ and that's off the rip
I'm gon see how she suckin', I might leave a tip
I don't miss when I aim, I go for the lips
They say "Boat, why you walk around like you hate us?"
That's cause my shoulder hold a big chip
Might be on the west side, chillin' with them big crips
Might be on the South side, with big bloods, woo-woo

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
She want dime, yeah I bought two
I need concierge under my roof
I might let you spend the night under one rule
Let me get up in your mouth and fill you
She say she love my style, so cool
Two pistols and a sword, look like Deadpool
Don't shoot me, I’m the messenger

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Why this bitch so obsessed with taking all these trips?
Same reason I’m so obsessed with makin' money flip
I’m gon see if she fuckin' and that's off the rip
I'm gon see how she suckin’, I might leave a tip
I don't miss when I aim, I go for the lips
They say "Boat, why you walk around like you hate us?"
That's cause my shoulder hold a big chip
Might be on the west side, chillin' with them big crips
Might be on the South side, with big bloods, woo-woo

[Verse 2: Chief Keef & Lil Yachty]
Shoot, hit him with the phantom (Aye)
I used to put my clothes on layaway (Aye, aye, aye)
She thirsty, get some gatorade
These lil niggas need haterrade
Don't play with me, go play with your bitch (Bang, bang, bang)
Yeah, I get cash but I need a airport outside
Don't miss the jet
Better hide like your boy right now
You know we pull up
It's a whole bunch of foreigns outside
I know you like cars
Don't act like you bored right now

[Chorus: Lil Yachty & Chief Keef]
Why this bitch so obsessed with taking all these trips? (Ooh, ooh)
Same reason I'm so obsessed with makin' money flip
I'm gon see if she fuckin' and that's off the rip
I'm gon see how she suckin', I might leave a tip
I don't miss when I aim, I go for the lips
They say "Boat, why you walk around like you hate us?"
That's cause my shoulder hold a big chip
Might be on the west side, chillin' with them big crips
Might be on the South side, with big bloods, woo-woo

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Yeah, baby girl why you lie to me?
Why you look in my eyes and you doubted me?
Is it for the million dollars and jewlery?
I'd be dead if you're serious
I'd be dead if you want it serious

[Verse 1]
I've never known a girl like you before
Now, just like in a song from days of yore
'Cause here you come a-knocking, knocking on my door
And I've never met a girl like you before

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Give me just a taste so I want more
Now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw
'Cause now you got me crawling, crawling on the floor
And I've never known a girl like you before

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
You made me acknowledge the devil in me
I hope to God I'm talking metaphorically
Hope that I'm talking allegorically
Know that I'm talking 'bout the way I feel

[Chorus]
And I've never known a girl like you before
Never, never, never, never
Never known a girl like you before

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
This old town's changed so much
Don't feel like I belong
Too many protest singers
Not enough protest songs
And now you've come along
Yes, you've come along
And I've never met a girl like you before

[Guitar Solo Outro]
Lyrics from Snippet

...knew that I crossed the line but I don't wanna hear it
Girl, you know I know no better...
I used to work for a jewelry store
And deliver cross town to every shopping mall
Listen to the singers outside of the door
On the corner

Where luminara candles in white paper bags
Lit the street and all the people in and out of the cabs
I’d never wanna go home for all that I had
Those were the good times

Now every fall it starts to take me back
To the love that I lost or love that I’d forget
When thеy’d ask me do I believе
Now I believe I’ll be headed home
This Christmas Eve

Frost on the window
Howling steam from the kettle
Listening to Nat King Cole
With a seasonal beer and some pretzels
Old decorations when red ranger came calling
On comic book wrapping paper
And cloves and mandarin pomander
Still remind me

Of untangling tinsel or having me
Hang popcorn and cranberries around the tree
Got me feeling sappy and blue
Now I’ll be headed home to spend Christmas with you

And just like hooves on the roof
I’ll be breaking off and on through the traffic
To spend Christmas with you
Til I’m dashing over reunion lights
To spend Christmas with you

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Rub him down, be a lady and a freak, oh

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Beating my drum like "dum di di day"
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like "hey mama, mama, hey mama, ma"
Banging the drum like "dum di di day"
I know you want it in the worst way (Be your man)
I wanna hеar you calling my name
Like "hey mama, mama, hеy mama, ma" (Be your man)

[Drop: Afrojack & Alan Lomax]
Be your man

[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Bridge]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Intro]
Hahaha, Nick, you're stupid

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, sometimes, I wonder why, oh why
You needed to die, I roll my spliff and get high tonight
I'm tryna ease my mind, I think about you and I can't help but to just cry
Welcome to my mind, that's how it's been inside

[Chorus]
Times to help for me, times to get over it
One day at a time, I need to take this slow
Straight out of my feelings, it's coming back to life, I can't control
I don't know what to do, God, show me a way, I'm feeling lost
I...

[Verse 1]
Another night on the straits
All bug-eyed and babbling
Out on the corner of 7th and A
I'm in the business of living
Yeah, that's something I'd say
All I need is a new friend, baby
I'm only five blocks away, ooh

[Chorus]
Oh, speak to me
Won't you speak, sweet angel?
Don't you remember me?
I was God's favorite customer

[Verse 2]
Beware the man who has everything
Everything that he wants
You can spot him from a mile away
In his gold chain and only one pair of socks
I'm out here testing the maxim
That all good things have to stop
Josh, the bar closes at five
But the big man is just opening shop
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?

[Chorus]
Speak to me
Won't you speak, sweet angel?
Don't you remember me?
I was God's favorite customer
But now I'm in trouble

[Outro]
Speak to me
Won't you speak, sweet angel?
I need some company
I swear, just one more night longer

[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was onе prize I'd cheat to win

The morе that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Blast off, she want Tim
Texas bitch, go to A&M
Ridin’ round’ drivin’ ten and two

Break еm’ out, no tellin’ what they’d do
Made a million, no pen no pad
Tote the rock like I’m Dameon Dash
Take em’ out, tryna take my stash
On the whip, red Ferrari like the old school Flash
Niggas mouth ridin’, comin’ in last
Dick suckin’, they can kiss my ass

Stay out the mix
Diamonds they shine like a flair
Walkin’ around like the old school Rick
Niggas tryna’ study my pics
My sunroof panoramic
Might paint a mirror on my low-key bitch (Slatt)
Yeah, yes, oh, yes, slatt, yes, huh, I got a lot to live for (Mmm)
Baby Glock tucked in the steel toe (Brrrd)
Geekin’, she might do the heel-toe (Mm mm)

Wrist in the air, complete field goals

Oh, I just gotta make sure the love is true
But I would give it all to you

Is it true, that you would do anything for me
Would you bleed the blood you bleed, while on your knees?
Would you care for me, do dares for me?
Would you cut off your hair for me, do jail for me?
Would you do the impossible for me
Instead of gossip, you could be my gospel queen
It’s more than getting between
Lil shawty fresh, she Alexander her jeans
I want my daughter to look like you, so I’ll ask for your Genes

[Chorus]
I would give it all, to you (Yeah, oh)
Oh, I just gotta make sure the love is true (True)
But I would give it all to you (I would)

Aye, these niggas can’t do for you like I can

Young nigga shinning, cause’ I was chosen
Ice on my neck lookin’ mighty frozen
That shit bout’ cold as a TV dinner

Might trade the fire for a Beamer truck
I struck the gold, it’s beginners luck
Ask if I care? I don’t give a fuck, no, no
Young nigga let me tell you somethin’
I got more value than most of these rap niggas
I make more money than your dad
Damn, ain’t that shit sad
Dick so big, the condom that I had to use was Glad
And my neck on the ice sickle
Old hundreds look like dill pickles, damn
Fuck nigga better recognize who a nigga is fore’ I snap on em’
Why these rappers like to cap on me?
Made a five off the rap tee
Grew up Sundays after Baptist
When I got old enough, I was baptized
Most these pussy niggas tell lies, Lil Boat keep it real
Did this shit with no deal
Did this shit here for real
Feeling like a hundred mill’
Know some niggas who can kill
Know some niggas who squeal
Got the head pulled back, got it peeled

These niggas keep talkin’, imma pull the truck up
Imma knuck the buck up, make em’ shut the fuck up
Imma count a hundred hundreds fore’ it’s over
Imma cop the new chain, cost a Rover
Makin’ all this good music, still sober
And these niggas pussy, and these niggas rookie
And these niggas tryna’ figure how I did it
And these niggas hatin’, pussy just admit it
And my new tape hot, it need mittens
I won’t eat that kitten, if it smell like chillins

Doin’ it wrong
Doin’ it bad, look

[Verse 1]
Doin’ it wrong, doin’ it bad, I done fucked up
I done loved half of you, I had it tucked up
Out of my mind, I been trippin’, thinkin’ about the Maron
You done moved on, to a new kind, damn I took too long
That’s my bad, that’s my fault, damn my momma mad
I still got the same number, if you want me back
I could live without ya, but I’m gon’ be sad
I could live without ya and I’m still gon’ be successful
But these niggas might finesse you
I can’t let em’
Let a nigga do you wrong, this baby choppa gon’ dissect em’
Knew you was the one for me, cause I’m in love with first impressions
I know you was not impressed, but can you please see my confession
When I seen you for the first time, looked like an angel outta heaven
You a ten not a seven, in New York, 9/11
And if I have a daughter, imma name her Angelina
Middle name Karah, last name McCollum
When she turn sixteen, imma buy her ass a Beamer
Her grandmother need her, she don’t play either
And hope that lil baby have features, as a beautiful creature

[Chorus]
I don’t want you to move on, no
But girl if you do, I still love you, I do, my boo

[Verse 2]
Shawty look so good in my clothes
Shawty look so good in the clothes that I pick out
When I get up in, I ain’t really tryna’ get out
Soon as I see you girl I know you wanna fuck me
Layin’ in the bed girl, you tellin’ me you love me
Hand on your face when I’m rubbin’ on your stummy
Any nigga get you then he lucky
I just wanna see lil baby smile
It’s been a minute since I seen you, way too long
Patek on my arm, dreams of you meetin’ my mom
Let’s start a family on a farm

[Chorus]
Oh I, don’t want you to move on, no (Oh, I)
But girl if you do, I still love you, I do, my boo

[Outro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Intro]
Ah-oh, oh, oh, no, no, oh, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Bitches poppin’ up pregnant with my babies now
Gettin’ rude, I can’t treat you like a lady now
Many thoughts, I’m gonna buy you a Mercedes car
Never happened cause’ we never actually made it far
Hold my head high and own up to it
Shoulda never made decisions and I stuck to it
I’ll always judge a bitch by her boyfriend
If she in love with bums, then what that mean?
Allergic to these bitches, need a vaccine
Used to sip so much codeine, was an ACT feign
Was so crazy, dropped them racks on ya surgery
Thank God I didn’t, cause’ you never showed an urgency
Took ya love to my life with a certainty
Even though I helped with all of your emergencies
You never gave a nigga shit
You didn’t make my heart beat, you pinched arteries

[Chorus]
I had to learn to let it go
Love wasn’t real and that’s fasho
People I thought was gonna go for me turnt to be the biggest hoes
I realize there’s more to life than money, cars and fancy clothes
What’s best for me, got let me know?
What’s best for me, got let me know my way

[Verse 2]
I need your help
I’m alone inside, I’m loosing myself
If I see your face, I probably might melt
Keep a distance from you to maintain my health
Oh my New York girl, you’re the one with the lil twin sister
Tell my duse, don’t miss her
I can still hear your whispers
Look me in my eyes, real man never been pussy
Guess that’s why I can’t grow whiskers
Hope you find a real nice mister, who treats you well

[Chorus]
I had to learn to let it go
Love wasn’t real and that’s fasho
People I thought was gonna go for me turnt to be the biggest hoes
I realize there’s more to life than money, cars and fancy clothes
What’s best for me, got let me know?
What’s best for me, got let me know my way

[Intro]
Slatt, damn, it’s us, aye
Damn, damn, damn, go, go, damn, look, damn, aye

[Verse]
I pray God let me die lone’, before I worship all these fake niggas
Real feminist, but on my momma, swear I hate niggas
Gang bang don’t make you niggas real, it just sign you niggas
I know niggas who don’t bang, but will find you niggas
Johnny Cochran, when it’s time I’m gon’ bond my niggas
Lawyers on deck, for when they gotta James Bond you niggas
Four different types of watches, I don’t mind you niggas
Truth be told I’m too damn busy, I don’t got time for niggas
Off the drank, we let it fall, we not limin’ nigga
My lil bro will eat yo’ food, like we dinin’ nigga
My other brother make that shit good in science nigga
Flеw a bitch from way, way, way, out the Mayans nigga
You niggas is not no street sweepers, stop lyin’ nigga
You know y’all some geek geekеrs, who you tryin’ nigga?
Will turn a nigga Stevie, who you eyein’ nigga?
Will turn your whip futuristic, get it flyin’ nigga
My niggas don’t play no games, they will fry you niggas
I kick a nigga ass, like I’m Ryu nigga
My bitch want a bigger ass, imma buy it then
Swear this bitch ain’t want to fuck, she had to hide again
My lil’ bro forgot his scale, he gon’ eye it then
She ain’t finna let me fuck? I bet my brotha’ can

Real talk, I’m the young nigga who pull up with them racks, now
And my brother got what you need yeah we tax, now

[Verse]
We took a trip to Seattle, everything loaded not one of them from me, 200k ready for battle
Might take them pints to Toronto from south of the border with no Pterodactyl

Can’t trust a soul, and I know they know

These niggas food, imma bait em’ (On God)

[Intro]
Mmm, yeah
If you could just turn my headphones up just a lil bit’
Mmm

[Chorus]
Aye, I just took me a five hour, I’m up
Ride with the shotty, I’m lookin for ducks
I brought it in and I did not have to tuck
I bought my momma a six figure chain
I fucked two bitches and gave them two pills
Had em’ geeked like Max Pane in the back of the Range
Still wanna fuck, didn’t ask for no names
No supervision, I got this shit tame
Six carrots ring, look like I’m Mary
Suckin’ on nipples, like I want the dairy
She want three wishes like I was the fairy
I need three, threesome
I beat up the coupe just like Terry
Repeat on my word like a pear
Pussy so wet, make me a fish like Derek
I’m gettin’ shit at the Mariot

[Verse]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Ice so cold, need a coat on
All in her throat like codeine
I just wanna fuck like a prostitute
I just wanna fuck like a stripper hoe
I just wanna fuck like a bad bitch
Talkin’ that bitch out to Sacs-Fifth (Alright)
If you do right, if you do right
Give you a flight, fuck from the bite, go take a hike
Mm, I just wanna fuck for a lil bit
Stack big bucks like a rich bitch
Fuck on a sun color bad bitch, let’s go

[Chorus]
Aye, I just took me a five hour, I’m up
Ride with the shotty, I’m lookin’ for ducks
I brought it in and I did not have to tuck
I bought my momma a six figure chain
I fucked two bitches and gave them two pills
Had em’ geeked like Max Pane in the back of the Range
Still wanna fuck, didn’t ask for no names
No supervision, I got this shit tame
Six carrots ring, look like I’m Mary
Suckin’ on nipples, like I want the dairy
She want three wishes like I was the fairy
I need three, threesome
I beat up the coupe just like Terry
Repeat on my word like a pear
Pussy so wet, make me a fish like Derek
I’m gettin’ shit at the Mariot

[Open Instrumental]

[Pre-Chorus]
Too much money on my mind
I blow bread right now
Too much money on the line
You go sit right now
I can't deal right now
I feel lit right now
What do you do with a pick and a four, pop a lid right now, yeah

[Chorus]
Lord, forgive me
I've been called to you two times
I know, I'm out of control, I'm out my zone
Lord, forgive me
I've been...

[Verse 1]
Lunch break, special herbs, fries and a sammich
Unleashed on the city, maximize damage
Onlookers all famished, these guys is outlandish
Negro, Spanish, leggo, don't brandish
Sent the super a nudie, all grill and the booty all groovy
Peach smoothie, Call of Duty
She thought he'd spoil her, doubt he even call her
Become a baller, see the world get smaller
Straight through the optic, hot shit
A chocolate, catch a crotch kick for a botched hit
Full capacity, no room for error, such audacity
Villain, the truthbearer
Likе when your pops catch you all in the mirror starin'
Scared to dеath, actin' like you ain't even hear him
State of shock, play the block, on his way to cop
Oye, put the raw in the beans, not the tater tots
Outside, it could be young boys tradin' shots
You could make a lot, stay alert, it's equator hot
Suntan, mint oil, none ran, they been loyal
Constituents whose light reflect like tin foil

[Break]
Yeah, this the break
Very nice, very nice
I remember
It's startin' to come back to me
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Lunch break, prob'ly catch it all in one take
Tiny circle, none fake
Still feel the burn when the sun bake
Lunch break, catch it all in one take
Small circle, none fake, rake dumb cake for fun's sake
Nights burn when the sun bake
Lunch break, they say be wary of the new guy
Too high, dreamt he got knocked in Dubai
Saw a spry, shy cyclops chick with one blue eye
Too fly, but would you hit that? Ooh, my
Draw conclusions, more to mislead in
Suicidal extension cords and wrists bleedin'
His dark folks is lonely, cold, 'tis the season
Lesson, leave bags to self for this reason
Keep faith, electricity; these nouns
Is why at times we end texts with three crowns
And why we load up with jewels like these rounds
Keep a couple of jokes for fools and these clowns
You can catch him at the Barnum
And Bailey, they be wicked on the daily, tryna pardon
Or we could throw boulders at a glass house
Watch her in the kitchen cookin' nekkid with her ass out
'Til she pass out

[Verse 1]
He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not thеre?
And you're by yourself
Am I thе answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
(Gi-gi-giving you that pleasure)
Hotter than hell
(Gi-gi-give it to you)

[Verse 2]
You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
You can’t let me know I'm wanted
You can’t let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I’m coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
(Gi-gi-giving you that pleasure)
Hotter than hell
(Gi-gi-give it to you)

[Bridge]
Pull me, you do me right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
Pull me, you do me right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We could make it

[Chorus]
'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
(Gi-gi-giving you that pleasure)
Hotter than hell
(Gi-gi-give it to you)
Hotter than hell
(Gi-gi-giving you that pleasure)
Hotter than hell
(Gi-gi-give it to you)
Hotter than hell
It's horrible
One little evening alone, home
End up with carpal tunnel syndrome
Here I am, known for giving heavy back aches
Grown and living off of Little Debbie snack cakes
Supposed to be checking e-mails
All I got is messages from ass naked females
I don't know a Jenny
She said it's free and I won't owe her a penny
And that's the last time I saw her
But thousands of more horrors on online Gomorrah
And Sodom, they got 'em with they curls out
And they got a better sales pitch than the Girl Scouts
I wonder what I owe her
For a whole box of caramel coconut samoa
("Nite nite!"), Uh, ok honey, sweet dreams
Now it's time to get serious like Peek Freans
A metal handful, wipe it on the quilt
Wife wake up and I'm kill't over spilt milk
Locked in, looking at your picture
Fully clothed winter and I right there with ya
Thinking about the last time I split your wishbone
A man could only wish you do the same 'til he get home
Fat chance, at least he get snacks
That'd have to do 'til a brother get back
Until then smack One-Eyed Jack
And hope one of his peoples can hook him with a tri-pack
That's three different flavors
Chocolate, vanilla and strawberry wafers
He acting all hard, 'bout to get beat up
I'll show him what time it is once I get this sheet up
Soon as he fell off the beat down
All I hear is, "13th cell, put the sheet down"
Damn C.O., what the hell do she know?
Besides the fact she wanna get dug out on the d-low
A workaholic with a fountain and a ink pen
Out in the mountains and I stopped drinking again
In the wee hours, he's gotten farther
Needing three showers, being hot and bothered
The wiz with her legs bent, pregnant
God bless the day she wondered where her egg went
I need a L, but is hard to drink without it
And could use some kookies but trying not to think about it
Watching "BET" on jazz for knowledge on file
Every other commercial, college hoes gone wild
Soft batch, I prefer the other bunch
Like they got for lunch, chocolate fudge butter crunch

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You don't mess with the Ritz Bits
Wheat Thins, Saltines or Triscuits
Matzos or Cheez-Its
Catch sugar fits every time that he sees
Chips Ahoy, double chocolate chunk
Something with the bubble and the junk in the trunk
Even the Oreos, no matter what weather
Always kept 'em dipped in milk and stuck together
In the game he's shameless
Even uses a code name: Famous Amos
Cheaper than a short stay at the Day's Inn
And good like 25 cent oatmeal raisin
Give a hand to who invented the camera
Skip past the graham animal and Grandma’s
Shh, make sure she don't wake from her dream chill
Or get caught with a handful of cream fill

"Ew honey, what are you doing?
That's so nasty!
Go wash your hands, get out of here!"

[Outro: Samples]
"We shall now vote for a new world leader, I nominate: DOOM"
"All in favor say Hai"
"Hai!"
"Oh no"
"DOOM is master of the world."
"I'd sure hate to see that ugly mug of yours in my history book."
"You've disturbed me for the last time."
(Voice 1): Hey, y'know something gang, that DOOM ain't really all bad
(Voice 2): What do you mean, Ben?
(Voice 1): Well I gotta admit that I've been having a real good time. Y'know, I mean, between you and me I kinda like being black
(Voice 3): Well, maybe if we're lucky he'll attack us once more and send you back, Benjamin
(Voice 1): Ah-haha very funny, very very funny
(Voice 2): He must be mad
(Voice 4): Well, if anyone can do it. Nevertheless let's get out of here, while we can
(Misc. Voice): Food, we need food

[Okay]

And the planets of the universe go their way
Not astounded by the sun and the moon and by the day
You and I will simply disappear out of sight
But I'm afraid soon there'll be no light

I will never love again the way I loved you
You will never rule again the way you've ruled
We will never change again the way we're changing
You'll forget the chill of love but not the strain
You'll forget the chill of love but not the strain

You will remembеr but I will die slowly
It's only an overture to somеthing that was best
And don't condescend to me
Take your leave
Take your leave
Take your leave of me
Disappear through the year
I wish you gone and I don't care
Now I know
Ooh, I was wrong to live for a dream
If I had my life to live over
I would never dream
Oh, I would never dream

Oh, I will live alone and I
I still wish you gone
And I

[I forgot how to go back into it]

[Um, did you get that?]

[It wasn't wonderful or anything but at least it has the...]

[I just wanted him to get that, y'know that, the B thing]

[Intro]
Ok, here’s the Westerly one, written in Westerly

[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from the look on your face
Drown in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Hеad on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you werе a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And it was only one game I'd die  to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Spoken]
And then I was thinking like a choral section like ...

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 1]
She does a dirty dance
To a song about a bad romance
Meet a damaged girl, meet a damaged guy
He's a local star, stealing glares of her across the bar
See a damaged girl, see a damaged guy

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take this panicked feeling
The way you look at me's a knife
I can't take this panicked feeling
I can't take this panicked feeling

[Chorus]
I wish that we could just be lovers
We could be lovers
Whoa, oh
I wish that we could just be lovers
We could be lovers
Whoa, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
They were neighbours then
Back then, they werеn't even friends
Watch a damagеd girl, watch a damaged guy
Fearing stories when a couple crashed, dangerous affair
Watching them tear up, the DJ cries, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take this panicked feeling
The way you look at me's a knife
I can't take this panicked feeling
I can't take this panicked feeling

[Chorus]
I wish that we could just be lovers
We could be lovers
Whoa, oh
I wish that we could just be lovers
We could be lovers
Whoa, oh, oh

[Intro]
X-X-XCX
Charli!

[Verse 1]
I just wanna drink you up
Pour you in a silver cup
You know I like to party
But you know I love your body
So many things I shouldn't do
I hate myself for hurting you
Honestly, I'm reckless
I'm sorry if I'm selfish

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you get too close, I run, I run away
And every time you say the words, I don't know what to say
Back, back to the beginning, really wish that I could change
I do, I do, I do

[Chorus]
I blame it on your love
Every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do

[Post-Chorus]
Blame it on your love
Blame it on your love
Blame it on your love
Blame it on your love

[Verse 2]
Sorry, I'm a little scared
But no onе ever really carеd
I took you for granted
Just a big misunderstanding
I just want to spend the night
Sleeping in your bed tonight
We'll watch a little TV
I love it when you need me

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you get too close, I run, I run away
Every time you say the words, I don't know what to say
Back, back to the beginning, really wish that I could change
I do, I do, I do

[Chorus]
I blame it on your love
Every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
Every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do

[Post-Chorus]
Blame it on your love
Blame it on your love
Blame it on your love

[Breakdown]
Ooh

Ooh
(I blame it on you, I blame it on you)
Ooh

Ooh

[Chorus]
I blame it on your love
Every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
Every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do

[Outro]
(It's Charli, baby)

[Chorus: Mike Posner]

Don't want your love
Don't worry who I'm seein' tonight
It's none of your business
Too bad I weren't enough
'Cause ready or not, I'm better on my own

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Too many times, you turned a blind eye to the way I feel
Oh, you're the reason why I'm numb
And when I try to give you my time, it's never, ever ideal
Had to learn it the hard way, oh yeah

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Wasted energy, yeah
Wasted energy
Wasted energy, yeah
Why did you, why did you fuck up the chemistry?

[Verse 2: Kaash Paige]
I'vе been wastin' time with these hoеs, hoes
Keep every blessing like low, low
I've been tryna feel your soul (Feel your soul)
Just to find out it was copped a month ago (A month ago)
But, we can take a trip to my island, private island
Know you'll like that (Like that)
Nobody else with us, no we vibin' (Vibin')
We just grindin' (Grindin')
Like a throwback
But don't be ashamed of us, our lives
Yeah, you know we fuss
'Cause baby I'm just tryna to do it just
So no love and no trust

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Kaash Paige]
Wasted energy (There's wasted energy, yeah-yeah)
Wasted energy
Between you and me
Between you and me

Wasted energy
Between you and me (Why did you, why did you fuck up the chemistry?)

Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape – I can't wait
I need a hit – baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it

Too high, can't come down
Losin' my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?
Yeah!

With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With a taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you: don't you know that you're toxic? (oh, yeah, yeah)
And I love what you do: don't you know that you're toxic?

It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from a devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Do you feel it now? (ah)

With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you: don't you know that you're toxic? (oh, yeah, yeah)
And I love what you do: don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you: don't you know that you're toxic?

I'm on a ride, I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you: don't you know that you're toxic?

Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now

Intoxicate me now
I'm getting dizzy now
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready now

Greetings. You're about to listen to Operation: Wake Up by Mike Posner

This album was written, recorded, and produced over a period of two weeks in Detroit, Michigan in my parents' basement

It's meant to be listened to all the way through. At least on the first listen. And it's about 36 minutes long

If you can't devote 36 minutes of undivided attention to this album, I again politely ask that you turn it off and return at a later time

I love you and I thank you for taking the time to listen in the first place

Also, it's important to note that the characters and the stories in this album are completely fictional. In addition, anyone struggling with a mental illness - depression, schizophrenia - should not listen to this album. Turn it off

With caution, tact and perspective, enjoy Operation: Wake Up.

*ding*

[Intro]
Our story begins in a Los Angeles mansion
That aging artist Mike Posner is renting for the week. He's in L.A. to write songs for other, more famous artists
We join him as his barber Tracy arrives at the mansion to give him a haircut

"What up doe Tracy?"
"Hey Mike! Welcome back to L.A.! How you doing?"

[Verse 1]
I guess I'm famous again
Shave off the beard
I think when we do it it's gon' take off a year
Privacy for press
The trade off is weird
But really its my last chance to stave off the fear
Of being famous again
Got me back in L.A
I sold my house here but I can't get away
I got a session today with the singer Jessie J
I'm renting this mansion where I'll stay
Turn your head this way
So how you want it cut?
Well, I think that the green is played
And to be honest, I've been feeling kinda off these days
It's something happening inside me, I can feel the change
These people want a fucking show? Okay
Shave it all off!
Hey, Mike are- are you okay? Are you sure?
Just shave it all off!
As your barber I gotta shoot you straight
This isn't going to look good. You're making a mistake

[Chorus]
And who are you to tell me that i'm wrong? (I'm just trying to be your friend and let you know)
I never really liked you anyway (Mike thats not true. Take that back.)
Just shave it all off
You're just another girl now with a song (Really, chill out)
And I'm just another sad man in L.A. (Don't say that. Come on.)

[Verse 2]
So how's Noelle doing anyways?
T, we broke up in May
Serious? I didn't know, are you okay?
Yeah I'm okay
What happened
Didn't take that long to figure out it wasn't working
She was sad, I was touring
Wasn't worth it
Thats tough. How'd you word it?
Well i texted her tha-
You texted her?
I know I'm a bad person
But it all felt cursed when she would sit around and drink and shit
You can't be rescued by a sinking ship
Thats true
So I pushed what i loved away (but why?)
Some people can't take L.A. (that's a cop-out)
I guess that I was one of 'em (that's bullshit)
It's not bullshit I'm one of them (I think you messed up)

[Chorus]
But who are you to tell me that I'm wrong
She never really liked me anyway
Just shave it all off
She's just another girl now with a song
And i'm just another sad man in L.A
Okay
Shave it all off

[Outro]
Okay, here goes
Do you want the top a little longer? like maybe a number 1 or some- number 2?
Just shave it all off

Okay you don't have to yell
Someone's moody today
Chill out, y'know?
I'm really sorry, Tracy. I- I didn't mean to yell at you. I just-
Mike, I know you're under pressure
Yeah
But you should take it easy
I know
Hey, whats that on your dresser?
Nothing, just a bottle of cologne
Nah, next to that
Hey, Tracy just leave it alone
Okay, wheres your session at?
Paramount on Santa Monica at 2
Meetin' blackbear for dinner in the valley when it's through
Well your hair's done, look in the mirror
Nah i don't need to. People who stare into mirrors are all see through
Well, let me wipe the hair from ur face, it's all messy
Its fine, I'm 'bout to shower, I got this session with Jessie

[Spoken Intro]
At 2 o' clock in Hollywood, which means I gotta leave here by 1
I should call an Uber at 12:50
And then after that I gotta meet Bear at Joe's Falafel for dinner at 8 PM (Correct)
Shit, I need a day off
(Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while
Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while)
I think that'd be good for me, honestly
If I just chill that'd be-

(Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while)
Gonna get ready now though, huh
(Once in a while, once in a while, once in a whilе)
Yo, this haircut is crazy, my God

[Verse 1]
Bald head smooth, not too shabby
Tom Ford cologne so Jessiе know I'm classy
I keep the bottle next to the heat on the dresser
That was too much she'll think I'm trying to impress her
I take another shower to wash off the smell
20 minutes late now, need excuse to tell
I'll just blame it on the traffic, better yet an accident
Car went in a backspin, it was tragic
On the 405 that's it
I call an Uber X
Here comes a man named Dafar in a Camry
Hurry up, I need the Grammy before I'm an antique
I'm too antsy, I get to the studio
There's a white dude in a hoodie named Andy
(Hey, my name's Andy, I'll be your engineer)
Cool
(Jessie's not here)
Alright
(can I offer you a drink)
Yeah, I'll take a cold beer
(We only have water and juice)
That's so L.A. Makes sense

I kill the time lookin' at my DMs, I check 'em

[Chorus]
(Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while)
(She's not bad)
Yeah, I check 'em every
(Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while)

[Verse 2]
And Jessie walks in the room like ahh
Bodyguard with her like (don't get too close, motherfucker)
And I gotta say that she smelled like ahh
I'm dumbfound lookin like "mmm, good God!"
And suddenly I'm so not prepared
I'm doing my best just not to stare
I'm wonderin' how I got in here
Must be the Lord's blessings
The first thing she says is:
Christ, Mike dear
What've you done with all your hair
You're lookin' like a white monk, it's weird

Well you know I just shaved it all off
It's just something that I do every

[Chorus]
Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while
Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while
Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while
Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while, yeah

[Verse 3]
Now I'm super embarrased, in all fairness
She wasn't tryna be mean, she was just surprised
Or maybe she was and now I'm just justifyin' the behavior
Because I love her but I'd touch her as much as I love her eyes
That must be why I tell her "you look very pretty today"
Nice one, dummy (uh, thanks)
Very original
I am sensing something subliminal (this guy's weird)
I think she doesn't really like me (I don't like him)
I think she's thinkin' that I'm lame as fuck (he's lame as fuck)
Yeah, she's thinkin' that I'm lame as fuck (yup)
So imma sing her a song that I already wrote
And pretend I just made it up

[Outro: Mike Posner, Jessie J]
Hey, uh, hey Jessie
Yeah
What if we tried something like

Don't do me dirty, show me some mercy
Darlin', please lay down your weaponry (that's cool)
How did I end up somewhere between, oh (uhh)
Lover and a memory
'Cause I don't believe in a halfway heart (that's cool)
Ba-buh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh (y'know?)
Mm-a-bee-dah-dah (Something like that)
That's dope
It'll sound
I like it
It'll sound better in your voice, too, when you sing it

[Verse 1]
But I'm thinkin' to myself that "Weaponry" is wack and corny
Halfway through it starts to bore me
Kind of a knock-off of Leonard Cohen's style
Noelle on my mind, we ain't spoken in a while
Jessie J offers me a J
I ain't smoked one in a while
I say okay, I took it and smile
But now I'm just sad and high
I thank her for the session and we say goodbye
I pack up my laptop and my hard drives
My microphone compressor and my guitar I'm
Meetin' bear at Joe's Falafel
No Soho house there's no falafel
Too many agents, too many managers
People sayin' words just to fill up all the calendars
That's why I moved from L.A
To gеt away from all the bad ideas peoplе tell me
Like

[Chorus]
You should take it easy
Baby, you should take it easy

[Verse 2]
So I'm in an Uber Black 'cause I wanna impress
Mr. blackbear I know will be very well-dressed
And if we take a photo then I wanna look dope, uh
I need all the hoes DMing Mike Posner
My ego's hard to tame
My fame remains the best card to play
Text from blackbear, "where are you?"
Well, I'm not that far away
But the 101's slammed, so it's hard to say
How long before I pull up so I pull up
The poem on my iPhone I was workin' on earlier today
And try to make some headway

To whom it may concern (that's a good opening)
Right before the sky gets too tired to hold up the stars (that's a nice line)
Right before virtual reality becomes realer than real reality (that's really shitty writing)
Right before we smoke ourselves out and the oceans turn black

And by the time I finish it up, I've arrived
Noelle's on my mind, maybe I should try
To call her up, let down my defense
Nah, I need to just listen to my friends
When they tell me

[Chorus]
You should take it easy
Baby, you should take it easy

[Verse 3]
So I walk in 20 minutes late
Bear's waitin' with a little funny look upon his face
And he says "you look like a cancer patient"
I remember I'm bald, now he's testin' my patience
He reads my face and sees I don't think it's funny
"What's up with you, man, sad with all that money?
You ride around in open limousines lookin' like Jimmy Dean
Feelin' clean, Rag and Bone, you got the winnin' genes"
I hear what he's sayin' but it's not effective
I can't see things from his perspective
"You know, I know what you need
Look at me, don't text
Some brand new pussy will get your mind off your ex"
Thank you, Dr. blackbear for breakin' me down
But my L.A. girls all hate me now
'Cause I moved to Detroit I don't reply to texts
So I doubt that they're gonna retry the sex
"Doesn't matter, here's what we're gonna do
You gotta big mansion that you're stayin' in, true?" (True)
"You throw a big party, I'll invite models
And you know Diddy, free Ciroc bottles!"
But I hate L.A. parties
"It'll feel like Cabo
You need this, dog, you're lookin' hollow"
He's right, I need it, he's not lyin'
But what about the house, man? It's not mine

[Chorus]
You should take it easy
("This gonna be fun. In fact, it's gonna be better than fun")
Baby, you should take it easy
("This is gonna be amazing. You hear me? Amazing.")

[Verse 4]
But the cleaner fee, who's gonna pay that shit?
"Did you really just say that? Dude, you're rich!
Live a little, I'm not sayin' buy Ferarris
All I'm sayin' is let's have a party"

[Chorus]
I don't mean to cause no trouble
I don't mean to steal your joy
I don't mean to burst your bubble
But he's just a little boy

[Verse 1]
Hey Noelle, how you doin'?
I'm chillin', how are you?
I'm good, I just cut Mike, he said you guys are through? (Yeah)
Oh my god, I didn't know, sweetie, are you ok?
T, I've never been better, what'd that motherfucker say?
Well I'm not sure I should get in the middle of it
Did he tell you that he dumped me? (Yeah) Aww, little pig
The sex was terrible, never talked to me
Studio all day, he never stopped to eat
He's a weirdo
So I told him we should go see
Other people
Now he runs around LA sayin'
That I'm evil
You seein' anybody new?
Yeah, blackbear, and he's got that good dick too
Isn't that Mike's best friend?
Mmm-hmm, but Mike don't know
When he hears it's gonna hit him like a cyclone, though
I don't like the sounds of this, Noelle!
I ain't ask for assistance, besides T
It's really none of your business (You're right)

[Chorus]
I don't mean to cause no trouble (I don't mean to cause no trouble, I just...)
I don't mean to steal your joy (I love both of you guys)
I don't mean to burst your bubble
But he's just a little boy (He's just a... you know... he's not the most mature guy, we both know that)
I don't mean to cause no trouble
I don't mean to steal your joy
I don't mean to burst your bubble
But he's just a little boy

[Verse 2]
It's just I'm kinda worried about him
It seems like he's got a dark cloud around him
I don't think he took the breakup well at all
Today he asked me to shave his whole head bald
Did you do it? - I had to
Oh my god! I bet he looks so dumb
I mean you're right
But I don't think he has anyone
He's working with Jessie, but he ain't having fun
And next to his cologne on a dresser I swear I saw a gun
Who cares? He just wants attention
He's even havin' a party tonight at the house that he's rentin'
I'mma go and make sure he sees me in my new man's arms
That's gonna kill him! - Too bad for him

[Chorus]
I don't mean to cause no trouble (Your really shouldn't go to this party, Noelle)
I don't mean to steal your joy (This is gonna be bad)
I don't mean to burst your bubble
But he's just a little boy (I have a bad feeling about this)
I don't mean to cause no trouble (He's just a little boy and he's- he doesn't- he can't control himself)
I don't mean to steal your joy
I don't mean to burst your bubble
But he's just a little boy

[Outro]
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Yeah-yeah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Yeah-Yeah

Man, fuck Tracy!
She don't know what she's talkin' about
Nosy!
I have to go to this party tonight
With bear
At Mike's house
Read it and weap
Fuck 'em both!

[Verse 1]
Ugh, damn bear, this is such an LA party
Why'd you invite so many stars?
'Cause I can
Bieber is here (Yeah)
Nick Jonas is here (Right)
In the corner smokin' cigars
Why you gotta be so negative?
Look at all the babes
Look at all the bitches
Wipe that look off your face
Blackbear and Mike Posner know how to rage
Are you serious, man? We need to act our age
I'm almost thirty
Let's face the truth, these girls just want Bieber
That's right, they do
You know what, bruh? (Just take this)
You're being such a beaver
I can't - Why?
Cue the jokes, I took a pill in Ibiza
What is it anyways, molly?
Nah, acid, a thousand 

[mikes]
I got it from Chris, turn down the lights
What about you? I don't wanna do it alone
I took two. - When? - When we were eating at Joe's
You're insane! Ok, here goes
Give it forty-five minutes, then let me know
I can already feel it opening my pores
Can I take this call in your bedroom?
Of course! Use the same key that I gave you before
Third room on the left, second floor
Can I tell you someting though? (Yeah)
I love you, man. - I love you too
I got your back for life. - The same for you

[Chorus]
I just hope that people see
I'm not who I used to be
I don't need to run no more
Someday soon I'll see the lord
This party's lit, my life is real
I don't care, that's how I feel
I don't need to run no more
Someday soon I'll see the lord

[Verse 2]
(Phone ringing)
Hello? - It's Noelle, I'm almost to the adress
Oh shit, you're comin'? - Yeah, I brought my friend too, you know, the actress
We actually just pulled up, you see me out here? (Nah)
Is Mike around? - Yeah I'm in his room, he's downstairs
All these fake people, what are we doin'?
Off the couch, this house is gonna be ruined
People smile at me and ask dumb questions
Talk about themselves and try to book sessions, like
You might be interested in this, I'm managing this really great artist
She's like Beyoncé mixed with Taylor Swift
Lucian loves her, she's gonna be - Yo, you listenin'?
Yeah sorry, I think these drugs are kickin' in
*Laughter*

[Refrain]
...just wanna be free

I am a lone mosquito
Ain't got no ego
I just wanna be free

We are all lone mosquitoes
Ain't got no ego
We just wanna be free

Oh, send me flyin'
A lone mosquito
Ain't got no ego
I just wanna be free

We are all lone mosquitoes
Ain't got no ego
We just wanna be free
(Nothing is real, nothing is real, nothing is real)
Free, free, free, free
(Nothing is real, nothing is real)
Free, free, free, free
(Nothing is real, nothing is real)
Free, free, free, free
(Nothing is real, nothing is real, is real)
Free, free, free, free
(Nothing is real, nothing...)
Free, free, free, free...

(Nothing is real, nothing is real, nothing is real, nothing is real
Nothing is real, nothing is real, nothing is real, nothing is rеal
Nothing is real, nothing is real, nothing is real, nothing is rеal)
(Nothing is real, nothing is real, nothing is real, nothing is real
Nothing is real, nothing is real, nothing is real, nothing is real
Nothing is real, nothing is real, nothing is real, nothing is real
Nothing is real, nothing is real, nothing is real, nothing is real...)

[Verse]
I took too much, latticework in my head
My clothes are too tight, need to get to my bed
Walk upstairs, it's gettin' harder to breathe
I hear people in my room, I'm 'bout to make 'em leave
Probably college kids lookin' for a place to kiss
I feel around on the wall and turn on the light switch
(Oh) oh my god, oh my (This, this isn't what it looks like, I swear)
Oh my god... (Just relax, just relax)
Am I hallucinatin'? Is it just a bad trip?
Bear's got Noelle bent over my bed and shit
Of all the girls, dog? (Dude I'm sorry) My ex?
And you, you couldn't pick another place to have sex? (No)
(Mike, it's okay) Just get the fuck out of my house
(This isn't even your house) Just get the fuck out of my house!
Then I pick up the gun from the dresser and I cock it
(Jesus, Mike, dude c'mon drop it)
I swear, if you don't get the fuck out of here
I count to three, (One... two...) they pick up their shit and disappear
I find a handle of Jack and turn it upside-down
Wake up the next morning on the floor face down

[Verse 1]
Red cups everywhere
Kerosene lights
I can hear my steps echo
Leftover lines

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's all in a silly attempt to be someone different
Someone different
Someone who ain't me

[Chorus]
And it's days like this that I find you on my mind
And it's clear that I really did fuck things up this time
Cause right now you're wrapped up in another man's arms who doesn't hold his love for ransom
And I'm right here
Alone in a mansion

[Verse 2]
Uh, acid in my blood flow
I feel like I'm dead
Razor bladе thought forms (?)
In the sandpaper bed

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's all in a silly attеmpt to make someone listen
Someone listen
To little old me

[Chorus]
And it's days like this that I find you on my mind (on my mind)
And it's clear that I really did fuck things up this time (up this time)
Cause right now you're wrapped up in another man's arms who doesn't hold his love for ransom
And I'm right here
Alone in a mansion
Yeah, I'm right here
Alone in a mansion

[Bridge]
Oh, woah
You tell me
You tell me what am I supposed to do
Oh, woah
You tell me
You tell me

[Chorus]
And it's days like this that I find you on my mind
And it's clear that I really did fuck things up this time
Cause right now you're wrapped up in another man's arms who doesn't hold his love for ransom
And I'm right here
Alone in a mansion
Yeah, it's days like this that I find you on my mind
And it's clear that I really did fuck things up this time
Cause right now you're wrapped up in another man's arms who doesn't hold his love for ransom
And I'm right here
Alone in a mansion
And i'm right here
Alone in a mansion

[Outro]
(sobbing)
To whom it may concern
Right before the sky gets too tired to hold up the stars
Right before virtual reality becomes too real
Right before we smoke ourselves out and the oceans turn black
Right before it all goes to shit
There will be a brief moment
When the world will remember my name
Mike Posner
Commencing Operation: Wake Up

(Gunshot)

[Verse 1]
Couldn't look me in the eye
He apologizes
He didn't make enough to take me out tonight
I beg him not to worry
Please don't turn away
I don't need a world of riches
I just need a little time with you and

[Chorus]
Sweet kisses
All I really need is
Sweet kisses
That's what moves me

[Verse 2]
His lips are pure emotion
He smiles because he knows
How much I love the way he makes me feel inside
He answers all my wishes
Who could ask for more
Doesn't have to say I lovе you
All I need he tells me with his

[Chorus]
Sweet kissеs
All I really need is
Sweet kisses
That's what moves me

[Bridge]
He heals me, he touches me down to my soul
My hearts beating out of control
I just need a little time with you

[Chorus]
Sweet kisses
All I really need is
Sweet kisses
That's what moves me

[Outro]
Sweet kisses baby
It's all I really need from you
Don't need your money baby
Just want you time now baby
Cause that's what moves me honey
Sweet kisses
To put it plainly, we just couldn't stop writing songs. To try and put it more poetically, it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice: to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music. We chose to wander deeper in and my collaborators and I are proud to announce that my 9th studio album and folklore's sister record is here. It's called evermore.

I've never done this before. In the past I've always treated albums as one-off еras and moved onto planning the next onе as soon as an album was released. There was something different with folklore. In making it, I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning. I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales. I loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found. So I just kept writing them. And I loved creating these songs with Aaron Dessner, Jack Antonoff, WB, and Justin Vernon. We've also welcomed some new (and longtime) friends to our musical kitchen table this time around...

Before I knew it there were 17 tales, some of which are mirrored or intersecting with one another. The one about two young con artists who fall in love while hanging out at fancy resorts trying to score rich romantic beneficiaries. The one where longtime college sweethearts had very different plans for the same night, one to end it and one who brought a ring. Dorothea, the girl who left her small town to chase down Hollywood dreams - and what happens when she comes back for the holidays and rediscovers an old flame. The 'unhappily ever after' anthology of marriages gone bad that includes infidelity, ambivalent toleration, and even murder. The most righteous motive, to avenge the fallen. The realization that maybe the only path to healing is to wish happiness on the one who took it away from you. One starring my grandmother, Marjorie, who still visits me sometimes...if only in my dreams.

I wanted to surprise you with this the week of my 31st birthday. You've all been so caring, supportive and thoughtful on my birthdays and so this time I wanted to give you something! I also know this holiday season will be a lonely one for most of us and of there are any of you out there who turn to music to cope with missing loved ones the way I do, this is for you.

I have no idea what will come next. I have no idea about a lot of things these days and so I've clung to the one thing that keeps me connected to you all. That thing always has and always will be music.

And may it continue, evermore. 

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre] *From snippet*
I'mma put you in the ground, just briefly
Cease to exist, B, without a sound that's profound
Down 6 feet deep, go to sleep...

[Verse 1]
This is not the regular, this is that boom-bap, bap, bap
Some, they call it secular, I just call it Black, Black, Black
Marcus Garvey, Boukman Dutty, bring that army back, back, back
Malcolm X and Kwame Ture, this is where I'm at, at, at
If you wanna talk to me, talk to me about Black, Black, Black
Haile Selassie The First, Negus Nagast, let's talk about that, that, that
Kaboom, Nanny Maroon and all the Maroons, let's talk about that, that, that
The real Underground Railroad, the first subway for Black, Black, Black
The freedom train begets what you bring, getting on track, track, track
Whether justice or injustice, how do you react-act-act?
Can you stand there laughing while they shoot us in the back, back, back?
This is what some rappers sound like every time they rap, rap, rap
I'm raising up the red and the green and the black, black, black
Even with no cops in the hood, we still hear, "Click-click, clack-clack-clack"
I cannot forget my ancestors just because I rap, rap, rap
Look at me from top to bottom, KRS is Black, Black, Black

[Chorus]
Get up, get out
Speak up, speak out
Reach up, reach out
This is what Black about
Get up, get out
Speak up, speak out
Reach up, reach out
This is what I rap about
Get up, get out
Speak up, speak out
Reach up, reach out
Too many selling out
Get up, get out
Reach up, reach out
Lift up, lift out
Get out

[Verse 2]
Time to ask the question now, are you really Black, Black, Black?
It is not a mystery, we under attack-tack-tack
If you chatting fuckery, you hold our people back, back, back
Time to put aside the fantasy and deal with fact, fact, fact
This is not the time to be talking all that crap, crap, crap
Those that talk that crap, crap, crap are those that don't fight back, back, back
You can say what you like, but real skill, I never lack, lack, lack
Black is more a consciousness, the way you think and act, act, act (Yo)

[Chorus]
Get up, get out
Speak up, speak out
Reach up, reach out
This is what Black about
Get up, get out
Speak up, speak out
Reach up, reach out
This is what I rap about
Get up, get out
Speak up, speak out
Reach up, reach out
Too many selling out
Get up, get out
Reach up, reach out
Lift up, lift out
Get out, lights out

[Intro: Page Kennedy]
Yeah we back on the grind
This year been a pain, for real
But we makin' it out alive, and on top
Detox, baby
In the studio with Dre!

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
That bitch tried to take my money and leave me
Just so she could do whatever she pleases
Why she did it? Beats me
But i'm back this year, fiendly
Ending my enemies, at least
Shout to Page Kennedy, see...

Can I get a quarter
From all the Mexicans down on the border
I oughta get me a pound
Even if it's on the wrong side of town
Is you down?

Get a gal in the water
So I can smoke a loopstick witcha daughter
I oughta...

Get me a 'fotie
And get drunk 'fore I go to the party
A lawdy lawdy

I can't wait til I get my welfare check
So I can put me a fat sack 'a yay on deck
Make a run for the border in my blue Caprise
So I can buy me a quarter piece
Wait a minute
East side rulin' on well cause I thump
Let my system bump while I wait for the chump
They put the dope I the sca'yo
This bomb-ass yayo
I know it's gon' sa'yo
Back in Palmdayo

I ain't afraid
It's time to get paid
Pass me the baggies and the razor blade
Ladi, dadi, I chop the rocks just like karate
Boy you better ask somebody

Stop bitchin' cause I'm able
Put the dope on the kitchen table
And watch me hook it up like cable
Wham! Bam! Baseheads like Gooood Damn!

Buy your dope from me, if you a loner or a stoner
My rocks way bigger than them low budget niggas round the corner
And they won't give you no love
If you don't buy a dime, dub or a bub
So come to me when you need a fat nickle
And you can hit the pipe in my stolen vehicle

They don't want your pennies?
That's alright, I want 'em
I even take the pennies with the green spots on 'em
For the East Palmdaler
Being a dope seller is hard
I accept your credit
And your Versetille card

AFDC
Your food stamps too
I'm a baller, but bitch I gotta eat like you

You think I'm smokin'
But I ain't jokin'
You can get a fat rock fo' a gang of bus tokens
How you doin' baby? I need a soulmate
My homie told me you got Section 8

And I know you ain't got no money in yo' pouch
Take a piece of this 'yay and let me sleep on the couch
BEYOTCH
I'm for real, I go  half on the bill
Yo' garage just right for my coupe DeVille

Tell yo' badass kids and them hood rat bitches
Don't be jumpin in my car
And fuckin' with my switches

Hip
Hop
Chop the rock
Let the beat stop, it's time to re-cop

We can go to Compton
We can go to Watts
We can go to Long Beach
I know a gang of dope spots

I'm neutral
I'm from the old school
I be buyin dope from a different gang of fools

Buy my drip from a crip
Pound of bud from a blood
Then I bought some yay from an ese

On my way back to Palmdale
I got stopped by the sheriff but I'm calm as hell

They pulled out heat
Put me face down in the street
Handcuffed threw me in the backseat
They searched my car with the microscope
Stupid-ass white boys couldn't find the dope

They took the handcuffs off but you know they still hate me
Racial remarks just to intimidate me
Write a ticket since I can't go to jail
Whatever they didn't find the yayo

Hey can I get a quarter
From the Mexicans down on the border
I oughta get me a pound
Even if it's on the wrong side of town
Is you down?

Get a gal in the water
So I can smoke a loopstick witcha daughter
I oughta...

Get me a 'fotie
And get drunk 'fore I go to the party
A lawdy lawdy

I don't Blood
I don't Crip
I don't tag
I put the rocks in a ZipLock bag

I'm lookin too shady
Me and JD
Hit you with the 3AD
So gimme gimme what you got
Hangin' at the dope spot
Try to jack and get got
Fuck around and get shot
In the parkin lot

So be cool, fool, don't be uptight
Money first, dope second, everything's alright

I don't have the mentality of some fool in a gang
It's the principality of the whole thang

If you wanna get high - get high
But don't fuck around a die
Alright?

I just wanna sell a rock
I don't wanna pull the Glock
And lose the clientelle on my block
Mad cause I shoulda been more selective
Hidin' in the bushes from the homicide detective

Trigger finger itchin' on me
All my homeboys snitchin' on me
Everybody that's friend of me
Lookin like the enemy
Now I'm tryin' to change my identity

Yo, I need a hootrat
I need a hootrat
Cause a hootrat got that good cat

I need a hootrat
I need a hootrat
Cause a hootrat got that good cat

We need a hootrat
We need a hootrat
Cause a hootrat got that good cat

We need a hootrat
We need a hootrat
Cause a hootrat got that good cat

Can I get a fat girl?
A fat girl just like that girl?
She might weight 400 pounds
But once she get blunted she can sure get down

I can't stand no bitch that thinks she pretty
Too saddidy, No ass and no titty
Attitude shitty, bank account itty bitty
Bi-bi-bi-bi-bitch come frim the inner city

I don't fuck with those skinny ass hoes
When you fuck all you feel is kneecaps and elbows
That's why I like 'em fat like
Why ride a bike when you can ride a fat girl like a lac

Shots going out for east Palmdale
You stuck up bitches think you're bomb as hell

Pretty girls can't suck
Pretty girls can't fuck
Pretty girls can't cook
Pretty girls get shook

Like what?
Like a brand new Gherri curl
You know why?
Cause you beg and yo pussy too dry

So could I get you to get our, girlfriend?
Let my Daytons twirl again
Until the world ends

Fuck black, white, mexican, all you whores
Homegirl,s pussy gets wet like yours
I don't give a damn if the girl's from China
Make sure she's got two breasts and a vagina

I need a hootrat
I need a hootrat
Cause a hootrat got that good cat

I need a hootrat
I need a hootrat
Cause a hootrat got that good cat

We need a hootrat
We need a hootrat
Cause a hootrat got that good cat

We need a hootrat
We need a hootrat
Cause a hootrat got that good cat

Buccoc!

Id like to introduce myself to everybody

I am the Hungry Hustla Afroman
From east side Pimpdale, Pimpafornia

And you know man when I'm around these hoes and mosquitoes
Trying to get high and suck me dry
I get homesick, man
Start slappin' bitches every which way, takin' all they pay
You understand me?

But before I get distracted I like to give a shout out to my
You understand me?
Bruntlaw Blaq out here from Beaumont, Texas
What's happenin' homeboy?

I'd also like to give a shoutout to my downass Compton partner
Shady J.D

[Intro]
You're frozen

[Verse 1]
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

You waste your time with hate and regret

Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

Kisses that should've been mine, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, what you've done

Who you love, who you love
Who you love
I know I'm losing you, so come on, tell the truth
Don't you tell me you're sorry, don't pretend you still want me
'Cause I don't wanna know, I already know

Screaming at angels
Holding a wall in my brain, yeah
Secrets are locked up
Prison cell in your heart, yeah
Kisses fall on her lips
The memory's left behind

I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, sick
(d.a. got that dope)

[Chorus]
They say these bars are like COVID (Bars are like COVID; what?)
You get 'em right off the bat (You get 'em right off the bat; yeah)
Infected with SARS and Corona (Infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (You took a bite off of that; damn)
And it goes from martian to human (From martian to human; yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (That's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (At me with machine guns; brr)
Like trying to fight off a gnat

[Verse 1]
Still stackin' my chips, hoes
Higher than Shaq on his tiptoes
Atop the Empire State Buildin'
This shit is like child's play, childrеn
I will anni-nihilate, kill them
I'll fuck around and pile еight million
Dead little juveniles, wait, chill, then
I'll await my trial date 'til then (What?)
Ain't nothin' you say could ever trump (Nah), mic, pencil get killed (Yeah)
If you're hypersensitive, I wasn't referencin' the vice president, chill (Chill)
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violence but with skill
That's why I hence when I write ends up with the mic and pencil gettin' killed (Haha, yeah, hold up)
And I'm still ride or die for the squad (Yeah)
So you know which side that I'm on
If a battle line's ever drawn, but if I get involved
It'll be like K9's in a brawl
But not similar to Mike Vick at all
'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight
They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog (Fight in the dog)
Got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled, a mic in the palms
Like claws, I can swing right for your jaw
And rip it off with one swipe of the paw
Bitch, you still on my dick or nah? (Nah)
If I suck, your wife is a straw (Straw)
I'm sick and I'm not gonna cover my mouth next time that I cough 'cause

[Chorus]
They say these bars are like COVID (Bars are like COVID; what?)
You get 'em right off the bat (You get 'em right off the bat; yeah)
Infected with SARS and Corona (Infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (You took a bite off of that; damn)
And it goes from martian to human (From martian to human; yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (That's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (At me with machine guns; brr)
Like trying to fight off a gnat (Like trying to fight off a gnat; yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
And d.a. got that dope he sends to me (Uh-huh)
It's like pneumonia symptoms and contracting COVID instantly
Which is what separates my flow from theirs
So that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me
So vocalistically (What?), that's social distancing (Yeah)
Flow going viral, you best stay strapped
With that Lysol and get way back (Shh)
Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax
'Cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback
Bitch, back the fuck up like fifteen yards, these rhymes call for a face mask (Face mask)
'Nother fourteen-day quarantine, they're cordoning off everything
This shit lookin' like a horror scene, like me metaphorically (Damn)
'Cause them stay-at-home orders seem
Like they just keep getting more extreme
Who knows when this nightmare will end (Marilyn)? Like Monroe, Norma Jean (Norma Jean)
Still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine
'Cause I'm so fuckin' dope (Dope) and you're a fiend
And that's the one thing that hasn't changed (Nope)
For some semblance of normalcy
But I might need that Hydrochloroquine 'cause I got that (Yeah)
The Dark Horse, I'm a knight-mare
Mom fed me Valium like air (Mmm)
Thought that's why they called it a high chair (Woah)
I got a contact like eyewear (Woah)
Wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here (Uh)
20/20 hindsight in my side mirror
Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square
My hair trigger whenever I get an idea's
Like, fuck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop
And my drip was a drop
In the bucket, so that gun shot
You just heard just now in that one spot
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded
I ain't even mean to go the fuck off
And I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'
Woah, everything is slow, I begin to floating
I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia
With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the G.O.A.T.​
Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault (A salt)
When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly
I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho
Got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river (Dope)
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause

[Chorus]
They say these bars are like COVID (Bars are like COVID; what?)
You get 'em right off the bat (You get 'em right off the bat; yeah)
Infected with SARS and Corona (Infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (You took a bite off of that; damn)
And it goes from martian to human (From martian to human; yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (That's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (At me with machine guns; brr)
It's like trying to fight off a gnat (Fight off a gnat)

[Intro]
Haha, hold up
What is that? Oh

[Verse]
Is that a key in my pocket or am I just happy to see
The hot chicks that are here for me and only me?
'Cause I am the cuz, the cuz meaning cousin
Meaning stemming back to bro
'Cause, bro, I'm the dude
And the dude gets all the chicks
Chicks is all that thine getteth
'Cause that's all I needeth is the chickeths
The chickadees runningeth about
And you'd be lucky to get my seconds
Leftover hot chicks

[Outro]
Hahaha
Fucking stupid

[Intro]
She loves me, she loves my knot
Not for who I am, but what I got, yeah
And I don't wanna blow up her spot
But da-na-na, na-na, da-naa (Woo)

[Verse 1]
Lady, I been watchin' you from the back every time that you walk past
Hate to put you on blast but you got a bomb ass (Yeah)
Been checkin' you out ever since the second you
Stepped in through Naunie's dressing room, girl, you're stunning, I'd bet that you'd
Zap me if I was next to you, sparks'll fly, I expect 'em to
I'd be shocked if they didn't, 'cause you're Carmen Electra-cute (Cutie)
And those ain't just sound effects
I knew something was special soon as we swapped info, I knew that

[Chorus]
She loves me, she loves me not
For who I am, but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not (Aha)
She loves me (One more time)
I said, 'cause she loves me (She loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (She loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not
She loves me

[Verse 2]
Sorry I missed your call again, I be in the studio usually
But tomorrow afternoon for me'd work beautifully
If your schedule's open, you say, "That's cool with me
But you stood me up twice, Slim, you're 0-for-2 with me"
'Cause like a basket, you've been going through hoops for me
Well, if the ball's in my court, why don't we shoot for three?
Yeah, I'll pick you up and we'll cruise through the D
And as soon as we hung up, I'm like, "Woo"

[Chorus]
'Cause she loves me (She loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (She loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not (Aha)
She loves me (Ayo, lemme do this bridge right quick)

[Bridge]
She pulls me close and whispers to me, oh-oh
Lies in my ear, but that's all I wanna hear
That's okay, long as we both know this is all it is, woah
She can have my love for as long as we both are here

[Verse 3]
We're back in my spot now (Yeah), the music is loud, so (What?)
I turn the boombox down (Shh), we cut off our cell phones
You're killin' me soft now, wanna hit it like Balboa
'Cause girl, you're a knockout, your body is out cold (Out cold)
(Woo) I put the moves on you like a U-Haul
Bend you over the foosball table, your shoes fall
To the floor, but canoodlin', I'm not in the mood for
Gotta get me out of these drawers if you wanna (want a) spoon, doll (Yeah)
But before we get to droppin' these drawers, there's options to explore
We can fuck in the closet (Yeah) or on my elevator (Uh)
And maybe when it stops and the door opens
We fall out and we just get off on this floor (Haha)
You say you're falling for me, but not 'cause I'm famous
Then explain to me who that tattoo that's on your leg's of
Girl, your game is an A-plus, but you think I don't notice
Who the screensaver on your damn phone is
It ain't 'cause who I am, bullshit, I like you
Just don't take me for no stupid ass, no disrespect
'Cause even though you're like my truest fan, know it's
Clear you only love me 'cause I'm Superman, Lois, but fuck it

[Chorus]
'Cause she loves me (She loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (She loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not
She loves me (Yeah, one more time)
I said, 'cause she loves me (She loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (She loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not (Haha)
She loves me

[Outro]
She loves my knot, haha
I'm just playin', I ain't got no foosball table

[Build: Eric Thomas]
Whaddup, whaddup, whaddup, whaddup?
Alright, look, look, look, look, look
Just in case you ain't got it by now
Listen to me, bring it in
If you are alive
I know you ain't reach your best yet
You got more, you could do more
You could see more, you could be more, alright?
Right now, you should feel invincible
Powerful, strong, look
Where your focus goes, your energy flows
Are you hearin' me?

[Drop: Eric Thomas]
A-ha
Now we goin' take it to another level
Right now, you should feel invincible
Powerful, strong, look
A-ha

[Build: Eric Thomas]
A lot of you, you're not where you wanna be
You thinkin' of that negative stuff
You talkin' negativity
You in that negative zone
I need you to do me a favor
I need you to know that
In order for you to get on that next level
The one thing you need to do
To go where you've never gone before
Is to change the way you think
Where your focus goes, your energy flows
Are you hearin' me?

[Drop: Eric Thomas]
Right now, you should feel invincible
Powerful, strong, look
A-ha

[Intro: Rico Wade]
Man, let me hit that, man
You gon' pass that?
Man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El-dogs
Nothing but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking 'bout a Black man heaven here, know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
It's beginning to look a lot like, what? Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept, I's 'bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least, no, no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better, bet
I said subtract, so shut up that nonsense about some silent night
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right
I'm like no matter what the season, forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons
So, tell me what did you expect?
You thought I'd break my neck to help y'all deck the halls
Oh, nah, I got other means of celebrating
I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year, can't ask for nothing much more
It's OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know, let's go

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening on Christmas day

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
You know I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do
The package store was closed, okay, my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious
'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes cause I'm mobbin', folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke
They having a smoke out in my back seat (Yeah)
They passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches
'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
It's just another day of work to me, the spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me
'Cause it's like that, ha, yeah
Forever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is (Check it)

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening on Christmas day

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto, so I won't be hanging my socks on no chimney
I'm fit as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we comin'
So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um

[Verse 4: André 3000]
It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac, my heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to Underground, sees a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A-five, fo', a-three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one (Yeah)

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening on Christmas day

[Interlude: Peaches]
Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, the 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide
Down for theirs

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening on Christmas day

[Outro: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came from far and wide

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah
You know, I've been around for a while now
Not sure if I have much left to prove
Yeah I do, haha

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I look at me now, I'm thinkin', "Damn"
How proud of me I am
What I did is nothin' to sneeze at
Even if your allergies are bad
I'm up in a balcony in France
I look around, I see the fans
How they surround me in the stands
Probably could drown in a sea of hands
They're hollerin', "Shady" ("Shady")
Yelling it out to me and that's what I mean when I say
That one day someway, somehow, if I get the chance to get a crowd
I'd flip it around and have a crowd give me the chants
(I've done it all, man)
But in actuality, I haven't, yet

[Chorus: Sly Pyper & Eminem, Sly Pyper]
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (My only question is)
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All I know is, all)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Got no time for no haters in this bitch
Or toleration for this shit
But like medication, my dedication
And the time it takes to do this shit
Reminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waiting room'll get
What I mean is maybe I have more patience (patients) than I'm able to admit
Yeah, but I'm still mentally stable as a three-legged table in this bitch
Fame was a switch, but I was grateful to trade this shit for the trailer with a hitch
That it would make me a raving lunatic
But I made it through my situation, I hit pay dirt
Now I get paper like a stapler in this bitch
But just 'cause I made a little bit of change
Don't mean I've changed a little bit
Brain full of wit, dangerous, can't extinguish this English language when it's lit
And I'm just berating you with it, it's Shady 'til I'm eighty-two
I'll spit this crazy, even Dre, he knows (nose) I'ma blow
Better get the handkerchief again, haha

[Chorus: Sly Pyper & Eminem]
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (Know I talk about this shit a lot, my only question is)
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All I know is, all)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

[Bridge: Sly Pyper & Eminem]
Oh, now what am I gonna do?
Can't nothing hold me, I'm on the loose
Born a winner, damn, it's so hard to lose
I can do it even when I'm tryin' to
When my record flops, it still go through the roof
This atmosphere's for a chosen few
Who was on they grind makin' money moves
And you ain't gon' get there if you watered-down
You gotta take shots with a hundred proof (Check it out)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Been in survival mode
Since a five year old, it was I alone
Since my trike was stole, spiral notebook and microphone
But lookin' back how bad it was then
If it hadn't been for the pad and the pen
Addict mom and deadbeat dad
I wouldn't have had the savage within
Havin' to win every single battle I'm in
All I ever wanted was to be an emcee
Tediously I wrote obediently, believing in me
EPMD must've had teachin' degrees
Learned to defeat enemies with the ink, thinkin' of these rhymes
Would be as Eazy as E
And graffiti would be like remedial readin' to me (Yeah)
'Til my last breath leaves my lungs
I'ma beat my drum (Yeah) for the streets I'm from (Yeah)
The East side slums (Yeah), gotta remind 'em (Yeah)
I'll take a foe out (Yeah), like fee-fi-fum
You see my finger (What?), you see my thumb (What?)
You see my fist, fuck a peace pipe, I'm (What?)
Here for the smoke but it's not the weed I want (What?)
With this beat I brung for the beef I've come (Woo)
But you better bring it if you wanna reply from
'Cause for you to be lyrically inclined, it'd be a steep climb up
That'll be an uphill battle
But I'm up like your feet in a recliner
And I think I'm about to go out on a limb like a tree climber
Time to push my ceiling higher 'cause

[Chorus: Sly Pyper & Eminem]
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (For the last time, my only question is)
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All I know is, all)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (Damn)

[Intro]
I don't smile, I don't frown, get too up or get too down (Nah)
I was here, so were you, you came and went, I stuck around (Yeah)
Still here now, stop me how? Your opinion's like a broken calculator
That shit doesn't count
Shut your motherfuckin' mouth

[Chorus]
I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (My book of rhymes)
Get 'em all off my pad, every thought that I had
I said I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (My book of rhymes)
Get 'em all off my pad (Yeah), every thought that I had (I'm eastside)

[Verse 1]
Haven't used all the tricks I have, so like my balls, I'm in my bag (My bag)
Get a littlе teste when I'm mad (I'm mad), sick of wrеstling this iPad (iPad)
Unsuccessfully, I might add (Might add)
And I know it's best to leave it lie
But even I get obsessed with reading everything
And let it get the best of me 'til I snap ('Til I snap)
But I need to get off the internet (Get off the internet)
I need to get on the mic (Get on the mic)
You need to get off the internet (Internet)
You need to get you a life
Why you waste time just to comment on shit? (Comment on shit)
Especially shit you don't like (Shit you don't like)
Don't like it, don't listen, but don't tell me 'bout your favorite rapper rippin' some shit he didn't write (Shit he didn't write)
What happened to Slim? He was no cap with the pen
He used to rap like the people his music was for
He was exactly like them
The dude who used to be poor, why can't he tap into him?
Can't use that excuse anymore
He's mad at the wind, he's in a nuclear war
With a cloud, he's yellin' at it again
I talked to your mother, she told me she loved me
All she wanna do is just hold me and hug me
Wants nobody but me, she showed me the Dougie
Can I get a witness like notary public? (Preach)
She said, "Kick some fly shit" (Fly shit)
I said, "I got wings on my ass" (Wings on my ass)
Told her my dick's a cockpit (Dick's a cockpit)
I fly by the seat of my pants (Seat of my pants)
Sinful thoughts, this beat is crazy, this shit's retarded
This instru's mental (This instru's mental) to mini-bars, incidental charges
When did it start? I been cold-hearted in this heart since kindergarten
Mental sharpness which makes Slim a walking dentist office, bitch, I invented flossin'
Yeah, I used to wonder (I used to wonder) where my next meal's gonna come from (Meal's gonna come from)
Now, I just wonder (Now I just wonder) where my next mill's gonna come from (Mill's gonna come from)
I cannot have no success (Have no success), unless when I finally make it (Finally make it)
I get to remind all the haters (Remind all the haters) who shitted on me when I'm on my way up (I'm on my way)
My floor is y'all fool's ceilings
If I was you, I would step or find yourself twisted
That's how you'll wind up like spiral stairs
I will swear on a stack of Bibles
I will tear new behinds out of rivals, even your idols, I don't care
It's Music to Be Murdered By, so Bon Iver can swallow a fuckin' Ja Rule bobblehead
And die slow like Alzheimer's (Ha-ha)
Lone sniper, I hold a microphone like a loaded rifle
My dome's brighter, all I spit from my skull's fire
All that's missing's a motorcycle with the chrome wires, spoke tires
And y'all are flow biters, so I don't gotta
Explain why they call me your ghostwriter

[Chorus]
I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (My book of rhymes)
Get 'em all off my pad, every thought that I had
I said I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (My book of rhymes)
Get 'em all off my pad, every thought that I had (Illa)

[Verse 2]
Haven't used all the tricks I have, so like my balls, it's in my bag
I tend to get a little testy when I'm mad
But gift of gab and pen to pad turn temper tantrums into anthems
Put lips to ass and kiss the cracks, spit your damnedest
You're still gonna hit the canvas
Rippin' rappers, veterans to whippersnappers
Mr. Mathers is killin' this shit, villainous wit with scant less
Syllables rip the planet, biblical shit's finna hit the fan
Anybody wanna go tit for tat's gonna get hit with that
Then the amygdala hippocampus is gonna trigger the ignoramus
To think of the most ridiculous shit to spit then
Pit it against these pitiful rappers
Insidious, these idiots wittiest shit against me shitty as MC Hammer's
Get your whole squad, send a task force in
If you want it, you're 'bout to get what you asked for then
Put your helmet on, strap your chin
You're 'bout to get you a crash course in
Who not to start a motherfuckin' rap war with
Or to go against, fuck would you wanna do that for?
No offense, but are you retards slow or dense?
A fuckin' penny has more sense
Yeah, now you gotta get killed, but it's not a big deal, but every thought is so ill
And so methodical, thought I swallowed a pill
I'm starting to feel like I'm an automobile
With Barnacle Bill inside the car at the wheel
Inside a carnival, 'cause I'm plowin' into everyone who wrote snidey articles
And that explains why the fuck you clowns are all in my grill
Joy and pain, fortune, fame, torture, shame, choice I made
Swore someday the world would pay less to lose, more to gain, daughters raised
Yesterday, glory days, adored and praised, ignored the hate
Addressed the fake, toured with Dre, tore a page from Jordan came
Destroyed the game before you came, enjoy your stay
Before it's gone away, but the more you claim that you're gonna point and aim
If it joined a gang, your shit isn't going to bang
You're just boring, lame and more of the same
You have an enormous chain, but a stormless brain
The most you can form is rain
Your shit is pointless, same as a scoreless game
So, bitch, quit lyin', you're denyin' like Mr. Porter's name (Haha)
Borderline bipolar disorder since my stroller
Eyes rollin' back in my skull like Eli Porter
Fire mortar (Brr) rounds, Ayatollah, every iota I load up
I owe to my motor mouth
This is my note to self
Sometimes you're gonna bomb
So you just might have to blow yourself up with no one's help
I just wrote it down in my book of rhymes
Preemo, take us out

[Outro]
Writin' in my book of rhymes
My book of rhymes, my book of rhymes
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm eastside
Writin' in my book of rhymes
My book of rhymes, my book of rhymes
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm eastside

[Intro: Sly Pyper & Eminem]
Nah, for real, you know what I'm sayin'? Like
Like music's my first love, right?
But what it turned into is like
You know, these, these cats got it now, she just like a ho
(They ain't doin' it now to make music)
You know what I mean? (Yeah)
It's not real (Yeah)
Switched it up, then everybody—
Done changed the shit on that damn—
Yeah, everybody done ran through it
Mumble rappin'
Ain't no more substance in shit
Right, right
They don't treat it the way it needs to be treated
I kinda want that old thing back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yeah, I was young, I was hungry
I was chasin' the bag at twenty-one, I was lucky
To find an unеaten fucking (What?) honeybun I forgot about
Now I got money fallin' out, fiftiеs, hundreds, and twenties (Twenties)
And I know nothing is funny 'bout the Manchester bombing
But we got something in common (What?), both of us are alarming
Foul, disgusting, and awful (Yeah), so repugnant and ugly (Yup)
I could give the Boston Marathon a run for its money, yeah
And you could say I'm a little bit immature
But this type of literature got me a little richer
But I get insecure when them other dudes hit on you, girl
You're letting 'em fiddle with your clitoris
Remember you were my fucking—

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
You used to be my favorite, bitch
Things'll never be the same, ain't it funny how you changed
Up and flipped the script?
You done let a bunch of lames fall through and go plain
That I can't permit
You ain't have to do it like that, told you I'd be right back
Look what you did, I need a new chick
Like the music, I have to bounce on my favorite, bitch

[Verse 2: Eminem, Eminem & Ty Dolla $ign]
Always hated my smile
Mama told me it's goofy
I'd get picked on at school
Come home and she'd school me
She never sugarcoated it to me
She said if I wasn't so stupid and ugly, I wouldn't always get bullied (True)
I think of my struggles (Yeah) and get emotional
Could be 'cause how behind the eight-ball and far in the hole that they put me
Now I'm on a roll like a Tootsie (Yeah)
I'm just trollin' you pussies
But I'm like a stroller 'cause you'll see just how I roll if you push me
But that's what I do this music for
When I was goin' through some of the hardest times, I drew from her
But she's like the devil 'cause I just can't let loose of her (Lucifer)
'Cause the thought of losin' her makes me wanna just let loose on her
Then I hit the studio, tryna rendezvous with her
Tell her, "It's a butt-dial girl," yeah, booty call (Haha)
That's how it used to be, 'cause you and me, we ruled the world
And we made Curtis blow (Kurtis Blow, 50)
Fuck, I miss them days

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
You used to be my favorite, bitch
Things'll never be the same, ain't it funny how you changed
Up and flipped the script?
You done let a bunch of lames fall through and go plain
That I can't permit
You ain't have to do it like that, told you I'd be right back
Look what you did, I need a new chick
Like the music, I have to bounce on my favorite, bitch

[Interlude: Eminem]
You fuckin' leavin' me, bitch?
I don't think so, sit your motherfuckin' ass down
I swear to God, you run to that door
I'ma put one in the back of your fuckin' head
Now I'ma ask you this one time
And your answer better be "Yes"

[Verse 3: Eminem & Ty Dolla $ign]
Would you marry me again
Now that everything has changed? (Yeah)
It'll never be the same (Nah)
As the era whence we came (Who?)
From Nas to Pac, Ra (Yeah), Eric B. and Kane (I know)
But I know a few from this era that are lyrically insane
And although most are never gonna hit the level Cole or Weezy at
Or be emotionally attached to Yo! MTV Raps (Yeah)
Runnin' home from school to catch an episode, the feeling that
It gave you to rip the plastic off the tape you're holdin'
Peel it back, yeah, tear it off, and play it (What?)
And swear to God, four o'clock
We'd crowd around the TV, Butter in his underwear and socks
When Naunie was Kon Artis (Yeah) and Proof had his hair in locs (Doody)
Yeah, back when Flavor Flav had us wearin' clocks
(Back with) Back with Ed Lover (Yeah)
And there was two Dr. Dre's, that's a paradox (Pair of Docs)
But I never thought I'd get so jealous
At the thought of letting you go psychologically
It's gonna bother me, my eyes are already watery
Part of me don't wanna stop (Yeah) 'til I get you back
If I gotta put the work in and tell you I'm never givin' this up
Other part wants to tell you just to get fucked
Go back to whatever dick that you sucked (Ah)
Get back together with them, you slut
Givin' up the vagina like a trip to the gynecologist
When I helped you become bigger than you were
But I guess that it slipped your mind, you must be biding your time
Looking for someone to come along that'll make you feel like I did back when you were mine, huh? (Damn)
But truthfully, it was never really you and me exclusively
And there's too many new MC's you can choose between
But no matter how many motherfuckers ran through it, they can't do it like me
But I can't keep burnin' the candle at both ends
And I can't handle it when I leave and you find another one
Now I gotta take this beat and dismantle it
I won't grieve when I kill you
But if I can't have you, bitch, nobody can
Can't believe I used to be your favorite, bitch

[Intro]
Yeah, I'm sorry (Huh?)
What did you say?
Oh, I can't hear you
I have an ear infucktion and I cunt finger it out (Out), yeah (I need Auto-Tune)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
It's my alter ego's fault
These evil thoughts could be so dark
Cerebral palsy, three Zolofts
I eat, doze off to "Rico Suave" (Look it up)
Cadillac with a ladder rack in the back, with a cracked axel, a backpack full of Paxil
A black satchel, a knapsack and a flask full of 'gnac and Jack Daniels
Girl, let's go back-back to my castle (Yeah)
I don't wanna hassle you, Alexandra
But my dick's an acronym 'cause it stands for you (Stands for you, oh)
Wait, Alexandra who? (Damn)
All I know is Friday, I met you (What?)
Saturday, I'll probably forget you
Guess that's what the Molly and ex do (What the fuck?)
'Cause who the fuck am I laying next to? (Huh)
But evеr since D-Nice To Tha Rescuе, Fila Fresh Crew (Uh)
I been a lab rat (Yeah) from a test tube (Uh)
I'm goin' in-nn like the red roof (Red Roof Inn)
You don't like it, eat a cock 'til your jaw breaks (Yeah)
Call it caught between a rock and a hard place
Like a sasquatch in a crawlspace
'Cause you're watchin' your heart race like you're Scarface
In a car chase with the cops or an arcade
Stuck inside of a Mario Kart race duckin' saw blades
At a stop and a start pace
What I'm tryin' to say is I'm drivin' 'em all crazy

[Chorus]
I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone-deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone-deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone-deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I see the rap game, then attack the verses (Uh)
Turn into a graveyard packed with hearses (Yeah)
Just like your funeral, I'm at your service (What?)
Pockets 'on stuff' like a taxidermist (Woo)
Just landed in Los Angeles when this chick Angela and her grandmother in a tan
Colored van pull up with a handful of Xans
And a substantial amount of gan' just to ask what my
(Plans) plans for the night are (Yeah)
I said, "Sneak into the Sleep Inn for the weekend and pretend it's a five-star," yeah
Or leap into the deep end of the pool
I can show you where the dives are (Get it?), ha
We don't even gotta drive far
I know this spot that is so live
But I'm tryna get some head first (What?), like a nosedive (Haha)
So many side chicks, can't decide which to slide with and which should I ditch
So when it comes to ass, bitch, I get behind like the Heimlich (Get behind, yeah)
Had one chick who liked to flip sometimes on some switchin' sides shit
Pushed her out the Sidekick, then I flipped the lil' white bitch off like a light switch (Bitch)
It's okay not to like my shit
Everything's fine, drink your wine, bitch
And get offline, quit whinin', this is just a rhyme, bitch (Rhyme, bitch)
But ask me, will I stick to my guns (Guns) like adhesive tape? (Adhesive tape)
Does Bill Cosby sedate once he treats to cheesecake and a decent steak? (Huh?)
You think gettin' rid of me's a piece of cake?
I'm harder than findin' Harvey Weinstein a date (Damn)
And that's why they say I got more lines than Black Friday
So save that sssshit for the damn library (Shh)
You heard of Kris Kristofferson? (Yeah)
Well, I am Piss Pissedofferson (Oh)
Paul's askin' for Christmas off again
I said, "No," then I spit this song for him
It goes

[Chorus]
I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone-deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone-deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone-deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Bitch, I can make "orange" rhyme with "banana" (Yeah)
Bornana
Eating pork rinds, sword fightin' in pajamas
At the crib, playin' Fortnite with your grandma
But I'm more like a four-five with the grammar
'Bout to show you why your five favorite rappers can't touch this
But before I get the hammer
I should warn you, I'm Thor-like in this manner (Thor)
But the day I lose sleep over you critiquin' me or
I ever let you cocksuckers eat at me
I'd need to be a motherfuckin' pizzeria
But you ain't gettin' no cheese from me
I went from Little Caesars, BLTses, grilled cheeses
Bein' dirt poor to filthy rich, I'm still me, bitch
Like a realtor, that's real tea (Realty), bitch (Real talk)
Aftermath, bitch, whole camp's lit
We put out fire, Dre stamps it
With my cohorts, hit a bogart
Yeah, got your whole squad yellin', "Oh, God"
Here comes Barshall with no holds barred
Bitch, I'm a hurricane, you're a blowhard
Like your old broad, she full of semen (Sea men), like the coast guard
And life's been pretty good to me so far (Yeah), for the most part
Had a couple of run-ins with po-po, caught
A couple assault charges, got a few priors (Priers) like crowbars (Priors)
Which is so odd 'cause I'm forty-eight now
That 5-0's startin' to creep up on me like a patrol car (Woo)
I'll be an old fart, but you don't want no part, so, bitch, don't start (Don't start)
Simmer down, compose yourself, Mozart
I ain't went nowhere, call me coleslaw
'Cause I'm out for the cabbage and I'm so raw
And if time is money, you have no clocks
And any folk caught within close proximity's gettin' cold-cocked
My enemies, I'm a chimney, give me the smoke, opps
And R.I.P. to King Von, and it don't stop, and I know not
What the fuck you say? I told y'all, it ain't me, it's my alter ego's fault
But if y'all wanna cancel me, no prob
I'll tell you the same thing I told Paul (Woo)

[Chorus]
I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone-deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone-deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone-deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (I'm tone-deaf)

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, you know what? (Loud Pack)
Haters are funny, man (Haha)
It's like, you're gonna hate it no matter what it is
Yet you still click on it (Zombie on the track), huh, yeah

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I want you to change, but don't change (Yeah)
I want you to grow up, but don't age
I want the rage, but don't get too angry
I want the new, but old Shady
I want you to say what they won't say (Yeah)
Just don't go too far, but go cray
I want you to almost lose it, man
They keep movin' the goalpost, don't they?
So let's cut to the chase like OJ
In his Bronco goin' up the roadway (Skrrt)
And get off my dick
If I said my balls were yarn, you bitches would crochet (Haha)
All I ever wanted's a rope chain
From the day I saw Cool J on Soul Train
Now I got that Kangol, two cables (Haha)
One yellow and white gold plated
Just to let 'em know I made it

[Chorus: MAJ & Eminem]
I told my dawgs we gon' get right in a year (Yeah), yeah, yeah
What did it cost? Now I get gone in the Lear (Woo), yeah, yeah
Still have all these demons comin' for my neck, yeah, yeah
I ain't never comin' down, yeah, yeah (Yo)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
This pandemic got us in a recession
We need to reopen America (What?)
Black people dyin', they want equal rights
White people wanna get haircuts (Haha)
Some people protest, some people riot (What?)
But we ain't never escapin' this virus (Nah)
'Til the cops that are racially biased (What?)
We no longer enable these liars
You get 'em on tape, they stick to a story
Like Spider-Man crawlin' upside of a wall and (Yeah)
Some are just unabiding as lawmen (Yeah)
Like Garrett Rolfe and like Derek Chauvin (Yup)
No cap, still riding with Colin (Yup)
Though some people don't like me at all and (Yeah)
Some are like (Summer like) bees to flowers (Why?)
'Cause some people find me appalling (A pollen, haha)
Ooh, I say a line, people are outraged (Oh no)
The press slams me again (Yeah), people ain't having it nowadays
Then give an album that I put out in, like, 2000 you griped about praise
But I wake up every day even more caked up than the makeup on your clown face
And I laid my foundation, and

[Chorus: MAJ & Eminem]
I told my dawgs we gon' get right in a year, yeah, yeah
What did it cost? Now I get gone in the Lear, yeah, yeah
Still have all these demons comin' for my neck, yeah, yeah
I ain't never comin' down (Yeah), yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I got a question (What?)
What rhymes with pariah?
(I don't know) Mm, tsk, uh, LEGO? (Oh shit)
You just bit into the lit end of the wick
Shit, I meant, shit end of the stick
I'm addicted to friction and mischief
It's like your bitch's midriff, shit gets my dick stiff as a stick shift
Dick as in Cheney, drip as in saline
They bring my name up just to get ratings
It's like trying to choose between Bizzy, Layzie, or Wish against Krayzie
'Cause I got a bone to pick and Slim Shady (Slim Shady)
Will thug (Thug) and harm any (Harmony)
Who attempt to diss Hailie (Hailie)
Bitch, I will go in like it's raining
And I get canceled like once a day (Yeah)
Why would I go? It's more fun to stay (Ah)
You get me to leave? There's no fuckin' way
I got a better chance of fuckin' Young M.A. (Ooh)
Ooh, sounds like I'm zoning
So me sayin' I'm out, nice to know me
Is like askin' me where my shin is
It's down right bologna (Below knee, haha)
Uh, oh, but we can play hide the salami (Yeah)
If your gal'd like to blow me (Yup)
My wave is like a tsunami (Yup)
These flows you're still tryna wrap your head around like you're a swami (Ha)
Just call me the mic kamikaze with Mike Zombie and I'ma just keep bombing (Woo)
'Cause the game is mine like an IED (Yeah)
If they ever do cancel me like Live PD
Said I'm takin' some of you with me if I'm leaving (Brr)
It's time to murder you now, side B, B
I might be D to the fuckin' I-Z-Z
Y from rappin' circles around these hoes
Just like girdles and every word from my mouth's so fire
I should be burnt to the ground
There's a fuckin' circus in town, yeah, bitch, this verse finna clown, ICP
R. Kelly sex tape, I see pee (Look)
My shit is intense (In tents) like tipis
You gettin' wiped like TP
You don't like me? You can bite my little white wee-wee
And I repeat, you can bite my little white wee-wee long as I L-I-V-E
And ever since my pre-teens, striped Lee jeans and Grandma Nan's little black and white TV (Yeah)
Now I'm so bougie that I stick out my pinkie every time I drink tea
Used to wanna wife Sweet Tee (Sweet Tee)
Used to rock wife beaters, now I let your wife beat me (Yeah)
So you can eat shit, but I might be the shit
So when I say "Eat shit," I mean me

[Intro]
(Killer)
Yeah, it's crazy, I'm a (Killer)
Made all this money from doin' this
(D.A. got that dope)

[Chorus]
Now count it, five, ten, yeah, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, yeah, get the money
Throw it in the furnace, yeah, this shit be funny
Earn it just to burn it, swag drippin' from me

[Verse 1]
That's what I do with money, got money up the ass
Call it toilet paper, yeah, flush with cash
Girl, nice butt, is it up for grabs?
Just wanna touch your ass, is that too much to ask? Yeah
I made a grip, I know it's tough to grasp, get the bag
Call it potato chips, I stuff in duffel bags
On some public transportation shit, 'cause I will bus' your ass
Fuck the chain, I'm off the trailer hitch, I got a bunch of swag

[Chorus]
Now count it, five, ten, yeah, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, yeah, get the money
Throw it in the furnace, yeah, this shit be funny
Earn it just to burn it, swag drippin' from me
Yeah, I'm a (Killer)

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm a (What?), I'm a (What?), I'm a (Killer)
Yeah, look, yeah

[Verse 2]
My income is all that and then some
Girl, your man is a nincompoop, a symptom
Of a simp 'cause he'll spend some loot to get some
As for me, I'm the Kim Jong-Un of pimps, hon' (Haha)
Swag dripping, I'm in a pub
Went up to this chick who was so tipsy, we went to hug
Ended up tripping, I picked her up
She yelled out it's her birthday
She's fifty and in the club
Then it comes on (Yeah), that "In da Club" song (Yeah)
She's a buzzsaw (What?), we're goin' numbskull (Uh)
I live on the edge (Haha), she's a jump off (Yeah)
Call her Cinderella (Why?), she loves balls (Oh)

[Chorus]
Now count it, five, ten, yeah, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, yeah, get the money
Throw it in the furnace, yeah, this shit be funny
Earn it just to burn it, swag drippin' from me
Yeah, I'm a (Killer)

[Verse 3]
Attack like the Ripper
All over the track doin' laps like a stripper
Now (Now), now (Now), w— wow (Wow) look out (Out)
Rap circles around ('Round) clowns, surround sound (Sound)
John Rambo's back and my ammo's stacked
And I'm cocking raps, I'm on your head
Other words, I'm stocking caps and I'm talking facts (Fax)
Like OfficeMax
Never down, I'll be up like an insomniac
Girl, I got racks you got a rack
How you got all that back and no body fat
I'm in awe with that
When I stopped the Pontiac at the laundromat that I saw you at
You almost had a heart attack, went into cardiac
You ran inside and told your boyfriend like, "I'll be back"
But for all you knew I probably act like I'm Daniel Wozniak
I'm a psycho-pa-pathic killer
I'm a cap peeler, caterpillar
With the botanic of bananas
You never heard better vernacular
Comin' after your scapula
For the lack of a better word, Dracula
'Cause I'm attackin' a rapper at the phrenic nerves
I'm a savage, back to put the dagger in the back of competitors
Predator and scavenger
I am a carnivore and a baller, you're at the dollar store
What the fuck you got a wallet for? Y'all are poor
I was livin' in squalor but, uh-uh, not no more
Now I'm the one they holla for
Fuckin' shit up like a dinosaur in a China store
Bitch, I'm number five (What?) minus four (Haha)

[Chorus]
Now count it, five, ten, yeah, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, yeah, get the money
Throw it in the furnace, yeah, this shit be funny
Earn it just to burn it, swag drippin' from me
Yeah, I'm a (Killer)

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm a (What?), I'm a (What?), I'm a (Killer)
Yeah

[Intro: Sly Pyper & Dr. Dre]
It's time to face the music
A stay of execution
No more distribution
(The fuck you doin'?)

[Chorus: Sly Pyper & Dr. Dre]
You did this to me
I'm right back on my bullshit, right back out in these streets
Just remember that you did this to yourself (Yeah, you did it to yourself)
Now you gotta suffer the consequences
Back up to bat and swingin' for the fences (Remember that)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Sly Pyper]
Let's make one thing clear, here, here, my dear
My resolute for this year
No pollution, fresh air
My solution, long hair with a fat ass, I'm deadass
Mile high club 'til I jеt lag
Rothstein flow, Casino
And you're just like Gingеr, we know
Single negro, I don't need your (Double standards and hypocrisy)
And that fake handholdin' on Father's Day
You a different motherfucker when you're not with me
Been sleepin' with the enemy, mockery
It's like I'm John F. Kennedy, shots at me
Yes, I'm president of debauchery
None of that bullshit ever got to me
'Cause your pillow Brillo, ditto
Breakin' this shit down little by little
I ain't got time for the fuckin' pom-poms
Shoulda never let this dog out of that kennel

[Refrain: Sly Pyper, Dr. Dre & Both]
Wastin' time, debatin' 'bout
Who I'm with when I'm not around
Just don't forget who you fuckin' wit'
When steppin' on hallowed ground

[Chorus: Sly Pyper & Eminem]
('Cause) You did this to me (Yeah, I'm)
Right back on my bullshit, right back out in these streets
Just remember that you did this to yourself (Yeah, you did it to yourself)
But now you gotta suffer the consequences
(And "sorry" isn't gonna help, nah)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Sly Pyper]
How many times have I got burnt and tried to act like I'm not hurt? (What?)
Or take you back and we not work, like clockwork
This shit is agony, you're draggin' me, Glocks burst
Just remember, you drawed first
You ain't toe taggin' me, ho-bag, any blowback, you deserve
Get the bozack, bitch (Yeah), my soul's blackening
So actually, this could've been a lot worse (Why?)
I could've name-dropped you in my verse (Yeah)
But out of respect for your daughter
I won't blow your spot up 'cause your toddler
Does not deserve to get caught up in our dirt (Damn)
And good luck with her father
Bitch, you're stuck with him now, ha-fuckin'-ha
Word to the doctor, these are wounds you cannot nurse
Hope it's drivin' you bonkers, that I'm not yours (Oh no, woo)
Guess I must've got wise, you are not sly
Just 'cause you can make up an on-the-spot lie
I'm comin' out, guns blazin', shots fired
'Hand sani', I'm cutting off 'tize' (Ties)
Bitch, everything you own's in a box, bye
Guess it's back to the trailer and pot pies
Hope I pull up to the window at Popeyes
One day and you'll be servin' me hot fries 'cause (You did this to me)
Taste of your own medicine
You shedded skin, yeah, you reptilian bitch
Off of your knees (Yeah), beggin' for forgiveness
Yeah, look at you, marry him again, bitch
You ain't Em's bitch, you're just regular him's bitch
We will never be together again, ever
And when you're in bed with him and you wish you was with me
Just remember that

[Chorus: Sly Pyper, Eminem & Both]
You did this to me (Yeah, now)
I'm right back on my bullshit, right back out in these streets (Look what you did)
Just remember that you did this to yourself (Yeah, you did it to yourself)
But now you gotta suffer the consequences
(And "sorry" isn't gonna help)
Remember that (Michelle) you did this to me (Yeah)
I'm right back on my bullshit, right back out in these streets (Fuck around and make you famous)
Just remember that you did this to yourself (Yeah, you did it to yourself)
But now you gotta suffer the consequences (Oh no)
(So when I'm hittin' someone else and you're)

[Refrain: Sly Pyper, Dr. Dre & Both]
Wastin' time, debatin' 'bout
Who I'm with when I'm not around
Just don't forget who you fuckin' wit'
When steppin' on hallowed ground

[Intro: Alfred Hitchcock]
Thus far, this album has provided musical accompaniment to make your passing pleasant
Our next number is designed to drown out the sound of shovels
Music to be buried by

[Verse 1]
Before I check the mic (Check, check, one, two)
I give it a extra swipe with a Lysol disinfectant wipe (Good evening)
Coronavirus in effect tonight
Antiseptics on deck, I got every type (Yeah)
I throw on my tux, then I (Yeah) give zero fucks, then I (Yeah)
Act like a jockstrap (Uh), cup my nuts, then I (Yeah)
Check my ball hair (What?), make sure it's all there (Yeah)
Then call the pallbearer (Yeah)
It's Music to Bе Murdered By again, why stop?
Overkill likе a pipe bomb in your pine box
You're all hitched to my cock (What?)
Went from punchin' a time clock to getting my shot
Then treated it like a cyclops
Like it's the only one I (Only one eye) got
And my thoughts are like nines cocked (Chk-chk)
Every line's obscene, pervertedest mind, got the dirtiest rhyme stocked
That's why there's parental advising (Visine) every time I drop (Eye drop)
So throw on the theme to Alfred, I'll channel him like the Panama Canal
But how could I get up in arms about you saying trash is all that I put out?
Bitch, I still get the bag when I'm putting garbage out
Plus, the potty mouth, I'm not about to wash it out
The filthiest, so all this talk about I'm washed up, how preposterous
Because if cleanliness is next to godliness
It's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself
And I'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun
Still on top the pile
Got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial
Quick to call you out on your bullshit
Don't make me give that crock a dial
'Cause if I do it, see you later, alligator
Made it out the trailer, then I made a vow to cater to no one
So hate, I've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account
So here's some more shit for you to complain about, I say the
Bars that never slack (Yeah), but always get attacked (Yeah)
I think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that
Like I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit
'Cause I have this target on my back (Ew, yuck)
But if I ever double-crossed my fans and lost my Stans
I'd probably pop five Xans (Yeah)
Go in my garage, start my van
Inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can
And doze off like *snores*
But odds like that, with these thoughts I have's like a giant getting squashed by ants
If this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors
Like I just tossed my crayons (Tossed my crayons)
Small, medium, and large size cans
Sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands
Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and
If my palms brush across my pants, I wash my hands

[Interlude]
Shit, hold on, man
Motherfuck
Happy birthday to—
Fuck (Shh, quiet)

[Verse 2]
I sit in silence in candlelit environments
Sipping Wild Irish while getting violent
Homicidal visions when I'm spitting like this
But really I'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes
Which is really childish and silly, but I'm really like this
I'm giving nightmares to Billie Eilish, I'm Diddy's side bitch

[Interlude]
What the fuck? Hold on, wait
"I'm Diddy's side bitch?"
Oh, I'm still east side, bitch

[Verse 3]
So 'til the E-N-D, since EPMD
Been givin' y'all the business (Yeah), D-R-E and me (Yup)
From the MMLP to (Huh?) MTBMB (Bitch)
Bitch, it's 2020, you still ain't seein' me (Haha)
So call me Santa Claus (Santa Claus)
'Cause at the present (Yeah), I out-rap 'em all (Wrap 'em all), I'm at the mall
Got your bitch in a bathroom stall, she could suck a basketball (Uh)
Through a plastic straw (Yeah) with a fractured jaw (Damn)
My dick is coat check (Ha), she wanna jack it off (Yeah)
I'm so far past the bar, I should practice law
Mentally, I'm fucked up generally (General Lee) (Duh)
Dukes of Hazzard car (Yeah), get the cadaver dogs
'Cause this is murder, murder and you'll get murked, murked
This music 'bout to kill you, brr, brr (Brr)
This chicken hit my phone, she said, "Chirp, chirp"
I said, "Hut, hut, hike your skirt, skirt"
Then go eat some worms, like the early bird
What the fuck is love? That's a dirty word
Make me fall in it, there's not a girl on Earth
Or any other planet, that's a world of hurt
And I won't buy her designer, 'cause I don't pander (Panda)
But I'm back with so many knots, I need a chiropractor (Damn)
And this the final chapter (Why?), 'cause I'm either frying after (Oh)
Or they gon' give me the needle (What?) like a vinyl scratcher (DJ)
Yeah, I'm a card, like Hallmark
At Walmart with a small cart buying wall art
And y'all who claim to be dogs aren't
No bite, like a tree, mostly just all bark, arf, arf
But y'all pickin' the wrong tree, they call me dog because I'm barking (Bar king, bark, bark, barking)
And I got a lot, yeah, like where cars park
I'd describe it as bowling (Why?) ball hard (Ball's hard)
'Cause the gutter's where my mind is and when
It's in this frame, better split like the five and the ten
'Cause without a second to spare, I'm strikin' again
And when the beat is up my alley, I go right for the pens (Pins)
The cypher begins
I'm talkin' smack like heroin, the mic's a syringe
It's like a binge, Vicodin, I would liken to tin
My mind is a recycling bin
There's no place I never been
But I never budge and I never bend
You hyperextend on me, this game's life, it depends
Like adult diapers for men
Even when I'm rappin' less stellar
It's sour grapes, I still whine, I'm the best seller (Cellar)
Like a trey deuce, spray you as these shots penetrate through Dre's booth
And go straight through your grapefruit, no escape route
So you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds
Your ass is grass and I am not gonna graze you
But if bars were semi-mac's, I'd be the Mad Hatter
'Cause I got so many caps, and you don't have any straps (Nah)
So you'd be a fitted (Yeah), so don't act like you fittin' to snap
Bitch, I'll pee (P) on your head like a Phillies hat (Haha)
No stoppin' me, you're on a window shopping spree
Bitch, you probably go broke at the Dollar Tree
You never buy shit, all you ever cop's a plea
You're always punkin' out like Halloween
You rather opt to flee, you need to stop it, punk
Homie, you're not a G, act like you got the pump
And you're gonna cock the heat or get the Glock and dump
Bitch, if you shot a tree, you wouldn't pop the trunk
Yeah, and I'm buddies with Alfred, we about to
Disembowel them, gut 'em and scalp 'em, yeah
This is 'bout to be the bloodiest outcome
'Cause we gon' make you bleed with every cut from this album
So I'm choppin' 'em up like Dahmer
The nut job with the nuts that are bigger than Jabba the Hutt
I'm in the cut, and I'm out for the blood
It's lookin' like it's that time of the month
Carvin' 'em up with the bars while I sharpen 'em up, dog and a mutt
I'm gonna fuck your mom in the butt with a thermometer, fuckin' phenomenal, but
Y'all will get cut the fuck up like abdominals if you don't vámonos
I keep droppin' like dominos, the formidable, abominable
Stompin' a mudhole in my comp even if it's off the top of the dome
Son 'em, get the Coppertone, I'm at the Stop and Go coppin' the Mop and Glo
Got your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope
You out of pocket though, like a motherfuckin' wallet stole

[Outro]
Wait, why'd the beat cut off?
Fuck it

[Verse 1: Eminem]
She says I am trash, but she listens to Tekashi (Damn)
Bitch, you lost me (Yeah)
Fair weather, wishy-washy
She thinks machine washed me (What?)
Swear to God, man, her favorite rapper wish he'd cross me (Yeah)
I love conflict, got a obnoxious (What?) subconscious (Yeah)
I'm afraid to unlock it (Nah)
Keep those monsters in the closet
I'm what an idiotic ('Otic) savant is (Savant is)
But I've been throwin' down gauntlets since that underground Rawkus (Yeah)
Where I planted my roots (What? Yeah)
That's how I had a whole planet that roots for me
As in the group, and no one thinks dark as I think (Nah)
So imagine the havoc these black thoughts are to wreak (Tariq)
As in Trotter, I keep slaughterin' beats
Shout out to Beatminerz and T-Minus
But, me, long as I breathe, promise to be honest
And wholeheartedly, apologies, Rihanna
For that song that leaked, I'm sorry, Ri
It wasn't meant to cause you grief
Regardless, it was wrong of me, but

[Chorus: White Gold & Eminem]
I be on my own (Yeah), head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, "You ain't the GOAT", I come down like, "Who?"
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus
Swear I can see the game from a bird's-eye view, ayy
Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god, ayy
Girl, you talkin' to a monsta, ayy
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around like they don't love you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yeah, they woke a giant up
So when I get back on my feet, don't wonder why in the
Fuck is my head in the clouds (Nah)
G5 with the stewardess, gettin' head in the clouds (Haha)
Mile-high club (Why?), I give a flying fuck (Fly and fuck, no)
Punchliner just tryin' to survive in this climate of vaginas (Bitch)
Who dyin' to cancel my ass like Aunt Jemima syrup
I'm a shit-stirrer, you're a dime-a
Dozen, said I couldn't do it
Hit Europe, kicked the door in, put a foot through it (Ugh)
Like a stirrup (Stirrup)
Used to have to sit and watch them bills pile up (Yeah)
Now I just sit back and watch them bills pile up (Haha), but

[Chorus: White Gold & Eminem]
I be on my own (Yeah, woo), head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, "You ain't the GOAT", I come down like, "Who?"
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus
Swear I can see the game from a bird's-eye view, ayy
Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god, ayy
Girl, you talkin' to a monsta, ayy
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around—

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I've seen them come and go
I've seen the hugest (Hugest) debuts ('Buts)
I've had a great view to see the (See the) game through (Through)
And Drake, they're gonna turn on you (You) one day too (Too)
And the more you win, the sooner (Sooner) they do
They'll be calling you a trash bin
Sayin' that your new one isn't better than your last and
Even if it is, once they start to turn their backs
They ain't never comin' back in
They did it to Chance
Next they'll be mentionin' Future in the past tense (Yeah)
Or sayin' "Adiós" to Migos
I ain't dissin', I'm just tryna keep the shit a C-note (Yeah)
Same people been tryna do the shit to me, so
I call them people (Peephole)
Because they're so easy to see through 'em (See through 'em)
But a fighter's all I knew how to be
I got the shit beat out of me (Yeah)
Tripped and fell and blew out a knee (Pop)
Popped it back in and hopped up like, "Fuck it (Fuck it)
Best two out of three", yeah
Man, I gotta be doin' (What?) somethin' right
I got eleven years of sobriety (Yeah)
So the only bottom I'ma be hittin' is if it's sodomy
Wait, I mean, you would think that somebody handed a saw to me (Sodomy)
How I'm choppin' these bars
They keep wantin' me to rap responsibly
When I'm constantly passin' the buck like the fuckin' Dollar Tree
But I'ma always remind you that I came from poverty
Black people saved my life, from the Doc and Deshaun
And all that we want is racial equality
R.I.P. Laquan McDonald, Trayvon, and Breonna
Atatiana, Rayshard, and Dominique
Eric Garner and Rodney King
No, we can't get along 'til these white motherfuckin' cops
Who keep murderin' Blacks are off the streets (Off the streets)
And, as far as squashin' beef, I'm used to people knockin' me
But, just not in my camp
And diplomatic as I'm tryna be
Last thing I need is Snoop doggin' me
Man, Dogg, you was like a (Yeah) damn god to me
Nah, not really (Haha)
I had "dog" backwards
But I'm startin' to think, all these people takin' shots at me
Shit, it's no wonder

[Chorus: White Gold, White Gold & Eminem]
I be on my own, head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, "You ain't the GOAT", I come down like, "Who?"
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus
Swear I can see the game from a bird's-eye view, ayy
Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god, ayy
Girl, you talkin' to a monsta, ayy
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around like they don't love you

[Interlude: Alfred Hitchcock]
Perhaps I should mention that we have decided that this
The flip, or "homicide," is a little special
A little too macabre for the squeamish
Therefore, we have labeled it—

[Intro]
Oh, ayo, Dre
I'm discombobulated
Let's take 'em back (Accents)
In time (Everything's all fucked up)
I'm discombobulated, discombobulated
Miss, you ovulating? Wait, I didn't mean to
Piss you off, my lady, what I really meant to say is
It goes a little something like this

[Verse 1]
Soon as I'm through with the Unisom I'ma hit the snooze alarm
Before I lose my mind, who am I gonna use it on?
Utilizing this tool, I will execute a line
Like what I tried to do one time in my youth when I euthanized
My poodle in junior high, used to hide in my room and fly
To the moon and try suicide with the glue from my school supplies
Then Proof, Denaun
Eye-Kyu and I would climb in that hooptie to ride to 'Drew's and rhyme
Bodied Saint Andrew's Hall too many times to count
Before I tear up The Shelter, give my dawgs a pound
Now I'm 'bout to treat all of you rappers' noggins how
Dre does every time he goes back to Compton now
'Cause every so often I'll visit my old stomping grounds
And Doc's in the house, so you know the bong is out
Room is spinning like nine-hundred-thousand miles an hour
Forgot what I'm talkin' 'bout, fuck, I'm discombobulated

[Chorus]
Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I comin' or goin'? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no
So, baby, please, take off your clothes
(No!) Yes! (No!) Yes! (No!) No! (Yes!) Oh! (Oh!), yeah

[Verse 2]
Just flew the coop, the cops are in hot pursuit
But the day they catch me is the day 50'll call a truce
And quash the feud with him and Ja and Ja'll actually spit a bar
That's not from a Dr. Seuss book and they'll start a group (Haha)
Fuck it, I'm a kook, I know I got a screw
And a couple of marbles loose, brain is like ramen soup
Shout to Trugoy, gotta give a De La salute
'Cause my noodle's in a knot, call it pasta noose (Posdnuos, yeah)
Wizard of ah's (Oz) and ooh's
Same Marshall Bruce in that battle who lost to Juice
Who also used to sound like Nas on "Live at the Barbeque"
Now I got the juice, wouldn't beef if I was you
Like, au jus, but beef, if like
"I was you," but, like, ah, fuck you (Man)
Long as I got these walls and these hallways I'm always
Have someone to argue with, I'm just all twisted, I'm discombobulated, man

[Chorus]
Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I comin' or goin'? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no
So, baby, please, take off your clothes
(No!) Yes! (No!) Yes! (No!) No! (Yes!) Oh! (Oh!)

[Verse 3]
I'm at my best when I'm at my worst
And for that I'm blessed, so every time I rap I curse
And that's why press, I usually get attacked by first
They're at my neck like motherfucking vampires
So critics si-day I si-day the same shi-dit, I'm always degrading, little bi-ditch
Well, fi-duck 'em, they can si-duck my di-dick when I'm taking a shi-dit
Mid-y middle fid-inger is ex-tid-ended now, should I tell 'em where to put it?
I'm si-do fed up with it, they ask me dumb shi-dit
So I act like I'm on a kayak with my back to Niagara
No life jacket, man, I had like six psychiatrists, scientists
Misdiagnose me with plaque psoriasis 'cause I asked 'em, "Why is it
My eye itches?" so they gave me some diet tips
And Viagra with side effects, I might end up growing spiderwebs
In my head and dying a horrifying death, on my final breath
I will tell you, apply your lips to my dick, it's one size that fits
I just took an AIDS test and the doctor said to think positive, what the fuck?

[Chorus]
Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I comin' or goin'? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no
So, baby, please, take off your clothes
(No!) Yes! (No!) Yes! (No!) No! (Yes!) Oh! (Oh!)

[Outro]
Haha, yeah
Dr. Dre
Black Bethoven
S1
2050, haha
We're out

[DJ Drop: DJ Khaled]
You're not gonna believe this
They still tryna put a ceiling on our greatness
So we took the fuckin' ceiling off
What you think they can stop this?
No Ceilings 3, B-Side
They don't want us to give you No Ceilings 3
So we give you No Ceilings 3, B-Side
You can't put a ceiling on our greatness
So we took the fuckin' ceiling off
Lil Wayne, DJ Khaled
No Ceilings 3, B-Side
Another one, 'pon your head

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Five white girls but they not Spice Girls
Just some hot girls who like to snort white girl
I'm in a all black coupe likе Dark Knight, girl
These herе Jimmy Choos, not Off-Whites, girl
Five AKs and they pop, NSYNC
Got five lil' baes and they pop and drink
If it's not bright pink then it's not my drink
These bright white links make your eyesight weak
Runnin' through a bag like YouTube money
New Orleans nigga, got beaucoup money
I voodoo somethin', I wish you would do somethin'
Milkin' this shit like the Yoo-Hoo bunny
Got the private plane lit and the Bluetooth runnin'
Tunechi gon' spit like a new tooth comin'
Everybody 5 like the FUBU company
Whole bunch of zeros like a new bag of Funyuns
Tunechi got shottas like Buju Banton
Bullets that'll shoot through mountains
Talkin' that shit and I Doo Doo Brown 'em
I punish these boys, I ground 'em
Yeah, and these funny ass boys, I clowned 'em
I'm laughin' so hard, laugh louder
Yeah, Young Money so raw, no condom
No teeth, just jaws, just tonsils
Fuck everything that they say about me
I done fucked every bad bitch that stay on South Beach
Money talk, mine just gave a nice speech
Just laid a bitch down like Laila Ali
Sittin' in the throne, tryna stay in my seat
It cost to be the boss, bitch payin' my fee
Only smoke blunts, give the J to wifey
Every now and then, I might hit the J like Kyrie
The ones that hate me the most look just like me
You tatted up and say that they GOATs, just like me
If I inspired you, that's so inspirin'
That Nina work for me, that ho can get fired
Golf Wang Converse, I'm Lil Tyler
Might skate in 'em, might not even rock 'em
Bad bitch, nice top, nice bottom
Fuck her with my chains on, she melt the ice out 'em
Superstar shit, smellin' like roses
Superstar dick, spread it like COVID
Flag red as fuck but I'm golden
Casket lit, was up and I closed it
Opp dead, this Hell and I'm Satan
Thousand bullet shells, yeah I'm blatant
No Ceilings, she's stargazin'
Dead presidents, reincarnated
Tyler Herro, workin' on my jumper
I need a shero, fuckin' Wonder Woman
No Ceilings, third times a charm
Nigga, I don't fuck with you like Big Sean

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Fuck what's on your tomb, it's carved in stone
Just like statues of me when I'm gone
Artists, yeah, artillery get drawn
Boy I goes in like outside was a storm
Upgraded, this ain't even my final form
Can't say you ain't been warned, you ain't on what I've been on
I live and breathe and die by this lifestyle shit
It just don't sit on my charm
Take my kindness for weakness then you not strong
Whole city remind me when I'm gone
When I was down bad, I didn't complain
I was at the bottom right where I belong
If you don't climb to the top, you're not as strong
Weezy, that's my twin but we both one of one
I can teach you how to get it one on one
When you ball like this, ho it's not a game
But I'm goin' insane all '21
Bitch think we dated off a one-and-done
And the human race, if it's not a race
It's a quest, a journey, but I'm fuckin' facin'
All the problems that I keep on runnin' from
Got a hitlist, checklist, to-do list, guest list
Super bad bitch list, I don't need a wish list
I'm already gifted, I'm done giving forgiveness
The ones that hate me the most ain't nothin' like me
I could never hate nobody I ain't met or seen
Bluegrass girl, ever since I cut her down
She been havin' wetter dreams, drop the mic, let her sing
I've been ready for the war and whatever that'll bring
From where niggas don't engage and they still let it ring (Brr)
Got back up with me and we movin' in sync
Got killer instincts but I spit that vaccine
I'm only hittin' raw if I hit a couple times
Already with the rubber and the shit didn't stink
Had a chain, gave my brothers, we forever in a link
Gonna roll on the world, let's travel
Well you gotta pay a toll, hmm-hmm, yeah, whatever that means
Weezy said, "Kill 'em man, fuck all that booty shit"
I’m on that brutal shit
When I say next year is our year, ho, watch what we do to it
Ten plus in and I can't let go
Just like my girl doin' stupid shit
This a lot of y'all that owe me a check, respect and publishing
Yeah, a whole slew and shit
I'm in euphoria with a young thing and she poppin' like Rue and shit
Me and Weezy beat the beat like we Ken and Ryu and shit
I used to hesitate, took my heart
Told my head, "Lil bitch quit playin' and do this shit"
When you on like this
Every bad bitch come around with ass and titties
Need that double R when you go rags to riches
Need some R&R but now we back to bid'ness, lil' bitch
Yeah, lil' fuckin' bitch

[DJ Drop: DJ Khaled]
No Ceilings 3, B-Side
Another one

Read out the warning
See how the river flows
Be ready to sail
On Judgment Day

[Pre-Chorus]
Who knows where God is
Paging through the book of life
Rememberin' crosses every day

[Chorus]
Goodbye Christians on the shore
Goodbye Christians on the shore

[Verse 2]
He'll take a little bird
He'll have the last word
And we'll stand and cheer
When he flies away

[Pre-Chorus]
Who knows where God is
Paging through the book of life
Rememberin' crosses evеry day

[Chorus]
Goodbye Christians on the shore
Goodbyе Christians on the shore

[Chorus]
Goodbye Christians on the shore
Goodbye Christians on the shore

Got you addicted, you're feelin' your feelin
White lines on the table, you name it, you name it

Yeah, I love the attention you're givin' me, givin' me
Don't get attached to the feelin' you feelin'

[Snippet Lyrics]

Be wary of others
The ones closest to you (Over)
The poison they feed you
And the voodoo that they do
But in rebellion, there's a sparkle of truth
Don't just stand there
Do what you got to do

[Chorus]
You'll find it in rebellion
You'll finally start breathing
They're not believing what they're seeing
'Cause you're rebellion

You'll find it so compelling
With everyone yelling
'Cause your soul you're not selling
'Cause you're rebellion
Bе wary of others
The ones closеst to you (Over)

[Verse 1: Dijon]
I saw a stranger
He was wiry
He was handsome
He was handsome and he was talking in his sleep
He's looking out for me
What a love

[Verse 2: Sachi]
I saw a stranger
And he saw me
He was handsome
He was dancin' and he
Swept me off my feet
When he grabbed ahold of me
And the mornin' set us free

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, how are you, stranger? And
How have you been? You said
"Three Hail Marys full
To wash away my sin"

[Chorus]
But baby, I’m guilty
Silver-barrel spinnin'
Gold-teeth shinin'
Guilty
And it’s hard to let you in
And I don’t know how

[Verse 3: Dan Reeder]
She was a stranger
On the 47 line
I looked into her big room
And she looked into mine
It was like wе were the samе
It was like we were the same person

[Verse 4: Tobias Jesso Jr.]
I got a stranger
I’m ashamed of
He keeps coming out
He keeps coming out
Every time I drink
Gets angry (He gets angry and I)
Starts cryin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, how are you, stranger? And
How have you been? You said
"Three Hail Marys full
To wash away my sin"

[Chorus]
But baby, I’m guilty
Silver-barrel spinnin'
Gold-teeth shinin'
Guilty
And it’s hard to let you in
And I don’t know how

[Verse 5: John C. Reilly]
I saw a stranger
Pass me on the street
Her eyes were so like yours
And it took me there
Completely unprepared
When I kissed you on the stairs

[Verse 6: Becky and the Birds]
Oh, stranger
She is right here
She’s watching me
She’s watching me like
"Baby, go ahead, turn up"
She really fucked it up this time
But I know you needed friends so it’s alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, how are you, stranger? And
How have you been? You said
"Three Hail Marys full
To wash away my sin"

[Chorus]
But baby, I’m guilty
Silver-barrel spinnin'
Gold-teeth shinin'
Guilty
And it’s hard to let you in
And I don’t know how
Lyrics from snippets

[Intro: The Kid LAROI]
Going 'til I'm A-Team, A-Team (Kid)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse: The Kid LAROI & Seezyn]
Shawty wanna join the A-Team, A-Team
Say she goin' 'til I'm A-Team, A-Team
Oh, this life is a great thing
But only if you have money, fame, in that case, yeah
Shawty wanna join the A-Team, A-Team
Say she goin' 'til I'm A-Team, A-Team
Oh, this life is a great thing
But only if you have money, fame, in that case, yeah

[...]
Shawty in my DM's, she cannot wait 'til I'm eighteen
Oh, this life is a great thing, yeah
But only if you have money, fame, in that case, yeah (Ooh, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Seezyn]
Say she like my melodies, yeah
I'm killin' for your like of mere felonies, oh (Killin' for your)
Ooh, be scared of me (Don't you)
'Cause...

[Verse 1]
What would you do if I told you
You made me crazy
To see your pretty pics on Sunset Boulevard?
And it makes me lazy
So I smoke cigarettes
Just to understand the smog

[Pre-Chorus]
I love you lots like polka dots
You're killing me more
Than coffee pots and Insta' thots
With every drop I pour
And if I had to do it all again
I would because, babe, in the end
It brought me here to you

[Chorus]
I left Calabasas, escaped all the ashes, ran into the dark
And it made me wild, wild, wild at heart
The cameras have flashes, they cause the car crashes
But I'm not a star
If you love me, you'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart
If they love me, they'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart

[Verse 2]
What would you do if I wouldn't sing for them no more?
Like if you heard I was out in the bars drinkin' Jack and Coke
Going crazy for anyone who would listen to my stories, babe
Time after time, I think about leaving
But you know that I never do just 'cause you keep me believin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I love you lots, despite the odds
You're killing me, John
And all these thoughts brought us apart
And that's okay, too
'Cause even in the worst of times
You saw the best of me
And that's why I stay here with you

[Chorus]
I left Calabasas, escaped all the ashes, ran into the dark
And it made me wild, wild, wild at heart
The cameras have flashes, they cause the car crashes
But I'm not a star
If you love me, you'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart
If you love me, you'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart

[Outro]
'Cause, baby, I'm wild at heart
If you love me, you'll love me
'Cause I'm wild at heart
Baby, I'm wild, wild at heart
If they love me, they'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart
If they love me, they'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart

[Verse 1: Zella Day]
I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shoppin' today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from their school
I was standin' on a noisy corner
Waitin' for the walkin' green
Across the street, he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet for free

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Now me, I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black Limousine and two gentlemen
Who escort me through these halls
And I'll play if you've got the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one-man band by thе quick lunch stand
He's been playin' real good for free

[Verse 3: Weyes Blood]
Nobody stopped to hеar him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never been on the TV
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain as the signal changed
He was playin' real good for free
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
... weekend
I'm the best 

[?] we won't be friends
Think I got my mind, I'm from the deep end
Shawty got me fucked up, got me tweakin'
I be out my mind sometimes

[Verse 1]
"It's dark, but just a game"
That's what he would say to me
The faces aren't the same, but their stories all end tragically
(Sweet or whatever, baby)
And that's the price of fame
A tale as old as time you'd be (Sweet or whatever, baby)
A pretty little fool to think exceptions to the rule
Just walk around like you and me, this way
But life is sweet or whatever, baby
You gotta take them for what they got
And while the whole world is crazy
We're getting high in the parking lot

[Chorus]
Wе keep changing all the time
The bеst ones lost their minds
So I'm not gonna change
I'll stay the same
No rose left on the vines
Don't even want what's mine
Much less the fame
It's dark, but just a game
It's dark, but just a game

[Verse 2]
It's dark, but just a game
So play it like a symphony
You know our love's the same, they'll both go down in infamy
I was a pretty little thing and God, I loved to sing
But nothing came from either one but pain (But fuck it)
Life is sweet or whatever, baby
Don't ever think it's not
While the whole world is crazy
We're making out in the parking lot

[Chorus]
We keep changing all the time
The best ones lost their minds
So I'm not gonna change
I'll stay the same
No rose left on the vines
Don't even want what's mine
Much less the fame
It's dark, but just a game
We keep changing all the time
The best ones lost their minds
So I'm not gonna change
I'll stay the same
No rose left on the vines
Don't even want what's mine
Much less the fame
It's dark, but just a game
It's dark, but just a game
It's dark, but just—

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
My mama said I didn’t come into this world with tears
Instead, I welcomed her with open eyes and open ears
Became the glue to a few things that couldn’t be repaired
We saw our future in each other, blending hope and fear
Some things you don’t get to decide, it’s just a fate you share
I used to try to hold the weight that she would need to bear
Watched uncles going on vacation for a couple years
When thеy came back they needed clothеs and had no souvenirs
I pick up the phone, they’re calling us from correction
But nothing is wrong, it’s filling my heart with questions
My mama is home, I’m following her expressions
A drop in her tone, some things that she had to mention
I nodded, I listened, she had all of my attention
"When you on your own, there gonna be some directions
I need you to follow and never make an exception"
I nodded; she held me and wished I would be protected

[Chorus: Joba, Zuri Marley & Christian Alexander]
You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it's hard to see
It's hard to be
You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it's hard to see
It's hard to be with you

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
On my sucker-free shit since I was a fetus
Pullin’ up at the doc in a Mazda 626
Bet my dad was trippin’ bad, hit the gas like car-chase
Light blue in the back, mama gettin' labor pains
Dropped my sister at the Bulls' like house was twenty-three
Sweat dripping down my face like river runnin’ free
Dark morning with the fog pourin’ in and out the trees
Every movement through they eyes seem to zoom at lightspeed
Before me, she lost one, stillborn tragedy
Grittin’ the teeth down to the root, pain like a cavity
Holdin' hands like they glued, radio channel on news
Valentines with a "X" up on the calendar
They knew I would be a fuckin’ baller like them posters on the wall
A little stain could be the beauty in it all
Amidst all the trouble, most your luck was rubbin’ off
Stickin’ to you like moss—you my Kate, you my rock
Forever

[Chorus: Joba, Zuri Marley & Christian Alexander]
You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it's hard to see
It's hard to be
You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it’s hard to see
It's hard to be with you

[Bridge: Joba]
Here I go, I'm gonna spread my wings
All grown up, let go and look at me
You'll always be (You'll always be)
A part of me (A part of me)
Here I go, I'm gonna spread my wings
All grown up, let go and look at me
You'll always be (You'll always be)
A part of me (A part of me)
That's why

[Outro: Joba]
A part of me, a part of me, a part of me, a part of me
A part of me, a part of me, a part of me, a part of me
That's why

[Intro]
Put some Actavis on layaway
Too much cash, ain't no more table space, yeah
I've been practicing my fade away, I'm shootin'
I'm an assassin, don't get JFK'd, shoot him (Bap!)

[Chorus]
Put some Actavis on layaway, yeah
Too much cash, ain't no more table space, yeah

I'm faded off this Actavis, just call it faderade, okay, okay

[Post-Chorus]
My lil' plastic bitch wanna lay all day, bitch, you fake
Fuck that nasty bitch then fade away, hit the J
Tell that natural bitch to stay that way, bitch, you great
Tell that dancer bitch to pay her way, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I sip some Ac' and go way away
I take a nap and I wake and bake
I be so litty, I radiate
She said, "Don't you go breaking my achy-break"
I don't fuck with niggas no way, no way
Stay away, far away or the Tommy spray
Chef with the Draco, I'm Bobby Flay
Blood on my apron, my pots and plates
Throw your ass in the grave like a microwave
The oven, the basement, the fireplace
Throw my flag in the air, no United States
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You might just swallow a tidal wave
And you might just swallow my mayonnaise
I'm mixing this codeine all kind of ways
Lit like Johnny Blaze

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know that roses are red, I know that hundreds are blue
I like my presidents dead, buried somewhere in my room
And all your Victoria red, and I like that color on you
You look like blood money, I'm a vampire, coming for you

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, put some Actavis on layaway
Yeah, yeah, too much cash, ain't no more table space
I've been practicing my fade away
Faded off this Actavis, just call it faderade, okay, okay

[Verse 2]
Too much coke, too many razorblades, hold up, wait
Snorting white way after Labor Day, yeah, yeah
Like our last day is a day away, yeah, yeah
I’d rather spend the night than save the day
I put some Actavis on layaway
I got this rachet pointin' at your fuckin' database
Stay in place, all of this ammo like the navy base
'Cause day-to-day, me and them bluefaces be face-to-face
Ball like Macy Gray, like Macy Gray, like Macy Gray
Bought my place a place, my safe a safe, my bae a bae
I smoke L.A. all day, I pop a Addy, stay awake
I'm with gorillas that'd kill you for some Bathing Apes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She know that roses are red, I know that hundreds are blue
I like my presidents dead, buried somewhere in my room
All your Victoria red, and I like that color on you
You look like blood money, this vampire suckin' his tooth, ooh

[Chorus]
Put some Actavis on layaway, yeah, yeah
Too much cash, ain't no more table space, yeah, yeah
I've been practicing my fade away, I'm shootin'
I'm an assassin don't get JFK'd, okay, okay

[Post-Chorus]
My lil' plastic bitch wanna lay all day, bitch, you fake
Fuck that nasty bitch then fade away, hit the J
Tell that natural bitch she tailor-made, bitch, you great
Tell that dancer bitch to pay her way, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I sip some Ac' and go way away
I take a nap and I wake and bake (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I be so litty, I radiate
She said, "Don't you go breaking my achy-break" (Moolah, baby)
I don't fuck with niggas no way, no way
Stay away, far away or the Tommy spray
(I'd rather spend the nights than save the day, yeah, yeah)

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
No Ceilings 3, Lil Wayne

[Chorus]
Go to war with your whole community
Go to war for these hoes, that's lunacy
I done lost all control of the goon in me
Chopper spark like it's electrocuting me
Pop a bar, sip some barre, smoke some Buddah weed
Pop it off, we can start the buffoonery
Only eat what I kill and watch who I eat
Normally pay for my meal, I'll kill you for free
No Ceilings 3

[Verse]
Tired of these strippers, I'm going at nurses
She write me prescriptions, she light up medicinal
The conditional critical, might need a physical
Cold as a hospital, warm and hospitable
Tommy gun extendo long as a tentacle
I got this octopus on me, it swim with you
I bring apocalypse straight to your living room
Tony the Tiger, you flaky, you cereal
My life a movie, get head underwater
We fuck in my pool, that's chlorine in her pussy
Codeine make the drank bubble like a jacuzzi
Codeine make it pink, something like a petunia
My baby whip faster than mine, she splurging
My baby sip glasses of wine, sip yurple
Take off that mask, bae, your smile don't deserve it
Take her to Belgium for waffles and syrup
Might take her to Paris to buy a few Birkins
They tryna put me in the can, she nervous
Bae Ima man I don’t mind I’ll serve it, just pray for your man pray your honor have mercy
She never leave me, she so down
She hang with actresses, don't even go out
I'm changing my status, I'm changing my profile
Changing my addy, I'm changing my doorknobs
I ran through the pack like it's inches on fourth down
Pour me some actavis, I watch it pour down
I drip every day just to stay in my own house
A nigga just trying to stay out the courthouse
Cullinan foggy, I'm smoking the loggy
I'm too high to argue, I'm too rich to bargain
That pussy my target, I look at my target
That pussy get soggy, her legs are wide open
Her tongue out like Jordan, cum on my Rick Owens
And cum on my Jordans and now I'm tiptoeing all up in her garden
And now her clit sore, I'ma rub on it for her
No Ceiling, nigga, hey
All of my hoes give facial, all of my hoes give fellatio
All of my hoes sensational, all of my hoes interracial
All of my hoes into gay shit, all of my hoes is persuasive
All of my hoes get a date, all of my hoes get 'em wasted
I be right there when you wake, and all of my hoes getting raises, Mula
She never leave me, she so down
I hang with capitalists, don't bring the broke 'round
This automatic a dummy a moron
I make it rain, clear it out like Boban
Run through the pack like inches on fourth down
Pour some actavis, I watch it pour down
I put on drip every day, it's a showdown
She blew my ceilings away, that's a blowjob

[Chorus]
I'ma blow up your community
Go to war for these hoes, that's lunacy
I done lost all control of the goon in me
Chopper spark like it's electrocuting me
Pop a bar, sip some barre, smoke some Buddah weed
Pop it off, we can start the buffoonery
Only eat what I kill and watch who I eat
Normally pay for my meal, I'll kill you for free
No Ceilings 3

One time for Cory Gunz, Lil Twist, Juelz Santana, Tyga
Bless up!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Feel like we popped the best meds in the world, don't it? She want that medicine dick
Bustin' nuts, and she act like a squirrel on it, and my shit ain't never been bit
I get up in that pussy with passionate dick, she can never forget, this that elephant dick
Uh, go ahead, sit on it, I took my thumb out her ass, and had shit on it
I know she feel it all in her arteries, I paint her face like an artist
She smokin' on D like Marlboros, I need me a bitch with a twin like the Charlos
She lick on that tip till the tip is a hollow tip, fuck IG, let's make a porno flick
I like big pussy on somе soprano shit, monkey on this banana clip
Messy lil' clit, wettеst lil’ throat, hold on, hold on real quick
We have sex on the beach, go where nobody knows, we got sand on our feet and white sand on our nose
Two nights ago, came in you twice and more, you say you'd like some more, I know you nice and slow
Ooh, you a angel, swallow the cum and say, "Thank you," I say, "De nada, mi amore"
She wants some Topanga, let me get my dreads out the way, I'm a casket, put the pussy dead in my face
She pull the dick out while I'm sleeping, I'm having wet dreams, she forgot her bikini
Ooh, now she topless, but like Champagne Papi, I start from the bottom, I'm the pussy monster
Might not love her, so when I fuck her, I put both hands on her neck and remind her

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid & Lil Wayne]
Love the way you walk, love the way you talk (Talk)
All the bands on me like a broke gettin' a boss
She'll suck a bag hard but the dick goes soft
She just choked on a dick but a nigga dozed off (Dozed off)
Michael Jackson, how the diamonds dancin'
I'm the boss, wake up, make her buy a phantom
Say he rich forever, so they really can't stand him
Tell her, "Suck the dick with two hands, I'm handsome"
When I pull up, take a bitch, ain't no ransom
He ain't dropped a hit, he ain't got no anthems (Woo)
It's a plain Patek, I won’t rock no ring
She just ran the money up, now they can't stand him
Might take a bitch to my momma spot (Momma spot)
She was a freaky, she licked me like lollipop
All this water on me, know that I keep a mop
All these cars, it's a G comin', flex a lot (No, Baby)
No babies, you better swallow them for me (For me)
On your knees (On your knees)
You had to pay, I got it free (Free)
All these diamonds on me kickin' like Bruce Lee (Yeah)
Rich Forever, Young Money, the movie (Young Money)
With my dawg, ain't no Shaggy and Scooby (Yeah)
New Bugatti, I was ridin' with Tunechi (Rich)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
No babies, you better swallow them for me

[Chorus]
Uh, beauty and the beat
It's pretty ugly what I do to any beat
Amen, Hallelujah, nigga, preach
She wanna lay up but I shoot too many threes
Goddamn

[Verse]
Now, the mula got her speakin'
I've speakin' for myself, I thought of usin' Robin Leach
I just bought Barbie a gift and it's an Uzi, got it pink
Should I teach her how to shoot it? She might take a shot at me
We some killers round this bitch, where it's kill or be killed
Prescription refill, pop a pill and be still
Not for nothin', for the most, we hold a toast at each meal
I can flip a Jae Mill to a fuckin' Meek Mill
Knock on wood, it might answer back when you this real
Fuck your bitch, told her, "Hit me back whеn I clear here”
I could roll a blunt fastеr than your get your ears pierced
I'ma shoot your ass exactly where you get your ears pierced
Never seen a bigger ticket than this, little bitty nigga
New Orleans, burry me up in the middle of it, nigga
I've been peepin', I've been squintin' and I still can't see a limit
Higher than my limitations, and the fuckin' Himalayas
And I'm stuntin on my neighbors
And the blunt as long as cables
There’s some hundreds on the table
That was our paper towels
Left my number for the waitress
She was flirtin', I embraced it
Now I'm fuckin' her and the women I was on a date with
I'm a god among Satans, I'm the doc that lost patience
I went from the judge sentence to a fuckin' fashion statement
Disappear like David Blaine when it come to affidavits
Aphrodisiac, all on your bitch face like aftershave
I never met Captain Save 'Em, Army, better yet, a Navy
Wore a sweater for the ladies
Pockets heavy, set inflated
That Prometh' it got me faded
Tell the chef that I'm the gravy
My bitch pussy hole so deep, feel like I'm steppin' out the grave
And that's the beauty in it

[Chorus]
The beauty in the beat
Steppin' out the pussy, therapeutic for my feet
Amen, Hallelujah, nigga, preach
She wanna lay up, I've been shootin' too many threes
God damn, it's the beauty and the beat
But it get pretty ugly what I do to any beat
Amen, Hallelujah, nigga, preach
And you're the only one that left the funeral in peace, yeah

[Outro]
It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful (It's beautiful)
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful (It's beautiful, it's beautiful)
It's beautiful, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful (It's beautiful)
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful (It's beautiful, it's beautiful)
It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful (Yeah, oh, oh)
It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful (It's beautiful, it's beautiful)
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's beautiful, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hallelujah, nigga, preach, amen (Beautiful, beautiful)

Empty the magazine, all the pages fall
By the time I leave, you done read them all
P-E-R-C, yeah
Percocet got a nigga percolatin', pussy ass, nigga
Perpetrating and impersonating
Bury those cockroaches I'm the exterminator
Make a nigga eat his own words and regurgitate 'em
Make a nigga see his own blood, start urinating
Blood gang, blood, like blood, we be circulatin'
Pow, in the morning, leave ‘em lookin’ like turkey bacon
I'ma keep the chopper shined up, like a turkey, glazed it
Codeine got us lookin' like turtles racing
Purple drank, weed, and heart; I’m a purple racist
I'm with the perfect bitch lookin' for her replacement
With a curvy bitch cummin’ ‘round her curves, I'm racin'
The Cartier watch, it deserve the bracelet
From the School of Hard Knocks, I’m a murder major
My bitch tongue twisted, sperm tornado
Tell you that they lyin'
That they sayin' that they see me
Niggas just blind to the fact, no 3D
Damn, but the diamonds I'm wearing look HD
Panoramic Plasma, big screen
Man on fire, 500 degrees
Lambo' fire, beep-beep
Way too hot, don't bother to reach me
Rest in peace, Mamba and Gigi, facts
Trippy ass nigga, Always trippin' but I never fall
Them bitch ass lil' niggas say they got your back
Your back against the wall
I'm a rich ass lil' nigga, I get bag
After bag, after bag, yeah, I ball
Shots hit the back of his skull
She put his head in her hands, it dissolve
I might just bring her lil' ass in the stall
Break her lil’ ass like the laws
Then take her lil’ ass to my dawgs
Then they treat her ass like a dog
Then they feed her ass to the dogs
That Draco attached to me arm, and that ho long as a baton
Canseco, my bat in my arms
I spray, leave your ass on the lawn, then take all your cash and your coins
That bitch went from Louis Vuitton to DC, DG
From Christian Dior back to BEBE
She be mad at slime 'cause I really got hoes
Bad bitches postin’ all these pictures of me
Lotta hoes on the side, right up under her nose
She say, just don’t put these hoes above me
Vroom-vroom, skrrt, take off, new juice, yeah
Straight sauce, pyoom-pyoom, damn, Egg-nog
Head, arm, leg, leg, arm

[Chorus]

I'm with my slime, treat a toe tag like I treat a trim tac
W-We send you to a different world, please say hi to Sinbad
Now, it's so hard to not bust down the presidential wristband
Got so much platinum on me right now, I look like the tin man
Tunechi a gardener, I'm about to water that bitch implants
You kick it off, I kick your ass, don't piss me off I shit back, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
Sh-She gone be up till like 6, micro-dosing on this dick
I'm micro-managing prescriptions, said tomorrow, I'ma quit
And then tomorrow I forget 'cause it's too hard around this bitch
Need some water, I'ma pop me a blue dolphin, that's for Nip
And I can't go without the sip, bitch, I've been sippin' sincе Lil Flip
Dosing off inside my bitch, so, nigga, I woke up like this
I'm bringing homе the bacon like a pigsty over here, bitch
Pigs fly over here, get shot down and fried over here
Pigs get fed, hogs get slaughtered everyday that's law and order
Stick his head in boiling water
Leave eighteen holes on his corner, now I'm golfing
Rickie Fowler, Arnold Palmer, get my shot off
Come in your church, and Peter pop off

[Chorus]
Come in your church, and Peter pop off
Come where you work, and Peter pop off

Whatever is first, I Peter pop off

Pop a perc, so Peter pop off
Whatever is first, I Peter pop off

[Verse 2]
Faded for real, skating for real, my niggas brazy for real, yeah
Get paid to get killed, get sprayed to get spilled, get shot from your head to your heels, yeah
She head over heals, she taking these pills, they give her the craziest thrills
I'm sedated a lil, but ain't no big deal, still fuck like I'm straight outta jail
The feds is raiding my crib but ain't no big deal, I'm way ahead of the field
These diamonds invaded my grill, got me from ear to ear, smiling like I'm Draymond for real
Go sicko mode, hungry hippo mode
24 carats shining like a glass of Michelob, here's a toast
Here we go, I can not tell if you're really real or not, can't take a loss I can't take a L
I'm famous as hell, I ain't really well, but I'm hanging in there like Patti Labelle
I'm stainless as steel, I'm flawless as fuck, the pain is concealed from all of the drugs
Brr, Hello I'm calling your bluff, here we go

[Pre-Chorus]
Sh-She gone be up till like 6, micro-dosing on this dick
I'm micro-managing prescriptions, said tomorrow, I'ma quit
She gone be up till like 6, micro-dosing on this dick
I'm micro-managing prescriptions, said tomorrow, I'ma quit
And then tomorrow I forget, it-it's too hard around this bitch
Need some water, I'ma pop me a blue dolphin, that's for Nip
And I can't go without the sip, bitch, I've been sippin' since Lil Flip
Dosing off inside my bitch, so, nigga, I woke up like this
Pigs get fed, hogs get slaughtered everyday that's law and order
Stick his head in boiling water
Leave eighteen holes on his corner, now I'm golfing
Rickie Fowler, Arnold Palmer, get my shot off
Come in your church, and Peter pop off

[Chorus]
Come in your church, and Peter pop off
Come where you work, and Peter pop off

Pop a perc, so Peter pop off
Whatever is first, I Peter pop off

Bling, bad lil' bitch is mine, I'ma ice her whole life out

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
I ain't tryna fall in love (No), she ain't tryna fall a victim (No)
Fell asleep off the drugs (Oh woah), woke up and rekindle (Oh, oh)

You fake as your chain, it's bread over fame
I lay on my plane, filet and Lo Mein
I'm wreckin' my brain like wrecked the Mulsannе
I get the McLaren and run a fеw errands
Got a mouth full of karats and I don't eat carrots
Got more Elliantte than Elliantte
Let me find out you've been shoppin' at Jared

No Ceilings 3, Lil Wayne

[Chorus]
I don't know how to play 2K
I don't know how to use Blu-Ray
Fuck a bag, I'ma need a suitcase
I'm dripping like Bobby Boucher bitch
Diamonds in my mouth like toothpaste
Codeine got me with the screw face
Either I'm seeing double or they two-faced
Double D's, these niggas too fake, uh
I keep a burner like Kevin Durant
I keep a burner like Kevin Durant
Kyrie Irving, I aim at your earth, back-back-back, I leave it flat
Brooklyn nets, dressed in all-black, FN all-black, extendo on that
Brooklyn nets, dressed in all-black, FN all-black, extendo on that

[Verse]
I don't know how to play too safe
Bitch, throw it back like a bouquеt
Diamonds in my mouth, no toothache
Weezy Baby coming, no due date
Couplе bank account in the UK
Two choppers, that two Ks
I don't know how to play 2K
Still balling out like Azubuike, damn
I keep a burner like Kevin Durant
Keep a burner 'til it melt my hand
I been strapped since I was twelve and a half
'Cause I got shot when I was twelve and a half
Thank you for life to the medical staff
Rain turn to ice but it melt when it land
Gangster for life and the life after that
Ain't no referee stripes, but yes, I got my flag
Yee, you don't wanna fuck with me
It could get dirty, I got them bloods with me
I got your blood on me, get the detergent
I heard you coming for me, I'm pressing your buttons, my G
You out of service, you don't wanna fuck with me
That Draco my judge for me, here come the verdict
I keep a burner like K do, shoot from long range like Trey do
Dame and Klay too
Reggie Miller and Ray too
Jesus Shuttlesworth, Jesus, I make ‘em pray too
I ball like they ain't got no game too
These boys all just think it's a game too
My shooters shoot at the whole game room
Your shooters like Shaq 'cause they can't shoot
Straps on straps, yep
Big B's, bitch, all caps, yeah
I'm high five, ain't no daps
I drip blood blood, ain't no cramps
These boys sci-fi, ain't no facts
I bleed concrete, ain't no cracks
Pulling that hair trigger back like tracks
Check your bitch ass like Air Max
Boy, I'm high as fuck, I get somebody to come tie you up
It's Tunechi, bitch, like P. Diddy
If you want smoke though, now I'm Puff
Time is up, bombs away
Fuck whatever you tryna say, them words hold no kinda weight
You ain't even got a pound in the safe, but I pound your face
Whole team black attire
Sold dreams, tax the buyer
Machine gun, rapid fire, boom-boombox, amplifier
Tube socks and chancletas, moonrocking Margiela
Sick as fuck, salmonella, I whip it up like Nutella
I got the desert with me, hope you could weather the heat
You sweat 'cause you weak
We hungry, we smelling defeat, and I'm like a chef with the beef, who ready to eat?
I got the FN with me, you don't wanna be F-in with me, definitely
My shooters shoot effortlessly, I'm talking catch-and-release, Steph from the three

[Chorus]
I don't know how to play 2K
I don't know how to use Blu-Ray
Fuck a bag, I'ma need a suitcase
I'm dripping like Bobby Boucher bitch
Diamonds in my mouth like toothpaste
Codeine got me with the screw face
Either I'm seeing double or they two-faced
Double D's, these niggas too fake, uh
I keep a burner like Kevin Durant
I keep a burner like Kevin Durant
Kyrie Irving, I aim at your earth, back-back-back, I leave it flat
Brooklyn nets, dressed in all-black, FN all-black, extendo on that
Brooklyn nets, dressed in all-black, FN all-black, extendo on that

[Outro]

No Ceilings 3, Lil Wayne

[Verse]
She give me head, and I her pick her up, put her legs in the air, fuck her but don't kiss
She ain't tryna have babies right now, so she open her mouth, and she perform abortion
I got Euros and Pesos and Franks, but if she ask for money, that bitch speaking foreign
Overseas acting like it's New Orleans, I be geeking like Swizzy in Harvard
Businessman, I just walked in the conference, busy man, someone warm me a coffee
Trigger man, I just marked me a target, out the mud, finna walk on your carpet
Label played me and made me a monster, Weezy Baby, no Baby, no sponsor
I'ma stand on the scale with a chopper, what that mean? Bitch, I'm weighing my options
She want Lil Dwayne, I fuck her 'til she came, she cum first, she cum second, and, bae, I'm gon' always cum last
I'ma cum all on your ass, got that shit looking like art on your ass
I give her an inch, she gon' take the whole nine, her pussy lips grin, I'ma make them hoes smile
Bust on her titties, her face, and her eyes, I bust a nut to the back of her throat, and it come out her nose like snot
She say "Do I look crazy?" I say "You look exotic"
You finna fuck me all day off the molly, I'm finna fuck you all night off the drink
I was all in that pussy, so you know what happened, you catch an orgasm like I catch a case
Eating that pussy, she squeezing her thighs, I say, "I need some breathing room, can't feel my face"
Peep all the moves I be making when I'm in that pussy, she gotta love when I vibrate
Watching my rubber, I know if it slip off inside of that pussy she gon' try to save it
All these red flags, now that hoe got rosacea, she on that black bottle Bumbu, no chaser
I'm tryna get outta here and go taste it, and give that bitch right back to you outta flavor, No Ceilings
Diamonds on deep freeze, ice cubes like Dr. Dre, Eazy
N.W.A, that New Watch Attitude, got bitches, they ain't got attitudes
I'm missing a whole lot of my screws, but she just want my screwdriver, that's bool with me
Told her don't screw it up if you screw with me, 'cause, bitch, I buss a nut, take my tools then leave, where is my hard head?
Lasagna, linguini, fettuccini, pastrami, panini
I order a hit like I'm ordering food, and I feel like a fork and a spoon
Elephant, I just walked in the room, can't forget how to make 'em remember me
Came in your bitch, told her that's a gift from me, since she all under me like a Christmas tree
Slippery like designers in Fiji, it's so wet up inside her bikini, it’s a water balloon
I'ma bust the balloon, look like I made her cum a monsoon
If it ain't, I just jumped in the pool, she say "Put on your life vest and swim in me"
I said "I'm 'bout to cum", she said, "Gimme me all of this sperm, you bring out the kid in me," gotta be kidding me
Diamonds on bling-bling, ooh, my wrist and my collar, my teeth bling, ooh
My ring finger shining like E.T., ooh, she sinking behind and beneath me
Oh, I started from the bottom like seaweed, oh, mentally, physically, literally
It's a conspiracy, really, 'cause lyrically, y'all can't be serious, seriously
No Ceilings 3, Mula

Lil Wayne, No Ceilings 3

Oh, Young Money, money so old

All these hoes want is to say that they fuck with a GOAT

[Verse]
All of my bitches tote choppers (Yeah)

It was at the House of Versace, me and Kanye was spotted (Oh)
He offered me some wings (Oh)

You know I fuck who she know, give a fuck if she know
I don't give a fuck 'bout these hoes
No ceilings, I ain't put a roof over none of these hoes
I ain’t even start on these hoes
I cum on these hoes, you know I ain't finna cum in these hoes (No)
I don't know what come with these hoes
I fuck every ho that come with these hoes, right in front of these hoes
You be doin' lunch with these hoes
Rollin' up blunts with these hoes, smokin' dubs with this ho
Nigga, I don't need a bunch of these hoes
I need to cover these hoes, I need to play some double-dutch with this rope
I'ma double cup on this ho
I'm over my bitch, layin' under his sofa
She bounce on my dick like a fucking '64
Gave me head like a marshmallow, then she dip low, go DJ
Pajama party on my PJ
I've been in Miami party, this is private
I got the banana clip in this machine gun
Extra machine gun, if this machine break (Brrr)
I'ma keep bussin', you better get lower than Donald be duckin'
You soft as some dough, and I'm hot as an oven
Your homie’s a s'more and your slime is a muffin
And I buss a lil' bitch, 'cause I like it, she love it
That bih gon' get busy in private, in public
I stuck it, I stick it, I strike it, I struck it
She suck it, she lick it, she bite, and I'm punchin'
I smack it up, flip it up, rub it down, whip it
Cookin' the coke, get the fuck out my kitchen
I'm whippin' the white girl, domestic violence
Nosy ass neighbors, stay the fuck out my business
Just business, I chop the boy up like some scissor (Yeah)
It ain't nothin' to get your throat cut like a ribbon (Yeah)
I aim at your nose and I buss when you sniffin'
Your brain's on the hoes and your blood on the bitches, uh
We are not on the same
Bum-bum-bum-bum and we're out of your lane
I'ma come through with so much ice on, lookin' like I don't wanna ever be a Hot Boy again

[Chorus]
Oh, Young Money, money so old
All these motherfuckin' M’s and all these motherfuckin' O's
I can give some to these hoes
But I got that dope dick, and all these hoes want is the dough
All these hoes come as they go (Yeah)
All these hoes want is snow, I'm a hundred below
All these hoes fuckin' for sure (Yeah)
All these hoes want is to say that they fuck with a GOAT

[DJ Drop: DJ Khaled]
You can't put a ceiling on the greatest
So we took the fuckin' ceiling off

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Oh, babe, yeah, huh
Oh, baby, yeah, babe
Ooh, mmm, 3

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She walked in my room, shameless as hell
I'll just sit still and watch you walk around here struttin', babe
Sparks in my room, pain's in the air
Let's pop us a pill, I'll let you know when I feel something, babe

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, tell me not to love these hoes
I'm flexing on my exes, bae
They found out I'm with somebody else
They wanna fist fight, they wanna cat fight
You wanna fuck yourself when I'm on TV
You see tattoos all over my back
Diamonds on the grill, babe
You wanna roll with me, you want some smoke with mе
Wanna get high, open your mind and your nose for mе
I just love it, then I taste it
Make a man say, "Mmm, babe"
Now, turn around, look back at me, can I be your mirror?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She walked on my moon, she played in my hair
I love the sound of those heels, you walkin' 'round here struttin', babe
The walls just might move, the paintings have fell
Got a shout in my ear, it sounded like sweet nothings, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Baby, you're the perfect shape
'Cause, baby, you're the curvy shape
When you walk, that booty twerk, babe
Go, shawty, it's your birthday
Hold up, tell me you gon' lie to the cops
Tell me you gon slide on the opp, opp, opp
But you love me, and I'm a dirty, yeah
You wanna roll with me and play a role for me
Wanna ménage with some thots you don't know for me
Yeah, I just love to kiss your faces
Make a man say, "Mmm, babe"

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, we going hard in my room, yeah, champagne as well
Yeah, bottles on chill, let's toast 'cause I feel bubbly, babe
Lost in taboo, under her spell
She say, "How does it feel?" I say, "Hold up, I'm still cummin', babe"
(No Ceilings)

[Verse 3: Lil Twist]
So, tell me how you think I'm sexy, baby
One chick, hella thick like Alexis Texas, baby
Backseat so presidential got us snorting Ronald Reagan
Then, she whispered in my ear and said, "This pussy is for the taking," okay
Twizzy Baby quick to get these bitches naked
Bumbu, a cup of Aces, got these hoes switching places
I promised to keep a secret, she promised to let me taste it
Her booty big and amazing, she love the way I embraced it
Get the game from Tha Carter, Young Carter bring home the bacon
Still pimpin', I was shot by Cupid, I hope he grazed me
My latest bitch thick as a stallion, but big as Megan
My other bitch cute, and she dangerous, think I don't make it, huh
Five star Bay List, all my hoes A-list
Party in the hills, Robin Thicke on the playlist
Twizzy F. in the air for Ferragamo for the fragrance
She told me eat her pussy, I said, "Make me"

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Like 2 Chainz, nigga

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I'm different, I'm different
I'm different, I'm different
Shit different, lit different
Drip different, sip different
Smoke different, hoes different
My bros different, I'm no different
My whip different, I'm stick shiftin'
I tip different, she quit strippin'
My bitch different, I just slip in
It hit different, I switch position
This dick different, it hit different
Got her walkin' different, she sit different
My money different, my chips different
Big difference, like Miss Winfrey's
I know it cost to be the boss, I paid the difference
Like 2 Chainz, nigga, I'm different

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I've been graveyard shiftin', makin' baseball figures
Goin' Karen in the park 'cause I hate y'all niggas
When the drought go down and the weight go fizzup
I'ma tote A-Rod, no J-Lo, nigga
Got a payroll, nigga, count like Kango, nigga
Shoot like Faygo, nigga, soft as Play-Doh, nigga
I can go anywhere that you can't go
I lay your ass down 'bout Halo
Southside, G-Road and Clayco
Can't forget about Heaven and Harmony
Ain't nobody out there harmin' me
Rock the old Atlanta like the motherfuckin' omni, calmly
I got some weapons like armory, uh
So Help Me God, solemnly, yeah
Follow me, follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me, smellin' like lottery
Lookin' like lottery, came from the Clay like pottery
I got the rage inside of me, I got the gauge on side of me
Just checked my page, I'm proud of me
Folk out the can like potted meat
Stars in my roof, astrology
Teachin' valet the technology
Hustlin', it run through my artery
Probably trappin' and boost the economy, yeah

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, the feds all over me, nigga, and I don't even trap no more
Your bae all over me, nigga, but, dawg, you can have that hoe
My side bitch fuckin' my main bitch, they don't even clash no more
My side bitch fuckin' my main bitch, uh

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I've been talkin' to myself
I told myself, "I gotta get my shit together" (Together)
Man this shit is just like Tetris
Get the bricks together, make 'em fit together (Together)
Got a line on everything
Man, I can give whatever and get this shit whenever (Whenever)
Uh, I can ship this shit wherever
Ten bathrooms, I can shit whenever (Whenever)
Just 'cause you see me with her
That don't mean me and the bitch together (Oh, no)
I've been cheatin' on my bae
And now me and bae'll fuck a bitch together (Oh, oh)
With two horns stickin' out the GOAT head
You know he's just the devil (Oh, oh)
And this shit right here, this shit right here

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
This shit different, lit different
Drip different, sip different
The pack different, the Act' different
My bros different, I'm no different
Got no ceilings, no ceilings
No ceilings, it's missin', it's missin'
In your feelings, you're trippin'
Come up missin', good riddance

[Intro: Jabari Manwa]
I did this all for you (for you)
(I did, I did, I did this all for you)

[Chorus: Jabari Manwa]
I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
They’re oh-so old, be new!
I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
That's old news

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
I wish it didn't end like this
You stopped lovin' me a long time ago, didn't notice
Pardon the waves, couldn't contain how I feel about it
Easy to say I'm to blame, no other way around it
How you say you don't love me like you used to?
Solitude is becoming so unusual
Old news that you rush into everything
That's why I'm stuck here tellin' you, you

[Chorus: Jabari Manwa]
I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
They’re oh-so old, be new!
I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
That's old news

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Say less, rain check, we friends, I guess
I got regrets, hop in Lexus
You don't hear me, but I bought your earrings (What?)
From the PJ's, treat you like an heiress
I ain't trickin', but I got it for your hair and nails (What?)
I always treat 'em too good, and it always fails (I'm winnin')
You an angel, I'm the one that tripped and fell (I’m chillin’)
Can't let go, I missed my own fairytale (I did it)

[Verse 3: Baird]
I'm out my head, I'm in my notebook, I'm feelin' hopeful
I joined The Band in Dylan's tour bus, turn up my vocals
Still makin' faces at your GoPro, like, "Fuck the promo"
I'll do the live show for a one-horse town
The blue-black behind my eyelids of an unheard sound
The words cracked into a silence of a sun gone down
But no regrets, coyote, baby, you can watch me howl
We're just so different, you and I, I guess we both know now
I guess we both know now

[Chorus: Jabari Manwa]
I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
They’re oh-so old, be new!
I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
That's old news

[Verse 4: Joba]
Wish I knew what it meant when I said I loved you (I love you)
Rips in the threads of the net I fell through (Ah)
What I gotta do for you?
Bet my life, paid the price
Almost died, shit was tight (For real)
What a life to lose
Beautiful and tragic, it rang true
Pleasure and pain, both remain (They do)
I was amazed in the maze with you
Said what I meant, meant what I said too
If you only knew...

[Outro]
Tell them keep your faith to the sky
(Keep your faith to the sky)
Tell them keep

[Verse 1]
I'm coverin' Joni and I'm dancin' with Joan
Stevie is callin' on the telephone
Court almost burned down my home
But God, it feels good not to be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
But sometimes, this ranch feels like my only friend
And life doesn't always work out like we planned
We keep it movin', babe

[Chorus]
So we made it back in the middle of the night
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancin' 'til we die
We'll keep walkin' on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die

[Verse 2]
Troubled by my circumstancе
Burdened by the wеight of fame
Clementine's not just a fruit
It's my daughter's chosen name

[Pre-Chorus]
And when all the bars close down tonight
There's one that stays open just for us, alright
We keep dancin', babe

[Chorus]
So we made it back in the middle of the night (We keep dancin', babe)
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright (We keep it movin', babe)
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancin' 'til we die
We'll keep walkin' on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die

[Bridge]
I went down to Woodside
I left Berkeley, out of city, out of mind
Killin' it, talkin' shit, Joan said she was gonna quit
Tearin' it up at the Afro-Caribbean two-step
I left San Francisco
I've been coverin' Joni and I'm dancin' with Joan
It's kinda hard to find love
When you're used to rollin' like a rollin' stone

[Chorus]
So we made it back in the middle of the night (We keep it movin', babe)
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright (We keep dancin', babe)
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancin' 'til we die
We'll keep walkin' on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die

[Verse 1]
I've been wearin' the same damn clothes for three damn days
Lincoln, Nebraska's got me in a haze
The thing about men like you is you got a lot to say
But will you stay?

[Pre-Chorus]
You say you got my name on your tattoo
Opening up doors, pulling out chairs, look at you
You talk to God like I do, I think you know
The same secrets that I do, I'm talkin' 'bout

[Chorus]
Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander, all those who wander
All those who wander are lost
It's just wanderlust

[Verse 2]
The thing about bein' on the road
Is there's too much time to think
About seasons of old
As you pour yourself a drink
'Cause every time I said no
It wasn't quite what I meant
If you know what I mean

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you got my name as your tattoo
Pulling out chairs, opening doors, look at you
You talk to people like I do, I think you know
The same things that I do

[Chorus]
Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander, all those who wander
All those who wander are lost
It's just wanderlust

[Bridge]
Look at me, look at you
Look at what you made me do
Look at me, look at you
Bible on your tattoo
Look at me, look at you
Look at what you made me do
Look at me, look at you

[Chorus]
Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander, all those who wander
All those who wander are lost
It's just wanderlust

[Intro: Joba]
I give, my mom so, —mess
In the same house my dad died in, all alone
Tryin' not to be paranoid, tryin' not— as they're calling it
'Cause every headline is a reminder that the world's fucked
So I'm just tryin' to see the light
In between the clouds
Still love that sunshine

[Verse 1: Joba]
When I look at myself, I see a broken man
Remnants of my pops, put the Glock to his head
Nothing ever go as planned, couldn't make amends
Forcibly pretend I don't give a damn
At a loss, aimless, six feet deep
Suffocatin', can't face it
Can't change it, ain't make it
Master plans by the Maker, I see no savior
Morbid reflection and stainless steel, alcohol and pills
Deadly combinations left with nothin' else to feel
A floral haven, hope it was painless, I see you in the faces
Places and my making, reflections off a broken mirror
Fragments of my fear glarin' back like, "Who's there?"
I can't stand myself, beside myself, I see you there
I know you cared
Felt numb since September when I heard the news
What I'd do to speak one last time
Think I always will be haunted by the image of a bloody backdrop Skull fragments in the ceilin', felt your presence in the room
Heard my mother squealin'
Master of disguises, ash to ash, dust to dust
Voids behind my eyelids, blacking out, bleeding out
Silence louder than a twisted tongue lying
As sick as our secrets
Shadow people and needles fading through a peephole
Bedtime stories from purgatory, I miss you

[Bridge: Joba]
For the record, I can fly
Around the world absorbing light
Something's missing deep inside
The light

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Somethin' changed in Texas, guess I missed the message
Look, I missed my exit, I'm living like a Jetson
I was broke and desperate, leanin' on my best friends
Only shot callers I was around was bartendin'
Ain't no love in this game, mama, this is not tennis
Take your shoes off, we just did the carpets in
I can the take the hatin', I can take the praisin'
It's all noise to me, I'll turn into Satan
Y'all stuck in The Matrix
Red pill, blue pill, all these different faces
All these different cases, shit, y'all done seen me naked
So I'ma wear what I want now and I ain't finna fake it
Thank God I made it, thank God I seen God last summer
I was standing on the bridge, I seen all y'all under me
Know you are struggling, niggas out here juggling
Losin' jobs and losing God, then everything is tumbling
Feel Heaven rumbling, the rapture is coming
I love the attention, I'm a bastard in public
I still struggle with tellin' my mom who I'm in love with
Subtleties in between, way these diamonds gleam
When Thanksgiving come around, I still don't see 'em
When Christmas come around, nigga, I still don't see 'em
Told the world who I was before I got to know Ian
They gave my people money in exchange for their freedom
I would give it all back for a chance to free 'em
Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse]
I'm a mess
God, all these feelings don't make sense
And I'll lie through my teeth with my heart on my sleeve
I'm Miss Teenage Drama Queen
I'm a weirdo with a cause
I'm 11 PM when the lights are off

Ending life I think somehow

Deeply deeply deeply me

He is all night and day

Thank you for Christmas
For every little thank
We stand alone
And thank you a lot
Every child will sing

Wow Kid, this is amazing

[Pre-Chorus]
Forgive me lord, I have sinned
I was scared to face my fears
Now I'm up, watch me win
Accomplish my childhood dreams

I ain't ever comin' back for the itty-bitty chat
I gotta go and get on the screen
They ain't ever saw what I seen
Fast-forward, now I'm chilling with Scheme
How I went from being so normal to every day looking like a movie scene?
I don't know, all I know is it happened quick
And I don't know if my head is mentally fit for it
...
And you've got a record, I ain't just

Remember the nights, I spent on the floor
You can ask Kenny 'cause Kenny's the G.O.A.T

All these bitches that doin' the most
I told my brothers there's no time to talk
'Cause I remember when they used to doubt

[Pre-Chorus]
Forgive me lord, I have sinned
I was scared to face my fears
Now I'm up, watch me win
Accomplish my childhood dreams

[Intro: Erykah Badu]
Too much to see
The world keeps turning
Oh what a day, what a day, what a day

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
Where am I goin'? What have I begun?
What has this become? Fuckin' me over
Shit, I would either, but I'm seein' neither
Shit I don't practice, shit I been preachin'
I can't express how I feel, I'd rather keep it down deeper
And that's why I'm in the deep end, I'm in the deep end

[Pre-Chorus: Erykah Badu]
Oh, on and on, and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
Oh, on and on, and on and on
Goddammit, I'ma sing my song

Oh, oh, no, been holdin' on (All night 'til the break of dawn)

[Verse 2: The Kid LAROI]
And I'll never forget the nights that I almost saw you touch death
Traumatized, the devil in your eyes, but you were God-sent
Feelin' like I don't even know you, thinkin', "What's next?"
You were right by my side, so how this shit go so left?
Dad left, Dub died, that night I saw a thug cry
I felt the whole world stop, fastforward, time flies
It's Christmas time and we don't got a house
Lyin' down on someone's couch, thinkin', "How this shit go south?"

[Pre-Chorus: Erykah Badu]
Oh, on and on, and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
Oh, on and on, and on and on
Goddammit, I'ma sing my song

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI & Erykah Badu]
Oh, oh, no, been holdin' on (My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone)
Oh, oh, no, been holdin' on (

[?])
Oh, oh, no, been holdin' on (All night 'til the break of dawn)

[Spoken Intro]
It's jingleball, there’s Santa hats everywhere, you're never too far away from one and you know I was wondering if maybe you wanted me to sing a song that I wrote?

[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin’ is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin’ is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin’ the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein’ in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah

[Bridge]
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we’re there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"

[Outro]
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Where every wish comes true
I love you

[Verse]
You say you're down for whatever but
You change your mind like the days and the weather, uh
You say I changed, but I changed for the better, uh
Your bitch a fan with your name all in memory, in memory of, yeah
Since you've been gone, I had left my home, been all alone lately
Might lose control, blow up your phone, it's over for me

[Chorus]
Yeah, and I'll admit it, it's really not the same no more
Yeah, and I don't get it, but I just play the games for you
Yeah, and I regret it, like еverything we evеr did
Fightin' on a

Nasty, nasty, nasty, ayy

Turn up your gratitude, turn down your attitude
I love my pussy, that means I got cattitude
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you

Ayy, go stupid, go dumb

[Verse 2]
You’re just mad cause your hair is flat, your record’s wack and you seem to attract
You’re just mad cause you’re fake as fuck, with your big old titties and a big old butt
I hope you know I like being a slut, and when you said I got a Justin Bieber cut
I know I’m 100 and I know I’m fresh, here’s a mint, use it on your breath

[Refrain]
'Cause I'm so nasty, nasty, nasty
Nasty

[Verse 3]
I'ma keep working from dawn to dusk
So I can keep buying cars off Elon Musk
The matte black spinners, now that's a must
But I want the whole pie, so leave the crust
I'm the moon, I'm the stars, I'm a Maserati
I love you, Nicki, but I listen to Cardi
I got a new song on the radio, and it goes five
(Four, three, two, one)
That's right, it's a number one
And I can't take you with me as a carry on
I already got my luggage, it's Margiela
And for my 16th birthday, I got Deréon
From the house of the queen
Queen, queen, that's what you can call me
Queen, I'ma have you run to your mommy
Queen, I'm the life of the party
Don't worry 'bout me, go and get yourself a hobby

[Refrain]
Ayy, I'm so motherfucking nasty
I'm so nasty, I'm so nasty

[Chorus]
Turn up your gratitude, turn down your attitude
I love my pussy, that means I got cattitude
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you

[Refrain]
I'm so nasty, I'm so nasty

[Chorus]
Turn up your gratitude, turn down your attitude
I love my pussy, that means I got cattitude
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you

[Bridge]
Back up, you're squashing my charisma
Why I gotta be so motherfucking extra?
Back up, you're squashing my charisma
Why I gotta be so motherfucking extra?

[Outro]
I'm so nasty, nasty
I'm so nasty, I'm so motherfucking nasty

[Chorus]
Sorry in advance, I don't give a fuck about love, I want bands

Throw it up, run it up, I know I'm gon' make it back
They think I'm young and I'm dumb, so they tryna put it past

[Verse]
Oh, she wildin'

Best friend already hit it, she got mileage
Ooh, I can feel it in the air, Phil Collins

I don't do no favors, talk to you later
I don't wanna tell you again

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on
Our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yule-tide gay
From now on
Our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon thе highest bough
And have yourself a mеrry little Christmas now
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithfull friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years
We all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Hey, this is Maggie Rogers. If you're listening to this you probably knew that already. Um, what you're about to hear is a record that I've put together called Notes from the Archive: Recordings 2011-2016.

I started writing songs as a way to process and document my life. A few years later, music production became a way for me to hear those songs alive and in the world in full form in the world. This record is about looking back on those ten years of work. It's about looking to the future by honoring the past. So, in that spirit I've left all the recordings in their original forms. They are so sturdy and real to me now as when I wrote them when I was 16, 18, 20, and so much of this record is about the process. It's about honoring the time it takes to come to a full form, about artistic development and how important and sacred that process is. And I wanted to give you the chance to hear me grow and hear me make mistakes, hear me change because all of those pieces are really beautiful parts of my present, and I don't feel complete without them in the world. And it's really exciting to get to share them

There are four different sections in this record starting with my 2016 shoegaze-y Lower East Side rock band and moving to my 2014 independent record, Blood Ballet, my first band, Del Water Gap, and my debut record, The Echo released in 2012 just as I was finishing high school. The record is in reverse chronological order because it's how I remember it. You know, you tell the story from the beginning, but it's sort of impossible to tell where the story actually starts. You know, does it start with my first harp lesson when I was six and begged my parents for lessons? Does it start when I'm thirteen and I'm in high school and I have so many hormones I don't know what to do with them and I start writing them into songs? It's impossible to say, but when I look back on this time I think of it back to front, and I also like the idea that you can hear me get younger. I think that that's hilarious. Like, I like that there's some weird Benjamin Button timeline to the whole thing. It just makes me laugh, and I also think leaving you with those earliest recordings makes the future so much sweeter
So, the first four songs that's you're gonna hear are from quote unquote "The Rock EP" which are a series of songs that I made in 2016 right when I was graduating from college in my last semester. I was working of two different projects. One was an EP that would become my EP that came out in January of 2017 called Now That the Light Is Fading that had "Alaska" on it, and that was me really experimenting and thinking about electronic music. And at the same time I was playing guitar in a band. 

[laughs] The band was called Maggie Rogers because I was terrified of coming up with a band name, um, but I was really interested in playing guitar-based music and, I think, trying to find a way to have fun with music and maybe not take it so seriously. I was really starting to get interested in the live experience. And when I say "not take it so seriously" what I mean is that music has always been this steady, sturdy autobiographical process for me. So, I was looking for a way to just let it be light

I was living on 12th Street between A and B in the East Village in a five floor walk-up with a little cat named Cat Stevens and my best friend, Mary Whites who was my classmate and still a songwriter, and I was playing shows at really classic downtown venues like Pianos or Baby's Alright in Brooklyn, and I was having so much fun playing these songs. I remember how good it felt to play guitar on stage. I would wear my, like, black boots, my white jeans. I had this denim shirt, I had this black baseball cap I was wearing all the time

You know, I got my first taste of what it felt like to be in a band in 2013, 2012 when I moved to New York City, but it had been awhile since I had really been able to experience that, and so much of this EP and these four songs was really me stepping up to the plate for the first time as a bandleader, as a producer, as a songwriter. I think it was the first sort of notion of what was to come

All these songs I wrote alone except for "Celadon & Gold" which I wrote with my friend Nick Das. You might recognize his name. He was a co-writer on "On + Off," um, and I heard him just, like, playing this guitar riff one day, and I asked him if I could write a song to the chords he was playing and that he would show me what he was playing. But the rest of them are sort of just me sitting in my bedroom thinking about my life

At the time I had been dating someone for the past couple years who I was really in love with and we were starting to think of breaking up after college and what our life would look like if he would move to LA, if I would because that was sort of the migration that a lot of our friends were taking. You can hear that on "Together" and "Celadon & Gold."

Um, I was processing grief. I had a friend die early in college, my, like, first love really and was sort of just coming around to being able to process what that meant in my life, and you hear that on "One More Afternoon."

And in "Steady Now," you know, the period directly preceding this I had had a really long period of writer's block and a lot of it had to do with developing. I was changing faster than I could keep up with, and I didn't know what I wanted my music to sound like, maybe, which is also evident in the difference between this EP and Now That the Light Is Fading. I mean, they're completely different bodies of music, and "Steady Now" is the first song I wrote as I was re-entering this phase of making things, and it's really just about starting to find my footing as a musician and as an artist again. I was just really interested in this version of music that was a little bit darker and had a little bit more teeth. I mean, in "Steady Now" especially you can hear me sort of just start to understand my vocal range and just sort of opening my mouth and yelling into a guitar for the first time and it felt awesome

This EP was recorded pretty much in one day. I'm playing guitar. You've got Nick Das on guitar. Harry Terrell on drums and Dan Hemerlein on bass. This record was recorded as Oscilloscope Studios in downtown New York which at the time was the Beastie Boys' studio that NYU had rented out for senior production students to use which was sick. 

[Chuckles] I produced them, and we recorded this entire EP live on the floor. I overdubbed vocals afterwards and a friend of mine mixed it. There four songs have never been released before, never been heard. They've just been sitting in a Dropbox and actually I almost tried to put them out right as I was graduating before "Alaska" came out. 

[Laughs]

At the time, I was just becoming friends with Sharon Van Etten and she had heard these songs, and I, I said to her, "Sharon, I'm thinking of maybe putting out this record. Just like putting it on Bandcamp or something."

And she was like, "Don't do that."

I was like, "Why?" 

[Laughs]
She said, "If you love these songs give them a chance to live in the world in full form," and so I held on to them and I'm so happy that they are finally out in the world
So, the next six you're gonna hear are from a record called Blood Ballet. It was my second record. I came out in July of 2014, and these songs were all written all in the time since moving to New York in late 2012. So I was 18, 19, 20 when all of this was being written, being recorded, being produced

It is called Blood Ballet because of the song "Blood Ballet," and the idea of a blood ballet is a beautiful mess. It's about the sort of grace that destruction can sometimes take, and for me personally I was completely unravelling because I think that's kind of what happens at that age. I have lived in rural Maryland my entire life, and I was 18 years old and I moved to New York City. And everything I believed to be true was completely blown open and changed. I started seeing four, five, six show a week. You know, before it would take me two hours plus to get to see a show and it was like the most sacred thing in the entire world and suddenly I had access to this thing I had just dreamt about forever. And I think you can hear that too in this record. I'm sort of experimenting with a couple different styles. You can hear me really in true folk mode on songs like "James." Um, shout out to my high school boyfriend James. Um, you can hear me really starting to learn my craft as a songwriter on songs like "Blood Ballet." You know, I was also on this record removing from banjo where I started in 2011, 2012 and into electric guitar and that spectrum is filled in on songs like "Resonant Body" or "Little Joys." Um, I was really starting to play around with space in production on songs like "Symmetry." My brain was starting to expand

It's important to note that both The Echo, my first record, and Blood Ballet, my second record, lived on streaming services. These songs were out in the world. They were on Spotify. They were on Bandcamp where they still live. They came out as I was making them, but when I was graduating from college I had a double major in Music Production and in English, and I was working as a journalist and I thought I was going to be applying for jobs as a music journalist and I thought that if I had music out on streaming services it could hurt my credentials and hurt my objectivity for an editor's point of view. So, I went onto CD Baby or whatever the site was that I had independently distributed them through and I applied for all the songs to come down

Some background on independent distributors is this music doesn't come down immediately. There is a sort of lag time where they process your request and eventually the music will come off the internet. Two days after I applied for this music to come down the video of me and Pharrell Williams at NYU went viral and suddenly I had five songs in the Viral Top 50 from these old records and then they just went inactive 

[laughs] and they just completely disappeared off the internet. So, I was on the phone with this company being like, "You have to get them back! Like, I can't do it." And it didn't work and so I sort of out of nowhere was given this blank slate. I was gonna get this shot at a career in music that I had always wanted, but it sort of looked different that I thought
So, going back a few years more, in 2012 I moved to New York City and became really good friends, and later musical collaborators, with a friend of mine named Holden. Holden Jaffe and I met growing up. I went to an all-girls camp in Maine, and he went to the brother camp and we used to sail against each other on Sundays and we recognized each other when we went to college because we were in thе same, like, 30 person group in our music program at NYU. So wе walked in and we were both sort of just like, "How do I know you?" and we got to talking and realized we had a lot of similar taste in music and we had both put out collections of songs in high school and were fans of each other

We decided to start a band, and we were a duo, but we had this amazing band. Will Evans on bass. Charlie Shanker on drums. From 2012 to 2013 we must've played fifteen shows in the span of five or six months which in New York now I know is not a good thing to do because you blow your ability to draw fans if you wear out your friends. 

[Laughs] But it was just fun. It was the first time i ever felt cool in my life and it was the first time I really felt permission to dream. You know, being in a band is about being part of something bigger than yourself and getting to feel like your creative sensibility is contributing to a greater whole

You know, we used to run rehearsal in the downstairs laundry room in the NYU dorm and rehearsal would be like as long as we could play until we got kicked out. Some days it would be, like, in Holden's dorm room. I remember once Charlie Shanker like trying to play drums while sitting on a twin bed so he was like bouncing every time and we had a horn section at the time and we had the entire horn section on the opposing twin bed and I was sitting on the desk playing banjo and like it was just fun

And this song "New Song" it's literally never gotten a title. It's always been "New Song." Even as Holden and I were speaking about putting this song out it was still in out brain called the "New Song." Um, this was the last song we wrote together. We both felt so powerfully about it. Every time I'd see him in the years afterwards we would both sort of be like, "Remember that one song?"

We were freshmen in college at the time. We were both 18. It was recorded by a group of seniors who needed a, like, freshmen band for their, like, senior engineering project. Somehow someone kept the audio and we had Andrew Sarlow mix it. It was the only one out of all of these songs that we actually had stems for, was able to get a proper mix. Um, and the song was played once at, like, the year-end concert at this venue called DROM. It was not great

Um, you know, Holden and I are still such good friends and fans of each other's work. He decided to keep the name Del Water Gap and still uses it today and is making some of my favorite music that exists. Uh, we decided at the end of this freshman year that we both were really powerful solo artists and as much as we loved being in a band that we had a lot more to discover about what our individual artistic lives looked like
This is going to be the last section of this record. So, these are the earliest songs that I have recorded or put out in the world in any way, and they're from my 2012 debut called The Echo. The Echo came out in May of 2012 right as I was graduating from high school. So, I was a fresh eighteen. Um, but all of the songs were written, recorded, and produced from sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, and my band was me on banjo and vocals and auxiliary percussion and unfortunately some mini instruments and Courtney Chang on violin, Katherine Haroldson on cello, bеcause those werе my friends and those were the instruments they played

I had this little makeshift studio at the school in a teacher's office that the school had let me set up and I would go everyday after school. You know, it was the last time I can remember having a really consistent creative process. I showed up everyday and I worked on this record and I had such a sense of purpose and working on this record was really an essential part of me forming my identity at that time. I was the music kid

You know, I started playing banjo because of gender largely. There were so many boys that played guitar, and I– the most important thing was getting to play music and I realized really quickly that if I learned how to sing harmony and play banjo that I would always get to play and I think later I came to resent that a little bit because I felt relegated to be the like quote unquote "banjo girl."

You know, I was always sort of in a support role which is funny sort of. Now I'm full circle. I know my own power as a solo artist, but I also, like, love singing harmony more than anything in the whole world. So, I think I've come to really appreciate and embrace all the sides of it but I came to music production then also in the same way

You know, I had all these grand ideas about how I wanted these songs to sound, but I was told so many times that my music was too girly. I couldn't get people to play my music, and so I just learned how to program and suddenly all these ideas I was hearing in my head I was able to hear back to me and it completely blew my world open

It's crazy for me listening back to these songs because I think my whole life I have been trying to get back to the level of focus and confidence that I had when I was this age. There's something really special about not knowing anything and thinking you can do everything that I was particularly empowered by

Um, I mean, this record came out, to me, completely was my first record. In the artwork, in concept for the record, in how I felt as a person, and, you know, there are– there are pieces of this record that I hear and make my skin crawl a little bit like anyone would hearing hearing a version of themselves that's ten years younger. Like, I can hear where I didn't mic something very well or where there's just too much reverb. My taste has changed, but it would be such a disservice to the eighteen-year-old version of myself to allow myself as a twenty-six-year-old to say that these aren't valid. I so truly believe this to be my full record and to be a complete artistic statement at the time that it is so important to get to honor the work in this way
So, yeah, now you've heard everything and it feels amazing 

[laughs] to be up to date. As I'm looking backwards in order to look forward what I'm realizing is it what there all along. You know, I am in so many ways still the artist that I was when I was eighteen, but the difference is I think I'm only just now starting to really believe it and it means that I can't wait to see what I make next because I think for a while I needed to prove it. I needed to prove to myself that I could do this and that I could make it my life. But now there's nothing to prove. The only thing that's left is the music and that is almost the greatest challenge of all because the only person I have to please is myself

Like, this next batch of music, as I'm thinking about making it, like, or as I'm working through the process and hearing parts of these records and these things I've done and how my past is weaving it's way back into my present. I mean, that's the most emotional thing about listening through to all of this music it's just I'm in this place now where every dream I have possibly ever had or said under my breath or even thought was too big to try and dream about I've been able to do. And the real question I'm asking is: Where do I go from here?

You know, with the support of many, many, many people I have been afforded the opportunity to do this with my life and I take that responsibility very seriously. It feels like the greatest gift that anyone has ever given me and it feels like I have really been tasked with the role of feeling everything I possibly can and reporting back. Like, it's– it, like, makes me teary to think about trying to tell that eighteen-year-old girl, like, what my life looks like now, but it makes me so happy. It's absolutely everything I've ever wanted. There is nothing else in my life I have every loved more that doing this thing and the fact that I get to do it everyday still completely blows my mind, and it, like, it brings me more joy and sense of purpose than anything and is the only thing in this time that is so uncertain that makes me feel completely at peace and alive and I– I just I hope I get to do it for the rest of my life

[Intro]
Yes
I want to welcome you all to the 23rd album
Between Da Protests
We gon' have to to rise on this ya'll
But just before we begin
Lemme spit on these cats

[Verse]
Fake rappers I respect none, DJs too
You know my way, we ain't you
5, 4, and three are taken and we ain't two
33 years later, we ain't through
Black lives been mattered yo cause we ain't blue
Selling out the culture is something we don't do
They call me the teacher that be so true
Cause I mastered the element of MCing like CO2
We so new, you know what we been through just to survive
All this debate about the top five, put it aside
Here's the real top five list
It's KRS, Blast Master, KRS-One, The Teacher, and Chris
Rappers going through some type of identity crisis
G-O-D is my image of life 'cause they don't like Chris
My mother is Ahset better known as Isis
I drop on the set like Horus, where the mic is
I'm the difference between what the real and the hype is
What the wrong and the right is
What the darkness and the light is
But rappers want to fantasize about battling me
They sleep and I'm over their whole head like a canopy
I'm chilling in Atlanta sipping Daiquiris
Don't come after me, I rapid fire rap-rap-rapidly
It's a catastrophe you not as fast as me
OG rappers coming after me, they're in back of me
You wanna come after me here's the truth
I'm invading your space like 

[?], let's get loose
You can't hang, I got the noose
When I train on tracks I'm the engine you're the caboose
I'm sipping the Remy Ma while I salute Papoose
I don't battle young rappers that's child abuse
I'm tightening the noose, put hands on you like a masseuse
And De La your soul like I'm Posndous
You'll be calling for a turce while I'm cooking your goose
Got the deuce-deuce for when you chickens come to roost
Man I'm mobile like boost while they're failing
So Imma put 'em down under like these dudes was Australian
Rappers couldn't see me in the 80's or the 90's
Thirty years later they wanna act like they're grimy
Now they wanna find me in the new millenium
But I'm a cannibal, I'll breakfast lunch and dinner them

[Verse 1]
Let the drums rip
Woo
Yeah
Turn my voice up a little bit
I don't deal with silly shit
I am not illiterate
Gun clapper, street rapper this is what you're dealing with
Boom bap, new rap only the real feeling it
Truth I'm revealing it, beef I ain't dealing with
Others put their 

[?] to the beat and make a meal of it
I'm the quiet type, banana clip I'm concealing it
Kick up on you with the banana and start peeling it
Hit the captain and America, no time for shielding it
Their crew got nicked with the fury, I'm real with it
Flow so sick I should be healing it
But instead I'm on the German autobahn wheeling it
You heard these millionaire, now hear a skillionaire
Rich with the skill and the cut, people I drill them there
Yeah savage, you can hand them out
No silverware, true legend
No jewels, black gorilla wear
Yeah where them skills at, Imma drill that
Too many rappers claiming OG and still wack
They sleeping and you can see how they act
Red pill, blue pill, I gave the red pill back
So I hear what they mumble 'bout me me but it don't penetrate
Young rappers want to be large and diss whoever's great
Me, I'm a legend been busting weapons since '88
Blast off the top of your dome, let it ventilate
Skills I will demonstrate, lyrical rap heavyweight
You ain't never heard of this feature, you bitches hella late
You better wait, KRS is never fake
That wack shit that sells out the culture I'll never make
That boom bap raw speak op who generate
I stay ahead, like you 8 o'clock, I'm ten to eight
I got ends to make with the bass kicking
These rap turkeys are fishing for beef but stay chicken
My rhyme style finger licking, keep mixing no quitting
No need for a vacation you tripping
Tock ticking, Imma spit this right
Like handcuffs you gotta say this shit is tight

[Verse 2]
Let me get to it
Yo
Drum ready I'm about to begin
You've been living without well try living within
You heard these others speak but I am not them
They talk paper but here's what I do with the pen
Sword in the air I don't fear anybody
We was criminal minded when they was on the potty
Been spiritual minded the devil can't stop me
Been politica minded, nope they can't lock me
This is an original, not a copy
Me and the mic we got together like swordfish with aki
Mashing any jam, and club, any party
Same shoes, same views, black tee, hair knotty
You could be stoned and you still can't rock me
You could be wood and you still can't knock me
Properly fulfilled and they still want to mock me
Behold it's obvious, the universe got me
Skill, that's my credential
When my words get sent to your mental they turn sentimental
No I will not be gentle
Most rappers are followers
The only thing they lead was a pencil
Money won't defend you
When I A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M end you
I'm that raw shit, hip hop call of war shit
That DJ and MC shit tagging, breaking on the floor shit
Street lyric you heard it I never lost it
Like Yasiin Bey I'm bringing you more shit
Double metaphors it's hard to target
Effortless I flow like a shower no need to force it
You saw it real shit you the witness, the listener
I stand behind my bars like a prisoner
Yeah Imma spit this right
And like them handcuffs you gotta say this shit is tight

[Outro]
Ah shay
To the ancestors
Ah shay
Let them drums rip

[Chorus]
Watch them (Watch them)
They all tell lie
Run up in their office with that boom bye bye
Social injustice, they the reason why
Hit these corporate thieves with that boom bye bye
Now you want to come and act like you my guy
I stay woke with that boom bye bye
I'm taking aim with my one third eye
Let my words fly, boom bye bye

[Verse 1]
Yo
Blackness, it's not just February
It's everyday from your birth to the cemetery
Revolutionary, they could never ever get me
They couldn't tempt me with the Maybach or the Bentley
They couldn't shut me up my soul is never empty
I've been spitting this game since By All Means Necessary
They asking for more but giving so much less today
This is what our ancestors got to say

[Chorus]
Watch them (Watch them)
They all tell lie
Run up in their office with that boom bye bye
Social injustice, they the reason why
Hit these corporate thieves with that boom bye bye
Now you want to come and act like you my guy
I stay woke with that boom bye bye
I'm taking aim with my one third eye
Let my words fly, boom bye bye

[Verse 2]
Yo
Look at the media, they all on some new shit
Black lives matter now, they all want to use it
It's all in the news and the music
What we seeing is the corporate co-opting of another black movement
Their whole economy, they're now about to lose it
How can a black life matter when you already abused it
Black life is the economy
It's been that way since black ancestors were white property
That's why they ain't liking me
I'm not the soldier getting paid
I'm a warrior fighting for free
They type you don't see on TV
The real revolution will not be televised for all to see
You know me
Let me get my voice on
What they pushing as hip-hop
Is soft porn
They asking for more but giving less today
This is what the ancestors got to say

[Chorus]
Watch them (Watch them)
They all tell lie
Run up in their office with that boom bye bye
Social injustice, they the reason why
Hit these corporate thieves with that boom bye bye
Now you want to come and act like you my guy
I stay woke with that boom bye bye
I'm taking aim with my one third eye
Let my words fly, boom bye bye

[Chorus]
Yeah we done heard it before
What we looking at, it's the beginning of civil war
Finally we just might be getting right to the core
The proof in that the truth of that murder we just saw

[Verse 1]
Fuck this there is no justice
And it's a shame because America is above this
But it's really not because these cops they are racist
The very foundation of America is racist
Yeah we all know it but nothing ever changes
They part of the system that puts us in cages
Time to break out every race, all ages
This is not anarchy, this is what change is
You don't have the right to tell me what my pain is
Or tell me how to protest or what my aim is
You the fucking problem, that's where the blame is
Cops killing black people, that's what insane is
Weak politicians we know what your name is
You can vote while I'm getting choked by a racist
All the actualizations against us are baseless
And falsifying the evidence and burying the cases
FTP

[Chorus]
Yeah we done heard it before
What we looking at, it's the beginning of civil war
Finally we just might be getting right to the core
The proof in that the truth of that murder we just saw
Yeah we done heard it before
What we looking at, it's the beginning of civil war
Finally we just might be getting right to the core
The proof in that the truth of that murder we just saw

[Verse 2]
Fuck that, criminal justice they run that
They can have guns but ask me where my gun at
They the criminals but it's me they want to come at
Who's telling them to put their gun back, fuck that
When it's gonna end?
Being killed by a cop is the sixth leading cause of death for black men
And then the courts don't convict them
When the camera shows they the criminals and we are the victims

[Chorus]
Yeah we done heard it before
What we looking at, it's the beginning of civil war
Finally we just might be getting right to the core
The proof in that the truth of that murder we just saw
Yeah we done heard it before
What we looking at, it's the beginning of civil war
Finally we just might be getting right to the core
The proof in that the truth of that murder we just saw

[Verse 3]
And they'll always be one more
As long as white society holds the monopoly on all law
Either or
That's the only law we follow
Cause colonial custom is what we trained to model
Shots in the air, this is just another day for me
Modern day slavery still requires the bravery
Street photography making slavery plain to see
We used to die aimlessly now the camera aims at me
One shot saving me, the other shot slaying me
But how is this condition any different from slavery
White supremacy is still trying to enslave us
When our voices ignored unless white folks save us
I appreciate the protests for sure
But when we gonna end the monopoly of white law
We follow their laws while they follow none
We're told to be peaceful while they're busting a gun

[Chorus]
Yeah we done heard it before
What we looking at, it's the beginning of civil war
Finally we just might be getting right to the core
The proof in that the truth of that murder we just saw

[Verse 1]
Class in session now
Most can't take it but Imma spit it anyhow
Young 'uns getting money, it's funny they think they're ready now
Old folks gossip and bickering sounding petty now
This is why the universe threw this verse it has sent me now
Just to let you know if you spit that flow keep it steady now
Do not be distracted by this one, that one, or other sounds
You can talk that hate but it's better to spread that love around
This is just that wisdom I give to those that's listening
Yeah I keep it gangster but consciousness Imma mix it in
This is KRS let me warn you I'm not the normal
I'm that part of hip hop that edutains and informs you
You can talk that murder, that mayhem but lеt me warn you
I know the game, you rеap what you speak that's how they caught you
Take a minute and listen to the flow that supports you
When I spit it, your spirit it rises like it ought to

[Chorus]
So turn the volume up
The devil's time is up
Turn the volume up
The devil's time is up
Just turn the volume up
The devil's time is up
Just turn the volume up
Up, up, up, up

[Verse 2]
I am the primitive, native, indigenous, savage
Aboriginal, KRS-One is not the average
Barbarian, heathen, and pagan
Burnt faced negro, original man that's what you're facing
Haitian, Baysian, Jamaican black Asian
Knife in the chest of the colonist that's still slaving
The Indian, the Simian, the maroon, the pygmy them
The Ethiopian, the black Carthaginian
Why focus on a continent when the Earth's my domain
The ancient ones are my ancestors and I live with them
Kushite, Kemite, mapping the stars in the night
Divine minds guide us from the sciences of living right
Europa before Jehovah and black Noah
The agriculturalist, I am the reaper and the sower
The higher and the lower, the all-seer and the knower
I been here already I'm just doing it all over
Reincarnated, the holder of a boulder
The black Atlas holding the whole world on my shoulders
Money folder, much older, street soldier
KRS we will be here forever I told you

[Chorus]
So turn the volume up
The devil's time is up
Turn the volume up
The devil's time is up
Just turn the volume up
The devil's time is up
Just turn the volume up
Up, up, up, up

[Verse 3]
Up on the last verse, blast first a Nazi
You know how long these industry fools trying to stop me
But they not me, they copies, they not free
I'm the pharoah, bow and arrow 

[?] they can't top me
The ancient one, I talk to Anunnaki watch me
Laying on the set, these rappers turning punani
Cause they know they mocked me, now I'm in my armor
Spear to the throat, now what my name, Chris Parker
There's no computer screen, I am dope, you the fiend
Your name is what a loser mean, you on the losing team
I come back spitting raps, I am looking super clean
My name is what knowledge means, your name what stupid mean
Nightmare, right there, I don't fight fair
Man it's quite clear, you want the truth keep it right here
People always telling me all these rappers are under me
That's true, I'm coming up on album number 23
Fuck with me, I don't sound like nobody, I'm no copy
I am no Gotti, a Nazi, I don't wait in no lobby
You know where to find me if you look look
These rappers are shook shook
Knowledge reigns supreme, my gats go buck buck

[Chorus]
So turn the volume up
The devil's time is up
Turn the volume up
The devil's time is up
Just turn the volume up
The devil's time is up
Just turn the volume up
Up, up, up, up

[Intro]
Yeah
You know an artist paints with his mind, not with his hands
Wake up

[Verse]
It ain't easy being a lyrical legend
I'm the average old-schooler
I stay sharp with this lyrical weapon
My main art's in the spiritual section
But some dudes ain't hearing this lesson
So I buck shot with the Smith and Wesson
Clips go into the weapon
If I bring the Mac 10 from the west coast
I'm aiming it into your section
Rip rhymes with a Tech-Nine and a 40 Glock
When I'm teaching a lesson
I'll even bring an M1 and leave an impression
A mean one, a clean one, you never seen onе
Til I sweep up with a machine gun
When the tеacha come, you see them run
First I be coming with the peta guns
For my peace love and unity, I'ma have to see your funds
Why you be so dumb
You need to run, look around
My delivery is hot, like when the pizza come, don't fuck around
(You talk to em)

[Chorus]
If you continue to ignore the word
You gonna go through the same deal
Rearrange your mind and how you speak out your word
You putting seeds in your brain field
Corporations treating you like sheep and like (?)
But KRS-One, he stays real
Listen to the teacher as he speaks out the word
You gonna rise if he stays real

(Watch this. Stay real)

[Verse]
It ain't easy being a lyrical icon
When I turn my mic on
Rappers start shaking like fiends when their pipe's gone
I'm squeezing the mic like a python, you got it quite wrong
The guru, step into the arena with the Teacha and your life's gone
These rappers are immoral, they write wrong
KRS-One is immortal, his career is quite long
This won't take long, I'm spitting on mics cause I'm made for this
Be clear, I speak that lyrical hip-hop lyrical craziness
The bar-tender, the airbender, I spit you see the waviness
I don't criticize or knock nobody's style, but I'ma stay with this
The traditional and lyrical is everyday for Kris
I'll strip these beats down to their nakedness
Ain't nothing fake with this
(Stay real)

[Chorus]
If you continue to ignore the word
You gonna go through the same deal
Rearrange your mind and how you speak out your word
You putting seeds in your brain field
Corporations treating you like sheep and like (?)
But KRS-One, he stays real
Listen to the teacha as he speaks out the word
You gonna rise if he stays real

[Verse]
They know that I'm spitting the truth everywhere
Or proof that I'm raising the roof everywhere
Off the top like I dont have any hair
Observe, you might just learn something here
My word is a clear, oh you forgot, 22, 45 uzi or Glock
I don't give a fuck if you choose me or not
First time fiends are new to this drop
Fail to receive when I (?) to the spot
Salutes all day when I cruise in the block
True, Fuck if you feel me or not
Don't claim to be a legend if you really a not
I'm real with the rock, skills are tight, real hip-hop, keep it real tonight
Got the will to fight, whether day or night
Gonna stay alright, cause I stay in the light
I'm the (?) and the hype man
I'm cooking and shaking and baking the mic
When I walk in, rappers jetting like they taking a flight
KRS-One, blazing the mic
Aight!

[Verse 1]
Real spitters out there hold tight (Yeah)
Heaven sent me evidently
Positive lyrics ever ready
Spirit charged, never empty
Devils charms can never tempt me
The level they on could never dent me
The enterprise could never rent me
Keep the drive without the Bentley
I-N-N-O-C-E-N-T
Truth is hard but I speak it gently
Squeeze my shit 'til the clip is empty
Demons and angels, they all protect me
Goblins, goons they all respect me
Walk in the room with the instrumentals
Superior MC skills essential
Spit with a hit quick I was meant to
Trump your card and intellect you
I got drive, I will wreck you
Band on the fact, rappers I will check you
Disrespect you, disconnect you
Bring the tech to you and who you next to
Say what you want yo I don't care
My crew charge in like da-da-da-da
Now you laying on the floor over there
As you can see all the raw right here
You would have seen it if I toured last year
But that's ok I bring it all in here
Strictly queens, no whores in here
And got King Negus all in here
Ain't no beggars, we all got gear
Lions, chewing up the goats and the deers
You don't want truth, close your ears
God, the devils supposed to fear

[Chorus]
Speak Medu-neter no less yes
Medu-neter no less yes
Medu-neter no less yes
Just speak medu-neter no less
Speak medu-neter, speak medu-neter

[Verse 2]
This that raw from the culture corp
You want that raw shit, we got some more
Come inside, lock the door
Some of y'all never heard hip-hop before
So here we go yo, the truth is short
Rappers be frauds like Manafort
You can see they amateurs
He ain't David, what you holding their banner for
David Banner, that's my boy
I can't wait for the day that we back on tour
Back to the raw, my skills are better
Rap so sick I hope you're feeling better
Resurrector
They spit rap, I spit medu-neter
Medu-neter
Lyrical ruler holding a scepter
You diss love, love's gonna get you
Temple of hip-hop that's the school
I don't wanna learn, that's a fool
Ignorance, that ain't cool
I'm flowing, get in the pool
We teach the golden rule, while they hold a tool
The platinum rule while they act a fool
God is the headliner
So ignorance KRS-One is coming after you
Straight blasting you not asking you
Then pray over the body like a pastor do
To hell they dragging you
You front so hard you can't even look in back of you
Your history is gone but this is what I came to do
Bring it back to you
You know we devour cowards
When these rappers talk we are not empowered
All they do is shout it
They ain't master the P, they ain't 'bout it 'bout it
I mastered the power and I'm proud about it
This cypher is getting crowded
Uh huh
Uh huh
Yeah

[Chorus]
Speak Medu-neter no less yes
Medu-neter no less yes
Medu-neter no less yes
Just speak medu-neter no less
Speak medu-neter, speak medu-neter

[Verse 3]
Ok
Look
Street runner, feet pumper
Everything hip-hop we cover
Some of these rappers are in a deep slumber
KRS-One, he will hover
Over nearly everyone, you never seen a  better one
I'm crazy with the letters son, you dealing with a veteran
I'm fly like a pelican, I reign 'til I'm wet again
I'm always a gentleman, 'till I put the venom in
And I'm in, what you hearing now is the melanin
You can see now by stars who the better man
Temple of hip-hop, culture develop and
Peace, love and unity we sending them
Some of these dudes 

[?]
So in the interim we hit 'em with the minimal
Alpha omega, beginning and ending them
Raw shit, we gonna keep hitting them

[Intro]
(K-Prom?) Productions on this

[Verse 1]
New books, new facts, new hooks, new tracks
New tools, new gats, you fools should move back
Original boom bap, mystery school rap
Within the Pythagorean harmonics crowds, I move that
Whos that? The one who rocks this mic and a thousand others
For further evidence, you can check this very album cover
I'm about to smother the ignorance out you motherfuckers
You sleepin on this Teacha, let me get you out them covers
No time for sleeping, no choking, stay awoken
African still beat when the stick's broken
I'm flowing, mind open, chakras glowing
I realize the all seeing being is all knowing
(Hawk?) clean, no interruption, (chief blowing?)
From heaven we came from, so to heaven we going
We the first agriculturalists, we reap what we sowing
Know who you are, not just what the TV's showing

[Chorus]
I came to find you, we are the gods!
I came to remind you, we are the gods!
Don't let them blind you, we are the gods!
The truth is inside you, we are the gods!

[Verse 2]
Grow up, feed the needy, avoid the greedy
No one but us look like Akhenaten/Nefertiti
Not the painted bust of Nefertiti, but the Nefertiti
On the temple wall seen by all in Ancient graffiti
Heed me, 33 years ago, god freed me
Then she said she needed me to spit the truth for her weekly
Freely, easy open mics now don't teach me
My face gets sweaty, palms get all greasy
I start flashing shit, all you see is feces
Written shit, spitting shit, KRS a different species
This boy beast, he's slow and he's low
That is the tempo, when you know you know
Rappers come and go always claim they run the show til they feel that
Thunder blow, straight from the mother flow, gutter flow
Faced with bullshit, I spit the other flow, but bullshits a
Fertilizer, maybe they'll help these brothers grow, I don't know

[Chorus]
I came to find you, we are the gods!
I came to remind you, we are the gods!
Don't let them blind you, we are the gods!
The truth is inside you, we are the gods!

[Verse 3]
Queen mother, wake up. King father, wake up
You sleeping on this teaching, it's you I got to shake up
Wake em up, we the return of the Christ
Christ is not a man, it's a symbol of a community brought back to life
They got you looking for a red or white or blue savior
But here comes the black savior, Krishna gat blazer
Tongue sharp like that razor, original rap flavor
I speak in general terms cause I'm that major
Still got to paint you privately, don't lie to me
God is the Motorola mobilizing inside of me
My sheep know my voices, they choice and they flock to me
When knowledge reigns supreme, ignorance you not gon' see
Unite with me, and I'll unite with you
Don't fight with me, and I won't fight with you
Establish law, that's what we gotta do
The future's dependent on us, maybe this is not for you

[Chorus]
I came to find you, we are the gods!
I came to remind you, we are the gods!
Don't let them blind you, we are the gods!
The truth is inside you, we are the gods!

[Chorus]
Yes we have to organize, organize, organize
Do away with all the lies, all the lies, all the lies
They coming with the mac and the Glock and the 45
In between the protests we profess and realize
Yes we have to organize, organize, organize
Do away with all the lies, all the lies, all the lies
They coming with the tear gas and Glocks and the 45
In between the protests wе profess and realize

[Verse 1]
Rеalize that we have already been here before
Protests in the streets 'cause we seeing we all at war
Burning police cars and we shooting, looting these stores
You may not agree but you see they changing these laws
The only thing they understand now is our city burning
They acting like they shocked with these cops, they just learning
Seeing Mr. Floyd on the ground it got 'em squirming
Now we can see they are the Nazis, we the German blacks

[Chorus]
Yes we have to organize, organize, organize
Do away with all the lies, all the lies, all the lies
They coming with the mac and the Glock and the 45
In between the protests we profess and realize
Yes we have to organize, organize, organize
Do away with all the lies, all the lies, all the lies
They coming with the tear gas and Glocks and the 45
In between the protests we profess and realize

[Verse 2]
Yeah we always wake up but then we go back to sleep again
In between the protests is when we be getting weak again
We hear about the looting, another shooting this week again
This give the police another excuse to hit the streets again
White police, black population could never be your friend
Our mothers and our fathers, they be seizing them
They the overseers, we the S-L-A-V-Es to them
We gotta rise to the level where we ain't needing them
Everybody

[Chorus]
Yes we have to organize, organize, organize
Do away with all the lies, all the lies, all the lies
They coming with the mac and the Glock and the 45
In between the protests we profess and realize
Yes we have to organize, organize, organize
Do away with all the lies, all the lies, all the lies
They coming with the tear gas and Glocks and the 45
In between the protests we profess and realize

[Verse 3]
Yes you have to follow me, follow me, follow me
It's my philosophy that white law monopoly makes democracy hypocrisy
In a capitalist economy there's no democracy
I demand a return to my sovereignty, no apology
Independence, autonomy, no need to mommy me
I could run my own country if you could just stop bombing me
Give me my land back, give me my gold back
My heritage, my birthright, you outright stole that

[Chorus]
Yes we have to organize, organize, organize
Do away with all the lies, all the lies, all the lies
They coming with the mac and the Glock and the 45
In between the protests we profess and realize
Yes we have to organize, organize, organize
Do away with all the lies, all the lies, all the lies
They coming with the tear gas and Glocks and the 45
In between the protests we profess and realize

[Intro]
I'ma tell you the truth though (Really?)

[Verse 1]
I like to read a lot
Books be uplifting me
Words help you see a lot
This book was a gift to me
Chuck D Presents This Day In Rap and Hip-Hop History
It's a reference book and puts important dates in lists for me
Jamel Shabazz A Time Before Crack
A photographic history of hip-hop from way way back
(His martha gupa's?) Hip-Hop Father, Charlie Ahern Wild Style
And 50 Cent's Fifty and More, I used to read this to my child
Sometimes I look at my library and I'll smile
Cause if I can't find it on the shelf
I know it's there (??)
Meanwhile, there's other books without the hooks and out looks
I like to cook so I'll read about cooks, I can't live without books
I like books, I recite books, I even write books a lot
Science and rap, ruminations, gospel of hip-hop
But let me spit a quick list, a book list, that's really short
The first book that you should get is really a passport
Travel, that's key. But the books cannot lie
Unlock your mind by reading lines of new topics
Place your optics on books of real black knowledge
Beginning with Carter G. Woodson, I'm paying homage
His book, Mis-Education of the Negro is essential
For freeing your mind from the slavery that's mental
Turn up this instrumental, you ain't dealing with an amateur
I'm reading Walter Rodney How Europe Underdeveloped Africa
That's the man to thank, high pray
Let's look at The Birth of Black America by Andrew Frank
Take that to the bank
Let me rock again, hip-hop again
Check out Africa: Mother of Western Civilization by Yosef Ben-Jochannan
Check out Black Man of the Nile again by Yosef Jochannan
Civilization or Barbarism by Cheikh Anta Diop and then
Black Indians by William Loren Katz, take it back
Anything by Dr. Cornel West, you need to go get that
Michael Eric Dyson, all his books, go get all of that
Henry Louis Gates, PBS, show support for that
I'm like (??) go with the almanac, books I got the tallest stack
The Brooklyn Public Library, yeah that's where I started at
I read up everything, every book that I can see
While these others went to college, I got my knowledge for free
Philosophy, theology, paleoanthropology
Mythology, economy, I studied these subjects entirely for free

[Chorus]
They was free!
You got to see me
It was free! Open your eyes and see! It was free!
You've got to see
Good things in life are free
Don't waste your money

[Verse 2]
Let us continue on the menu with these reference books
Like the Oxford English Dictionary for words its a better look
It deals with word history, before and after them
But its funny, in the A section you can't find the word African
But these books, don't start trashing em, bashing em, harassing em
It just shows accurately the racism to the maximum
Here's American Heritage Dictionary, 4th edition
Here's what it looks like when you look at the definition of Shirley Chisholm
Peep the wisdom and the complication
Shirley Chisholm was the first black woman to seek the Democratic presidential nomination
You talk about breaking new ground, Shirley's profound
But in the American Heritage Dictionary, this is nowhere to be found
This is an American Heritage Dictionary reference
And Shirley Chisholm's run for president doesn't get one sentence
I'm just pointing it out, scholarship, what it's all about
Don't just read, find out what these authors are all about

[Chorus]
I'm free!
It was free!
You got to see me
It was free!
Open your eyes and see!
It was free!
You've got to see
Good things in life are free
Don't waste your money

[Verse 1]
Imma switch up on y'all real quick
Racists in these places only see me as cattle
But I'm more like D'Jango on the horse with the saddle
Put a racists head in the gravel with the burner
Harriet Tubman, John Brown and the one Nat Turner
I'm a learner, I keep my head in a book
So when a racist start talking I could never be shook
I can never be took because I'm knocking their block off
Like crack dealers used to say let's get this rock off

[Chorus]
You're always blaming me
I'm not thе enemy, you are

[Verse 2]
Pеople ask why are you looting the stores
Why you burning down the business and city that's yours
First of all the city ain't mine it's yours
Democracy's a joke when capitalists write the laws
You critique my flaws and don't speak of yours
You only show the effects and never speak of the cause
I got no money, no help and no voice
With no way out I only got one choice
Brick through the glass, rock through the window
Tear gas moving anyway that the wind blow
Rubber bullets overhead, now we got to get low
But this was how slaves were treated from the get go
Robbery, invasion and rape
These are not criminal acts, these are the acts of the state
If you just waking up to this fact you a little late
For justice how long you think we gotta wait
Yeah, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah, c'mon

[Chorus]
You're always blaming me
I'm not the enemy you are
You're claiming unity
This time it's time you see who you are

[Verse 3]
Liberate you mind, living ain't a crime
Innovate the time, renovate the rhyme
Every line and rhyme you're using
Generates confusion and bring your people a revolution
Winning not losing
Helping not using
Oppression, aggression and hate we refusing
If you really want change rewrite the constitution
But that's the one solution that they are not doing
So we sharpen the blade, clean out the barrel
Pick up the rock and the bow and the arrow
Pull out the gas mask and the protest apparel
For justice Imma go into battle

[Chorus]
You're always blaming me
I'm not the enemy you are
You're claiming unity
This time it's time you see who you are
Who you are
Who you are
You're always blaming me
I'm not the enemy you are
You're claiming unity
This time it's time you see who you are
Who you are
Who you are
It's a tug of war
What with one thing and another
It's a tug of war
We expected more
But with one thing and another
We were trying to outdo each other
In a tug of war

In another world
In another world we could

Stand on top of the mountain
With our flag unfurled
In time to come
In time to come we will be
Dancing to the beat played
On a different drum

It's a tug of war
Though I know I mustn't grumble
It's a tug of war
But I can't let go
If I do you'll take a tumble
And the whole thing is going to crumble
It's a tug of war
Pushing pushing, pulling pulling
Pushing and pulling

In years to come they may discover
What the air we breathe and the life we lead
Are all about
But it won't be soon enough
Soon enough for me
No it won't be soon enough
Soon enough for me

In another world we could
Stand on top of the mountain
With our flag unfurled
In a time to come we will be
Dancing to the beat played on a different drum

We will be dancing to the beat
Played on a different drum
We will be dancing to the beat
Played on a different drum

It's a tug of war, a tug of war
A tug of war
What with one thing and another
It's a tug of war
We expected more
But with one thing and another
We were trying to outscore each other
In a tug of war
Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around!

Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around?

Lonely driver
Out on the road
With a hundred miles to go
Sole survivor
Carrying the load
Switches on his radio
Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down (down down)
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around?

REPEAT

In the audience
Watching the show
With a paper in his hand
(In his hand, in his hand)
Some important impresario
Has a message for the band

Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down (down down)
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around?

You never know who may be
Listening to you
You never know who may be
Listening to you
Take it away - take it away
After hours
Late in the bar
By a darkened corner seat
Faded flowers wait in the jar
Till the evening is complete
When your body is coming
Apart at the seams
And the whole thing's feeling low
You're convincing yourself
That there's nobody there, I know
I know how you feel

Like somebody has taken
The wheels off your car
When you had somewhere to go
Well it's annoying
Not going to get very far
I know
But somebody cares

There's always someone, somewhere
You should know by now
Always somebody who cares
It's happening day in, day out
Well you know by now
Always somebody who cares
If you don't know it
How will it find you?
How will we know your whereabouts?
But I know how you feel

I know how you feel

Like somebody has taken
The wheels off your car
When you had somewhere to go
Well it's frustrating
Not going to get very far
I know
But somebody cares

There's always someone, somewhere
You should know by now
Always somebody who cares
It's happening day in, day out
Well you know by now
Always somebody who cares

If you don't know it
How will it find you?
How will we know your whereabouts?
But I know how you feel
What's that you're doing?
Girl, I like what you do to me
What's that you're doing?
‘cos it makes no kind of sense to me

You can make me feel so proud
You can make me holler ow!
Girl, you make me want to dance and sing
My mind is blown and you're the blame
I say it's sunnin' when there's rain
I jump by leaps and bounds, just call my name

What's that you're saying?
Girl, I like the way you talk to me
What's that you're saying?
Even if it's wrong girl I do agree

Girl, you make me feel so small
Though I might stand six feet tall
What you've got cuts me right down to size
I'll be the last, you'll be the first
I'll do my best to quench your thirst
I'm the lucky onе who keeps the prize
Girl, I like what you'rе doing
Baby do it some more
Girl, I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
Girl, I like what you
Do to me, do to me
Do it some more
Do it to me, do it to me
Do it some more

What's that you're doing?
Girl, I like what you do to me
What's that you're doing?
‘cos it makes no kind of sense to me

You can fill my appetite
Without me taking up a bite
Never knew that love could fill you up
You're much too good for me to pass
I'm for the taking, you just ask
We can make it stick with love and luck

Girl, I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
Girl, I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
Girl, I like what you
Do to me, do to me
Do it some more
You know I like what you're doing
Girl, I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
What's that I'm feeling?
That sensation's such a mystery
I know that it's thrilling
And I hope this feeling lasts eternally

Girl, you make me scream and shout
Tell me what it's all about
You make me give in without a fight
I don't have any words to say
You can fill it any way
And everything you do will turn out alright

Girl, I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
Girl, I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
She loves you yeah yeah yeah
She loves you yeah yeah yeah yeah
And if I said
I really knew you well
What would your answer be?
If you were here today
Here today

Well knowing you
You'd probably laugh and say
That we were worlds apart
If you were here today
Here today

But as for me
I still remember how it was before
And I am holding back the tears no more
I love you

What about the time we met?
Well I suppose that you could say that
We were playing hard to get
Didn't understand a thing
But we could always sing
What about the night we cried?
Because there wasn't any reason left
To keep it all inside
Never understood a word
But you were always there with a smile

And if I say I really loved you
And was glad you came along
Then you were here today
For you were in my song
Here today
Well I used to smile when I was a pup
Sailing down the Nile in a china cup
With the recipe for a lovely day
Sticking out of my back pocket

But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'cos we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till we made it up in the ballroom

Ballroom dancing, made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your
Ballroom dancing, seen it on TV
I got what I got from ballroom dancing
Big B.D

Well I used to fly when I was a kid
And I didn't cry if it hurt a bit
On a carpet ride to a foreign land
At the time of Davy Crockett
But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'cos we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till we made it up in the ballroom

Ballroom dancing, made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore
Your ballroom dancing, seen it on TV
I got quitе a lot from ballroom dancing
Big B.D

Well it went so fast and we all grеw up
Now the days that passed in the china cup
Are the memories of another day
And I wouldn't want to knock it

But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'cos we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till we made it up in the ballroom

Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore
Your ballroom dancing, seen it on TV
I got quite a lot from ballroom dancing
Big B.D
Oh!
The pound is sinking
The peso's falling
The lira's reeling
And feeling quite appalling

The mark is holding
The franc is fading
The drachma's very weak
But everyone's still trading

The market's bottom
Has fallen right out
And only the strong are survivors

Well I fear, my dear
That it's eminently clear
That you can't see the trees
For the forest
Your father was an
Extraordinary man
But you don't seem to have inherited
Many of his mannerisms
Oh, any of his mannerisms

The dollar's moving
The rouble's rising
The yen is keeping up
Which hardly seems surprising

The market's bottom
Has fallen right out
And only the stout are survivors

Hear me lover
I can't be held responsible now
For something that didn't happen
I knew you for a minute
Oh, it didn't happen
Only for a minute
Your heart just wasn't in it any more

The pound is sinking
The peso's failing
The lira's reeling
And feeling quite appalling
Light out Wanderlust
Head us out to sea
Captain says there'll be a bust
This one's not for me

Take us from the dark
Out where we can see
Captain's out to make his mark
This one's not to be

Light out Wanderlust
Help us to be free
Light out Wanderlust
Do it just for me
Wanderlust

Oh where did I go wrong my love?
What petty crime was I found guilty of?
What better time to find a brand new day?
Oh - Wanderlust away
Light out Wanderlust
Help us to be free
Light out Wanderlust
Do it just for me
Wanderlust

Captain's out to make his mark
This one's not to be

Light out Wanderlust
Hеad us out to sea
Captain says there'll bе a bust
This one's not for me

COUNTER MELODY
Oh where did I go wrong my love?
What petty crime was I found guilty of?
What better time to find a brand new day?
Oh Wanderlust away

Dropping a line
Maybe this time
It's Wanderlust for me
You've got to get it mm mm
You've got to get it don't forget
It doesn't come around again
You've got to get it mm mm
You've got to get it and you've got to get it good

Once I had a little Spanish guitar
The neighbors told me I could go pretty far
Well I came and I went
And my guitar got bent
But I discovered that the people who love
Are what we need if we're to get up above it all
And that's that
Unless the world is flat

I wanna get it mm mm
I wanna get it just in case
It doesn't come around again
I wanna get it mm mm
I wanna get it and I wanna get it good
Pardon me if I've been misunderstood
I wanna get it while the going is good
The telephone rang
About a song I sang
The life of Cadillac and ultra for sure
Is automatic for the Lady Demure
She came and she went
Without a single dent

Come on, let's get it mm mm
You've got to get it don't forget
It doesn't come around again
You've got to get it mm mm
You've got to get it and you've got to get it good

Come on, let's get it mm mm
You've got to get it don't forget
It doesn't come around again
You've got to get it mm mm
You've got to get it and you've got to get it good
Well you can dress me up as a robber
But I won't be in disguise
Only love is a robber
And he lives within your eyes
Ooh, ooh eee ooh

You can dress me up as a sailor
But I'll never run to sea
As long as your love is available to me
What do I do with a sea of blue?
Ooh, eee ooh

Dressing me up
It doesn't make a difference
What you want to do
Whichever way you look at it
I'm still in love with you
If we go on forever
I may never make a change

Dressing me up
And if I don't convince you
You needn't look too far
To see that I'm not lying
‘cos I lovе you the way you are
And what's the point of changing
Whеn I'm happy as I am?
Well you can dress me up as a soldier
But I wouldn't know what for
I was the one that told you he loved you
Don't wanna go to another war
No, no, no
Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we?

We all know that people are the same wherever you go
There is good and bad in everyone
We learn to live, we learn to give each other what we need to survive
Together alive

Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we?

Ebony, ivory, living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory

We all know that people are the same wherever you go
There is good and bad, in everyone
We learn to live when we learn to give each other what we need to survive
Together alive

Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh Lord, why don't we

Ebony, ivory, living in perfect harmony…

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
If I was down to my last dollar, give a fuck what they think
We gon' load a 80 benz and a old impala
Told this bitch, "My boys from Detroit," she askin' us about Sada
My wife prolly up in New York making enchiladas
Bitch want me to put her in school, I am not your papa
.30 clip and it feel full, I'm in my mood
Ready to road rage in a Rolls (Ayy)
Ready to road rage in a Rolls to go hit your ho
Bitch, leave me alone when I'm home and I'm sipping my four
Niggas better not run up on me wrong, that shit in my coat
And it clear they lookin' at Boat just like he the Pope

[Verse 2: Babyface Ray]
You know I done done it all, I ain’t Shawty Lo
Rap nigga play with the bag, keep it on the low
Cool nigga run with the steppers, steppin' on the dope
I just-I just touched down, Yachty scooped me Double R
I think I got everything, man, Saint Laurent
Nigga say they see on the jet and on the block
Give a bad bitch four minutes like a vibe
Lil' cuz said he want some money, send him out
Spot banging like it’s fast food, In-N-Out
If my youngins catch a nigga outside, they’ll spin the block
How the fuck these niggas actin' like they street? They in the house

[Verse 3: Veeze]
Heard that nigga want the clout, fuck it, put them in a cloud
Heard the brokest niggas loud, that's why I don’t make a sound
That nigga said he don't like Veeze, he don’t know why
I rap about shit you ain't seen or you ain’t know about
I sleep on Chrome Heart pillows at Lil Boat house
I'm doing scamming, sending bows to your ho house
Riding with a hundred twenty shots, boy, that's four Glocks
Me and face had shows and lows and they sold out
We just turned a San Fran' mansion to a grow house
I just spent three thousand on a coat 'cause it's cold now

[Verse 4: Lil Yachty]
I can’t ride around in that Bentley 'cause it’s old now
I can’t hang around with that nigga 'cause he told now
You was just a gangsta online, why you folding now?
I thought buddy was your OG, why they ho'in' him out?

[Verse 5: Babyface Ray]
Pull up in ATL with them things, make it snow in the south
Trappin' by the door in my room, it’s one more on the couch
Seventeen wavy, not a yacht in the water
Rolex shopping, seen the Yacht' and I bought it
Me and Meech treat the gallery like a office
Lately, I been globetrottin' like I'm playing in Harlem

[Verse 6: Veeze]
Riding 'round like we ain’t famous with a Glock and a 'Rari
All my niggas banging red, like they got hired at Target
'Bout to change my name to Ken, all my bitches be Barbies
She keep throwing me the pussy, but I really don’t want it
If her throat could have a baby, I might end up on Maury
Walk around with twenty thousand for the times I was starvin'

[Verse 7: Lil Yachty]
If she pop a X pill, then that pussy, I'm carving
I done fucked a thousand bitches who BD’s think I'm garbage
Well it’s a pandemic, world recession, I'm never starving
Nigga play with my money, leave him lumpy like Martin
Let’s be honest, I'm the real reason you bitches want a Birkin
How the hell his nails painted and his niggas might murk you?
Made a million dollars cash in a bank I ain’t go to
Seen what you said online, I just really don’t know you
Why would I shine some light on these niggas on purpose?
My bitch bring her friend, it’s gon' turn to a circus
I just got mad at Veeze, he don’t check his purchase
Ah, I meant purchases
This bitch mad I ain’t text back, she worthless

[Intro: Charli XCX]
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason (No, no)
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Tell me the reason (Yeah)
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason
Why you won't open up

Tequila on your tongue
You gotta tell me the rеason
Why we can't fall in love

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Why, why, why?
Don't you lie, what do you want?
Fall in lovе, ah, risk it all

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Tell me what you want
'Cause I know that you're lonely on your own
We're out in L.A. for a month
I don't think I can hide my emotions no, no more (Uh-huh)
A late night, say you want me, say you're selfish
Think about my body, then two-time
Say you want her? Do you want her?
Doesn't do it like me, no
So hot, burn the place down
Give you what you need

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
So you gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
(Why we can't fall in love)

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Why, why, why?
Don't you lie, what do you want?
Fall in love, ah, risk it all

[Verse 2: A. G. Cook]
It's that time of year again
Rudolph ring that bell again
Isn't it so elegant?
Yeah this sounds so eloquent
Now that it's so cold
It's that time of year so let us cheer
Hey Michael Bublé's here!
Let's fall in love, oh yeah
Like falling snow
Almost twelve, cold as hell
Santa's here to stay
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen
Can't take him away
Cookies and a pine tree
We got everything

[Chorus: A. G. Cook & Charli XCX]
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
Baby you know it's the season
Where people open up
Yeah we kicked out of heaven
Tequila in the pub
You really got me believing (Oh yeah)
Yeah yeah

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX & A. G. Cook]
Why, why, why?
Don't you lie, what do you want? (Don't you lie)
Fall in love, ah, risk it all

[Outro: A. G. Cook]
Take it while you can
I'll let you hold my hand
Take it while you can
Feels better the closer you stand
Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
I won't let go
(I won't let go, no no, no no no no)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
Come on, come on
Save me from my rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat
I'm all alone
And I hope, I hope someone come and take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul
I need to know you won't let go
I won't let go
(I won't let go, no no, no no no no)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I won't let go

And she never could sing but she get melodic (Woah)
It's a pussy party and my dick invited (Woah)
Now she's blowing my phone like a psychotic
Baby lower your tone, you're too excited

Bitches with their mixed feelings, I ain't fuckin' with 'em (No)
Fucking their best friends then another one
Toe tag every beat, here's another one (Woah)
CQ with the beat, I just chalk it up
Niggas take style then they play it out
All this

Broke niggas need not apply

If we can do it, you can do it
But in the meantime
Let us have our fun with her

[Verse 1]
Back when I was in the Bay (Yea)
Working on my mixtape (Ayy)
Got a verse from Lil B
Back when AE was in the A's
It was 2007 VMAs
First day that I met Lil Wayne
Signed to Young Money straight out the gate
Bedrock, now they all in my face
"Rack City" had 'em switch up the base
Blowing money fast, I got the cake
Lap dance, got her ass on my face
Tour money, yeah I sold everyday
Crib in Calabasas must've been fake
Had my money, need my name on the gates
5'3" and she got a little waist
I can't be arguing, gotta escape
Niggas praying on my downfall
Had to go left likе a foul ball
Friends in LA got 'em telling it all
I can't trust you, I know who you arе
Bitch, yeah, I'm popping, come pop it on me
Money got longer, I'm living your dream
Nigga I made it, you making a meme
Ice on the pussy, I made that bitch cream

[Chorus]
Cash in the rain (Rain)
I feel like I'm on a bean (Bean)
Rollercoaster, hear the scream
Ayy, I bought that Wraith, crashed it the first day
(Crashed that whip the first day)
Ayy, I swear I got angels watching over me
(Angels watching over me)
Ayy, I fall in love in her then fall out in weeks
(I fall in love then fall out in weeks)
Words got power, watch how you speak to me
(Watch how you speak to me)

[Verse 2]
Ayy, bitch, I'm 'bout that, I shout that (Ayy)
Rich nigga, I don't shit where I lay at (Yea)
And my new bitch always wearing latex (Yea)
Said keep her body tight and her ass fat (Woo)
Got a bitch half vietnamese half black (Yea)
I'ma fuck her from the back with my hat back (Ayy)
I ain't tripping on you girl, I been had that (Ayy)
And I put in all the work, what you mad at? (Haha)

[Outro]
Ooh, I look like Nigo (Nigo)
Treat the hills like it's Tokyo (Tokyo)

Gotta take care of my people

And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever

You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

So gon' and let the rain pour

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever

…
(Oh, carry her safe to Bethlehem)
(Little gray donkey, tonight)
(A miracle rests on your four small feet)
(Little gray donkey, tonight)

You know, after six days of creating the world
The Lord has surely earned His seventh day of rest
For instance, take the day He created the animals
Just as He was about finished, He picked up one more piece of clay
After shaping it to His liking, He added a pinch of courage, a dab of humility, six grains of faithfulness
This one He made just a little bit ugly
But He gave it a big handful of solemn wisdom
Gave it a little pat, and sent it on its way

And then, upon a winter's day, and in the long ago
The dusty road to Bethlehem was trod by many feet
And in that throng, a donkey walked, a donkey small and gray
As donkeys plod their donkey days, in cold, or rain, or heat
No hand reached out to touch him as he went his donkey way
No scribe set down his donkey name for men unborn to say
No eye could see a radiance about this lowly one
Who plodded on to Bethlehem, with Mary, and God's Son

(Oh, carry her safe to Bethlehem)
Little gray donkey, tonight
(A miracle rests on your four small feet)
Little gray donkey, tonight

All Heaven is watching your mission divine
And, over a stable, a star waits to shine
While shepherds and wise men all look for the sign
Little gray donkey, tonight

A king will come, the prophets cried
A king will come, like no king has come before
On noble steed, with golden crown and silver trumpet-call

But on that silent, holy night
There was no pomp, no pride, in Bethlehem
The child-king came to Bethlehem upon a donkey small
A donkey old, and tired, and gray
With long and drooping ears
And no one dreamed he brought our world
The light of after-years

A donkey plodding through the dust
To see God’s will was done
And, bearing on his rugged back, the Virgin
And God’s Son
(Oh, carry her safe to Bethlehem)
Little gray donkey, tonight
(A miracle rests on your four small feet)
Little gray donkey, tonight

All Heaven is watching your mission divine
And, over a stable, a star waits to shine
While shepherds and wise men all look for the sign
(Little gray donkey) Blessed little donkey
God's little donkey, tonight

[Verse]
Turnin' up emotional faders
Keep repeating self-hating phrases
I have heard enough of these voices
Almost like I have no choice
This is biological stasis
My mood's shifting to manic places
Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships
Watch life, here I go again

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (Ooh)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end (Ooh)

[Chorus]
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me ever since day one
Pop a 911, then pop another one

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Chiseled their names in stone
Heavy the load you tow
And the red horse is always close
And the fire don't burn below

[Verse 2]
Two hundred miles to clear
Chasing a sound I hear
When the call brings them all to tears
And the hopes they all turn to fears

[Chorus]
And they're walking around
With their heads in the cloud screaming
Must catch the bandit
Reckless abandon
Rundown and stranded
Must catch the bandit

[Verse 3]
Tracks in the dirt for days
Sniff out the fire ablaze
And the red door, it seems to sway
And it carries a heavy weight

[Chorus]
And they're walking around
With their heads in the cloud screaming
Must catch the bandit
Reckless abandon
Rundown and stranded
Must catch the bandit

[Chorus]
And they're walking around
With their heads in the cloud screaming
Must catch the bandit
Reckless abandon
Rundown and stranded
Must catch the bandit
There is still no person who does not move the fiber for music or when listening to the most popular songs on Spotify. It's understood by various authors and professionals that music does extraordinary things in every living thing, so we'll show you how to unblock and use Spotify at work. Under psychological currents, music is capable of appeasing clinical pictures that compromise the patient's health; even sound vibrations at a certain decibel can be helpful in minimizing unfavorable behavioral and neurological symptoms for the sufferer.

Other studies that arе still under discussion for verification, fall on the usе of music for the growth of plants; taking into account that those who affirm this theory are participants in the idea that the growth of flora has to do with something more holistic than just nature and its process. In another aspect, music is part of the recreation of many generations and that is why, the monetary amount invested in the music industry and its related as producers; record labels, songwriters, editors, singers and musicians in general.

The development of new hits that promote the success of the author of the piece is taken very seriously. This success is based on becoming known to the public, buying a record, promoting diverse feelings and emotions in the public, selling tickets to concerts and finally downloading songs on the web or available platforms; especially using Spotify at work.

If we analyze which are the main applications or programs that we have to have installed on our mobiles or computers today, we can be sure that a huge number of users will bet directly on streaming services, and among the musical ones, of course, it stands out Spotify.

Spotify is a Swedish-American multiplatform application, used to play music via streaming. It has a "premium" business model, a basic free service and with advertising; but with additional features, with better audio quality, through a paid subscription. It allows listening in "radio mode", searching by artist, album or playlists created by users themselves.

Spotify offers Internet audio file transfer through a combination of dedicated streaming servers and peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer involving users. A 256 kbit / s internet connection is sufficient, and the bit rate of the tracks is 320 kbit / s. Audio files can be played on demand, as if they were on the user's hard drive. Songs are cached by the software to avoid consuming more bandwidth by repeating songs over and over again. Users in premium mode access a higher level of audio quality. Due to all these benefits, it is such an interesting tool that many users lose valuable time in their day to day browsing the contents of the application, something that teachers or bosses do not like at all.

How to unblock Spotify website

If you can't access spotify.com, you may have been blocked at school, high school, college, work, or the government.

Below are the methods for getting Spotify unblocked content:

Method 1: using the hosts file

Important: for this method we need to have the administrator permissions of the machine we are on.  For example:
193.235.232.103 spotify.com
193.235.232.103 www.spotify.com
54.230.187.53 d2c87l0yth4zbw.cloudfront.net
173.194.34.254 www.googletagmanager.com
23.38.101.231 cdn.betrad.com
54,225,246,248 l.betrad.com

Method 2: using webproxy

It is the most comfortable method, since we only need to enter the url we want to visit and press the "Hide me" button. The downside to this method is that it only works when we surf the web and not for other programs that have access to the internet, for this we would need to use the third VPN method.

Method 3: using a VPN

A VPN serves to encrypt your activity on the web and browser completely anonymously, making it the most efficient and robust option. Once we are connected to the VPN, we will be able to use all the programs on our computer by connecting to the internet anonymously. If you are concerned about your privacy and security on the web, this alternative is worth it despite the expense of a little money.

Choose a method that you are able to master. Hopefully this brief explanation has helped you unblock Spotify at school or work.

[Verse 1]
Get up! It's time! Your life! Your world!

(Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock)

[Verse 1]
I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel-Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Verse 2]
I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and еlectric soul

[Chorus]
Will you still love me whеn I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Bridge]
Dear Lord, when I get to heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that you'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

Makes me wanna party

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothin' but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Outro]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?

[Verse 1]
I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

[Verse 2]
There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

[Bridge]
In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide
Across this new divide
Across this new divide

[Intro]
Uh
Ayy

[Verse]
Racin', I'm racin'
Tryna find the way I balance the time (Ayy)
Niggas that you stay with
Wanna get one up on me every single time
That's why I waited, waited patient
'Cause I might fall but I won't fall every time
In this space, tryna pace it
'Cause you know I give my all every time

[Chorus]
Hold on to me
Hold on to me
And I'll hold onto you
Hold on to me
And I'll hold onto you
Hold on to me
One day, when you’re out of line
You’ll say, can you spare the time?
Oh I know you’re out of line
Yes I know you’re out of line
And you will say, everyday
And you will play

Some say, there’s another day
I’m sure, that my thing’s ok
Though I know you’re out of line
Yes I know you’re out of line
And you will say, everyday
And you will play

I am your friend

Though I know you’re out of line
Yes I know you’re out of line
And you will say, everyday
And you will say
One day, when you’re out of line
You’ll say, can you spare the time
Though I know you’re out of line
Yes I know you’re out of line
And you will say, everyday
And you will play

We say yes, we say yes, we say yes, we say yes
We say yes, we say yes, we say yes, we say yes
Let me show you how to be alive
There's no use to worry
Good luck's not far behind
Let me see you keep a steady life
It's no use to hurry
Nobody needs your wife

Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to

Lend him a gentle hand
Show him that we can laugh
Be at his side
It's not so far away

Let me show you how to be alive
There's no use to worry
Good luck's not far behind
Let me see you keep a steady life
It's no use to hurry
Nobody needs your wife
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to

Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Talks about the cold on television
Appetizing in the intermission
Let's go look, glued to the screen
There she is, so terribly clean
I love her

Mrs. Gillespie, you know how to sell me
You made me blow my mind with things you tell me
Let's go look, glued to the screen
There she is, so terribly clean
I love her

Now she disappears back to the program
I return to bed, feeling so low down
Someone else is stealing my scene
Fading away into a dream
About her
I steal the night away
Driving my life away, dancing
I was a Romeo
I knew the art of romancing
I was just an average guy, in a world of empty dreams
I needed someone to show me how to love

Juliet, oh, Juliet
The night was magic when we first met
Juliet, oh, Juliet
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside
For me and my baby
J-J-J-Juliet

Fighting with destiny
Fortune and fame, but kept losing
Playing a joker's game
Only myself I was fooling
I was an average guy in a world of empty dreams
You've broken down all the walls with your love
J-J-J-Juliet
Oh, Juliet
This kind of loving you don't forget
Juliet, oh, Juliet
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside

Close your eyes, Juliet
Don't let go
On and on, our love is like the sun
It keeps on going strong throughout eternity

I wanna love you in my life
Sweet Juliet
Living without love in my life
My girl Juliet

J-J-J-Juliet
Oh, Juliet
This kind of loving you don't forget
Juliet, oh, Juliet
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside
Juliet, oh, Juliet
This kind of loving you don't forget
Juliet, oh, Juliet
Ooh

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Juliet, oh, Juliet
This kind of loving you don't forget
Juliet
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1]
Patience ain't no virtue with you
And I wasted plenty time pissing around
And It's coo'
Leaving bitches on the side
And for my mama them too
You relentless nigga
I don't need rent nigga

[Verse 2]
Call me like you got confessions queued up
Like ya last bitch
Looking chewed up, baby (Coming over)
Coming at 3
You regret missing this
And it’s all even (All even)
You know the difference
Between me and chickens
I don't wanna be her
I don't want to be healed
I don't want to smile (Ooh, oh)
I don't want to be alone
Oh

[Chorus]
Talk to me
In your love language
Show me, yeah
How to connect to you
Help me Understand
How you speak
Your love language

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you
In the candlelight
There's no one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
Turning my mind away
Oh oh, how I could love you
But, I don't know the way
Oh, but you should love me
If I could let you stay

[Chorus]
(It's late) When I'm bleeding deep inside
(It's late) Ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
(Too late) Even now
The feeling seems to steal away
(So late) Though I'm crying
I can't help but hear you say
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

[Verse 2]
The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time
The more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now, you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh, you know that I can love you
Though, I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through

[Chorus]
(It's late) Oh, and it's driving me so mad
(It's late) Yes, I know
But don't try to tell me that it's
(Too late) Save our love
You can't turn out the lights
(So late) I've been wrong
But I'll learn to be right
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

[Bridge]
I've been so long, you've been so long
We've been so long trying to work it out
I ain't got long, you ain't got long
We gotta know what this life is all about

[Guitar Solo]
Tell me
Try to work it out, late
Woo! Ooh
Too late, yeah
Too late, much too late
Ooh

[Verse 3]
You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
C'mon
If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh, you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?

[Chorus]
(It's late) Yes it's late, but it's time to set me free
(It's late) Ooh yes, I know
But there's no way it has to be
(Too late) So let the fire
Take our bodies this night
(So late) Let the waters
Take our guilt in the tide, now
It's late, it's late, it's late, it's late
It's late, it's late, it's late

[Outro]
Oh, it's all too late
Whoa, oh, it's too late
Come on!
I'm late, too late, oh yeah
Whoa!

[Intro]
..Mmm

[Chorus]
I know that you probably hate me now
But I promise, girl, that it ain't like that
Can I make it up to you? Can you come to me?
And I promise, girl, I'ma get you right back
Oh, you deserve it

[?] in your back right now when you birkin'
The way you workin'...

[Verse]
...love with it...

[...]

[?] been
But baby, I'm sorry, I've been busy on the road

[Chorus]
I know that you probably hate me now
But I promise, girl, that it ain't like that
Can I make it up to you? Can you come to me?
And I promise, girl, I'ma get you right back
Oh, you deserve it

[?] in your back right now when you birkin'
The way you workin'...

[Intro]
In case you ain't know, check it
Let me tell you right not and the whole world
You are the only one (One, one)

[Verse 1]
Uh, I saw them guys you were wit'
I don't flash platinum watches and drop-top whips
But you can rest assure you my perfect fit
Every dollar that we get, we be earning it
Yo, you never have to worry about me taking a trip
Or leaving you at home so I can quickly forget
Yo, with me it's the opposite, you swerve the jeep
You the queen of ya house, you earn your keep
And I rеspect that, in high school we both got left back
Wе both were divorced and had setbacks
But you should never let that depress you
God has blessed you, yo, here's what KRS do
Support your goals, keep you warm when it's cold
It ain't about now, it's about when we get old

[Chorus]
Let me tell you right now and the whole world
You are the only one (One, one)
In my heart you are that number one girl
You are the one (One, one, one)
Even when your hair ain't done wit' no curl
You are the only one (One, one, one)
Let me tell you right now and the whole world
You are the only one (One, one)

[Verse 2]
Crazy wild love making, we already did
Shit, that's why we got four kids
Romantic, our parenthood we planned it
On the QE2 to England, cross the Atlantic
Respect, you don't have to demand
It's like you got the perfect husband and your friends can't stand it
Especially when I watch the kids
And when you come home I ain't trying to find out what you did
It flips they lid, 'cause they looking for the player
A little boy trying to pay theirs cell phones and pagers
But wit' me you living with the savior
We be up in the temple of hip-hop, or chilling with the mayor
I thank the creator, we don't need what they handing out
This is what your man is about, it's like
Peace and much love, trust and respect
Your friends may have diamonds but they ain't get that yet
They may have the 

[?] and cars and private jets
But all they're really good for is sex, uh

[Chorus]
Let me tell you right now and the whole world
You are the only one (One, one)
In my heart you are that number one girl
You are the one (One, one, one)
Even when your hair ain't done wit' no curl
You are the only one (One, one, one)
Let me tell you right now and the whole world
You are the only one (One, one)

[Verse 3]
Yo, we be hanging out late night at Denny's
Having conversations about every and any
Many people want what we got
A relationship that just keeps getting hot like hip-hop
You know I'm not the regular guy, you know I can't be compared
You know when the drama comes I ain't scared
My name rings bells in the street
You can say my name in any hood your protection is complete
Thugs be right on their feet, saying "What
Your man is Kris? You don't worry, Miss"
Let me tell you right now and the whole world
You are the only one (One, one)
But most of the time you're with me and the kids
Mind at ease, chilling out at Chucky Cheese's
These are my kids, I know what their need is
I know what the doctor bill in school tuition fee is
My daughter, I know who she is
And all my sons know exactly what being free is
Let me tell you right now and the whole world
You are the only one (One, one)
No, you might not get the drop-top three
But all your kids wanna be like me
They father, and even when times are getting harder
There's only one name you could trust, Kris Parker

[Outro]
Let me tell you right now and the whole world
You are the only one (One, one)
Uh, uh, uh, yeah
Uh
Uh, send this out to you
You and yours, word
Uh
It's that time y'all
That's word
Lemme ring it
Let me tell you right now and the whole world
You are the only one (One, one)

[Verse 1]
My life is shifting
I can feel it in the way I smile
I need to go, I need to get out
I haven’t felt this in a while

[Verse 2]
My life is shifting (ooh ooh)
And it’s all because of you (ooh ooh ooh)
I need to get up and get over
But it’s hard getting over you

[verse 3]
Oh, (ooh ooh ooh)
I want you to be happy
You deserve the world (the world)
If I could pluck it out of the universe
You’d be the first one I’d call (first one I’d call)

[Verse 4]
(Ooh ooh ooh)
I hope someone loves you
In all the ways I never could (I never could)
One day, maybe five years from years from now
I’ll bump into you (bump into you)

[Verse 5]
So plеase never forgеt me
I know it is time (it is time)

[?] burns easier
Love you, and that’s a goodbye

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
...money in the bag
New jeans and the money
And I brought it with the baby Gmoney, oh, yeah
And we in the coupe, getting money
Fucking bitches, getting money
That's the type of shit that we do

[Verse 2: Lil George & The Kid LAROI]

[?] money (Ooh)
New jeans and the money
Ridin' solo with the money
Got the tank with the money
Go so fast with the money

[Verse 3: The Kid LAROI]
Got the money, got these stains
Got the 

[?], got the brain

[Intro: Carole Sager]
Hi Kanye, it's Carole and I'm gonna read you this lyric that I've got going
If you like it, where it's going, I'll finish it
I like it, it's called 'The Garden'

[Verse 1: Carole Bayer Sager & Kanye West]
There's been a lot of change in our lives
Some unexpected, some undefined
Don't wanna lose faith in each other
You are my brother, family
*gibberish*

[Chorus: Carole Bayer Sager & Kanye West]
Writings on the wall around us
Watching people fall around us
If we wake up to the call above us
Then I know it's gonna be alright
Living in a house that is divided
We all gotta pray that we'll be guided
Some way, somehow
We'll find our way
*gibberish*

[Verse 2: Carole Bayer Sager, Kanye West & Ant Clemons]
When will this world, when will this world come back together
And will we ever be okay
Don't wanna lose faith in each other
Okay, oh, I'm sorry, so that was the start
*gibberish*
I'mma take my badass kids over to the house, keep a crib (Writing's on the wall around us)
So this is the rap
And I 

[?] out the house, keep it lit (Watchin' people all around us)
And 

[?], keep her lit (Gotta wake up to the call above us)
*gibberish* (Then I know it's gonna be alright)
Gotta get back to the garden where peace was divine (It's comin' back around, we're enlightened)

[?] back, get back to the garden for the sake of mankind (Prayin' that we all stay guided)
*gibberish* (Lead the way)
And then, uh, writing our own story line

[Outro: Carole Bayer Sager & Kanye West]
And that's it, I-I didn't write more so you need to tell me how you feel, I'm here, okay
*gibberish*
Okay

[Intro]
Ah, well, the thing is with me, like-
I think right now I'm in love
And that I think it's the first time I've ever really been in love like
The times before I liked a girl and I
And I've really liked a girl and they've like-
That's why I was feeling like fuck love because like
I don't even want love
I didn't even want love at that point
I was like sometimes you just have to accept what you feel
You know what I'm saying? It is- it is what it is

[Chorus]
This isn't workin' (Yeah)
Why every time I like a bitch, I end up hurtin'? Yeah
It always feels right, right at the time, but it's never worth it, yeah
I always get my feelings so tired, this shit like a circus
Baby, nobody perfect, yeah

[Verse 1]
I do you wrong first so I know you never beat me to it, yeah
All of these mind games that you try to play, I'm used to it, woah
Baby, there's money on the line, I gotta get to it, woah
And you think that I'ma drive it all for you, you stupid, woah
I got my momma to feed, I got my brother to feed
I got my cousin back home tellin' all they friends about how they grew up with me, I can't let 'em down
If you ain't meet me before the scene, you wouldn't look at me now, girl, let's be honest
Told you I keep it one hundred so, baby, if I'm being honest

[Chorus]
This isn't workin' (Yeah)
Why every time I like a bitch, I end up hurtin'? Yeah
It always feels right, right at the time, but it's never worth it, yeah
I always get my feelings so tired, this shit like a circus
Baby, nobody perfect, yeah
This isn't workin' (Yeah)
Why every time I like a bitch, I end up hurtin'? Yeah
It always feels right, right at the time, but it's never worth it, yeah
I always get my feelings so tired, this shit like a circus
Baby, nobody perfect

[Verse 2]
They told me to let you go, and I couldn't agree more
This shit, only if they could know how hard it's gon' be, I don't wanna be alone
But I've overcome too much just for you to come and fuck it up
I cannot go out sad just 'cause I thought it was love
Calls, messages
All the stress is unnecessary
All the lies and the accusations
Girl, I feel like this shit never-ending
Calls, textin' me
I can't let you through my messages
Girl, I wish that we could work this out
But right now, I don't think we are meant to be

[Chorus]
This isn't workin' (Yeah)
Why every time I like a bitch, I end up hurtin'? Yeah
It always feels right, right at the time, but it's never worth it, yeah
I always get my feelings so tired, this shit like a circus
Baby, nobody perfect
This isn't workin' (Yeah)
Why every time I like a bitch, I end up hurtin'? Yeah
It always feels right, right at the time, but it's never worth it, yeah
I always get my feelings so tired, this shit like a circus
Baby, nobody perfect
Baby, nobody perfect
To put it plainly, we just couldn’t stop writing songs. To try and put it more poetically, it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice: to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music. We chose to wander deeper in. I’ve never done this before. In the past I’ve always treated albums as one-off eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released. There was something different with folklore. In making it, I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning. I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales. I loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found into your lives. So I just kept writing them.

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
From the past, I got rich up in the safe
Got some millies in the wild
Fly my racks out to L.A., bitch

[Chorus]

[?], uh
Give me your love, uh
Can we keep in touch I try...
...

[?], power, aye

[?] me 

[?], outta space
Pull up in all black
All went in, Starring in
It's the only one I'm in
Shuffle shit, the mountain's high
Above the tiny hills up high
Work goes in, tracks come out
I don't really leave the house
You know I have a small white ass
Boy beats changing Neptune's path

Yeah, The earth is flat, and you are bored
I talk shit to you through your Ouija board
I will still be here, after hating not ignored

They will name Planet X after me
But I'm surprised they recognized on the street
I'm ruler of the universe you cannot miss
Read at home, cry myself, tried my best

Mainstream home, picture wet, think afford the internet
Search my name, spend your net, seeing you must been my type
I only here, I fly the graph but I'm back behind the business class
High above, all the hits, a throne adrift is where I sit
Yeah, The earth is flat, and you are bored
I talk shit to you through your Ouija board
I will still be here, after hating not ignored

They will name Planet X after me
But I'm surprised they recognized on the street
I'm ruler of the universe you cannot miss
Read at home, cry myself, tried my best (Motherfucker)

Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

They will name Planet X after me

Please have me for Planet X
Will you name it after me
Please the greater or some blocks
Can you name one after me

Yeeaah
Who is gooooone?

Better, we do it better, we do it better
And you know that's why you like it
Anata wa sore o suki

[Verse 1]
Don't let us fool you, remember we told you
We're just a bit twisted, deranged
Always be like this, surrounded by misfits
I guess we were born on the fray

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Look how we killed all the princеs
The castle is ours and we'rе gonna reign
Look how we killed all the princes
The castle is ours and we're here to stay

[Chorus]
Play all night, we're not afraid
We are, we are, we are so alive, so alive
Burn so bright we're up in flames
We are, we are, we are so alive, so alive
Anata wa sore o suki

[Verse 2]
Four in the morning, the sun's coming up
But you know when they’re shutting us down
Don't try and stop us, got magic, got gold dust
You'll only be wasting your time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Look how we running this kingdom
This castle is ours and we're gonna reign
Look how we running this kingdom
This castle is ours and we're here to stay

[Chorus]
Play all night, we're not afraid
We are, we are, we are so alive, so alive
Burn so bright we're up in flames
We are, we are, we are so alive, so alive
Anata wa sore o suki

[Post-Chorus]
Better, we do it better, we do it better
And you know that's why you like it, like it
Better, we do it better, we do it better
And you know that's why you like it, like it
Better, we do it better, we do it better
And you know that's why you like it, like it
Better, we do it better, we do it better
And you know that's why you like it

[Chorus]
Play all night, we're not afraid
We are, we are, we are so alive, so alive
Burn so bright we're up in flames
We are, we are, we are so alive, so alive
Anata wa sore o suki

[Intro: Martin Luther King Jr.]
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere

[Verse 1]
Maybe I stare too much
Maybe not long enough
Funny how I forget to blink
But when you let down your hair
Dancin' like no one's there
I know I'm where I'm s'posed to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I say "I love you" under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest

[Chorus]
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months
And that's too much

[Verse 2]
Love the way you love your mom
Take on all your friends' problems
Still somehow stop the world for us, oh
I still relive that second
I met my biggest blessing
Prayed for you, look what God has done

[Pre-Chorus]
I say "I love you" under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest

[Chorus]
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months
And that's too much

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that’s it)

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
And I say, oh (Oh)
The way I breathe you in (In)
It's the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh
There's nothing like your touch
It’s the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
You ain't sure yet
But I'm for ya
All I can want, all I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There's no time, I wanna make more time
And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I’m in Mallorca
Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn’t hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that’s it)

[Verse 3: GIVĒON]
I get the feeling, so I'm sure (Sure)
Hand in my hand because I'm yours, I can't
I can’t pretend, I can't ignore, you're right for me
Don't think you wanna know just where I've been, oh
Done bein' distracted
The one I need is right in my arms (Oh)
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
(I get my light right from the source, yeah, yeah, that's it)
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)

[Verse 1]
You know you can call me if you need someone
I'll pick up the pieces if you come undone

[Pre-Chorus]
Painting stars up on your ceiling
'Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you can call me if you need someone

[Chorus]
I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (We all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone (Someone)
Feels to be someone who loses their way

[Verse 2]
You're looking for answers in a place unknown
You need the connection but you can't get close (Can't get close)

[Pre-Chorus]
Painting stars up on your ceiling
'Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you can call me if you need someone

[Chorus]
I need you to hold on (Hold on)
Heaven is a place not too far away (Away, yeah)
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (We all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on (Oh, oh, oh-woah, oh-woah)
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone
Feels to be someone who loses their way

[Post-Chorus]
Midnight 'til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you (I will be there for you)
Midnight 'til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you

[Chorus]
I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (We all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on (Hold on)
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone (Ooh, yeah)
Feels to be someone who loses their way

[Post-Chorus]
Midnight 'til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Midnight 'til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you

[Verse 1]
One touch and you got me stoned
Higher than I've ever known
You call the shots and I follow
Sunrise but the night's still young
No words, but we speak in tongues
If you let me, I might say too much

[Pre-Chorus]
Your touch blurred my vision
It's your world, and I'm just in it
Even sober I'm not thinkin' straight

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you
I'm out my head, so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Can't sleep 'cause I'm way too buzzed
Too late, now you're in my blood
I don't hate the way you keep me up

[Pre-Chorus]
Your touch blurred my vision
It's your world, and I'm just in it
Even sober I'm not thinkin' straight

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you
I'm out my head, so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you
I'm out my head, so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh
By you, ooh-ooh-ooh

M-M-Murda

[Verse: Justin Bieber]
He laid down his life, paid the price, yeah, get that
Comin' with the drama, lil' mama I ain't with that
Breakin' up the bread, pour the wine and I sip that
I ain't gotta flex, I already got a six pack
This that Hallelujah
I ain't tryna break it down but I'll break it to you
Fake friends come around but don't let 'em use you
I don't wanna lose you
Let the spirit move you
Ain't it funny how the money and the cars and the clothes
Weren't nun ‘til I met Jesus
And ain't it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe Him
Ain't it funny how the money and the cars and the clothes
Weren't nun ‘til I met Jesus
And ain't it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe Him

[Chorus: Quavo]
How many crosses on my neck, let me check
I need more (Ice), I need more (Jesus)
How many crosses on my neck, let me check
I need more (Ice), I need more (Jesus)
Holy water on the neck
And that's what I need more (Ice), I need more (Jesus)
Holy water on the neck
And that's what I need more (Ice), I need more (Go)

[Post-Chorus: Quavo]
Holy cross, let me shake the demons off (Holy)
He lost that prize in the sauce (Holy)
Pay your ties, young man, pay the cost (Ties)
Pay your ties, young man, pay the cost (Yeah)

[Verse: Justin Bieber]
He laid down his life, paid the price, yeah, get that
Comin' with the drama, lil' mama I ain't with that
Breakin' up the bread, pour the wine and I sip that
I ain't gotta flex, I already got a six pack
This that Hallelujah
I ain't tryna break it down but I'll break it to you
Fake friends come around but don't let 'em use you

Ain't it funny how the money and the cars and the clothes
Weren't nun' ‘til I met Jesus
And ain't it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe Him

[Verse 1]
When I'm in my thoughts sometimes
It's hard to believe I'm the person you think I am
The person that you tell me you love
I'm on my ten thousandth life
Nine thousand nine hundred nine and it slipped my hands
But this the one I'm not givin' up

[Pre-Chorus]
Night after night you fall asleep on me
I'm prayin' that I don't go back to who I was

[Chorus]
I feel like I don't deserve you tonight (Tonight)
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight (Tonight)
It's in the things that you show me (Show me)
I need you, don't let me go
Need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de-, I don't de-, I don't deserve you tonight

[Verse 2]
I can tend to hold things back
I need you more than I let you believe I do
'Cause you could think it might be too much, oh yeah
I don't wanna be my past
Oh, when we kiss, I'm alive and I feel brand new
There's nothing that I want more than us (Na-na-na-na-na)

[Pre-Chorus]
Night after night, you fall asleep on me (Sleep on me)
I'm prayin' that I don't go back to who I was (Oh no, no no, no)

[Chorus]
I feel like I don't deserve you tonight (Deserve you)
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight (Deserve you)
It's in the things that you show me (Oh)
I need you, don't let me go (No)
Need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de-, I don't de-, I don't deserve you tonight

[Bridge]
Somewhere in the sky (Yeah)
The way your body fits on mine
And when you give in to me
I'm so high, but I'm fallin' (Na-na-na), uh
And now my eyes are locked on you (Yeah)
As you dance around the room (Yeah)
And finally, I'm right where I belong, oh-oh, ohh

[Chorus]
I feel like I don't deserve you tonight (I don't deserve you)
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight (I don't deserve you)
It's in the things that you show me (I can't live without you)
I need you, don't let me go (Hey)
Need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de- (I don't), I don't de- (I don't)
I don't deserve you tonight (You)

[Outro]
(I don't deserve you)
No, I don't, no
(I don't deserve you)
Gotta need you
I can't breathe without you

[Intro: John Legend]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: John Legend]
One man come in the name of love
One man come and go
One man come, he justify
One man to overthrow

[Chorus: John Legend]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

[Verse 2: John Legend]
One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One man washed on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss

[Chorus: John Legend]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

[Post-Chorus: John Legend]
Ohh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3: John Legend]
Late afternoon, April 4
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride

[Chorus: John Legend]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro: Barack Obama]
Dr King once said that the art of the whole universe is long, but it bends towards justice. It bends towards justice, but here's the thing. It does not bend on its own

[Intro]
Take me back to LA
I'll be back again someday
Runnin' back to something, yeah
I stayed for our love

[Verse 1]
Take me back to our love
Another day, something wrong
Our love can't save you now
I know what you said out loud
And it hurts when I think about
The days that you aren't around
And I give that, it's something clear
Think clear, think clear
And it hurts when I know inside
Even though I, I know it's bad
I make you, I leave you crying

[Chorus]
Myself, myself
All myself, myself
It’s better that I’m by myself
Myself, myself
Myself, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm back
I was walkin' on the side
Whеre you called, mm
Save 'еm all, or I'll save you
Take whatever I find
Something numb, some, but I know
It hurts when I think about that day
When you gon' decide?
I hurt some, I know inside I'm feeling numb

[Chorus]
So I go by myself, by myself
Go by myself, oh, oh
By myself, by myself
By myself, by myself
When I was a little boy
(When I was just a boy)
And my mother would call my name
(When I was just a boy)
She'd say I had to be in the house by seven
(When I was just a boy)

But I'd stay out late at night
(When I was just a boy)
And when I'd finally get back in
Oh, I know she'd hit me, she'd hit me
She'd sit me on her knees and whip me

Oh, she'd hit me with a rock
She'd whip me with a rock, oh baby
She'd hit me (hit me with a rock)
She'd hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me
(Hit me with a rock)

And when I was grown to be a man
(Grown to be a man)
The minute the boss would call my name
(Grown to be a man)
And say I had to be in the office by seven
(Grown to be a man)
I'm a constipated man
(Grown to be a man)
And when I'd finally get back in
Oh, my boss'd hit me, he'd hit me
He'd tie me to a chair and whip me

Oh he'd hit me with a rock
He'd whip me with a rock, oh baby
He'd hit me (hit me with a rock)
He'd hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me
(Hit me with a rock)

When I was grown to be President
(Was the President)
The minute the congress'd call my name
(Was the President)
And said some papers had to be signed by Thursday
(Had to be signed by Thursday)

I'd fly away to Pakistan
(Was the President)
And the second that I'd get back home
Oh, I know they'd hit me, they'd hit me
With leather and chains they'd whip me

Oh, they'd hit me with a rock
They'd whip me with a rock, oh baby
They'd hit me. (Hit me with a rock)
They'd hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me
(Hit me with a rock)
Hit me, hit me, hit me
(Hit me with a rock)
They'd hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me
(Hit me with a rock)
Yah yah yah yah yah yah
(Hit me with a rock)
(Hit with a rock)
Ow, whaddaya doin' to me, get away from me
(Hit with a rock, oh baby)
(Hit with a rock)
(He's gettin' hit with a rock)
(He's gettin' hit with a rock, oh baby)
(Hit with a rock)
Wait a minute, hold it
I think he's dead
Let's leave
Let's get out of here, man

[Intro: Barack Obama]
A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see
Into your imagination
We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in the world of my creation
What we'll see will defy explanation

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
If you wanna view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Wanna change the world?
There's nothing to it

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there, you'll be free
If you truly wish to be
Oh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
If you wanna view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Wanna change the world?
There's nothing to it

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there, you'll be free
If you truly wish to be

[Spoken: Barack Obama]
America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves: If our children should live to see the next century? What change will they see? What progress will we have made? This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time

[Outro: Adam Levine]
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there, you'll be free
If you truly wish to be
I remember all the moments when I used to hold you near
I remember the sweet nothings you would whisper in my ear
Whenever we would hold my hand my heart would skip a beat
We were such a happy couple and my life was so complete
But times have changed and now you've left me for some other guy
It seems I'll never get you back no matter how I try
This emptiness inside of mе is tearing me apart
I gotta find a way that I can soothe this aching hеart

'Cause babe I get so lonely whenever you're not here
You never even call me on the phone
So I'm gonna buy a Hustler and a six pack of beer
And have a little orgy on my own

I can't believe you'd ever go and leave me for that chump
So what if he's a millionaire, and I work in a dump?
So what if he makes more in an hour, than I make in a day?
He lights his pipes with dollar bills and bathes in Perrier
Well I'm not much into culture, and I don't drive no fancy cars
And I couldn't tell a dirt clod from a plate of caviar
I'd like to meet this friend of yours, so bring him by my place
I'll have a friendly chat with him and stab him in the face
'Cause you know I get so lonely whenever you're not here
You never even call me on the phone
So I'm gonna buy a Hustler and a six pack of beer
And have a little orgy on my own

I can't forget the day you put my love back on the shelf
It was then I knew I had to get a firm grip on myself
For other folks this solitude would be a living Hell
But when times get rough I still can handle myself pretty well
It's hard on me remembering the way that we were then
But when I read my magazines, I feel myself again
I must admit, from time to time, my memory still lingers
But the only pain I feel is from the blisters on my fingers

Babe you know I get so lonely whenever you're not here
You never even call me on the phone
So I'm gonna buy a Hustler and a six pack of beer
And have a little orgy on my own

Yes I'm gonna buy a Hustler and a six pack of beer
And have a little orgy
Have a little orgy
I'll have a little orgy on my own
One, two, a-one, two, three, four

Well I, can't go to the park
I can't go to work
I can't do nothin'
I gotta stay in my house like a jerk

How come I always lose
My car has blown a fuse
Oh yeah
I got hydraulic fluid leakin' in my shoes
And the dead car battery blues

You know, can't visit my girlfriend
I can't go to school
I can't go anywhere
Gotta stay in my room like a fool

'Cause I got grease in my hair
My Belvedere's in disrepair
Oh yeah
I got hydraulic fluid leakin' in my shoes
And the dead car battery blues
So I, went to see my mechanic
He said, "Okay, now what is wrong"
I told him my car wouldn't start
He said, "This shouldn't take very long"

So he replaced all my plugs and my points
And he looked at my carburetor
He took out my engine and turned it around
And then seventeen hours later

He looked at my headlights and said
"Son, how long have these things been on"
I told him, "Oh, about three or four weeks"
He said, "Buddy, I know what's wrong"
"But I hate to be the one to give you the news"
"You got the dead car battery blues"

So now I, can't go to my office
Can't work on my job
I might as well lock myself up in my room
And live my life like a slob

How come I always lose
My Belvedere has blown a fuse
Oh yeah
I got hydraulic fluid leakin' in my shoes
And the dead car battery blues
Hey! I left my sandwich in the backseat!
Well, woke up this morning
With a Big Mac in my hand
What fries, whose fries
Where's my Hot Apple Pies
Must be a joke
I can't believe there's no Coke
Thank you, thank you, thank you
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Thottie, thottie on the name tag
Quick nap when the plane lag
Overdressed with my late ass
I'm still in coach, so I can't brag
Perfect titties with the trained ass
Bitch, act your age since I can't ask
Got a lot if it can't last
Some are ready for the rain-pass, but I ain't mad
Hallelujah, all the music therapeutic
Therapy makes me go to sleep
Back up on my feet, back to doing me
Guess that you could say I'm back into the team
Way that shit is lookin', now it's time to eat
Gotta get a plate, call me for the green
Just to say my grace, I gotta see a priest
Just to say my gracе, I gotta see a priest

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
All the boys move around and thеy watchin' me
With my girls in the back in the VIP
And I'm dancin' just to keep 'em on their toes
And when I leave with you, I keep it on the low
All the boys move around and they watchin' me
With my girls in the back in the VIP
And I'm dancin' just to keep 'em on their toes
And when I leave with you, I keep it on the low

[Intro]
30, you a fool for this one

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I ain't gon' lie, I thought about yo' ass every night
Wish you would've came and saw me 'fore you took a flight
I know you mad, but we only got one life
Do you remeber nights? Sippin' Miller Lite
I was sippin' drink, we was ridin' 'round
With the top down, talkin' 'bout wedding rings
Like we always do, you said you wanna kid
Well I want one, too, but you been trippin' hard
Girl that's not a lie, that's a fact
Thought you did forget 'bout the tat on yo' back
Of the Big Boat, yeah that's me, yeah that's that
Let's keep it real, girl, your new nigga wack
When you wanna come home, I'm ready
Yo' new nigga my son, you call him baby, but I'm daddy
Why you let this nigga drive you 'round in a Cadi'
That came from 04, girl, what the hell you want?
You must like him, 'cause he grown, that must be the thing
I'm a young nigga and I take care of my team

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
You hate seein' niggas walk around in my crib
You hate seein' niggas sleep on couches and on floors
You hate when my niggas go everywhere that we go
You hate when my niggas try to holla’ at some hoes
You hate when my niggas gotta show up, sippin' fours
You hate when my niggas walk around totin’ poles
You hate when my niggas in the backseat of the whip
Fuck you, damn, bitch goin' suck another tip

[Bridge: Lil Yachty]
You hate when my niggas all fill up the VIP
But my niggas came first, and loosin' 'em is worse

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
But I fuck wit' you, and I really hope that you can learn to like my crew
It ain't that much that I ask for, I'ma get 'em stamps in yo' passport
Make it rain, make it rain like you dancin'
But it’s just me and you, we romancin'
You so quick to kill the love Charles Manson
I miss everything we had, girl, what happened?
And it's all 'cause of the gang
Damn, that shit a shame
You could bring yo' bitches 'round and I won't say a thing
Girl, what's wrong, why don't you fuck wit' my friends?
Ain't nobody home, we could fuck in the den
Damn, she said "why you nice as you am?
I love everything about you, except yo' friends
But girl, you can get to steppin’, gon' head
Gang goes first, yeah, you heard what I say

[Chorus: Lil Yachty & PnB Rock]
You hate seein' niggas walk around in my crib
You hate seein' niggas sleep on couches and on floors
You hate when my niggas go everywhere that we go
You hate when my niggas tryna holla’ at some hoes
You hate when my niggas got the shots, sippin' fours
You hate when my niggas walk around totin' poles (Poles)
You hate when my niggas in a backseat of the whip (Of the whip)
Fuck you, damn, bitch goin' suck another tip (Oh yeah)

[Verse 3: PnB Rock]
Aye, I know you hate anyway

Girl, you say I always try and treat you like a thottie
Gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
Wait, wait, wait, I treat you better though
Not like tgem other hoes
Yeah, you fuck 'em other niggas, but I get you wetter, though
And yeah, I fuck wit' other bitches, but I keep your neck on froze

You know I fuck wit' you, can't get enough of you
I am in love wit' you, sometimes I think 'bout cuffin' you
But you so mixy girl so that's just a dub for you
No, I can't fuck wit' you that way, that way
You go, your way, I go, my way

[Chorus: Lil Yachty & PnB Rock]
You hate seein' niggas walk around in my crib (My crib)

You hate when my niggas walk around totin’ poles
You hate when my niggas in a backseat at the whip (Whip)
Fuck you then bitch go and suck another a tip (Suck another tip)
Oh my la-di-da-da
Wally, where'd you get those glasses?
Those are the freakiest glasses I've ever seen
Can I try 'em on?
You see, I'm goin' to a party tonight and I could be so clean
Are you goin' with that same dame?
You know, the one with the beautiful chest and the gorgeous mouth
'Cause if you are, I was wonderin' if she had a sister
'Cause Wally, that dame is so fine
Eeh-hee!

Check it out Wally, huh, I'm on the prowl tonight
'Cause my baby don't love me no more
Shе said, she said, "Well, maybe I do, just not likе I did before"

Ain't that a trip, Wally?
You know, I'd give her all my money 'fore I'd give it all to Uncle Sam
Can you believe it, Wally?
Where'd you get those glasses?
Those are the freakiest glasses I've ever seen
Ooh
Wally, can you tell me why did my baby leave?
La-la-la-di-da, oh my la-di-da
Wally, come on, go out with me tonight
We'll tear it up like we used to do
You wanna bring your lady, it's alright
But if you'd rather stay at home tonight, it's cool
Oh no, I understand
We'll hook up sometime when I find another
Then the four of us, I mean, the four of us can
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, my la-di-da

It's too late for sympathy
Whatever will be will be
I'm goin' to a party
And if I don't find somebody, somebody will find me
Huh, what am I gonna do?
She was the only one in the whole world that I could talk to

Wally, where'd you get those glasses?
Those are the freakiest glasses I've ever seen
Ooh
La-la-la-di-da, oh, my la-di-da
Ooh
La-la-la-di-da, oh, my la-di-da
La-la-la-di-da, oh, my la-di-da
La-la-la-di-da, oh, my la-di-da
La-la-la-di-da, oh, my la-di-da
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, my la-di-da

[Verse 1]
Teacher, teacher
I'm really not lovin' you
But you're the teacher
I try to do what you want me to
I know you get lonely
But you gotta know
It wasn't love
Let me tell you honey
I'm just a young girl
Don't think I know it enough

[Chorus]
Teacher, teacher
I don't wanna get an A
Teacher, teacher
There's gotta be a better way

[Verse 2]
I'm sick and tired of makin' plans
Without makin' up my mind (Make up your mind)
Teacher, teacher
Can't you see? I just need a little time
I know you've been cryin'
'Cause you spеnt the night alone
And I cry me a rivеr
That's why I don't deliver
We'll have to do it on the phone

[Chorus]
Teacher, teacher
I don't wanna get an A
Teacher, teacher
There's gotta be a better way

[Verse 3]
(Woohoo, yeah)
Teacher, teacher
I'm not really tryin' to get you down
But why should you get used to somebody
Who won't be around
I know you get discouraged
'Cause you wanna get it all the time
Honey, I can't let you use my body
The same way you use my mind

[Chorus]
Teacher, teacher
I don't wanna get an A
Teacher, teacher
There's gotta be a better way
Teacher, teacher
I don't wanna get an A
Teacher, teacher
There's gotta be a better way
Teacher, teacher
I don't wanna get an A
Teacher, teacher
There's gotta be a better way
Teacher, teacher
I don't wanna get an A
Teacher, teacher
There's gotta be a better way
Teacher, teacher
I don't wanna get an A
Teacher, teacher
There's gotta be a better way
Teacher, teacher
I don't wanna get an A

[Intro: John Legend]
Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now (I guess I'll get up from behind the piano)
I'm ready to go right now (Woo, let's go)
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

[Verse 1: John Legend]
I see you move, I'm checking your smile
Workin' your back like it's going out of style
Shake just a little bit faster
Shake just a little now, girl
Dying to meet you, so let's mess around
Got an obsession with us getting down
Come just a little bit closer
I just need permission, so

[Chorus: John Legend]
Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
We could go all night
Givе me the green light
I'm ready to go right now
I'm rеady to go right now

[Refrain: André 3000 & John Legend]
A-one, two, three, green light
Well, if it's what it seems like
The way you're movin', baby, lets me know that's it's gon' be right
I'm (I'm ready to go right now), ah, ah
I'm (I'm ready to go right now)
A-one, two, three, red light
I wanna see what your bed's like
But if I be your buddy, get you studied, is yo' head right?
I'm (I'm ready to go right now), ah, ah
I'm (I'm ready to go right now)

[Verse 2: John Legend & André 3000]
Do I have a girlfriend? Well, technically no (No)
If you'll be my girlfriend, then I'll make it so
You'll be my only true lover
No competition, no other (No other)
Baby, it's just the thrill of the chase
I've got a feeling I'm winning this race
Baby, I'm gettin' much closer
I just need permission, so

[Chorus: John Legend]
Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
We could go all night
Give me the green light
I'm ready to go right now (We gotta hear André a little bit)
I'm ready to go right now (C'mon)

[Refrain: André 3000 & John Legend]
A-one, two, three, green light
Well, if it's what it seems like
The way you're movin', baby, lets me know that's it's gon' be right
I'm (I'm ready to go right now), ah, ah
I'm (I'm ready to go right now)
A-one, two, three, red light
I wanna see what your bed's like
But if I be your buddy, get you studied, is yo' head right?
I'm (I'm ready to go right now), ah, ah
I'm (I'm ready to go right now)

[Verse 3: André 3000 & John Legend]
So I went hard like Medusa starin' at me
I told her, "Let's go, let's blow this lame nigga factory"
She said, "What kind of girl do you think that I are?
The kind that you meet in a bar?
You think you can get whatever you want 'cause you some kind of star?"
No, I'm a comet, I just want you, woman
Hey, if I were you, it would be me that I'd go home with
Three, the one and only, one thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl, "Ooh, he can get it", admit it
You did it, let's hop a cab and split it
I'm kiddin', we both goin' to where you livin'
Aha, I got you giggling like a piglet, oh, that's the ticket?
I hope you more like Anita Baker than Robin Givens
No, I don't know that lady, so let me quit it
I'm just style freein', freestylin', which I seldom do
(I'm ready to go right now) This is what I'm tellin' you
To the bed I'm nailin' you
(I'm ready to go right now) Like I've been in jail for two
Years and then they let me loose

[Outro: John Legend & Alicia Keys]
Give me the green light (André 3000, y'all, ooh, boy)
Yes, 2008, oh my God
That is a cat right there-right there
Okay, while we at it, let's go

[Intro: John Legend & Alicia Keys]
C'mon, happy Juneteenth! (Ayy)
Celebration
Wake up, everybody
Shout out to Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes
Teddy Pendergrass, rest in peace
Wait for it
Wait for it

[Verse 1: John Legend]
Wake up everybody, no more sleeping in bed
No more backward thinking, time for thinking ahead
The world has changed so very much from what it used to be
There is so much hatred, war, and poverty
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Melanie Fiona]
Wake up all the teachers, time to teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen to what you have to say
'Cause they're the ones who's coming up and the world is in their hands
When you teach the children, teach them the very best you can
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: John Legend & Melanie Fiona]
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be, oh, no
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah, just you and me

[Verse 3: John Legend]
Wake up all the doctors, make the old people well
They're the ones who suffer and who catch all the hell (Catch all the hell)
But they don't have so very long before their Judgment Day (Oh)
So won't you make them happy before they pass away?
Oh, yeah

[Verse 4: Melanie Fiona]
Wake up, all the builders time to build a new land
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand
The only thing we've gotta do is put it in our mind
Surely things'll work out, 'cause they do every time
Yeah

[Chorus: John Legend & Alicia Keys]
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be, oh-oh
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah, just you and me (Mm, yes, we do)

[Outro: Alicia Keys & John Legend]
Right on time, yes, mane (Yeah)
Melanie Fiona is so fire (Melanie), big love to you
I wanna play this song
That is the first time that I ever wrote—
Wrote with and worked with Tony! Toni! Toné! (Ooh)
Um, and man, oh, man
Those brothers are so crazy
So crazy, the musicianship and the whole thing is outrageous
So definitely have to play, this is one of my favorites
I remember, I li— I played the piano of this a hundred times
Before I could ever find the words
This was one of those ones
You probably have those (Yes)
And for whatever reason, the piano knew what it wanted to do but the words didn't
Until finally, big love to Jermaine Paul, too
It went like this

[Intro: John Legend & Alicia Keys]
So I came on the scene in 2004
After, you know, a couple features
Kanye's album College Dropout comes out in February
And then all the labels that were turnin' me down before, they were like
"Oh, um, now that Kanye's sold this many records
I think it's time to sign the next thing out of his camp"
And so we come back with the same demo that we had before (And he was like, "Wow!")
But all of a sudden it sounded so much bеtter ("Wow!")
All these songs that madе my album Get Lifted were pretty much done by then
Including this one (Mm)

[Verse: John Legend & Alicia Keys]
Come on and go with me (See?)
There's something new for you to see
Come on and go with me, yeah
There's something new for you to see
Just relax
Just relax (Mm)

[Outro: John Legend & Alicia Keys]
And then we put my first single out
And it's a good breakup song, here we go (Hit it)

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, message from the DOOM fans
Whoops, who left the whips for the coon's hands?
I heard they want equity in the broom brands
Royalties from the cotton fields, 40 acres of moon land
Scram, quick before the portal ends
Mind the coral, especially around your dorsal fins
Could be horrible, you can go from adorable to barely morgue-able
I'm just warning you of possible injuries
If you wanna live long as centipedes
You gotta learn how to make lemonade to lemon trees
Going rate's five dollars a sip
Pro tip, no rips, I only smoke when the Pope's picked
Take the whole trip, with the old swole swift
Ex-dread locked, headlock with both pits
Living off borrowed time, the clock tick faster
MCs in the class, observe the slick master
Master of man kept a handle on the craft
Like a fondue of fine-blended words that you love like a Mom Duke
Verbal diversion for the pocket-pick
To fund your favorite main chick used whip shopping trips
It's carefully constructed
Precisely overseen and then merrily conducted
Plus, barely interrupted, rarely ever fucked with
DOOM make a Midas out of everything he touches
And that's how the vibe goes
Two trails of rust running from out of the eye holes
Been crying like a grown man
I promise to make rappers snatch mics outta they own hands
Exactly how you taught us
We'll take it from here, look how far you brought us
DOOM

[Intro: Barack Obama]
Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and independents across this great land — enough! This moment — this moment —  this election, is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive

[Verse 1: Usher]
Every day he wakes up in his million dollar home
His life is like a video, the only reality he knows
He jumps inside of his hundred thousand dollar car
Cruising up the boulevard
Driving pass people living hard
Complains about the gas prices, but still supports the war
He complains about his 6-figure salary, tax to feed the poor
He doesn't understand the homeless, doesn't think it's genocide
That millions die from three lethal letters
So he does sh— to make it better
And I'm thinkin' new

[Chorus: Usher]
Everybody wanna touch the sky
And nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly
Everybody wants Heaven
If you don't wanna sacrifice
You don't say nothing
Don't say nothing

[Post-Chorus: Usher & Barack Obama]
(Ooh, hush) Don't say nothing
That's the promise of America — the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper
(Ooh, hush) Don't say nothing

[Verse 2: Usher]
She watches television full of fabricated show
Thinks the world is just a joke, but oh, little does she know
That there's a real life drama happening right outside her door
'Cause she continues to ignore, but she's like the TV
The story repeats, yeah
She's searching through the channels
Skipping pass the news
She's more entertained by lies and gossip
'Cause it hurts to see the truth
She complains about the nation
Thinks it's a waste of time to vote
She says the world has been corrupted forever
No one tries to make it better
And I'm thinking who

[Chorus: Usher & Barack Obama]
It's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America. And that's why I'm running for president of the United States
Everybody wanna touch the sky (Ooh)
And nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly (Scared to fly)
Everybody wants Heaven (Heaven)
If you don't wanna sacrifice (Oh)
Don't say nothing, no
Don't say nothing

[Post-Chorus: Usher]
(Ooh, hush)
Don't say nothing (Hand to your brother)
Ooh, hush (Hand to your sister)
(Don't say nothing)
(Ooh, hush) (Don't say nothing)
Ooh, hush (Don't say nothing)

[Spoken Outro: Barack Obama]
The fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper. That's the promise we need to keep. That's the change we need right now. You can decide whether we're gonna travel the same worn path, or whether we will chart a new course. That offers real hope for the future

[Intro: Barack Obama]
There's something happening when Americans who are young in age and in spirit, who've never participated in politics before, turn out in numbers we have never seen because they know in their hearts, that this time must be different

[Verse 1: John Mayer]
Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see evеrything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
Wе just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

[Chorus: John Mayer]
So we keep waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

[Verse 2: John Mayer]
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
But when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

[Chorus: John Mayer]
That's why we're waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

[Guitar Solo]

[Spoken: Barack Obama]
What gives me the most hope is the next generation - the young people whose attitudes and beliefs and the openness to change have already made history in this election

[Chorus: John Mayer]
And we're still waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

[Post-Chorus: John Mayer]
Now we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change

[Outro: Barack Obama & Crowd]
We want change
We want change
We want change
We want change
We want change
That's what's happening in America right now. Change is what's happening in America
Rain in the forest
Rain on the trees
Raining down on me
Rainclouds hide the sun
Rainclouds hide the sun

Clouds in the valley
Clouds in the sky
Clouds, please, pass me by

Sail the ocean, sail across the sea (sail across the sea)
Send a card to me (send a card to me)
Wind's gonna blow (wind's gonna blow)
And if you go (oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oh)

Talkin' 'bout sun in the desert (sun in the desert)

Rain in the forest (rain in the forest)
Rain on the trees (rain on the trees)
Raining down on me
Rainclouds hide the sun, pretty woman, in the morning

Rainclouds hide the sun (rainclouds hide the sun)

Rain in the forest (rainclouds hide the sun)
Rain on the trees (rainclouds hide the sun)
Rainclouds hide the sun

He already made me tired
Making me look like a liar

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
But tonight, tonight, tonight

In the devil's game

Devil's game
Oh, oh, oh, oh
The devil's game
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
I've been in the spotlight for some time with you, babe
But what good is all this fame and lust
If you always ruin the whole fucking thing
God knows I'm not the same old good girl anymore
I'm trying to play the bad bitch that turned me on
Today will be the last move
And I know you'll miss the way I used turn you on

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande & Both]
I'm tired of the same routine
I'm wanting to spill
I'm wanting a change of pace
He already made me tired
Making me look like a liar

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Ariana Grande]
But tonight, tonight, tonight
I'll get high to get into a fight
I'll show you that I ain't just a bright girl
Tonight I'll stop playing this devil's game
I'll throw all the blame, the names in the flames
In the devil's game

[Post-Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Ariana Grande]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Devil's game
Oh, oh, oh, oh
The devil's game
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus & Ariana Grande]
Tonight, tonight, tonight (Baby)
Tonight, tonight, tonight (Baby)
Tonight, tonight, tonight (Baby, ayy)

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande & Both]
I'll get high to get into a fight (I'll get, yeah yeah)
I'll show you that I ain't just a bright girl
Tonight I'll stop playing this devil's game (Tonight, tonigh, baby, ayy)
I'll throw all the blame, the names in the flames
In the devil's game

[Intro]
I said I was gon’ tell my bro to run that back, mhm
I told that mothafucka turn that shit up, I’m bored as a mothafucka, no cap, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Pshh)

[Chorus]
(Yeah) bring that in, I need some more (Oh, yeah)
She went in my life, she want some more (Yeah)
She wanna be more than just one of my hoes (Oh, yeah)
Trust don’t come easy, girl fall in line (Yeah)
Two chopsticks they both loaded, that’s on my slime (Oh, yeah)
Need top from her best friend for wasting time (Hm, hm, hm)

[Verse]
Baby, is you ridin’ trough peace and violence?
Would you love me when I’m broke just likе we on a island?
Can you keep the boy calm when thеy all wylin’?
Can you keep the boy sane?, sometimes I go insane, I got you on my brain
Thinking ‘bout the pain that come with this fame
That weighs on my heart, that eat like a shark trough the dark in my thoughts
(Yeah) I make it look easy, baby believe me
Tell me why to trust you?, you might deceive me
Tell me why to trust you?, you might just leave me

[Chorus]
(Yeah) bring that in, I need some more (Oh, yeah)
She went in my life, she want some more (Yeah)
She wanna be more than just one of my hoes (Oh, yeah)
Trust don’t come easy, girl fall in line (Yeah)
Two chopsticks they both loaded, that’s on my slime (Oh, yeah)
Need top from her best friend for wasting time (Hm, hm, hm)

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Who let the dope boys out?
Thank God you let me crash on your couch
Who's my God that I’m prayin' to now?
Early two-thous, they tried to jump me in, Latino protection
Any direction, you gave me your blessing
Texan, I text him, I told him I got him
Told him I made it to Hollywood, all it took was a summer to fail
A platinum record not gon' keep my Black ass out of jail
Truth prevails, this is real, miss my brother
I love my mother, drove all the way to Cali’ just to check up on me
Made her go home, felt the virus
Web of life is my weed, false dreams stripped by silence
Deals they had us sign, for years, it had mе blind
Think I had to hit rewind and think about why I do shine
Got my cousin doin' time, hе was barely pushin' dimes
My whole family cursed, now get the fuck out my ride

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Now, get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I (Get the fuck out)
Fuck with me, give no shit, guess my ignorance is bliss
Now get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I
Nothin’, nothin’, nothin', nothin’, nothin'
So get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I
If a killer say shit, then get these motherfuckers— (Get the fuck out)

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Live from the gutter, blood like red paint spills
You niggas ain't alpha, you're incels
You normies ain’t a part of the script, doxx your house with Crips
Pop shit, now you got content, constant
Where to begin? A veteran with medicine pen
Let 'em all in, treat 'em like they next of my kin
Checkin' your chin way before the record begin
Niggas blow a lot of smoke like they breath in the wind
Ain't no pretend, tell you how it is, how it go
What do you know, when you start escapin' your soul
White on the street, walking the beat like Abbey Road
Truth be told, no such thing as real nigga mode
Through the lights, camera, action, glamor, glitters and gold
Unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
No peace on the street, so I'm clutchin' my heat
Gotta watch for these savages roamin' the street (Go)

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract & Jabari Manwa]
I- I float (Go)
I'ma see ya when I do
Now get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I
(Yeah, nigga, we back up in this thang)
Now get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide
(Yeah, new machine)
They said I'd never, ever see the sunlight (Tell 'em)
I thought I'd never, ever see the sunlight
They said I'd never, ever see the sunlight

[Outro: Joba, Kevin Abstract, & Merlyn Wood]
Sometimes, it drives me crazy (Look at the sky!)
This all I got for you (Niggas!)
That sunlight, it'll drive you crazy
What is God to you niggas?
(Goddamn, motherfucker, ugh)

[Verse 1]
Rake at the moon where the river flows
Cut from the cloth of the winter's cold
Bound by the voice that no one hears
I've been around in a way for years
Stray from the heart the more that you know
All gussied up with no place to go
Tableside with one of your dreams
Get what you want and not what you need

[Verse 2]
Parlor games and 6 o'clock news
Hands of a stranger touching you
Wide awake encased in a dream
Everything is not as it seems
All your time is heaven sent
Days and nights all start to blend
It's not like this town to set you free
The more you look, the less you see

[Chorus]
The table's set, the rose is out
You know what this is
Miles away from places you have been
The call was made to pull the shades
The start of something new
Still nothing makes me feel the way
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do

[Verse 3]
The ones they say have come here before
All gather 'round the corridor
I can't seem to place your name
Know the face that I can't explain
In my mind, you're everything
Lips don't move, but voices still ring
The light inside has lost its glow
The more you see, the less you know

[Chorus]
The table's set, the rose is out
You know what this is
Miles away from places you have been
The call was made to pull the shades
The start of something new
Still nothing makes me feel the way
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do

[Outro]
The seasons change
My mind erased
The stars all fade
But one remains the same
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
Must I, your grace
Unveil the face
Only to say
Nothing takes the place?
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
...I could

[Chorus]
Hold you down, hold you down

[?] your side, yeah

[?]
Hold you down, hold you down

[?] your side

[Verse 1]
We tried, we tried, we tried and tried some more
Investigated, yeah, we unlocked every door
But then we chose to say goodbye
And no no no no, no no no no no no no
Yeah, we had to choose a different life

[Pre-Chorus]
But sometimes I go to sleep so I can meet you in my dreams
The only place where we can be more than just a memory

[Chorus]
So I close my eyes to go back in time
Yeah, I closе my eyes and therе you are mine
Wherever you are tonight, will you meet me in my dreams?

[Verse 2]
My heart's still pounding, yeah, it wakes me up
Eight hours later and it's never quite enough
Two different worlds that we're cut between
Just five more minutes and I'll face reality
'Cause that's where we know that we have to be

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but sometimes I go to sleep so I can meet you in my dreams
It's the only place we can be more than just a memory

[Chorus]
Yeah, I close my eyes to go back in time
I close my eyes and there you are mine
So wherever you are tonight, will you meet me in my dreams?

[Outro]
Wherever you are tonight
Will you meet me in my dreams?
Lyrics from Snippet

...won't forget
You used to wait for me at the crib
I don't know why it changed, but it did
You used to wait for me, yeah
You used to wait for me

[?] hope you're proud of yourself...

[Verse 1]
Blind attraction, chain reaction
What you have is mine
Persian ivy running widly
Ashes left behind
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Closer now to the edge
Winds are blowing, fires glowing
Dancing in your head

[Verse 2]
Grand occasion conversation
Light the crowded room
No one knows which way we're going
But we'll get there soon
Run from the mountain, poison the fountain
Just for the peace of mind
Back of the alley, they seem to rally
All people of their kind

[Chorus]
Close your еyes and what do you see?
Is it a man or masked machine?
Is thе world I belong to just a shade of light?
It's just time in disguise

[Verse 3]
Congregated late arrival only passing through
Prairie garden cold hardened
Waiting here for you
So come a little closer, come a little closer
Closer now to the edge
Bold distraction taking action
Going where you're led

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and what do you see?
Is it a man or masked machine?
Is the world I belong to just a shade of light?

[Bridge]
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Closer now to the edge
Winds are blowing, fires glowing
Dancing in your head

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and what do you see?
Is it a man or masked machine?
Is the world I belong to just a shade of light?
It's just time in disguise

[Outro]
Come a little closer, come a little closer

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
All-American self-hatred runs deep
White boys all I see whenever I sleep
Niggas think I think these thoughts on purpose
But I knew 'bout *NSYNC 'fore cash could rule me
Colonized minds by masters and slaves
They both hate niggas that like niggas the same
Homophobic, I tried to gangbang
I tried to get laid, I had to get paid
Hopped off the ship, I land on my feet
In Corpus Christi, I got my own street
Runnin' this shit like it's a track meet
I had to go back home, I seen too many niggas die in a week
Get my dogs black wealth, let 'em live well
What a miracle we dreamed, a million stories to tеll
You are now tuned in, baby, to the nеw classic
New Machine, keep the peace, keep 'em dancing

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Don't shoot up the party
Don't shoot up the party
Please, please
Don't shoot up the party
Don't shoot up the party
Please, please
Don't shoot up the party
Don't shoot up my party
Please, please (Please, please)
Please, please (Please, please)

[Verse 2: Matt Champion & Joba]
This a jam for your whims and your woes
For the people in the back standing on they tippy-toes
Don't give a damn what the journalist wrote
Always dead inside like they in the catacombs
On the prowl like a lion in his throne
Watchin' for the prey that might slit his throat
It's 'bout time that I let your ass know
Y'all deserve the guillotine even more (Oh, oh)
Kiss my ass, treat my balls like it's mistletoe
Fuck class, get cash by the truckload
Latest album with my dogs, but the city closed
You in for a hell of a ride (Oh, oh)
This a good time, know I'm damn right
Order every single bottle of the best wine
Fuck if I know, need it all though
Dedicate this to my family in Chicago

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract & Joba]
Stay down, I'm sorry
Stay down, you're ugly (Oh, oh)
The people need more of the money
These white people don't love me (Oh, oh)
Stay down, I'm sorry
Stay down, I'm hungry (Oh, oh)
I don't need you to love me
Fuck you, come fuck me
I know

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Matt Champion]
Don't shoot up the party
Don't shoot up the party
Please, please
Don't shoot up the party
Don't shoot up the party
Please, please
Don't shoot up the party
Don't shoot up my party
Please, please (Please, please)
Please, please (Please, please)

[Verse 3: Joba]
What's the issue?
Why you gotta grab that pistol?
Think about who gon' miss you
Never know what I been through
What's the issue?
Why you gotta grab that pistol?
Think about who gon' miss you
Never know what they might do

[Outro: bearface & Kevin Abstract]
Don't shoot up the party
Don't shoot up the p—
Who you really wanna try to step to?
Who you really wanna try to step to?
Ohh, yeah
Lyrics from Snippets

[Chorus]
She said she love me, I know it's a lie
So I pour me a cup, throw it up to the sky
But her jealousy, see it all in her eyes
But they envy me, I'm not here for the talk
They said that they love me, I know it's a lie
Yeah I was down bad, I was broke, oh my God
But they envy me, so I gotta be cautious
But that jealousy, it was never your time, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Shawty fell in love with this lifestyle
Heard she fell in love with the sights, no
Heard she for my love for the night, night
Still no talkin' bout it, supposed to pipe down

[Verse]
...Stay, stay, stay

[?] too late, late, late
Shawty you can't play a player, yeah

[Chorus]
We in the air, soon as the check clear, we don't even care
Bring her here, let the top down, 2-6 with no rear
In the trunk where the engine be, that bitch in the mirror
Can't compare to the life I live, they stop and they stare
I'm a player, no remote control, good weed in my soul
Say I'm old, I feel like I'm young, that's what I been told
I done sold hundreds of millions of records cross the globe
Diamonds cold, soon as I hop off the plane, all legs unfold

[Verse]
Joint already rolled, new crib, got her own
Take me out for something to eat then I'm getting dome
I'll call you, bitch, don't call me, stop blowing up my phone
Instead of beefing with you I rather be alone
Ridin' around picking that kush, she out of zone
Bitch so bad makin' me wish she had a clone
Big ass diamonds look like a flash' when I roll
Big ass player, get me that cash then I'm gone
I'ma need a bigger bag
My niggas need a bigger bag
My bitch need a bigger bag
Fly private on a plane don't need a mask

[Chorus]
We in the air, soon as the check clear, we don't even care
Bring her here, let the top down, 2-6 with no rear
In the trunk where the engine be, that bitch in the mirror
Can't compare to the life I live, they stop and they stare
I'm a player, no remote control, good weed in my soul
Say I'm old, I feel like I'm young, that's what I been told
I done sold hundreds of millions of records cross the globe
Diamonds cold, soon as I hop off the plane, all legs unfold
Lyrics from Snippets

[Verse 1]
Kiss me, dangerous
Been so lost without you all around me
Gettin' anxious
Leave me, don't look back, it's all about you

[Pre-Chorus]
In the dark right now
Feeling lost, but I like it
Comfort in my sins, it's all about me
Only calm right now
And the taste of resentment
Simmer in my skin
It's all about

[Chorus]
Bloodstain on my shirt
New bitch on my nerves
Old nigga got curved
Going back on my word
Damn, bitch, you like thirty
Stealing all of my worth
Still question my affection
Let you all in my mental
Got me lookin' so desperate
Damn, nigga-

[Verse 1]
He was kinda like a summer fling
Hot and heavy through the April rain
May & June he was after me
By July it was getting hypnotic
So he kinda started being my babe
I don't really wanna say his name
All I know is I liked his drink
All my girls say 'ooh' is you feel me

[Pre-Chorus]
I saw you there
I can't get you out my sight, boy
Better go and get another drink
'Cause you ain't getting none of mine, no

[Chorus]
(Right to the left to the break of dawn
It don't stop 'till the early mornin')
Oooh...

Baby, baby, baby, yeah
(Right to the left to the break of dawn
It don't stop 'till the early mornin')
Oooh...
Tell me what you're sippin' on
Baby, baby, baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
What I feel is more than a crush
Then again, it's not quite love
Just enough to fill my cup
Whatever you do just keep it flowin'
So tell me how you like it, babe
On the rocks or straight up, babe?
Oh boy don't be afraid
I'm right here and I'm gonna show you

[Pre-Chorus]
I saw you there
I can't get you out of my mind, boy
Better go and get another drink
All my girls say 'ooh, ooh, ooh'

[Chorus]
(Right to the left to the break of dawn
It don't stop 'till the early mornin')
Oooh...
Tell me what you're sippin' on
Baby, baby, baby, yeah

It don't stop 'till the early mornin')
Oooh...
Tell me what you're sippin' on
Baby, baby, baby, yeah

[Bridge]
I can't ignore it boy I feel like I'm yours
(Yeah, feel like I'm yours)
The way you look at me I just can't say no
(Just can't say no, just can't say no)
So we should hook up, who knows where we will go
'Cause baby when I'm with you, I
I feel I'm losing control

[Verse 3]
Oh boy you hit the spot
So baby please don't stop
Do you like my lemon drop?
Just taste it baby (Yeah, yeah)
You make me feel so hot
Summertime love is all we've got
Here we are let's take a shot
(Just taste it, baby)

[Chorus]

Oooh...

This is AC baby
All the tabloids tell me how you was a handful
Toxic, try to make you an example
You know me, I'm just tryin' to have you shoot for the airport(?)
Cause all this stress got me losing my hair too
Lets release, get live on the track
Got my baby in the whip, she could ride on my lap
Put that one finger up mommy, guzzle some more
Tell them the only issues you got is the covers your on, uh
One more drink, make us some a the bomb
Order shot, bartender gave one in the arm
All you rappers better recognize the best
Cuz AC about to blow like a breathalyzer test

So clap, are you ready for that's so clap
So clap, are you ready for that so clap
Well, there was a time on earth when in the books of heaven
That an old account was standing for sins yet unforgiven
My name was at the top, there were many things below
But I went unto the keeper and I settled it long ago

Long ago, on my knees, yes long ago (I settled it all)
I said the old account was settled long ago
And my record's clear today, He washed my sins away
And the old account was settled long ago

Well the old account was large and growing everyday
I was always sinning and I never tried to pray
But when I looked ahead and saw such pain and woe
Well I thought I'd better get it settled, so I settled it long ago

Long ago, yes long ago (I settled it all)
I said the old account was settled long ago
And my record's clear today, He done washed my sins away
And the old account was settled long ago

Well, sinner seek the Lord, and repent of all your sins
He has commanded if we're gonna make it in
And if you should live one hundred years below
You gonna know you got it settled if you settled it long ago
Long ago, on my knees, yes long ago (I settled it all)
I said the old account was settled long ago
And the old account was settled long ago
I've been falling in love with you from the moment we met
It's been consistent, a constant persistence and it hasn't stopped yet
It's cold but the window is open, and we sit on the ledge
Breathing in smoke
Breathing in all of this moment
So I don't forget

I've been falling in love with you since September 13th
I didn't know why you were on my mind so frequently
And when you kissed me for the first time I didn't want you to leave
Holding you close
Holding in those three words
That could changе everything

On my couch, watching tv
Then you pausеd it, turned to see me
And you told me that you loved me
Nothing was ever the same
There has never been a moment
When i wish you hadn't paused it
On my couch, as we watched the office
Nothing was ever the same
I've been falling in love with you since the moment we met
And I haven't stopped yet

[Intro]
Four in the morning
Came and you left without warning
Looking for a good time lover
A right now man

[Verse 1]
Running like bulls of Pamplona
Try as I might to control you
You're like smoke in my eyes
Closed every time
Face of a starchild
Born in a sea, a mile high
Never seen a bad moon rise
It's the right time now

[Pre-Chorus]
Time away from here has never felt so long
Find your souvenir and make your way back home

[Chorus]
(I see)
I see stormy weather (Weather)
This could be the place, the place
(Bettеr)
Better late than nеver (Never)
This is just a taste, a taste
It's the right time now

[Verse 2]
Working the floor on the weekend
No one can spin it like we can
No time to explain
You put a face to the name
The weight of the evening
Christ, I've been taking a beating
I can be your good time lover
Your right now man

[Pre-Chorus]
Time away from here has never felt so long
Quiet in the air never too far gone
Chasing through the night out there on your own
Find your souvenir and make your way back home

[Chorus]
(I see)
I see stormy weather (Weather)
This could be the place, the place
(Better)
Better late than never (Never)
This is just a taste
It's the right time now
Wearing a smile
Fighting my tears
Covering it all
Hiding a disguise
Hiding my fears
Put up a wall

But underneath it all
The girl you love is gone
I've already let go
But I put on a show
That's all that I know
But I'm waiting to fall

It's a masquerade
You made me hide my face behind a masquerade
Dancing around the truth
I'm done with lying
Tired of pretending
Acting like everything's okay
I just wanna prove my case
Its over, I'm done with being in this masquerade
Its all that I know
So comfortable
I wanna prove you wrong
Even though I need more
Blue skies and rainbows
But the song goes on

If I took off the mask
It wouldn't be because you asked
What you'll be forced to see
It's all been make believe
I'm not who you want me to be

It's a masquerade
You made me hide my face behind a masquerade
Dancing around the truth
I'm done with lying
Tired of pretending
Acting like everything's okay
I just wanna prove my case
Its over, I'm done with being in this masquerade

Lying on my bed, letting these tears come streaming down
But you're going away, and taking your lies with you into the ground
I've been screaming inside, I can finally let it out
The truth is heard now
Face to face
Time to put an end to this
It's a masquerade
You made me hide my face behind a masquerade
Dancing around the truth
I'm done with lying
Tired of pretending
Acting like everything's okay
I just wanna prove my case
Its over, I'm done with being in this masquerade
It's a masquerade
You made me hide my face behind a masquerade
Dancing around the truth
I'm done with lying
Tired of pretending
Acting like everything's okay
I just wanna prove my case
Its over, I'm done with being in this masquerade
I had to step back to breathe
Internal attack on me
The well's running dry for good
Same goes for my eyes, they should
In the end
I realize we're dust from the stars
A strange sensation is all that we are
And we wanna be more even though
We're unsure of the space we're in
I don't mean anything and the value I bring
Isn't worth a cause
Nothing at all, nobody's there
All that we do, nobody carеs
And then the dust is gone
Conniption fit
Conniption fit

[Outro]
Thе bigger picture is beyond
A carbon fissure on its own
Who will find what
When we're all done?

[Verse 1]
Walk little, walk small, talk big thoughts
Gonna tell them all just what I want
That street, two streets
I see you and me hanging on the empty swings

[Verse 2]
Count high low
Don't worry, my eyes are closed
I'm a Superman and it's my show
One shoe, two
Gonna kick with my new shoes
I'm gonna kick until I need new shoes

{Chorus]
(Tell those hipsters, I want to dance)
I said don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
I said don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop

[Verse 3]
I run, they run, everybody run, run
And we're all just having fun
Sleigh ride, boat ride, piggy back ride
I'm gonna show them all how I can ride

[Verse 4]
One, two, three, close your eyes and count to four
I'm gonna hide behind my bedroom door
Crayons on walls
I'll color on them all
I'll draw until I've broken every law
(Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I said don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
I said don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop

[Outro]
I said don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop

[Verse 1]
I hold your heart, be close to you
And I don’t make you label me, it's true
I'm holdin' on, I feel alive
I wouldn’t ever be your leak in life
I know I can't belong for you
I know say ’cause you’re us too
And I know you can’t believe my lie
We hold a deeper meaning now

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Refrain]
I feel you can’t believe your luck
And I can be, you can’t believe you can trust
It’s hard to hold me close to you
But even though I can’t believe it’s true

[Bridge]
‘Cause I say you go, get on you now
Show me the timе you go, go now

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Refrain]
I feel you can’t believe your luck
And I can bе, you can’t believe you can trust
It’s hard to hold me close to you
But even though I can’t believe it’s true

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Well, don't you know that there's a
Madman-a-comin' gonna do you no harm
He's wearin' pink pajamas and he lives on a farm
Oh, he's got to get somewhere to
Go and be so happy on his own


Every Place you go he loathes
Every Place you go he loathes
Every Place you go he loathes
Every Place you go he loathes

[Ameer Vann]
Stroke my ego
My white bitch got a black ass
I love white people
I know they got me brainwashed
I was watchin' Baywatch
Mommy with the colored people
Then she lost her day job

[Kevin Abstract]
Man, ever since I came to California
I felt so lonely even though I-

[Matt Champion]

And that's really not me actin' famous

[John Lennon]
(Ring me in, Ringo)
Ah fuck, guys, it's raining
God damn it, it is rain
We got to cancel the trip, guys
’Cause of the fucking rain

[Paul McCartney]
Man, didn't you read the fucking news?
It said it was raining, damn it, you fucking idiot (Ah, shut up, Paul)

[George Harrison]
Fuck you both
Why did you form a fucking band anyways?
Fuck

[Ringo Starr]
This is a fucking disaster
I'm gonna go do some acid
Peace and love, Ringo

[Verse 1]
Sweet ocean liner, come and anchor down
Sea of forgiveness, see what I have found
It's long and lanky, awkward at times
I'm going nowhere if you get the time

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's a long hard road until I can get to you
And I'll be holding on, hoping the sun comes shining through

[Chorus]
I'm going nowhere, if you've got the time
I'm going nowhere, with you on my mind

[Verse 2]
I took to driving, to see what I would find
A place in history, a little peace of mind
I know what you're thinking
I know just what you mean
I'll never be whole again until I get clean

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's a long hard road until I can get to you
And I'll be holding on, hoping the sun comes shining through

[Chorus]
I'm going nowhere if you'vе got the time
I'm going nowherе with you on my mind
I'm going nowhere, won't you stop by?
I'm going nowhere if you've got the time

[Chorus]
I'm going nowhere if you've got the time
I'm going nowhere with you on my mind
I'm going nowhere, won't you stop by?
I'm going nowhere if you got the time

Uh, talk to me, 'cause I'll talk back
It ain't my fault your girl fell in love with a gangsta mack
Now that's cold, jack
Talk that shit to me

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Peter Piper picked a pimp to play the game with passion
Made power plays with paper while they folded like a pamphlet
Protectin' my progression, politickin' for the people
Platinum with Doggystyle, "Deep Cover" was the prequel
Polarizin', prophesizin', I'm what put us on the map
At Poly bustin' down them P-O-U-N-D's into them sacks
Poundin' pavement with the pushers, pocket rocket for the pussies
Player tried to play me cold, I left him bleedin' in the bushes
I'm like a pigeon with precision, Snoopy shittin' from the top
Piggly Wigglys on patrol, tryna pop us at the park
Partner, please, we just posted up, we plottin' on some paper, man
Just popped a Pontiac and peach is probably what I'll paint the thang
Papered up, I can't complain
Still, I play the game, but it won't ease the pain
My homies passin' earlier than they 'posed to
Pop 'pagne in the Porsche
Most powerful Crip to ever throw up gangs on a poster

[Chorus: Kokane]
Snoop D-O-double-G
Talk that shit to me
From the LBC
Talk that shit to me (Talk that shit to me)
It's levels to this game
Got to earn your stripes
Bitch, if you ain't breakin' bread
Then you need to get a life (Talk that shit to me)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Crip without a crush, cocket full of cucks, check that
Cock it then I cuss, count one in the clutch, step back, swish
This Crippin' collision causing catastrophes
My casual conversations end up turnin' to casualties
Cold game, cat crackin' with Kokane
Go against the gang, we got a cellar with your name on it
Showstopper that dropped classics
The same nigga that closed curtains will close caskets
'Cause the crew on it too like compilation tracks
Runnin' numbers up, but it ain't no miscalculatin' that
Goin' kamikaze for me and my concentration camp
'Fore we had to take it back, 'cause really ain't no cake in that
Cryptolite
Play Superman, I'll be your Kryptonite
Took the nigga's citch 'cause she'd rather fuck a Crip tonight
Get this right, can't call yourself a king unless your clique is right
You niggas better get your Crippin' right

[Chorus: Kokane]
Snoop D-O-double-G
Talk that shit to me
From the LBC
Talk that shit to me (Talk that shit to me)
It's levels to this game
Got to earn your stripes
Bitch, if you ain't breakin' bread
Then you need to get a life (Talk that shit to me)

[Outro: Kokane]

[Verse 1]
How does it feel?
Know you know nothing
Still trapped in this wheel, can your feet keep, keep running
Words of the wise, a awful goal
She look in my eyes, my old girl go cold

[Bridge]
Oh whoa oh, yeah
Oh whoa oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
I have to relax
Jump with no parachutes strapped to my back
Yeah
They shot me first, I just had to react
Bang

[Pre-Chorus]
How does that feel?
Said how do you feel?
Oh
Yeah

[Chorus]
Do you feel high?
Do you feel high?
Do you feel high?
Oh whoa oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Pay me well, find some sort of 

[?]
Cause we standing on middle ground now
And this ain't a drill, why do they just sit around
Can you listen, please can you listen?
Cause we won't take your shit no more
Scriptures in my hidden drawer
Lord what should I listen for?
You got my attеntion
An evil dwells within themsеlves
These women speak in witches spells

[Pre-Chorus]
How's it feel?
Tell me how's it feel
Eh?

[Chorus]
Said, do you feel high?
Tell me that
Do you feel high?
Do you feel high?
Oh whoa oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
This space in time, this bated breath
I've seen your kind at your very best
This long goodbye is overdue
You never came when I called on you

[Verse 2]
The bastard wind is on your back
The rabid dog has caught your track
The golden age of old advice
Don't give no cause or alibi

[Chorus]
One more night, one more night, will you stay here?
One more night, one more night we'll be safe, dear
One more night, one more night
One morе night, one more night, will you stay herе?
One more night, will you stay here?

[Verse 3]
We've crystalized, it's dawned on you
You have the face of someone new
The pleasures of this life I'm told
Will spit you out in the middle of the road
A scenic place the sky grows cold

[Chorus]
One more night, one more night, will you stay here?
One more night, one more night we'll be safe, dear
One more night, one more night
One more night, one more night, will you stay here?
One more night, will you stay here?
One more night, one more night, will you stay here?
One more night, one more night, will you stay here?
One more night, will you stay here?

[Outro]
Ooh
When you see yourself, are you far away?
Is it night or day?
Ooh
When it comes to you, if you reach the moon
Can I be there too?
Ooh
When you see yourself, are you far away?
Is it night or day?
Ooh
When it comes to you, if you reach the moon
Can I be there too?

[Intro]
(We got London on the track)

[Rich Homie Quan]
Shawty 

[?] cuff, somebody buffed her (Woo)
Get your lil' sexy ass in that corner, you in trouble (Come here)
I wanna sip it, baby, I wanna make it double (What?)
You 

[?] callin' Thugger (Brrr)

[Young Thug]
I gave lil' mama twenty-five 

[?]
I wanna put a 

[?]
I want it even if she 

[?]
I wanna tie the knot and ain't talkin' tubes (Woo)
I gave the bitch a million bucks, said, "Go to school with it" (Woo)
She 

[?] my 

[?] so I don't wan' know 

[?] with me (What?)
We stick together even though I ain't got no glue with me (Woah)
I'm rich and ain't got no Jew with me (Woo)
Baby, stop bringin' hoes inside your house (Sheesh)
They arе not your friends, they just lookin' for a scout (Hee)
Same boy you'rе with 

[?] until it's a drought (Woo)
You know that they squeeze and they milkin' you, no cows (Squeeze)
I just bought a Porsche and it's five-hundred more horses (Skrrt)
Pockets fat like Norbit, money tall, but she my shorty

[Verse 1]
Oh, wave crash down on me
Until I'm whole again
Like days of old
I see myself and rise
I'm drying out in this weather
Feeling of parasites
And the time when the night feels better
Is when you don't go

[Chorus]
A taste as bitter as before
We could waste all the best of times 'til we know
That lights and shapes they only fade
In the hold that washes all away
What a wave
What a wave
What a wave
What a wave

[Verse 2]
The rose's thorn still reaches out to pierce my skin
It grows me warm and cloudys up my mind
Evеrybody has an opinion
I don't like most of them
'Cause thе life that we live is better living
Than living alone

[Chorus]
The taste, as bitter as before
We could waste all the best of times 'til we know
That lights and shapes they only fade
In the hold that washes all away
What a wave
What a wave
What a wave
What a wave

[Bridge]
I'm drying out in this weather
Feeling of parasites
And the time when the night feels better
Is when you don't go

[Outro]
What a wave
What a wave
What a wave
What a wave

[Verse 1]
Inconsistent love masked in a fairytale
You play along and you wear it well
You'll fall apart when the timings right
Pacing the floor til' the morning light

[Verse 2]
There will be a time out there on the line
When you know you've had enough
Plant a little seed down there on your knees
When you know you've got the stuff

[Verse 3]
Everybody wants a little piece of my time
Keep it all the rage and they'll stand in line
Heard your little cause playing on the radio
It's getting good, real good at getting old

[Verse 4]
Always just away
Everybody says
You could be here when you're home
You never say goodbye
Or look me in the eye
I'll love you 'til the day is gone

[Verse 5]
I can see my feet
Planted on the street
Rumbling like a waterfall
At my own device
I can scale the ice
Waiting for the warm to come

[Verse 6]
And the words always get in the way
It cuts you down just the same
I can't wait to see what you find
And the sun will find its place to shine

[Verse 1]
Waking early in the morning
Waiting on the light of day
Whole new kind of feeling is on the way
I'm not scared of knowing
If we’re ever getting out
We could be here forever without a doubt

[Verse 2]
Time is often higher learning
I'm still barely making grades
Just about imagination anyway
We are circling the wagons
Lining up in single file
Members of the jury are standing trial

[Refrain]
Waiting on a memory
Waiting on a memory, oh

[Chorus]
Said if you love me and you're willing to dance
We could take it to the high sеas
Echoing, echoing where do wе stand

[Verse 3]
My heart’s hard of hearing
My head's full of sand
Feet point both directions if you need a hand
Black water reflection
Lost in a city park
I can't find my way through the dark

[Refrain]
Waiting on a memory
Waiting on a memory, oh

[Chorus]
Said if you love me and you're willing to dance
We could take it to the high seas
Echoing, echoing where do we stand
We'll be sailing on a wild breeze
Oh, if you love me and you're willing to dance
We could take it to high seas
Echoing, echoing, echoing

[Outro]
Sometimes you're slow
Sent from mountain high
Where flours are made from grain
We'll be sailing blue sky

[Verse 1]
You smile
Your lips beguile
You look impeccable
Cutting through the room like a knife
Sharpened leather fastened tight
Oh so insatiable

[Verse 2]
Such a sight
An apparition holding tight
Never to shy from the scene
Splash of sound
Just a bellow bouncing 'round
There is a quiet to your scream

[Pre-Chorus]
They fall, you rise
It's here, your time

[Chorus]
The golden restless age
And time won't turn the page
You're only passing through a form of you
I look in your eyes and therе's a rage
And time won't turn the pagе
It hits you headlong to go it alone

[Verse 3]
See the eyes how they shimmer
And how they shine
It's only personal
I watch you fall, at breakneck speed
Lie in wait
Aching to feel it all

[Pre-Chorus]
The cause - effect
The line is set

[Chorus]
The golden restless age
And time won't turn the page
You're only passing through a form of you
I look in your eyes and there's a rage
And time won't turn the page
It hits you headlong to go it alone

[Pre-Chorus]
They fall, you rise
It's here, your time

[Chorus]
The golden restless age
And time won't turn the page
You're only passing through a form of you
I look in your eyes and there's a rage
And time won't turn the page
It hits you headlong to go it alone

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Not everybody I know
Holdin' onto daylight (Jeeeee)
Not everybody I know
Holdin' onto daylight (Jeeeee)

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Damn it I won't go, dammit I won't flow
Damn if I don't, ride on my own plane
Doing my own thing, still in this boat
I feel alone man, I'm so alone man
All on this rope
Let me inside, where did you go?
I need a seven to let me to glow

[Verse 2: Matt Champion & Kevin Abstract]
I been in my stride, think I need an ice bath
Hit my hot spot so I do it like that
Mind of a predator, you know I bite back
When my eyes stay close know I love it like that
Lick-a lick-a sticker with a stamp of approval
Rumor flick that you get down like a gasoline lamp and it's see through
Straight through the vines, climb to the vines
Ruffling the minds
Couldn't see all the signs when the ones that got so far from divine
Could you resemble a python in the wild? After God didn't let you
Fly with you, be able to guide a child in this world
Pressure in the sky, think God want a diamond
I never lie with my mind
I'm up down, like a geyser
Double milkshake, large fry 'cause nostalgia
Stay stay sleek like a croc in the water
See bad times, sharks flying, lemme alter
You believe in no falters, no trial
No error, just terror (One more?)

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Not everybody I know
Holdin' onto daylight (Jeeeee)
Not everybody I know
Holdin' onto daylight (Jeeeee)

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Driving in silence (Ay), looking for guidance
I lost my license, I lost control, I miss all those islands (Woo)
Quarter-life crisis (Ay), handle ill profit
Whipping this wrist so long non-stop, Imma get arthritis
Walking like giants (Right), checking my shadow
Making sure the clouds don't catch on the wounds that share my battles
Holding that gavel, twisting these axels
Holding my heart to stop this riot
Swear I'm trying my hardest to keep my pride
I know inside, these metals been gettin' violent (Violent)

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
It's impossible to change my attitude
Whenever I get into a new mood
I don’t wanna meet no more new dudes
I don't wanna make no money with you
I don't wanna pretend to be friends with you
Niggas swearing that they cool
Niggas do not make me drool
Niggas swearing that they bosses
Bitch, I’ve been a boss since way before I had an office
I'm addicted to flossing, why the wrist so glossy?
Look at the jeans, get off me; look at my team, the starters
The jerseys, I'm Herculеs
Yelling "Fuck the police!"
Niggas down south wasn't fucking with mе
'Cause I left CC, 'cause my momma made me
We been done hated the law, nigga, this ain't new
Niggas won't quit, that’s why I still bang Screw
That’s why I hang onto
The truth, the rule, the booth
The way I let loose rhymes slip through my gap tooth
But nigga, I got the juice
This is me in my raw form
Diss me, you must be on one
Yeah, my nigga, it's my dogs’ turn
Yelling "BH!" while the blunt burn, burn

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Yeah, I chose to blast a light
We find the same black pool
Where my party people at?
You'll never break us down
Yeah, I chose to blast a light
We find the same black pool
Where my party people at?
You'll never break us down

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
'Scuse me, I’m not aware of the rules
Bump a little pie like the food on the cruise (Ah)
I got news for you dudes
Gunning for the crown like I'm over the goon, ugh
What's the problem with your bitch ass? Moody
Attitude need a little dip in a Jacuzzi
Boy, you get the boot up out the window where the roof be
'Less you wanna take all this to Judge Judy
Shouldn't get your little panties in a bunch (Nah)
I've been swapping flows like a home-packed lunch
Feeling down the face like the sun in the trunk
And I must be dreaming 'cause this shit is too fun, look
I know I gotta be clutch
'Specially when the time is on the crunch
Etiquette, yes, I must be blunt
Fuck around and go tell 'em, "Wassup?"
I don't play 'em by the book, I don't cater like a cook
I don't project all my issues like I know a hater should, I'm—
I'm just doin' what I do
Lil' bitch, I know a thing or two, don't do all that and then come through
Money-makin' what I do, I keep a stack up in my shoe (Who)
Ready to shut it down (Who) Ready to kill it now
Where my motherfuckers at? I know you came to tear it down (Down, down, down)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Jabari Manwa]
Yeah, I chose to blast a light
We find the same black pool
Where my party people at?
You'll never break us down
Yeah, I chose to blast a light
We find the same black pool
Where my party people at?
You'll never break us down

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
I don't wanna do no handshake, I ain't tryna break my pact
I'm finna hang out my window, nigga, I ain't goin' back home
I don't wanna do no handshake, I ain't tryna break my pact
I'm finna hang out my window, nigga, I ain't goin' back home

[Chorus: Matt Champion]
Are you braindead or are you stupid? (Are you stupid?)
Wipe that smirk off your face when shit get ruthless (Shit get ruthless)
Oh my, swear to God, come on bitch, let's do it (Ayy, let's do it)
I can't stand the way your bitch ass keep on moving (Keep on moving, yeah)

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Still in the back of my homie's whip from the other night (Night)
I always do what I gotta do, so you know I do it, felt right (Right)
My mind is glued to your mind (Hmm)
I'm like, "Bitch, why you wastin' your time?"
With them other motherfuckers that you keepin' on the side
Now you killin' my high, get the fuck out my ride
Like, any niggas could be your situation
And everybody ready to go in on presentation
I'm so impatient, I know Heaven's waitin' just for Hell to raise
They don't really feel better when my hands is raisin'
Up in the sky and we ain't doin' no praisin'
And outside the sun off, you can hit me later
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

[Chorus: Matt Champion]
Are you braindead or are you stupid? (Are you stupid?)
Wipe that smirk off your face when shit get ruthless (Shit get ruthless)
Oh my, swear to God, come on bitch, let's do it (Ayy, let's do it)
I can't stand the way your bitch ass keep on moving (Keep on moving, yeah)

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Row, row, row your boat
Oh no, they gon' take the boat
Oh no, your girl paint her toes
Oh no, that's a UFO
Oh no, I done took your hoe
Oh no, she want jump my coat
Oh no, I can't bring that back
You know, I done break her back
Woah, the system, hands to the ceiling
The love of your life, I got your girlfriend
I fuck from behind, her hands to the ceiling
Honeys buzzin' my cell, I get no rest, man

[Bridge: Joba]
I do it all for the loot, grab the clip out the boot
Papa know I can shoot (Shoot, shoot shoot)
Do it all to the truth
Break 'em all, get loose
Break 'em all, Grey Goose
Chess moves, they truant
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it, remember
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it, remember
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it, remember
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it

[Chorus: Matt Champion]

Oh my, swear to God, come on bitch, let's do it (Ayy, let's do it)
I can't stand the way your bitch ass keep on moving (Keep on moving, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Sister ride, sister ride if you wanna
To a place I know that we can go
Where the hills come together
We can take it slow until you come around

[Verse 2]
There's a glow at the face of the canyon
And a sound blowing 'round
Says you're nowhere you've ever been before
Take a plunge into the Colorado River
Where you feel yourself for the very first time
I knew you'd be a friend of mine

[Chorus]
Ooh fire's gonna rage if people don't change
Ooh a story so old, still so original

[Verse 3]
You drift in and out like a thunder
Force my hand to get you out of here
Somewhere we can disappear
This is love although you've never seen it
We knew in time it had to be one of us
Never felt a warmer touch

[Chorus]
Ooh fire's gonna rage if people don't change
Ooh a story so old, still so original

[Chorus 2]
Ooh fire's gonna rage if people don't change
Ooh I'm chemically inclined to say what's on my mind
Ooh you're getting pretty close, but you've got a little ways to go
The story so old but still so original

[Outro]
You really laid it on the line, line, line, line, line, line, line
Oh hit me one more time, time, time, time, time, time, time
You really laid it on the line, line, line, line, line, line, line
Oh baby hit me one more time, time, time, time, time, time, time

[Intro]
No tengas miedo, sigue tu corazón
Que Dios te bendiga
Que Dios te bendiga
(Have no fear)

[Verse 1]
Never mind your fears, just let them go
They only happen to help you grow
Destiny is not a matter of chance
You have to seize it with your hands

[Pre-Chorus]
So maybe I'm crazy
I won't stop 'til I'm free
From the fears within me
Please stop haunting me

[Chorus]
Mi corazón (Never mind your fears)
No tengas miedo (Tengo miedo)
Mi corazón (Never mind your fears)
No tengas miedo (Mm-mm)

My mind's not satisfied
Hear the sounds when I cry
Million things on my mind
God, open this war inside

[Pre-Chorus]
So maybe I'm crazy
I won't stop 'til I'm free
From all the fear
Please stop haunting me
Never mind those fears

[Chorus]
Mi corazón

I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms
I got everything, everything but real love
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out
Or you could leave me there, 'cause

[Chorus]
We just love to dream
I fell asleep when you woke up, oh
It's not you, baby, it's just me
I don't believe what I just lost

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna close my eyes
Nobody wants to fall (Fall) after they did it all (All)
I wonder if I left my body there, would I
Die right in my sleep (Sleep) but in reality ('Ty)
It could feel like anything is possible
When I hear you speak, it really drives it deep
Woke up in a sweat in the middle of the night
It's gettin' under my skin, baby
I wouldn't wonder why

I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms
I got everything, everything but real love

Jump in bed without my bonnet, ah (My bonnet)
Take a minute for the finer things (Yeah)
I don't even wanna sleep
You doin' some weed, blow it in my China bang
I be havin' hella dreams
Pickin' up his sheets feelin' like a tidal wave
Hit me if you want it right away
If he hit me with the mornin' sex
Show up, hit him with apologies
Kicks on him with a pile of J's
Bricks on him with a dick on him (Yo)
Put a fit on him with the Prada shades (Prada shades)
Tits on him and I ride away (Ride away)
How much do you want it? Twice a day
Four times on the holidays (Yeah)
King come through, your dreams come true
And trust me, you won't ever fall asleep

[Verse 1: David Bowie]
The air is getting hotter
There's a rumbling in the sky
I've been wading through the high muddy water
With heat rising through my eyes
Every day, your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't hurt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Tryin' to get to Heaven before they close the door
Oh, hey, yeah

[Verse 2: David Bowie]
Oh, when I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see
They broke the heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I've been walking that lonesome valley
Tryin' to get to Heaven before they close the door
Oh, oh, yeah

[Chorus: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey]
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door

[Verse 3: David Bowie]
Oh, people on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts are beatin'
Like pendulums swingin' on a chain
When you think you lost everything
You find out you can lose a little more
I, I'm just going down the, that road feeling bad
Tryin' hard to get to Heaven before they close the door

[Chorus: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey]
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door

[Bridge: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey]
Ooh
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey]
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door

[Verse 4: David Bowie]
I'm going down the river
Going down to New Orleans
They tell me everything's gonna be alright
But I don't know what alright even means
I close my eyes and I wonder, boys
If everything is as hollow as it seems
I've been to Sugar Town, oh, shook the sugar down
Tryin' to get to Heaven before they close the door, hey

[Chorus: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey, David Bowie]
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven (Tryin' to get there)
Before they close the door (Woo, door)
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven (Tryin' to get to Heaven)
Before they close the door (And relive my dreams there)
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door (I've been all around the world, boys)
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door

[Verse 1]
Mother, you had me but I never had you
Oh, I, I wanted you but you didn't want me
So I, I just gotta tell you
Goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 2]
Father, you left me but I never left you
Oh, I needed you, you didn't need me
So, I, I, I just gotta tell you
Goodbye, goodbye

[Chorus]
Mama, don't go
Daddy, come home
Mama, don't go
Daddy, come home

[Verse 3]
Children, please don't do what I have done, oh, no
Oh, I, I couldn't walk but I tried to run, oh, oh
So I, I, I gotta tell you
Goodbye, goodbye

[Chorus]
Mama, don't go
Daddy, come home
Mama, don't go
Daddy, come home
Mama, don't go

[Outro]
No, no, no (Mama, don't go)

Mama, don't go
Daddy, come home

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Dylan Brady]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to brеak

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
You can tell me if you’ve had еnough
Dirty dishes, counter tops
Sit in bed and wash my brain out
My tummy’s turning into boulders
Clenching up my shoulders
And I don’t know what to tell you

[Break: Laura Les & Chester Bennington]
I’m moving closer to the edge
Can’t hear what you said
Loud pack to my head
Can’t hear what you said
(Just like before)

[Chorus: Laura Les & Dylan Brady]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to
Break!

[Bridge: Dylan Brady]
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I'm about to break!

[Chorus: Laura Les & Dylan Brady]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to
Break
Lyrics from Snippet

Yeah
Decide me some lines, need assurance
I can't let niggas get high

It's hard to get around, my intuition's just so mad
Interfering, switching through the grid, that shit so mad
Lack of inhibition keep me learning, Ms. Nomad
Lack of confidence, I need assurance, gimme dat

Don't surround me if you covet
If you judgin', keep it movin'
We don't need you (We ain't need)
Lyrics from Snippet

This one's for all the fast girls in the house

I guess I should've known by the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb 'cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used

But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say "What have I got to lose?"

And honey, I say Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvettе
You need a love that's gonna last

I guess I should've closеd my eyes when you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the negroes that was there before me
Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "Baby, have you got enough gas?"
Oh yeah!

Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
You need to find a love that's gonna last
(Oh, oh)

A body like yours oughta be in jail
'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over, baby, gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine

Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
Need to find a love that's gonna last, hey hey

Little Red Corvette
Honey, you got to slow down (Got to slow down)
Little Red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, you're gonna run your Little Red Corvette right in the ground
Right down to the ground
Right down to the ground
Right down to the ground
You got to slow down
You're movin' much too fast, too fast
Need to find a love
If you wanna be my woman
There's just one thing you gotta understand
Got to slow down
Got to slow down
(?) but you've got to slow down
Here we are in this big old empty room
Staring each other down
You want me just as much as I want you
Let's stop fooling around
Take me baby, kiss me all over
Play with my love
Bring out what's been in me for far too long
Baby, you know that's all I've been dreaming of

Do me, baby
Like you never done before
Oh, give it to me 'til I just can't take no more
Come on and do me, baby
Like you never done before
I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait, oh

Here we are looking for a reason
You to lay mе down
For a love like ours is nevеr out of season
So baby please stop teasing me
(Ooh) What you do, I can never love no other
You're the best I ever had
Whenever we're not close to one another
I just want you so bad
So...
Do me, baby
Like you never done before
(No, no)
Ooh, give it to me 'til I just can't take no more
Come on, do me, baby

Oooh, I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait
I said

Do, do, do, do me, baby

(Do me, baby)
This feeling is too strong, make me wait too long
(I want you now)
Baby, you're leaving me no choice
Okay, what are you going to do, you just going to sit there and watch?
Alright
Are you sure you don't want to close your eyes?
Well, isn't it supposed to take a long time?
I'm not going to stop until the war is over
Help me
There okay, okay
I'm so cold, just hold me

[Prince and Lisa Coleman]
I remember when I met you, sugar
You were on your way to be wed
You were such a sexy thing
I loved the way you walked, the things you said
And I was so nonchalant
I didn't want you to be misled
But I've got to have you, baby
I got to have you in my bed
You said:
"But I'm just a virgin, and I'm
On my way to be wed
But you're such a hunk
So full of spunk"

I'll give you head 'til you're burning up
Head 'til you get enough
Head 'til your love is red
Head, love you 'til you're dead

You know you're good, girl
I think you like to go down
You wouldn't have stopped
But, uh, I came on your wedding gown
And you said:
"I must confess
I wanna get undressed and go to bed"
With that I jammed, you fool
You married me instead
Now morning, noon, and night
I give you head 'til you're burning up
Head 'til you get enough
Head 'til your love is red
Head, love you 'til you're dead, oh

Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Head
Head
Head
Head
Woah

Head 'til you're burning up
Head 'til you get enough
Head 'til your love is red
Head, love you 'til you're dead

Head
Head
Head

[Intro]
Ooh
Raise your hands, everybody in the house, c'mon
Up there, raise your hands, I see you

[Verse]
She saw me walking down the streets of your fine city
Kind of turned me on when she looked at me and said, "Come here"
Now I don't usually talk to strangers, but she looked so pretty
What can I lose if I just give a little ear? And I bet you do
She's just a crazy, crazy, crazy, uh baby
They all say she's just a crazy, crazy, crazy little mixed up dame
Yeah she is, no
She's just a victim of society and all its games
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Whеre I come from
We don't lеt society, tell us how it's supposed to be
Our clothes, our hair, we don't care
It's all about being there
You know what I'm sayin', raise your hands
Sing it loud

[Chorus]
Uptown
That's where I want to be, you say
Uptown
Set your mind free
Uptown
Got my body hot
Get down
I don't want to stop
(Yeah)
Shooter, you shot me in the heart
And I've been dying since we've been apart
Woah, shooter, I don't think I'm gonna make it
See, I'm, I'm just as good as dead
(I'm good as dead)

Woah-oh-oh, bullseye
Girl, you shot me down to my knees, yeah
Since you took your love from me
And I'm holding on to the hopes that you will return
Although I feel I've lost you forever
I will believe that you still love me
Girl, say you do, say you do, say you do
(Say you do)
Say you still love me

Shooter, shooter, yeah
You shot me in the heart, oh, yeah
And I've been dying since we'vе been apart
Oh-oh-oh, shooter, shooter
I don't think I'm gonna make it, no
And I'm just as good as dеad
(I'm good as dead)
Oooh-oooh-oooh
See, I neglected the fact that your love was precious
And I should have took more better care of it
And now every minute you're gone
Girl, I sit here just dying alone
And I wish that I could have dodged that bullet of you leaving me

Shooter, shooter, you shot me in the heart
And I've been dying since we've been part, yeah
Woah-oh-oh, shooter, lord, lord
Oh, I don't think that I'm gonna make it, no-no-no
And I'm just as good as dead, dead, dead, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, shooter, girl, you shot me in the heart, oh
And I've been dying since we've been apart, yeah
Shooter, shooter, shooter, shooter, shooter
See, I just don't think that I'm gonna make it without you baby, Shooter

I've gotta go
I don't wanna go but I've got to go
Red is not supposed to be green
Like faiths not supposed to be seen
The skies not supposed to touch the ground
And a square is not supposed to be round
The moons not supposed to touch the sun
And a two is not supposed to be a one
Said the hearts not supposed to weigh a ton
And forevers not supposed to be done
Winters not supposed to come in June
And I am not supposed to have the blues
There are so many things that are not supposed to be, babe
Except you and me

(So many things, there are so many things)
There are so many things
(So many things, there are so many things)
That are not supposed to be
(So many things, there are so many things)
Oooh baby, yeah
Except you and me
Nights not supposed to be lonely, yeah
No one is supposed to be alone
Understanding is not supposed to be confused
And a win is not supposed to lose
Like fires not supposed to freeze
Like  joy is not supposed to greave
Like you're not supposed to leave
What I said I'm not supposed to mean
He is not supposed to have your heart
Baby, we are not supposed to be apart
There are so many things that are not supposed to be
Except you and me

(So many things, there are so many things)
There are so many things
(So many things, there are so many things)
That are not supposed to be
(So many things, there are so many things)
Yeah, baby

It seems just like no sessions changing
All this earth with no creation
All heart with no feelings
Or a sickness without a healing
Just like a frozen spring or bird with no wings
Just like a song outta key is how my life would be
Like the nice guys with no stars, a lonely broken heart
No holding hands, walks in the park
That's how it would be if we were to part, oooh
(So many things, there are so many things)
There are so many things, yeah
(So many things, there are so many things)
Except our love
(So many things, there are so many things)
So many things that are not supposed to be
(So many things, there are so many things)
It's like having no air to breathe, nah-no
Like having no words to preach, nah-no
Like having no rain for the sea
(So many things, there are so many things)
There are so many things that are not supposed....
Not supposed to be
Not supposed to be
Except you and me, baby
Yeah-yeah-yeah, baby, yeah
Except you and me
See, a man is a man of his word
And keeps his word
Snatches life by the collar, gets what he wants
But all of his power means nothing if he ain't happy

This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or girl

A man's got power, a mans got riches
A man's got respect but hangs in the trenches
Work day to day just to pay the bills
But behind all the lights, ya'll the struggle is real
Hustler! Baller! He may be
What is he without a she?
This is a man's, man's, man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing no without a woman or girl

See, a man's got dreams
A man wants to fly
Do what he gotta do, ah just to get by
See, a man comes from nothing
And makes something of himself
But no matter how much money, no
See, a woman is his true wealth
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, not one lil thing without a woman or girl
Oooh-Oooh-Oooh, I

Hе would be lost in the worldliness, hеy
He would be lost in bitterness
He would be lost without a woman
Man, see, he would be lost without a woman

His... His world means nothing without a woman
All of his fortune and fame means nothing without a woman
This is a man's world but without a woman
This is a man's world , hey, hey, without a woman
But it don't mean nothing without a woman
Nothing without a w.o.m.a.n
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1]
I got my driver's license last week
Something we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying, 'cause you weren't around

[Verse 2]
And you're probably with that brunette girl
The one I always thought about
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause I couldn't fathom loving no one else

[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay
Now that I'm gone
And I don't believe you when you say I did nothing wrong
Oh, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause I couldn't fathom loving no one else

[Intro]
Ladies and gentleman, Lil Wayne

[Chorus: Halsey & Lil Wayne]
You cannot break down what can't be broken (Yeah)
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen (Yeah)
When all of the lights, they get low (Low)
And all of the curtains, they close (Close)
You cannot break down what can't be broken

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, they can do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce, should I wave the deuce?
In 1982, momma taped me to a space shuttle
Say now I'm raising you, ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors food
Be afraid of who? I made the loot
Money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Twisted like tornadoes too
Man, I like my head a screw
Man, I'ma need some crazy glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gone break a few
You can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you, errr

[Chorus: Halsey & Lil Wayne]
You cannot break down what can't be broken (Broken)
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen (Chosen)
When all of the lights, they get low (They get low)
And all of the curtains, they close (They close)
You cannot break down what can't be broken

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne & Halsey]
G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these bros
G-code (Can't be broken)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I ain't finna break or fix the brakes
You emulate, I'm laughing in your face
So fix your face, I can't disintegrate, 'cause I facilitate a mil' a day
For like a million days
Least the bills are paid, the children safe
Want to get away? No, I'm here to stay
I'm really great, but don't discriminate
'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
Stickin' out your chest, is really fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, get replaced
The heart was built to break
Smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
Got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, do some Q&A
You saw the news today
Got news to break, rules to break
It hurt to say, they want to see Lil Tune to break
It's worth the wait, commercial break

[Chorus: Halsey & Lil Wayne]
You cannot break down what can't be broken (G-code)
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen (G-code)
When all of the lights, they get low (They get low)
And all of the curtains, they close (They close)
You cannot break down what can't be broken

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne & Halsey]
G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these bros
G-code (Can't be broken)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
To all the veterans, thank you

[Verse 1]
I pictured a rainbow
You held it in your hands
I had flashes
But you saw the plan
I wandered out in the world for years
While you just stayed in your room
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

[Chorus 1]
You were there in the turnstiles
With the wind at your heels
You stretched for the stars
And you know how it feels
To reach too high
Too far too soon
You saw the whole of the moon

[Verse 3]
I was grounded
While you filled the skies
I was dumbfounded by truth
You cut through lies
I saw the rain dirty valley
You saw Brigadoon
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon

[Verse 4]
I spoke about wings
You just flew
I wondered I guessed and I tried
You just knew I sighed
But you swooned
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon

[Chorus 2]
With a torch in your pocket
And the wind at your heels
You climbed on the ladder
And you know how it feels
To get too high
Too far too soon
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

[Bridge]
Unicorns and cannonballs
Palaces and piers
Trumpets towers and tenements
Wide oceans full of tears
Flags rags ferryboats
Scimitars and scarves
Every precious dream and vision
Underneath the stars

[Chorus 3]
You climbed on the ladder
With the wind in your sails
You came like comet
Blazing your trail
Too high too far too soon
You saw the whole of the moon

[Verse 1]
I got a lot of things on my mind
I'm pretty sure you're feeling the same (Ooh)
I wanna know if you're down to ride, oh
You gotta be one hundred percent

[Pre-Chorus]
Been rocking back and forth
Spend a million nights in bed
Just write the label off
Gotta get you outta my head
Been running 'round for miles
'Bout a million words were said
Now I just need to know, I just need to know

[Chorus]
Yeah, tell me do you wanna that real love?
Do you wanna be something true?
Then I'mma put it down on you
Yeah, tell me do you wanna that real love?
I'mma get you that perfect view
Then I'mma put it down on you

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, tеll me do you wanna that real, real, rеal, real
Tell me do you wanna that real, real, real, real, yeah

[Verse 2]
Nobody else can do what I can
Top of the class, I've got that degree (Ooh)
Not tryna get a ring on my hand, no no
Just wanna know if it's you and me

[Pre-Chorus]
Been rocking back and forth
Spend a million nights in bed
Just write the label off
Gotta get you outta my head
Been running 'round for miles
'Bout a million words were said
Now I just need to know, I just need to know

[Chorus]
Yeah, tell me do you wanna that real love?
Do you wanna be something true?
Then I'mma put it down on you
Yeah, tell me do you wanna that real love?
I'mma get you that perfect view
Then I'mma put it down on you

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, tell me do you wanna that real, real, real, real
Tell me do you wanna that real, real, real, real, yeah
I'mma give it you so real, real, real, real, oh
Tell me do you wanna that real love, that real love, yeahh

[Outro]
Could be the one so I'm not willing to let you go, oh no
I could be wrong, but I'll take a chance and let you know, oh no

[Verse 1]
Hallelujah, I'm a freak, I'm a freak, hallelujah
Every day of the week, I'ma do ya like I want to
I'm a Nile crocodile, a piranha

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my God, she got the power
Oh, look at her, she got the power
So, so, so

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter

[Post-Chorus]
So, back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh

[Verse 2]
Hallelujah, I'm a witch, I'm a witch, hallelujah
Swish swish, I'm a three-point shooter, I blow through ya
Like a hot wind out in thе bayou, yah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my God, she got the power
Wеll, look at her, she got the power

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter

[Post-Chorus]
So, back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh

[Verse 1]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?

[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

[Verse 2]
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?

[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying, baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

[Bridge]
We don't talk enough, we should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn? We've been here before
It's just what we know

[Outro]
Stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to get away

[Verse 1]
Just a perfect day
Drink sangria in the park
And later on when it gets dark
We go home
Just a perfect day
Feed animals in the zoo
And later on, a movie, too
And then home

[Chorus]
Oh, it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh, oh, perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
Just keep me hanging on

[Verse 2]
Just a perfect day
Problems all left alone
Weekenders on our own
It's so much fun, yeah
Just a perfect day
You made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else
Someone good

[Chorus]
Oh, it's such a pеrfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh, oh, a perfеct day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on

[Bridge]
Well, uh-huh

[Outro]
You're going to reap just what you sow
Sweetheart, you're gonna reap just what you sow, ah yeah, yeah
You're gonna reap just what you sow
We all are gonna reap just what we sow

[Spoken Intro]
Thank you

[Verse]
Look in my eyes
You'll see the soul
Underneath my celebrity skin
I'm not afraid
To open up wider
Please be my guest, come on in
You'll feel right at home
Inside my song
Shelter from the stormy weather
Body and soul, body and soul
Blood will mix it all together
I'm gonna live it up
Build it up
Higher
Don't depend on luck
Be driven by what you desire
Gonna build it up
Lift it up
Higher
Don't depend on luck
Be driven by what you desire

[Spoken Intro]
Alright, so, we don't just, uh
We don't just put on clothes and come on out here and just do as we wish
Like, we ask permission, you know?
In prayer, and also go to my mother
And this is a song called "Mother May I"

[Chorus]
Mother may I
Oh, mother may I
I wanna go outside tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I

[Verse 1]
Mommy, just listen
Something in the wind keeps calling me
And I'm old enough now to answer
I want everything that's mine
Give it all to me
And I need your, your blessing
'Cause your baby was born to be out of control
It'll help me make it home safely
But I'm still not sure if I wanna live to be old
Oh

[Chorus]
Mother may I
Oh, mother may I
I wanna go outside tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I

[Verse 2]
Now mommy, I know you're watching
I've been a good boy, I'll never bring you shame
And I'll never know all your secrets
But it's impossible for us not to be the same
Now see, I've got one chance, y'all
To do whatever it is I'm supposed to do
And when you think I'm ready
Please make sure that I come back home with you
Oh oh oh

[Chorus]
Mother may I (Help me, mama)
Oh, mother may I
I wanna go outside tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I (Oh, one more time)
Mother may I
Oh, mother may I
Say I wanna be alive tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I

[Bridge]
One way you can show you really love me
Just to let me go
Oh, but make sure that you tell my Heavenly Father
I said "Hello"
Ooh hoo ooh

[Chorus]
Oh, mother may I
Oh, mother may I
I wanna go outside tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I
Mother may I
Oh, mother may I
I wanna be alive tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I

[Verse 1]
Nobody lives forever
So come on let's have some fun
And I want a happy ending
Just like everyone wants one
And life would be sweeter
If we all had somewhere we could run
Oh, but don't you dare tell me what can't be done

[Chorus]
They say you don't have to grow up
But you've got to grow older
It only hurts when I laugh, you see
I'll always be young
I'll always be young in my mind
But I'm racing against the time

[Refrain]
(Alright, yeah yeah yeah, na na na)

[Verse 2]
Ah, nevermind the mirror in your room
Be who you feel
And thе ground's under your feet
But you won't get therе standing still
Peak and valley is a promise
But don't you stop until
Oh, and I'll make it, yes, I'll make it, yes, I will

[Chorus]
Had a fight with my father time
About my mother's nature
That meant I'm destiny's child
You see, I'll always be young
I'll always be young in my mind
But I'm racing against the time

[Bridge]
(Alright, yeah yeah yeah) Yeah
(Na na na, yeah yeah yeah) Ooh wee
(Na na na, yeah yeah yeah)
(Na na na, yeah yeah yeah) Come on, children
(Na na na, yeah yeah yeah)
(Na na na, yeah yeah yeah)
Ah, one, two, three, do it
(Ah) Ah (Ah) Yeah (Ah) Yeah (Ah) Ah (Ah)
(Ah)
Racing against the time
(Alright, yeah yeah yeah, na na na)

[Verse 3]
But I won't keep any secrets from you, baby
I'm a sinner, yes, I am
And I may have lost your war of words
But baby, I'm still a winner, yeah
Does wearing your heart on your sleeve really mean
That it is isn't in you?
Looking good but you aren't that great of a pretender

[Chorus]
When everything is said and done
I'll be alive in my only son
And I'll be there when his son has one, yeah
So I'll always be young
Said I'll always be young in my mind
Oh, said I'm racing against the time, yes

[Outro]
(Alright, yeah yeah yeah, na na na)
Yes, yeah now
(Alright, yeah yeah yeah, na na na)
Ooh ooh, racing against the time
(Alright, yeah yeah yeah, na na na)
Oh yeah, mmm, racing, yeah yeah
(Alright, yeah yeah yeah, na na na)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night
Tears in my eyes, staring up at the sky in disbelief
"I've got a voice in my head, voice in my head"
That’s what it said
All we really need is some comic relief

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm afraid of not being able to laugh anymore, oh
What's life going to become once we don’t have anymore heroes?

[Chorus]
We don't know what the next man's going through
Wish I could say it in a plainer way
I said we don't know but life reminds me of Robin Williams
We've got to laugh the pain away
We don't know what the next man's going through
Wish I could say it in a plainеr way
I said we don't know but life reminds mе of Robin Williams
We’ve got to laugh the pain away
Laugh the pain away, oh oh

[Verse 2]
John Belushi knew you and me better than we knew ourselves
And we all listen to Richard Pryor, yeah
They don’t make Philip Seymour Hoffman often
Now he's one of the things we lost in the fire, Lord, yes

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I’m afraid of not being able to laugh anymore, oh
What's life going to become once we don't have anymore heroes?

[Chorus]
We don't know what the next man’s going through
Wish I could say it in a plainer way
I said we don't know but life reminds me of Robin Williams
We've got to laugh the pain away
We don't know what the next man's going through
Wish I could say it in a plainer way
I said we don't know but life reminds me of David Bowie
We've got to dance the pain away

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, Chris Farley can you hear me?
Oh oh oh, Bernie, can you hear me?
Oh, yes

[Chorus]
Said we don't know what the next man's going through
We don't know, life reminds me of Robin Williams
We don't know what the next man's going through
I said we don't know but life reminds me of Robin Williams
We've got to laugh the pain away

[Outro]
Phil Hartman, can you hear me? Ooh, yes
Robin, can you hear me?

[Chorus]
I wonder, could it be you and I are a sign of the times?
Why can't we open our eyes to the sign of the times?

[Verse 1]
When I feel like I'm all out of love, and my time is up
It scares me, judge us fairly
If only music could make us understand
I swear sometimes I hear a ghost in the radio
I went from station to station lookin' for somewhere safe to go
I'm not the only one that's seen it
So there's no question, I believe it
I'm not crazy
And I can't move 'til it makes me
Plеase try to save as many as you can
Ah yes, I said

[Chorus]
Could it bе you and I are a sign of the times?
Why can't we open our eyes to the sign of the times?

[Post-Chorus]
Well, it's something you can't deny, go 'head and ask me why
For the meaning, and if you think you're dreaming
Oh, I have got the perfect song for you

[Verse 2]
If I time it just right, I won't have to say it again
Hey, will my two cents be enough for you to play it again?
I put some weight on it
Repetition can change a human condition
Ooh, we need to listen, if it's the last thing that you do
Oh, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Could it be you and I are a sign of the times?
(Sign of the times)
Why can't we open our eyes to the sign of the times?
(Ah ah ah, oh yes, baby)
Could it be you and I are a sign of the times?
(Everything)
Why can't we open our eyes to the sign of the times?

[Post-Chorus]
Well, it's something you can't deny, go 'head and ask me why
For the meaning, and if you think you're dreaming
I've got the perfect song for you

[Chorus]
Could it be you and I are a sign of the times?
Why can't we open our eyes to the sign of the times?
Could it be you and I are a sign of the times?
Why can't we open our eyes to the sign of the times?

[Chorus]
See you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Fuck you and fuck her, too"
If I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Hah, ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
Got pain in my chest, I wish you the best
But, "Fuck you"

[Verse 1]
Said I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
But I'm an Xbox and he's more an Atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair

[Pre-Chorus]
I pity the fool that falls in love with you, alright
(She's a gold digger) Yeah
(Thought you should know)
Ooh, I've got some news for you
Yeah, go run and tell your little boyfriend

[Chorus]
I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like - I need it loud, L.A. (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like...
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ah, ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
Got pain in my chest, wish you the best
But, "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
Now I know that I had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Tryin' to keep ya, tryin' to please ya, yeah
Being in love with your ass ain't cheap, ha

[Pre-Chorus]
I pity the fool that falls in love with you, come on
(She's a gold digger) Oh baby
(Thought you should know)
Ooh, I've got some news for you
I really hate yo' ass right now

[Chorus]
Drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
I'm like... (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Change in my pocket wasn't enough, alright
If I was richer, hey hey, ah (Ain't that some shit?)
There's pain in my chest, wish you the best
Ah, alright now (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baby
Why you wanna hurt me so bad?
(So bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my mother, told me
"This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Yes, she did
I was like, (Uh) Why? (Uh) Why?(Uh)
Why, baby?
(Uh) I love you
(Uh) I still love you, oh

[Chorus]
Drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
Oh, louder (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Change in my pocket wasn't enough
So, ah baby
If I was richer, yeah y'all (Ain't that some shit?)
Got pain in my chest, wish you the best
Ah ah (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Outro]
Yeah
Hey baby, how y'all feel? (Alright)
Alright, hey hey

Baby baby now (Baby baby now)
Ah yeah (Oh yeah)
If you don't love me, woman
Well, fuck you (Fuck you)
Well, fuck you then (Fuck you)

Fuck you (Fuck you)
Fuck you then (Fuck you)
I said if you can't respect me, woman
Well, fuck you (Fuck you)
Fuck you then, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, yeah
Yo, thank y'all, man

[Crazy]

[Verse 1]
I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo in so much space, mhm
When you're out there without care, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

[Chorus 1]
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

[Verse 2]
And I hope that you are having the time of your lifе
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you think you arе?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

[Chorus 2]
Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

[Verse 3]
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I'll die when I'm done
But I'm not done

[Chorus 3]
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Wait and see

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh oh
Wait a minute
Hey
Band

[Trouble So Hard]

[Outro]
I said, ooh lordy, trouble so hard
Ooh Lordy, trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
I said, ooh lordy, trouble so hard
Ooh Lordy, trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God

Say oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I say oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Thank y'all

[Spoken Intro]
Love you, too
I got like a sinus infection so I'm taking it slow

[Verse 1]
I got some bad news this morning
Which, in turn, made my day
When this someone spoke, I listened
All of a sudden has less, and less to say
Oh, how could this be?
All this time, I’ve lived vicariously

[Chorus]
Who's gonna save my soul now?
Who's gonna save my soul now?
How will my story ever be told now?
How will my story be told now?

[Verse 2]
Made me feel like somebody
Like somebody else
Although he was imitated often
It felt like I was bein’ myself
Is it a shame that someonе else's song
Was totally and completеly depended on?

[Chorus]
Who's gonna save my soul now?
Who's gonna save my soul now? Yeah
I wonder if I'll live to grow old now
Gettin' high 'cause I feel so low down

[Verse 3]
And maybe it's a little selfish
All I have is the memory
But I never stopped to wonder
Was it possible you were hurtin’ worse than me?
Still, my hunger turns to greed
’Cause what about what I need?
And oh

[Chorus]
Who's gonna save my soul now?
Tell me ho’s gonna save my soul now?
Oh, I know I'm out of control now, yeah
Tired enough to lay my own soul down

[Outro]
Ooh, mmm, well well well
Mhm, mmm

Thank you, guys

[Verse 1]
Instantly
Right in front of your eyes
The rhythm gets inside of me
And I come alive
And it makes my body hot
Turned up all the way
Can't you hear it talking?
Sometimes all you can say
It said oh oh oh (Oh oh)
And oh oh oh (Oh)
I'm staring through ya
I'm watching it happen to ya
It says oh oh oh (Oh oh)
And oh oh oh (Oh)
Our rhythm is gonna get you
I'll be right there right with you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Everything's alright, ooh wee, baby
Baby, don't you show shame at all
My back's up against the wall
And we're grindin'
'Til it smells like fire, babe
And it's gonna burn forever
As long as we're together
We'll be grindin'
'Til it smells like fire, babe
Ooh yeah

[Chorus]
I said you (Alright)
And me (Hey)
We (We are)
Are starting to smell like fire, babe

Gotta get it how you can
Gotta handle your business
When the baby gotta eat
Gotta get a real job
Or get it off the street

[Chorus]
I go to work
Said hold up wait one minute

[Verse 1]
I've been living for the weekend, no, not anymore
'Cause here comes that familiar feeling, Friday's famous for
Yeah, I'm lookin' for some action, and it's out there somewhere
You can feel the electricity all in the evening air
May just be more of the same (More of the same)
But sometimes you wanna go where everyone knows your name

Guess I'll have to wait and see (Wait and see)
But I'm just gonna let somеthing brand new happen to me

And it's alright (It's alright)
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright (It's alright)
Bright lights and thе big city

[Verse 2]
Now Friday is cool, but there's something about Saturday night
You can't say what you won't do, you know that you just might
I'm alive this evening, it was love at first sight
This Saturday, every Saturday for the rest of my life
Everyone's standing in line (Standing in line)
Yeah, lookin' good, and lookin' for a real good time (Real good time)
Never have to wonder if
I'll have someone to share all of this with
Sing

[Chorus]
And it's alright (It's alright)
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright (It's alright)
Bright lights and the big city
It belongs to us tonight (Tonight, tonight)

[Bridge]
Just throw your hands up in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
You came to party with CeeLo Green
Let me say "Oh yeah"
"Oh yeah"
And you don't stop
Now, somebody, everybody scream

Yes, I need it, everybody does, yes, they do
Cocktails and conversation (Music and making love)

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
What's worse is y'all just be stumblin' backwards
2001, the living room was filled with glass, it smelled like Backwoods
I can't even remember the last time like I felt like that was appropriate for you to be calling me names
I was leavin' you laughin'
I build from passion, study magic, got the patent, born a patient
Turn around like I'm Fantasia, tell them niggas that I'ma grace ya
I trade you for a Mercedes, baby, I wonder if that chain is real
Stop signs in disguises, man, I wonder if that pain is real
As the sun shine, my nigga Ashlan, man, yeah, he paint the steel
We ain't painin' still, stay still, find ways to stay real
They grill but they don't feel, I grow weaker and weaker
As I bleed through the speaker, Heaven is mine, God is me
I am one with my niggas
I am one with my niggas

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Matt Champion]
I can't deal with the time, I won't listen to you
If you count your check right, they won't give up on you
If you don't pull up on me right, I'ma give it to you
Middle finger to the sky, I'ma give it to you
I can't deal with the time, I won't listen to you
If you count your check right, they won't give up on you
If you don't pull up on me right, I'ma give it to you (Can you turn the beat up?)
Middle finger to the sky, I'ma give it to you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Yeah, call the ambulance, I need a, shh, shh, clear (Woo)
I'm a little tilted like a fallen chandelier (Hello)
I just got my fan, I don't like bullshit, I can't hear (Nah)
Fresh, I done showed up feelin' fresh, ain't it clear?
Can you feel it, can you feel it like that? (I can)
Feelin' like a little feather ticklin' your back (Hoo-hoo)
Right down my face, what do you know? I'm throwin' slack (Hah, hah, hah, hah, hah)
She hold her finger like she flickin' cigarettes
We go low to the side like a jitsu
Get her in a circle, hit on it, no Alexa
Head, 'pon a muscle, 'pon a muscle, no flexin'
I do crazy dance, crazy dance, like I'm George, uh (Woo, woo, yeah)
Who is George? Glad you asked, George Jetson, correct, son
If they not movin', vote, we next 'em, less than (One)
Watch you Lauryn Hill like you bought mansion (Ooh)
One-step, two-step, I'm no choreographer (Hmm, what?)
But I got you dancin', romancin'
She gon' move her body, watch her transform, uh, yeah
She gon' back it up, no need to mention nothin'
Had to take that lovin', lovin' out

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Deal with the time, I won't listen to you
If you count your check right, they won't give up on you
If you don't pull up on me right, I'ma give it to you
Middle finger to the sky, I'ma give it to you
I can't get with the time, I won't listen to you
If you count your check right, they won't give up on you
If you don't pull up on me right, I'ma give it to you
Middle finger to the sky, I'ma give it to you

[Verse 1]
You can't win, you can't break even
And you can't get out of the game
People keep saying things are going to change
But they look just like they're staying the same
You can't win, way over your head
And you only have yourself to blame

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
You can't win, chile
You can’t break even
And you can't get out of the game

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson (The Crows)]
You can't win, the world keeps moving
And you're standing far behind
People keep saying, things will get better
(Just to ease your state of mind)
(So you lean back)(And you smoke that smoke)
(And you drink your glass of wine)

[Chorus]
Sayin' you can't win, chile
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

[Bridge: Michael Jackson (The Crows)]
You can't win, you can't win no way
If your story stays the same
(You ain’t winning) No, no
(But it's nice to see you, I'm awfully glad you came)
(Better cool it, cause it ain't about losin')
Then the world has got no shame

[Chorus]
You can't win, chile
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson (The Crows)]
You can't win, you can't break even
Ain’t the way it's supposed to be
(You'll be spending) No, no, oh
(Your little bit of money)
While someone else rides for free
(Learn your lesson) Hoo-hoo!
(Refuel your mind before some turkey blows out your flame)

[Outro: Michael Jackson (The Crows)]
You can't win, chile
(No, you can't win) 

[4x]

You can't win, chile
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

[Verse 1: Michael & Siedah]
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Both & Siedah]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael & Siedah & Both]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do"
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my Life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael & Both]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

[Bridge: Michael & Siedah & Both]
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always

[Chorus: Both]
I just can't stop loving you (No, baby)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you (Hee-hee-hee, without you, girl)
I just can't stop loving you (You know I do)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

[Q.S.R.]
Quasar, and MJB's crazy, Loco
It's 2-0-0-0
Even they don't know
It don't show
Women they wanna grind in my path
Find a fo' do'
It's only a ninety three
Still they be (Where?)
Behind the meat (Yo)
I needed two points to swing (Then I)
Shot a three, got nigga's hot at me (Word)
But they can't do nada, B (Uh uh)
I'm more economy than the brand new odessey

Hey yo, Carter got it beat, these times and probably
Won't be around for nigga's to finish playing Monopoly
Yo, it's the dolla's B, that got me writin' apologies
The bill collectors, plead the fifth or cop a plea
When they follow me, I'm duckin' like somebody shot at me

[MJB] (Q.S.R.)
If I had my way (I'd hit the highway)
Life would be just fine (Party on Friday)
But the world's too much (It's too much, too much)
And it makes me cry (Feel like I had enough)
Sometimes I feel like leaving (I'm on my way)
But I must be wise (Think twice)
Because time (Come on, sing it wit' me now)
Is not on our side
(Don't you know that time's not on our side)
Because time is not on our side

[MJB]
The end is coming, stop your running
I'm telling you this is the truth
You can talk about what you read about
Everything is on the news
People nowadays so shady
Now what is wrong with them
Something cast a spell up on their minds
And they always wanna condemn

[MJB] (Q.S.R.)
If I had my way (Uh huh)
Life would be just fine (Life would be fine)
But the world's too much (Too much, too much)
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving (It's gotta be gone)
But I must be wise (Mary Jane cries)
Because time (Come on, sing it wit' me now)
Is not on our side

[Don't you know that time is not on our side]
Because time is not on our side

[MJB]
While you're judging me, you should look around
And you'll see how people goin' down
Some of them are killed over a dime
Now tell me do we really have time
To continue with this madness
Cuz I'm sick and tired of it
Trying to crush my world with jealousy
And I'm about to catch a fit

[MJB] (Q.S.R.)
If I had my way (I'd hit the highway)
Life would be just fine (Party on Friday)
But the world's too much (It's too much, too much)
And it makes me cry (Feel like I had enough)
Sometimes I feel like leaving (I'm on my way)
But I must be wise (Yo, think twice)
Because time (Sing it wit' me now)
Is not on our side (Uh huh, yup yup)

[Don't you know that time's not on our side]
Because time (Yo, time is running out)
Is not on our side 

[On our side]

You're deceiving (You can tell lies)
What's the meaning (Then they can falsefy)
If you're retrieving (You're ready for the don)
The enemy's greeting (You know it, ya'all can die)
You all are leaving (Whut) someday but (Whut)
They don't know how (Whut) we are going (Uh uh)
Please believe me (Whut) when I tell you (Whut)
That time is (Whut) not really on our side

[Q.S.R.]
Yo, yo, aight
We gon' talk about life for a minute
How many nigga's out here do dirt but won't admit it, huh?
How many nigga's know shorty young, but still hit it
Same nigga's that'll snatch your chains off and run wit' it
Yellin' Mary J, more cash than Mary K
It rains every day, rock jewels the heavy way
Shorty's wanna talk to the guard, but anyways
All the stress that I got in my life, that make me say

[MJB]
If I had my way
Life would be just fine
But the world's too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving
But I must be wise
Because time
Is not on our side

[Don't you know that time is not on our side]
Because time is not on our side

Repeat above while:
How can you hurt the children
They mean so much to us
They'll soon be leaders
And they will lead us to the rightous path
But you must understand

[Verse]
'Round the world, catch a flight
Say hello, just to say goodbye
Keep you close, far apart
It's a lie, but we're holding on for one more day
Just to live, but we die
We can never survive
Where you been? Who you with?
Call me back
You don't wanna know, took a sip
Just a kiss, not your friend, you don't know him
I apologize, I was low
I was high, I was out of my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Where'd you go?
I'm irresponsible at love
I'm savage when my heart gets cold
Warned you not to get too close

[Chorus]
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try , I try, I try (I try)
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try , I try, I try (I try)
I try to stop myself from hurting you
Try to stop myself from hurting you
Try to stop myself from hurting you, from hurting you, yeah
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try , I try, I try (I try)
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try , I try, I try (I try)
I try to stop myself from hurting you
I try to stop myself from hurting you
Try to stop myself from loving you, from loving you, yeah

[Verse]
'Round the world, catch a flight
Say hello, just to say goodbye
Keep you close, far apart
It's a lie, but we're holding on for one more day
Just to live, but we die
We can never survive
Where you been? Who you with?
Call me back
You don't wanna know, took a sip
Just a kiss, not your friend, you don't know him
I apologize, I was low
I was high, I was out of my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Where'd you go?
I'm irresponsible at love
I'm savage when my heart gets cold
Warned you not to get too close

[Chorus]
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try , I try, I try (I try)
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try , I try, I try (I try)
I try to stop myself from hurting you
Try to stop myself from hurting you
Try to stop myself from hurting you, from hurting you, yeah
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try , I try, I try (I try)
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try , I try, I try (I try)
I try to stop myself from hurting you
I try to stop myself from hurting you
Try to stop myself from loving you, from loving you, yeah

[Verse 1]
When I hear you in the night
I can't help but lose my mind
You know I want it, you know I want it
When you come and shake my bones
I will never dance alone
Just let your love lick, just let your love lick

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm screaming out, I'm burning out
So won't you come and heat it up?
You know I love to taste your drug
I'm lying down, I want it now
So won't you chase the pain away?
You know I like it every way

[Chorus]
Just turn me on like your favorite song
All night (Ah-ah-ah)
So turn me up and I'll make it bump
Let's ride (Ah-ah-ah)

[Verse 2]
When you really run to go
Push it fast, don't let it slow
You know you want me, you know you want me
When I'm pounding in your brain
Hope you know I feel the same
I let my lights show, I let my lights show

[Pre-Chorus]
You're screaming out, you're burning out
You know I want to heat it up
You know you love to taste my drug
You're lying down, you want it now
So I will go and chase the pain
You know you like it every way

[Chorus]
Just turn me on like your favorite song
All night (Ah-ah-ah)
So turn me up and I'll make it bump
Let's ride (Ah-ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Turn it up, let it drop
Fill me up, take me down again
You, me and the radio
Turn it up, let it drop
Fill me up, take me down again
You, me and the radio

[Bridge]
It couldn't get too much louder
So don't take your time if you wanna be mine
It couldn't get too much louder
It's way too late now, you just can't turn it down

[Chorus]
Just turn me on like your favorite song
All night (Ah-ah-ah)
So turn me up and I'll make it bump
Let's ride (Ah-ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Turn it up, let it drop
Fill me up, take me down again
You, me and the radio
Turn it up, let it drop
Fill me up, take me down again
You, me and the radio

[Verse 1]
Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off we go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road

[Verse 2]
Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway, baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go, oh no

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, can they keep it?
Oh no, they can't

[Verse 3]
I'm driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Where you at now
I feel around
There you are

[Verse 4]
Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you how hot can it get
And as you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly you say, I'm not there yet

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, can they keep it?
Oh no, they can't
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, but can they keep it?
Oh no, they can't

[Outro]
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
So long when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She always come too long
Anytime, she goes away
Under the sand, where she's gone
Hey lady!
What you tryna do to me?
Hey lady!
Please don't give me anymore
Hey, he-ay!
What is going through your head
Hey, he-ay!
Daddy got a brand new car

All I ever wanted, babe
Was your love, oh
All I ever needed, girl
Was your touch
All I ever wanted, babe
You to be true
All I ever needed, girl
Was you, ooh...
Ooh!

Hey Jim-ae!
I don't need her anymore
Hey Jim-ae!
You can have her if you want
Hey Summer!
Don't your flowers bloom in spring
Hеy Summer!
Always coming 'round again
All I ever wantеd, babe
Was your love, oh
All I ever needed, girl
Was your touch
All I ever wanted, babe
You to be true
All I ever needed, girl
Was you, ooh

Free woman!
I'm a free man walking out
Free hon-ay!
I don't want your cryin' now
Yes silent!
Glad you caught me for the star
I'm flyin'!

[?]

All I ever wanted, babe
Was your love, oh
All I ever needed, girl
Was your touch
All I ever wanted, babe
You to be true
All I ever needed, girl
Was you, ooh..

[Verse]
I met a liar who reflected in me
I don't think they could tell
I loved a girl who I didn't deserve
So I fucked that up as well
I haven't cut a line in ten long years
Sure does make me think
I wrote a list of my character flaws
Pen ran out of ink

I've said it all along
If you love me, then love me to death

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the noose in the nook
I'm the bad ending book
I'm the one that you wish got away
Before you bit the hook

[Chorus]
I will always learn thе hard way
Compromising those I love
I'd be finе with hurting myself
If it didn't overflow to them
If I love you, I'll love you to death

[Verse]
You'll feel the weight of my actions
I wish I couldn't tell, tell
In spite of all my discretion
I'm poisoning the well, well

I had a girl who was too good for me
She soon would see the same
Do as I say and never as I do
I've put that rule to shame

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the noose in the nook
I'm the bad ending book
I'm the rush that you get when you want to
But can't bear to look

[Chorus]
I will always learn the hard way
Compromising those I love
I'd be fine with hurting myself
If it didn't overflow to them
Learn the hard way
Those I love
Compromising everything I am

[Outro]
Counterproductive and a little destructive
Selfish, like the past ten years didn't even happen
So, I guess I'm learning slow

Caution when approaching
Watch for warning signs
I embody every red flag
It gets bad, I know
Yeah, I know it gets bad
I've said it all along
If you love me, then love me to death

[Verse]
Half asleep, you check to see if I'm alive
Why would you come over just to start a fight?
I'm the type who loves to be alone
All you want's affection, yeah
And all I want's to go

[Chorus]
Euphoria
I try to keep the upper hand and
You're far along
It's not hard to keep the upper hand when
You say I still love you when I choose
Knowing when to lose and let go
Euphoria

[Verse]
Patience is a virtue and I'm falling short
Every time we disagree, I'm out the door
You should not empower me
I feed off the pain
Tantrum tactic obstacles
Keeps us both engaged all the same

[Chorus]
Euphoria
I try to keep the upper hand and
You're far along
It's not hard to keep thе upper hand when
You say I still love you whеn I choose
Knowing when to lose and let go
Euphoria

[Bridge]
I need to sculpt the way you feel
To keep the spark alive and well
'Cause I might never be the one who sees the everlasting
I might never give the time it takes for our finessing
I might never be the one who sees the everlasting
I might never give the time it takes for our finessing

[Verse]
I forget the way it feels to be forgotten
Right up 'til it happens
All the imperfections tell me that I'm rotten
Take what I need and collide

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll burn with the sin
From every room I've stayed in
I deserve to be quartered and drawn

[Chorus]
I forgot the name of the person I'm about to meet
And I keep on validating empty needs
I threw the hotel key away

[Verse]
I'm outside my body watching from the ceiling
That's not what you wanted
Leave that shadowed self-reflеction at the door
No one asked what you'rе doing

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I reap what I sow
From every lie that I've told
I deserve to be drowned in the flood

[Chorus]
I forgot the name of the person I'm about to meet
And I keep on validating empty needs
I forget the names of the people I'm about to meet
But I can't keep validating empty speech
I threw the hotel key away

[Bridge]
Did my fingerprints
Sneak away from me?
I feel closer to the air that floats around you
Than I actually do to you
I feel closer to the air that floats around you
Than I do to you

[Outro]
So it goes
I deserve to be drowned in the flood

[Verse]
The day I found the body
I knew what had come
Walked around the entrails
Fear dissolved the bond
I saw the way it scared them
To go against the tide
When currency's a factor
They fell in line

[Pre-Chorus]
All this time I was thinking
All the things that I would say
If it played out
Would I hang myself or drown?
When it played out
I would run right to it
Now my eyes are open

[Chorus]
You can say what you want
But it'd be wrong still
Be wrong still
You all cover your tracks
While you still run

[Post-Chorus]
Better never ever watch me fold for you
Better never ever not be sold untrue

[Verse]
I counted on my brother
To tell me what to see
Was I not the person
I thought to be?
(Tell me)
Little congregations meet behind my back
Clinging to opinion as if it's fact

[Pre-Chorus]
We reflect one another in a way
Locking on to what we want
But I won't stab anybody in the back
And I won't have what I don't trust

[Chorus]
You can say what you want
But it'd be wrong still
Be wrong still
You all cover your tracks
While you still run
You may go where you like
But you'll end up here
End up here
Watched you cover your tracks
While you still run

[Bridge]
Better never ever watch me fold
Slander
Slander
When I can't speak for myself
No one else should

[Chorus]
You can say what you want
But it'd be wrong still
Be wrong still
You all cover your tracks
While you still run
You may go where you like
But you'll end up here
End up here
Saw you cover your tracks
While you still run

[Outro]
Better never ever watch me fold for you
Better never ever not be sold untrue
Slander
Slander

[Verse]
I remember watching and waiting to talk
Couldn't get enough of the way that you spoke
You'd come over here soon after that
Left your tears one by one in Malibu sand

Though we knew we shouldn't
We acted on impulse
Who were we to fight it
The magnetic pull
Drove you aimlessly through Echo Park
Taught me patience while I taught you guitar
As we fell apart

[Chorus]
Wherever we end up
Know that you've made your mark
I'm forever lost
Forever caught by your moment on Earth

[Verse]
I can be deceptive
I'll never deserve you
And even though it's selfish
I still want you near
From your flat we'd view Chelsea at night
You'd play piano while I took in the sight
You, not the light

[Chorus]
Wherever we end up
Know that you've made your mark
I'm forever lost
Forever caught by
Photos in a chapter
Black city cabs on the bridge
Wherever you end up
I'm forever marked
Forever marked
Forever marked

[Chorus]
The walls around me spin
I think of the way it began
If I were to know all the things
That would change for that rush
I'd still do it again

[Verse]
All that I've wanted is all that I've known
The callous pursuit of stimulants to a fault
Open the vault

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do I seek that knowing the damage?
I face the scars on my arms
I can't deny that I romanticize it
Missing the times that I've mourned

[Chorus]
The walls around me spin
I think of the way it began
If I were to know all the things
That would change for that rush
I'd do it again

[Verse]
What ever happened to all that I've learned?
That darkened abyss
I really shouldn't miss at all
But hеre I go

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinking about the glass shatterеd around me
Shame from the promise I broke
I can't deny that I romanticize it
Missing the times that I've mourned

[Bridge]
Shadow men stalked me all through the night
Shadow men stalked me all through the night

[Chorus]
The walls around me spin
I think of the way it began
If I were to know all the things
That would change for that rush
I'd do it again

[Bridge]
Pull it, push it, tight fist
Pull it, push it and enter the void
But I escaped so long ago

[Outro]
Don't look down
Don't look down
The tourniquet I shouldn't miss
I shouldn't miss the warm caress
How can I?

[Intro]
Burning fission
Eight-six eight-one-five
Burning solemn

[Breakdown]
Break in the through the weakness
We are like a virus
Focus on the vein that is leaking
It's leaking
Acting under pressure anything is justified
Doing what they're told
Crossing T's, dotting I's
And I wonder
And I wonder
And I wonder

[Verse]
Do we siphon sunlight?
Are we leeches in debris?
Make us suffer silent
So you can all pretend that you don't see

[Pre-Chorus]
Concept lost on all of us

[Chorus]
Decay, disarray
The crisis doctors say I'm not okay
If God is watching us
This must be what it wants

[Post-Chorus]
Decimated, waiting
Died off as we waited

[Verse]
Do we siphon sunlight?
Are we leeches in debris?
Make us suffer silent
So you can all pretend that you don't see

[Breakdown]
Break in the through the weakness
We are like a virus
Focus on the vein that is leaking
It's leaking
They just do as they're told
Why stay here if we know
That we're under
That we're under
That we're under?

[Chorus]
Decay, disarray
The crisis doctors say I'm not ok
A means to an end
We're told this is a parasitic cleanse
If God is watching us, this must be what it wants

[Post-Chorus]
Decimated, waiting
Died off as we waited

[Verse]
Looking back, I see
All that you hid from
Was all that I touched
Will I be your scar or a metaphor?

[Chorus]
Talk taken away
Which side of me comes out today?
Time floats away
How many days was I awake?
The walls around begin to drown me in my sleep
This isolation isn't good for me

[Breakdown]
All the clocks are spinning backwards
And the pictures begin to speak to me

[Verse]
All that you hid from was all that I touched
Will I be your scar or a metaphor?
The little notches on my ego tell me to keep you for myself
Why am I like this?
Is it broken?

[Chorus]
Talk taken away
Which side of me comes out today?
This isolation isn't good for me

[Bridge]
I must control the way you feel
(Melt in to the wall with me)
For all of it to seem real

[Breakdown]
All the faces melt into the wall
And the paint, I think, begins to laugh
I'm just a piece of living breathing furniture
Eyes, mouth, skin, lips, shut
Kiss the doctor

[Outro]
The little notches on my ego tell me to keep you for myself
Why am I like this?
Is it broken?
All that you hid from was all that I touched
Will I be your scar or a metaphor?

[Verse]
If we leave this world then we do it all together
My heart is heavy all the time and dying for the truth
So let's follow suit as we leave our minds for better
We have to do it now
Together all at once

[Chorus]
Don't wait
Wash it down and lead the others
Can't stay
Don't be mistaken
Don't wait
Wash it down, beseech the others
Be saved
Force feed the children

[Verse]
False pretenses conniving up against us
We're half a world away from thеm and almost to the next
To live and to suffеr is never getting better
I want to change the way I am
And this is how we leave everything else
For a better world
No, no

[Chorus]
Don't wait
Wash it down and lead the others
Can't stay
Don't be mistaken
Don't wait
Wash it down, beseech the others
Be saved
Force feed the children

[Bridge]
We follow God to the temple now
You need to drink 'til the heart stops
When the glasses are emptied out
All the people around drop
We go now
We go now
Let's all escape this world together
The temple now is the future

If you run then they're gonna shoot
Everyone has to see it through
If you run then they're gonna shoot
You're gonna to be the target

[Chorus]
Don't wait
Wash it down and lead the others
Can't stay
Don't be mistaken
Don't wait
Wash it down, beseech the others
Be saved
Force feed the children
And there were future reflections
On the face and the hands
On a green colored island
On a primitive man
It was the future reflecting
It felt familiar but new
A street was missing a building
The kids had something to do

There was a feeling the spirit was leaving
Red like a marker
So my tribe, with my knife
Cut the heart from a lonely life

I saw patterns on floorboards
Deep in the dust was a leader
Someone was walking on floorboards
Turning from oak into cedar
He can assess the situation
I wrapped a string around my finger
Into the forest with the young ones
I don't expect to be a winner
But as long as you feel it
I'm a believer
My heart is phosphor
Sea rolls and death tolls
Break the surface don't break my bones

Off of the trail and off of your hands and
Onto a new plan
Is the cost to stay lost
Forever in an empty skin
Pale and thin

If it's good, or if it's fortune, I can't tell
But pieces come together for some reason just as well
Their guns couldn't see us
There's a sea outside my door
And one day I'll appreciate
The rush of blood and the washed out beat of the shore

And remember what it felt like
To be alone
Sitting in the sunlight
All alone

Thank you very much, everybody
Thank you

[Intro]
Electric

[Verse 1]
In the dark, when you feel lost
Wanna be the best, but at what cost?
If you're gonna stay here
Nothing's ever changin', no
Big world, gotta see it all
Gotta get up even when you fall
There's no point in waitin', no

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh) They'll try to bring you down
(Oh) But you've got the power now

[Chorus]
I know you feel it (Feel it)
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be
Electric
Oh, I can see it, see it
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be
Electric (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Long road, got a ways to go
Took a big step, but you're not alone
'Cause we got each other
There's so much you'll discover
Headstrong, but your heart is stronger
Stay calm walkin' through the fire
I know you're gonna make it out

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh) They'll try to bring you down
(Oh) But you've got the power now

[Chorus]
I know you feel it, feel it
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be
Electric
Oh, I can see it, see it
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be
Electric

[Bridge]
(Oh) They'll try to bring you down
(Oh) You're electric right now
Electric
(Oh) But you've got the power now
(Oh) You've got the power now
Electric
You've got the power now
Woah-oh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I know you feel it, feel it
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be
Electric
Oh, I can see it, see it (Oh, I can see it)
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be
Electric

[Outro]
(Oh) They'll try to bring you down
(Oh) You're electric right now
Electric
(Oh) But you've got the power now
(Oh) You've got the power now
You've got the power now

[Verse 1: Joba]
Thank you for your patience, but it's too complicated
This time I know better than to trust you one more time
Fame is overrated, and I'm not even famous
This time I know better than to trust you one more time

[Refrain: Joba]
Picking up what you are putting down
I'm just picking up what you are putting down
I'm just picking up what you are putting down
I'm just picking up what you are putting down
Picking up what you are putting down
I'm just picking up what you are putting down
I'm just picking up what you are putting down
I'm just picking up what you are putting down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon & Joba ]
Murder, I hear bloody murder
Murmurs from observers in my head that might disturb ya
Bleeding with the burner, can't be a preserver
Just might crash the server if we take this any further
Bitch, I'm on point like a cursor
Play to smell like concrete if you want it to get firmer
Terracotta, terra firma
Through the shadows we emerge, uh (Murder them)
Kept outside the water until they cannot submerge us (Murder them)
Watch these bodies earn, ugh (Bloody murder)

[Verse 1]
Hawaiian Tropic Dark and a bottle of Jack
In the Cadillac, as I drive down the highway
You aren't coming back and I know that now
So I let the wind hit me in my face

[Chorus]
You spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and every day
We almost had it all, didn't we, baby?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Your red Hawaiian shirt and your hair jet black
Hangin' 'round with your good for nothing friends, bettin' by the track
Baby, you can't come back from being that bad
Just to sit at home, pledge allegiance to the flag

[Pre-Chorus]
And still
I remember everything that I miss
And I love the way that you'd say
That every man gets his wish

[Chorus]
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and every day
We almost had it all, didn't we, baby?
Yeah
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and every day
We almost had it all, didn't we, baby?
Didn't we?

[Verse 3]
Copacabana, yes, in my party dress
I'm shimmering in love on that crystal meth
There were velvet Elvis and the rosaries
In your white Corvette under willow trees
You're the one for me, my one true king

[Chorus]
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and every day
We almost had it all, didn't we, baby?
Yeah
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and every day
We almost had it all, didn't we, baby?
Didn't we?

[Outro]
You're the one for me, you're the one for me
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one for me, babe, yeah
Ah, right

Take the pain away
I can be the star that burn in the dark
Take your pain away
I can be your love, be your love on the side

I can be your babe

[Intro: Ant Clemons & Young Thug]
Turned to a Mothra, bro, this that Godzilla
Turned to a monster, more like Othello

Sixteen years, I've been popping these pills (Ah)

I got locked up and then I had to take the helicopter to LIV

Turned to a Mothra, bro, this that Godzilla
Turned to a monster, more like Othello

And my nightmares, they haunt me (Ooh ooh)
But I won't let 'em get the best of me

Thirty thousand, catch me on a motherfucking highway

[mumbling]
Huh, really?
You don't see me like bessie, no, ay
Ridin' round like betsy ro, ay

[mumbling]
Hopefully this song in there!
I confess that I was lost before
The lights made me lose my direction
My aching heart now riots, rules my actions
I sense your ignorance, voiceless,I cannot move on

Don't let this love fall again down
I don’t wanna feel again like on a high rope
I adore getting grabbed by your attention
And I'm desperate to feel your devotion

Be my umbrella in the burning rain
Catch my tears and keep me safe
I only want to feel pain when you agree with it
You are my saviour, far from my enemy

Don't let this love fall again down
I don’t wanna feel again like on a high rope
I adore getting grabbed by your attention
And I'm desperate to feel your devotion

And my love, when I hear your soft voice
My spine is burning to ashes and the lust grows
I wanna be real with you, baby
Because you're making my life having goals
Don't let this love fall again down
I don't wanna feel again like on a high rope
I adore getting grabbed by your attention
And I'm desperate to feel your devotion

[Chorus]
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

[Verse]
You were a child crawling on your knees toward it
Making mama so proud, but your voice is too loud
We like to watch you laughing
You pick the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences

[Chorus]
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of tree—

Don't put me off, 'cause I'm on fire
And I can't quench my desire

But you don't even know I'm alive
And this pounding in my heart just won't die
I'm burning up

Well, that only makes me want you more
And day and night, I cry for your love
You're not convinced that that is enough
To justify my wanting you
Now tell me what you want me to do
I'm not blind, and I know
That you want to want me, but you can't let go
C'mon, let go

And you're wanting my body, I don't mind
Baby, all I've got is time
And I'm waiting to make you mine
You say you wanna stay the night
But you'll leave me tomorrow, I don't care
All of your moves are right
We can take it anywhere

Baby, won't you stay a while?
It could be such a fantasy

I'm burning up, burning up for your love
For your love

[Verse 2]
You're always closing your door
Well, that only makes me want you more
And day and night, I cry for your love
You're not convinced that that is enough
To justify my wanting you
Now tell me what you want me to do
I'm not blind, and I know
That you want to want me, but you can't let go
C'mon, let go

[Chorus]
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
For your lovе, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Do you wanna see me down on my knees?
Or bending over backwards, now, would you bе pleased?
Unlike the others, I'd do anything
I'm not the same, I have no shame
I'm on fire

[Verse 2]
You're always closing your door
Well, that only makes me want you more
And day and night, I cry for your love
You're not convinced that that is enough

I'm not blind, and I know
That you want to want me, but you can't let go
C'mon, let go

[Verse 1]
Don't put me off, 'cause I'm on fire
And I can't quench my desire
Don't you know that I'm burning up for your love?
You're not convinced that that is enough
I put myself in this position
And I deserve the imposition
But you don't even know I'm alive
And this pounding in my heart just won't die
I'm burning up

[Chorus]
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
For your love

C'mon, let go (Go, go, go)

[Chorus]
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
For your love, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Do you wanna see me down on my knees?

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
Los Angeles is dangerous
Them things they bust try cancel us
Los Angeles is dangerous
Them things they bust try cancel us
Los Angeles is dangerous
Them things they bust try cancel us
Los Angeles is dangerous
Them things they bust try cancel us

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
I've been on some other shit, ducking undercovers
I've been running from the government, racist white Republicans
Now I'm out in California, Prius full of vegans
Always late to meetings with rich white people
Fuck these rich white people, stroke my ego
My white bitch got a Black ass—I love white people
I know they got me brainwashed, I was watching Baywatch
"Mommy, where the colored people?" Then she lost her day job
We was watching Jamie Foxx, I'ma move to LA
I'ma get my money up, I'ma be a famous rapper
Only got a hundred bucks, Daddy let me take his truck
In this truck, I had a mic, I had my niggas set it up
Arrive on 37th Street, think my past just set me up
Niggas throwing sets up, but that shit don't upset us
Had to quit my day job, I would work security
Lyrics on my cellphone, protecting my community
You don't see how clear it be? A angel right in front of me
Came to me inside a dream, told me to grab on her wings
Camera lens up on my face, tell your boy to stay in place
Reason why I love my state, let's see if the world agree

[Break: Ameer Vann]
Ever since I came to LA
Ever since I came to LA
Ever since I came to LA
Ever since I came to LA

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Running through Elysium, I done died a hundred times
Demons hit the high-beams, I'm trying to adjust my eyes
Smuggled in a angel past the borders of my broken mind
All the other angels on the bridge committing suicide
Lucifer is petrified, everybody lost faith
Sky turned into fire before I could find a prom date
When we hit the streets, they couldn't calculate the crime rate
Acid in the fireplace, Hades for the holidays
I could tell you all the horror stories of my past life
I been having visions where I'm sipping on my last light
Poison in the palace from the chalice of my past wife
Murdered by my confidence, the closet drew the last knife
Swerving past the lava, hope I make it to get baptized

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Man, ever since I came to California
I've felt so lonely even though I stay with homies
But, damn, I can't wait to get out California
Floating by my lonely with some money just to hold me

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
I don't trust nobody on the West Coast
Turned me to an asshole
Wanna break my phone, turn into a ghost
Guess I'm just an asshole
People walking in and out the house like, "Who is you?
Man, who you is? Man, who is this?
You ain't even introduce yourself
You gon' step inside my house with your shoes on?
And it's raining, and I'm pissed off
No, I really don't remember what your name is
And that's really not me acting famous
'Cause I'm not famous—bad memory"
"South Central, man, isn't that a bad place?
'There were riots in the '90s, you might die' place"
Nah, this "hundred in the summer, sink or swim" place
This a "world's best tacos on the corner" place
This a "they will hold you down if you respect" place
So don't get comfortable, 'cause really, this ain't my place
Been to SoHo, been to Cannes, been to one-oh
That's some fake industry, but it's fun, though
Smoking on the patio with my hood up
Out of place—ask the bar for some smokes, man
"Did you know? Did you see? There's a dress code"
Scott Disick saying, "Who the hell are we, man?"
Shit, guess he just an asshole like me, damn

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Man, ever since I came to California
I've felt so lonely even though I stay with homies
But damn, I can't wait to get out California
Floating by my lonely with some money just to hold me
Man, ever since I came to California
I've felt so lonely even though I stay with homies
But damn, I can't wait to get out California
Floating by my lonely with some money just to hold me
Man, ever since I came to California
I've felt so lonely even though I stay with homies
But damn, I can't wait to get out California
Floating by my lonely with some money just to hold me
Man, ever since I came to California
I've felt so lonely even though I stay with homies
But damn, I can't wait to get out California
Floating by my lonely with some money just to hold me

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
See, that's the reason I don't like to talk
Niggas move they hands 'til they hit the wall
I'll be in this van 'til the early morn'
I don't want a friend I want a million bucks (Help me out now)
See, that's the reason I don't like to talk
Niggas move they hands 'til they hit the wall
I'll be in this van 'til the early morn'
I don't want a friend I want a million bucks

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I'll never be who you want me to be (What)
Wear my own pants, should've probably popped the seat
Made my own clothes, I don't need no receipt
'Less it's Holiday on me like I'm Jesus Tree
A lotta you niggas try to be like me
Vibe jack it all you want, 'cause nigga this the OG
Done with the teenage shit too
I'm just a cute-ass nigga with a gap-tooth
Niggas online always got a fuckin' attitude
I've been the weird one out since the classroom
And y'all be wonderin' why I'm actin' crazy now
They call me corny but I'm thinkin' that we're idols now
I'm eatin' fast food, yellin' this what life about
Nigga took the harder route, ended up with less friends
They took the faster route, ended up with no ends
I'm like Wayne in '04, this where my story begins
And this that—

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
See, that's the reason I don't like to talk
Niggas move they hands 'til they hit the wall
I'll be in this van 'til the early morn'
I don't want a friend, I want a million bucks (Help me out now)
See, that's the reason I don't like to talk
Niggas move they hands 'til they hit the wall
I'll be in this van 'til the early morn'
I don't want a friend, I want a million bucks

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Bet you're only talkin' to me for a benefit
If you get around me, you wouldn't ask me if
Is my mental, is my dental, is my health good?
When they're crashin' through my cars, see me on the hood
Better get insurance, when the tire burns
Break the mirror on the side, man, that's seven years
Of fuckin' bad luck, want to see me sad, fuck
Walkin' under ladders 

[?]
Not too superstitious, rather build a business
Not to worry 'bout the petty shit in your britches
Color-coordinated, give a fuck about the gossip
Let me boss up, let me make it on my own
Who the God, who the God, who let the birds chirp

[?] then we hit the curb
Riding on the front lawn, anybody doubt me?
That's some teachers, that's some people
Not too good with names, you—

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
See, that's the reason I don't like to talk
Niggas think they haters 'til they hit the wall
I'll be in this van 'til the early morn'
I don't want a friend I want a million bucks (Help me out now)
See, that's the reason I don't like to talk
Niggas think they haters 'til they hit the wall
I'll be in this van 'til the early morn'
I don't want a friend, I want a million bucks

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Get up off your ass
Know I gotta have some, gotta get my ransom
Babblin', babblin', babblin'
What's all this babblin', this time, I would've had 'em, man
Have gun, and I said I will travel, man
Shootin' at eleven, I'm Wilt Chamberlain

[?] liberty

[?] everything
When I failed seventh grade, since a kid, man
I mean, Ghana, I mean
Fuck any nationality tryna prevent me
By any violence I will take currency

[?]
I'll whoop that trick, I'll take that beat
Who stomp
I'll whoop that trick, I'll take that beat

[Bridge: Joba]
You better watch your mouth 'cause that shit spew out
When you talk about what I'm worth
Y'all talk to talk (Everybody wanna talk that shit)
Y'all talk to talk (Everybody wanna talk that shit)
You better watch your mouth 'cause that shit spew out
When you talk about what I'm worth
Y'all talk to talk (Everybody wanna talk that shit)
Y'all talk to talk (Everybody wanna talk that shit)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
See, that's the reason I don't like to talk
Niggas think they haters 'til they hit the wall
I'll be in this van 'til the early morn'
I don't want a friend I want a million bucks (Help me out now)
See, that's the reason I don't like to talk
Niggas think they haters 'til they hit the wall
I'll be in this van 'til the early morn'
I don't want a friend I want a million bucks

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
God as my witness, I ain't sadistic
I'm just a soul that's been tortured beyond its limits
Feel like an idiot, feel like a misfit
A fallen angel that's lost its chance at repentance
Ain't no forgiveness for how I ran up them digits
I'm too colorful, wonderful, ambitious
See, bein' me ain't easy, it's sacrilegious
I need assistance to maximize my existence
Gratification instant, gratitude nonexistent

[?] just servin' between the ridges
I've been up to make shit
Burned all my bridges
Death in the distance, killed all the princes
Draped a fine linen, fell out the sky
Built Earth in my image, now I can fly
See, legends can't die, we too altruistic
Y'all some fake tears, so hop off my business

[Verse 5: Ameer Vann]
I sell it by the gram, money loves my hands
I pull a few bands out a plastic bag
And it all add up, I'm real good with the math
I turn a quarter of the gas into a bundle of cash
They always come back for what I put in the bag
From my bones to my skin, I'm a businessman
I know cash is the law, you could lose your head
Get shot in the back and you could lose your legs
Niggas sing for the feds to avoid the pen
They atone for sins, I don't trust no men
Cops raidin' my house off some shit you said
Niggas strapped with mics, they'll take your life

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Merlyn Wood]
I'll keep it locked in my pocket for you
We so tired, when the sun gon' show up?
(Yeah!) Fireworks make me feel alive in the morning
(Yeah, yeah!) Fireworks make me feel alive in the morning
I'll keep it locked in my pocket for you
We so tired, when the sun gon' show up?
(Yeah!) Fireworks make me feel alive in the morning
(Yeah, yeah!) Fireworks make me feel alive in the morning

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
Hi, guys! Come to the south side
Where niggas pop them fireworks when they drive by
The helicopters, they fly over, I wave "hi"
The men in red throw gang signs when I skate by
I walk the line between South Central and Van Nuys
A nice house, a quiet life, and clear skies
No butterflies on the south side of the city
All my niggas is with me, this is just the beginning

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I'm absentminded, intelligent, with too many thoughts
Personify 'em in voices whenever I'm distraught
Who's making choices inside of me when I'm feeling lost?
They say I made it, don't ever imagine it's the cost
On autopilot whenever I have to operate
Within constraints of society when it concentrates
I'm separating inside of myself and contemplate
I don't cooperate, fuck how you congregate

[Verse 3: JOBA]
Oh, were those gunshots or fireworks? Still can't tell the difference
I got press, street cred nonexistent
I was paranoid, my bank account was empty
Spent the money that I had on ice cream
I wore a sportcoat to feel like a rich man
And like the fake wood on the floor, I watch the cars peel off
Poppin' bullets, I was sweating bullets, mind my business
Had no air conditioning, didn't have a lot of shit I wanted
I had a microphone and twenty dumbasses wanting to hop on—
The microphone, so I just record 'em all
And then we made some songs that got real big and all
Just kidding, they kinda did, but not really, sort of
Um, we got out the hood—bye!

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Merlyn Wood]
I'll keep it locked in my pocket for you
We so tired, when the sun gon' show up?
(Yeah!) Fireworks make me feel alive in the morning
(Yeah, yeah!) Fireworks make me feel alive in the morning
I'll keep it locked in my pocket for you
We so tired, when the sun gon' show up?
(Yeah!) Fireworks make me feel alive in the morning
(Yeah, yeah!) Fireworks make me feel alive in the morning

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I used to hate going to school, Mama said it's cool
But they still standing there, ripping me out my seatbelt (Ooh)
I eat lunch with the counselors, should I bring a friend?
Play Connect Four, eat nuggets shaped like some dinosaurs
I had a crush on Maddie (Aww) 'til she threw up on her TAKS test

[?] signed her cast in 

[?] text
I wanna be pro baller 'til I saw Baker 3
That's a free-living, piss-drunk, feelin' billy goat curse
Cuz-loving, eye bag-having, take a nap-ass
But actin' like a airbag beacon, don't speak about the trip
On the 

[?], on the weekend
Even Steven bleeding reruns, TV glisten

[Outro]
Shut up! Shut up!

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
Bust your head inside my Camry
If I ever see your camera
Bust your head inside my Camry
Yeah, yeah, I'm sweeter than a motherfucker

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood, with Ameer Vann]
Bust your head inside my Camry
If I ever see your camera
Bust your head inside my Camry
If I ever see your camera

Huff, huh, huh, huh, huh (If I ever see your camera)

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I'm the elephant in the room, demon under the bed
Genius within the walls, monsters inside your head
I rebel without a pulse and saddle into the dead
So give me all of your dreams and I intertwine all the threads
Reality by design, 

[?] dread
I listen to what they say, it's what I'm goin' against
It's what we goin' against, it's keeping me up at night
I'm killing all of that shit that's made interfere with my sight, huh

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Wanna eat shellfish, belching on the balcony
Fuck a Lambo', I feel better in a Camry
If I see some candids of me, it get to duffing
If I see some candids, you ain't seen nothing
We don't do NDAs, we just do fists, man
'Bout to blow a stickman fuckin' with my shit, man
Big business money comin' just like a tidal wave
I don't roll the window down, I just do a small wave
Keep my feelings concave, my trust underground
When the cameras come around, you will never see me 'round
Round it out, throw it up, just in the roundabout
Just like a rollercoaster, fuck away from me, man

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
Sell it by the gram, money loves my hands
I pull a few bands out a plastic bag
And it all add up, I'm real good with the math
I turn a quarter of the gas to a bundle of cash
They always come back for what I put in the bag
From my bones to my skin, I'm a businessman
I know cash is the law, you could lose your head
Get shot in the back and you could lose your legs
Niggas sing for the feds to avoid the pen
They atone for sin, I don't trust no men
Cops raid my house off some shit you said
Niggas strapped with mics, they'll take your life

[Intro: Matt Champion]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
'Round the clock, 'cause anyone could be right on your back
No problem, bruh
Life will never give you that, you gotta corral 'em up
The world don't shed a tear when the past erupt
Shit, you got in any drama, keep my head low
She get money like (Aw)
She get money like (Aw)
She get money like (Aw)
She get money like

[Chorus: Matt Champion]
Rich boy, rich boy
Baby just want a rich boy
Rich boy, rich boy
Baby just want a pocket full of cash
Want a pocket full of cash
Rich boy, rich boy
Baby just want a pocket full of cash

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
See how full it is, homie?
See how real it is, huh?
Hell no! (Woah!)

[Verse 2: Joba & Matt Champion]
Green cash, rеd flag
Big sad, think fast
Got a fist full
Grab ass, Bojack
All you do is horse around, stop that
I’ll buck back
Switch up, switched back
News flash, fakе news
Fuck you, fuck that
Draw backs, give back, give thanks
All that, all day, won’t change
When I get paid, everybody else paid
This ain’t play money, we can buy anything
Crown jewel hold me down when I’m on the move
Count my blessings, count my blessings too
Give thanks for the blessings
Blessings, blessings, blessings, blessings, woo-ooh-ooh

Give thanks for the blessings

Push up on me like I got a golden touch
And you talk to me, baby, like you know it's worth it
I never lose money when I come to spend shit
So you ain't gotta ask me if I seen the prices

Empty out my pockets

I see how hard you are tryin’
To be the one providin’
How can I be smiling, when I don’t know what happens next?
Empty out my pockets

[Verse: Merlyn Wood & Dijon]
I'm screwed up, different mindset
I'm a hot boy, I need a hot chick
I can't be loveless on sunset
I play the cup 'til ain't nothing left (One fifty on the dash)
Ride your bitch, while you ride a bench (I’ll hit you when the phone ring twice, ooo!)
I'm no pimp, but I know the steps (I’ma meet you outside, ooo!)
I came in with Chanel stench
I'm from Texas, I don't run from shit

[Bridge: Merlyn Wood]
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-dum
I'll feed your fantasy
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-dum

I’m a hot boy, I need a hot chick- (I’ll hit you when the phone ring twice, ooo!)
I’m a hot boy, I need a hot chick- (I’ma meet you outside, ooo!)
I need a hot chick-
I need a hot chick-

Take back all your love 'cause
Fake words ain't enough, no

But you only care how your money talks
One rose layin' on your grave 'cause
You pushed everyone away but
My mausoleum, pretty like Versailles
Man, I played it out 'bout a thousand times, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You won't hear my teardrops when they're fallin'
Engine drownin' out the sound, you hear me comin'
Went and got it all, just to prove you wrong

Watch you use her up, and then I watch you go under
Bad look, yeah
Watch me flourish as your fall, yeah-yeah

Tinted windows and my teardrops when they're fallin'
Engine drownin' out the sound, you hear me comin'
Went and got it all, just to prove you wrong

Yeah, I've been fantasizin' 'bout it, yeah

[Chorus]
Get away, yeah
We need to get away, yeah, yeah
Talking segregate, yeah
We need to segregate, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Get away
We need to get away, yeah
I'm talking segregation, yeah
'Cause I could care, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Me and you under the night lights, you know I love it in the night time, yeah
Lately there's been so much on my mind, yeah
I've been waiting for this my whole life
It's finally time, it's finally time, yeah
Now let me give you a peace of mine, yeah
That would give me a little piece of mind, yeah
Is you down, 'cause I don't hit reply, I don't hit reply, yeah
Serenades is all I hear
I just wish that you were here
My letters to you, sincere
I wish I could show I care, yeah

[Chorus]
Get away, yeah
We need to get away, yeah, yeah
Talking segregate, yeah
We need to segregate, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Get away
We need to get away
I'm talking segregation, yeah
'Cause I could care, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I’m not good at saying bye bye, yeah
And best believe it, baby, I try, yeah
My friends all tell me that I'm too kind, yeah
'Cause I know even if it's I die, at least I say I tried
I know that you don't believe I'm fine, yeah
Don't do it on purpose, it's a sideless
Don't end up with my heart and my mind, yeah
Last thing I want to see is you cry, yeah
It's too bright, yeah

[Chorus]
Get away, yeah
We need to get away, yeah, yeah
Talking segregate, yeah
We need to segregate, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Get away
We need to get away, yeah, yeah
I'm talking segregation
'Cause I could care, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I put the same pedal down, on the same metal slung
The same gravel goodbye high
I burned the same bridges up, with the same finger up
She got out the driver's side

[Pre-Chorus]
So I know what never comin' back looks like
Looks like she ain't ever comin' back

[Chorus]
It’s usually me doing the leaving, me doing the running
I don't know where she's going
But I know a little something 'bout
Smokin' up them Goodyears
To know that it ain't lookin' good here for thе home crowd
Guess she bеat me at my own game
Thing about a two-lane, guess it's gotta work both ways
What goes around, comes around, came around and here I am now
On this side of a dust cloud

[Verse 2]
She's burnin' unleaded and my own medicine
Tastes more bitter than sweet
Her tires are turnin' and the tables are too
Never seen a broken heart from this point of view

[Chorus]
It’s usually me doing the leaving, me doing the running
I don't know where she's going
But I know a little something 'bout
Smokin' up them Goodyears
To know that it ain't lookin' good here for the home crowd
Guess she beat me at my own game
Thing about a two-lane, guess it's gotta work both ways
What goes around, comes around, came around and here I am now
On this side of a dust cloud

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
So I know what never comin' back looks like
Looks like she ain't ever comin' back
Yeah, I know what never comin' back looks like
Looks like she ain't ever lookin' back

[Chorus]
It’s usually me doing the leaving, me doing the running
I don't know where she's going
But I know a little something 'bout
Smokin' up them Goodyears
To know that it ain't lookin' good here for the home crowd
Guess she beat me at my own game
Thing about a two-lane, guess it's gotta work both ways
What goes around, comes around, came around and here I am now
On this side of a dust cloud
Goes around, comes around, came around and here I am now
On this side of a dust cloud

[Outro]
On this side of a dust cloud

[Verse 1]
Girl, since you left me
Been tryin' to forget we
Ever became what we were
And I poured some whiskey
On places you kissed me
Tried to wash off all the hurt
But ain't nothin' workin'
I've lived out the words in
A thousand old sad country songs
But whenever I try to move on

[Chorus]
It's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
Tryna tell a cowboy to slow down
It's like watchin' the way that the river rolls
And then tellin' it to turn back around
And I've held some strangers, told people I hatе you
But I just keep hittin' a wall
It's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
It just don't do mе no good at all

[Verse 2]
If I was only
Heart broke and lonely
I'd head on back down to the bar
Find me a companion
But you left a canyon
Can't nobody fill in this heart

[Chorus]
And girl, it's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
Tryna tell a cowboy to slow down
It's like watchin' the way that the river rolls
And then tellin' it to turn back around
And I've held some strangers told people I hate you
But I just keep hittin' a wall
It's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
It just don't do me no good at all
No damn good, damn good, damn good at all

[Bridge]
And baby tell me how you did it?
I just gotta know
And tell me what's your secret?
And how'd you let me go so easy?

[Chorus]
'Cause girl, it's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
Tryna tell a cowboy to slow down
It's like watchin' the way that the river rolls
And then tellin' it to turn back around
Oh, I've held some strangers told people I hate you
But I just keep hittin' a wall
It's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
It just don't do me no good at all
It's like tryna to put a bandaid on a bullet hole
It just don't do me no good at all
No damn good, damn good, damn good at all
Intro:
(Don't fuck with me)

There's no beef, I'm a motherfuckin' vegan

Unless I'm freakin', jump in the jeep and
With my man and my angel of a girlfriend (Fun)

And you're feedin' my anticipation for appetite, hey
You a mouse, I'm a fuckin' pussycat, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm hunty, get real cunty
If I come for you, it will not be funty
Used to have short hair and longer acrylics
From the back with a new vibe and still gonna kill it
I told you once before I'm a mother's daughter
But you think I jump the gun with my achy breaky father
So I put in the time, and I put in the work
And you need to sit down before you get hurt, hey

[Chorus]
I'm a cheetah, not a zebra
Better run faster, I'ma eat ya
Sagittarius, not a Libra
I'm on my new shit, nice to meet ya
Sagittarius, not a Libra, hey, hey, hey
Sagittarius, not a Libra (I’m on that new shit)

[Outro]
I lick my paw then I go and get my wallet
I'm on my new shit, 'bout to get you all lit (All lit)
Lick your paw then you go and get your wallet
We on that new shit, 'bout to get you all lit
Lick your paw 'cause we goin' to the mall, yeah
Hey, hey, hey (Ayy)
Lick, lick, lick your paw (Hey)
Lick, lick, lick your paw (Hey)

Lick, lick, lick your paw (Hey, I’m on that new shit)
Lick, lick, lick your paw (Hey)
Lick, lick, lick your paw (Hey, I’m on that new shit)

[Intro]
One night everywhere, one night everywhere
One night everywhere, one night everywhere

[Verse 1]
Dawn has reared its welcome head
I lay in bed bravely
Waiting for the day to begin

[Verse 2]
Hours pass reading the news of the day
That begins in such a state
I bravely await fate

[Chorus]
Am I going insane?
Am I able to wake from the nightmare?
Can I keep it containеd?
One night everywhеre turned to nowhere

[Instrumental & Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Human race deserves its steaming fate on a plate
We did exploit the fish of the sea
And the birds of the heavens
And even the bugs in the ground
And every creeping thing that creeps on Earth

[Chorus]
Am I going insane?
Am I able to wake from the nightmare?
Can I keep it contained?
One night everywhere turned to nowhere

[Verse 1]
Bone stock brewed up, graveyard shoot up
Came in trapdoor, thrown up on the floor
Servants of the lord of lung slaughter
The Necromancer
Woo!

[Verse 2]
Orange baby always squealing
Cradle snatch the new world fading
The final test, it takes your breath
Desecrates our grave
Woo!

[Chorus]
Drink the blood of that you spill
Underneath the whippoorwill
One more piece of Jenga to pull
Then Necromancer will thank us all

[Bridge]
Eager to assimilate
And I choose you to walk on your pleura

[Extended Chorus]
Drink the blood of that you spill
Underneath the whippoorwill
One more piece of Jenga to pull
Then Necromancer will thank us all
Suck the life from what you love
I learnt that from the orange one
No one to answer to after the fall
Necromancer will dance on us all

[Chorus]
Drink the blood of that you spill (Pleura, Pleura, Pleura...)
Underneath the whippoorwill (Pleura, Pleura, Pleura...)
One more piece of Jenga to pull (Pleura, Pleura, Pleura...)
Then Necromancer will thank us all

[Outro]
Eager to assimilate
And I choose you to walk on your pleura
Cheat me out of living my life?
I exercise my right to die

[Verse 1]
How can you get away with a murder?
Scot-free when you're found guilty in the first degree
It's pretty simple when you're so powerful
It's who you know
Untouchable, lying through your teeth
Break the doctrine, they're all laughing
Double-parking tax-free control monopoly
So complacent, it's adjacent to the demons you summon from your faculty

[Chorus]
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
You're not above the law, no matter your beliefs
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
You're not above the law, no matter your beliefs

[Post-Chorus]
Supreme ascendancy
Supreme ascendancy

[Verse 2]
Satan in a cassock casting black magic
Childhoods tragically ripped from their shaking feet
Conscious yet inadequate
The bullshit catalyst
Far flung inaction by the ministry of presbytery

[Chorus]
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
You're not above the law, no matter your beliefs
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
You're not above the law, no matter your beliefs
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
You're not above the law, no matter your beliefs
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
Holy hands of God
Justice impedes

[Outro]
Supreme ascendancy
Supreme ascendancy
Supreme ascendancy
Permanent purgatory

[Part I: Stu Mackenzie]

[Chorus]
Split you and me, static electricity
Static electricity
Split you and me, static electricity

[Verse 1]
Singularity at the point of contacting
Lightning strikes deep inside digital cells in my mind
Torn apart like a baguette
Rip the husk from the brown rice
Lacerate the pig flesh and shape the machine out of clay
Blow the brain up in your hand and replace the ashes with static

[Chorus]
Split you and me, static electricity
Static electricity
Split you and me, static electricity

[Verse 2]
Strangers divergent
They were once one, now they're two
Species come late to the fold
Ships in the night sail home
Cannonball falls from the sky
Sever the deck with a mind
Made of metal in plain sight
Invisible ball of death
Run by a rogue mutant brain
In a bubble of golden static

[Chorus]
Split you and me, static electricity

[Part II: Ambrose Kenny-Smith]

Split you and me, static electricity
Split you and me, static electricity

Split you and me, splitting bodies, static electricity
Split you and me, splitting bodies, static electricity

Split you and me (Split you and me)
Static electricity
Split you and me (Split you and me)
Static electricity

Split you and me, static electricity
Split you and me, static electricity

Split you and me
Split you and me
Split you and me
Split you and me
Split you and me
Static electricity
Split you and me, static electricity
Split you and me, static electricity
Split you and me, splitting bodies, static electricity
Split you and me, splitting bodies, static electricity

[Refrain]
All the highways like terminal airways
All the highways like sapien DNA

[Verse 1]
We can build a road
We can cut a tree
We can shoot a bird
Nobody will see

[Refrain]
All the highways like terminal airways
All the highways like sapien DNA

[Chorus]
Never ever wanna be on the other side of karma for digging underworld
Never wanna get up, never wanna get out of bed when I live in this world
Woo!

Woo!

[Verse 2]
We can kill the worms
Underneath the trees
We can tunnel in
Nobody will see

[Refrain]
All the highways like terminal airways
All the highways like sapien DNA

[Chorus]
Never ever wanna be on the other side of karma for digging underworld
Never wanna get up, never wanna get out of bed when I live in this world

[Verse 1]
Take no position on good or bad
Much watched is the doing, so fuck the tarot's read
The life I lead, it has a taste
Like milk drank from the teat, curdles at a certain age

[Chorus 1]
Get with ataraxia
Force it into being
Suck face
Ataraxia
Lower the ceiling
What if I amount to
Nothing at all?
Inside, it hits me up
I care too much about what I think

[Verse 2]
Shame the mirrors that stretch my hips
Mute the hypochondria that whispers spoilers in my ear
I'm not a father yet so don't ask again
Salt the snail and teach it to obtain

[Chorus 2]
Lay in
Ataraxia
Set the kindling
Weigh in
Ataraxia
Absolve me of my skin
Shamе him, name him
Cut me down to size
Insidе, it hits me up
I care too much about what I think

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 1]
Get with ataraxia
Force it into being
Suck face
Ataraxia
Lower the ceiling
What if I amount to
Nothing at all?
Inside, it hits me up
I care too much about what I think
Ataraxia
Ataraxia

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
How can anybody see me when I am invisible and
How can anybody be the friend of someone impossible?
How can everything in my sight be so far into the distance?
How can every day I survive turn so easily to night?

[Refrain]
How can anybody see me?
I'm invisible
How can anybody see me?
I'm a shadow here forevermore

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
How can anybody see me when I am a hidden person?
How on earth can someone like me be intangible to others?
How do all the people do the things that pеople do around me?
How can anybody move whеn our planet is suffocating?

[Refrain]
How can anybody see me?
I'm invisible (See me)
How can anybody see me?
I'm a shadow here forevermore (See me)

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
How can anybody see me?
I'm invisible (See me)
How can anybody see me?
I'm a shadow here forevermore (See me)

[Instrumental Break]
See me, see me, see me, see me
See me

[Intro]
Watch out!

[Verse 1]
I see you on the street, and you walk on by
You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance
You'd see my desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way

[Pre-Chorus]
I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want
Don't try to resist me

[Chorus]
Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

[Verse 2]
I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad, boy, I wonder why
I follow you around, but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to run, I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying
You've got to

[Chorus]
Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

[Post-Chorus]
Open your heart with the key
One is such a lonely number

[Bridge]
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to run, I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying
You've got to

[Chorus]
Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

[Post-Chorus]
Open your heart with the key

[Outro]
Open your heart, I'll make you love me  (Come on, baby)
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key (I'm gonna get to you)
Open your heart, I'll make you love me (Ow, come on, baby)
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key
(Watch out, watch out, watch out)
Open your heart, I'll make you love me

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
Jabari, mi paddy

[Verse: Dom McLennon]
Only talkin' numbers like it's binary code
I need all the ones and zeros like we piloting drones
I move like Neo through the Matrix, you won't find me alone
'Cause I'm a dog and you might find out if you reach for my bone
How you unique if everyone around you's next to a clone?
How you gon' gentrify the trap until it's passing your home?
These gowns and caps ain't got 

[?] to match with the tone
I take a trip but never slip, you can keep your chaperones
I might, I might train in my city, if you from there, you know
I bring the color to a planet livin' in monochrome
I crack the wall then fill it up like it came from Al Capone
If you need paper, I need favors, we could trade for a loan
'Cause me and Bari set our base now, LeBron with the chase style
Give me what I need and I won't have to catch a case now
And your sleeves, you think you got it next 'cause you ain't got the 

[?] to see
If you can't win without it, you a gimmick and disgrace
Nigga, I don't got no damn opponents (Woo), I came from the coldest
Where the bullets freeze 'em buildings and the police never notice
I'm a trooper, stayin' posted, they don't got ties to the state
But they got ties to the family and we got money to make
Let's go

[Intro]
There's so many stories I could tell you, I wish I could
Have more time to tell you things like—
The things I could tell you
Oh, you don't know the half of it

[Verse]
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
And the workers have struck for fame
For Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog and clowns

[Pre-Chorus]
But the film is a saddening bore
For I've lived it ten times or more
It's about to be lived again
As I ask you to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh, man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man, wonder if he'll ever know
It's the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

[Interlude]
Thank you, Michael
And welcome to Storytellers
Well, I'd like to bring on, uh
The rest of the artists who will be working with us tonight
In ab— In about 1968
My then publisher, um, asked me if I would do, uh
An English lyric for a French song that he was managing at the time
It's called, um, "Comme d'habitude"
Sorry, "Comme d'habitude"
And I said I'd have a— a crack at it
And I turned in
The pitifully awful titled "Even A Fool Learns To Love"
Which he rejected out of hand quite rightly, I feel
And it passed on to Paul Anka who did his own English lyric
And he called it, simply and effectively, "My Way"
Uh, so, in retaliation, haha, yeah, right
In retaliation, I wrote "Life On Mars"
But then I got my comeuppance
When miss Barbara Streisand decided to cover Mars
Going through one of her slightly more lost periods
She had her then-husband come hairdresser
Produce and arrange and probably blow-dry it
Anyway

[Intro]
Once a Packer, always a Packer

Green and yellow, that forever, we on go nonstop
Freezin' weather, get the shovel, play in the snow, hot spot

Legendary, just like Aaron, MVP, run up the score
Give the ball to Aaron Jones, let him run it down their throat
Touchdown, glasses on, Lambeau Leap in the front row
I'm screamin', "9-2" and that's for life
That's for Reverend Reggie White, rest in paradise
Coach Carter, boy, I'm feelin' like Matt tonight

Yeah, boy, we 'bout to be in Tampa, hype
And whoever play the Packers, hope you packin' light

[Intro]
Got me 100, got me 100
Got me 100, got me 100
Woo-ooh

[Verse 1]
Told myself I could walk away
Golden touch, got a hold of me (A hold of me)
You're like morphine inside my veins
Got me hooked, got me hooked on this chemistry

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In my head, I'm not conflicted
I'm 100% addicted

[Chorus]
Your love, your love
Your love, your love is takin' me
High, high
Your love, your love
Your love, your love is takin' me
High, high
Never put me down when you pick me up
You're my diamond ring, you're the one I love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love is takin' me
High, high

[Verse 2]
Took a trip, just a holiday
Poppin' E's, drinking pink champagne
Purple pills fade my memory
But you'll always belong to me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Got me tied up, got me twisted
I'm 100% addicted

[Chorus]
Your love, your love
Your love, your love is takin' me
High, high
Your love, your love
Your love, your love is takin' me
High, high

I'm way up in the clouds
And I'm not comin' down
Your love, your love
Your love, your love is takin' me
Never put me down when you pick me up
You're my diamond ring, you're the one I love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love is takin' me
High, high

[Outro]
Got me 100, got me 100
Woo-ooh
Got me 100, got me 100

[Verse 1]
You laughed at me, you made me cry
You made a joke, then wonder why
I was the loser, I was the loser
I say hello, you say good-bye
I reach to you, you don't even try
I was the loser, I was the loser

[Refrain]
If losin' you makes me happy
Then why does it makes me cry
Losin' you makes you a winner
Then how did our love ever die?

[Verse 2]
I'm born to lose, you know it's true

[Chorus: Mabvuto Carpenter]
Sam was born by the river
Martin, he had a dream
But that don't mean there will be harmony
Just because the choir sings
They say that change gon' come
So when is change gon' come?
Somebody tell me, somebody tell me

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
They throw the rock, hide they hand and wait for you to trip
Then show the worst on the news, "Look y'all, he was a Crip"
Now what am I supposed to do when family's on the line?
And how am I to stay calm with that still on my mind?
Bodies droppin' by the dozens
The people sworn to protect is killin' all my cousins
For that, I keep my head on a swivel, Dogg's out the kennel
Don't you want revenge just a little? Shit
What do you tell a mother in pain who lost a child
By the hands of the people she called?
For a situation across the street
When all he did was walk over to keep the peace? Cold game
Now she gotta live with seein' that whole thing
Nobody got charged for the murder - more pain
They wonder why we out here trippin'
The least of your worries should be me and my Crippin', nigga

[Chorus: Mabvuto Carpenter]
Sam was born by the river
Martin, he had a dream
But that don't mean there will be harmony
Just because the choir sings
They say that change gon' come
So when is change gon' come?
Somebody tell me, somebody tell me

[Verse 2: Bad Lucc]
As the world comes crashin' down around you
You're sittin' in that fire like nothin' here can down you
You find ease in pain and some comfort, this life has consumed you
It's dark everywhere you look, my tears amuse you
You've gotta break free from that trap, but trust, I get it
When hopeless start shapin' your focus, life is wicked
I used to be that type of guy who smiled in all the pictures
And then I had my face where I would drown it out in liquor
Told the world that I would be the man, and baby, I will
I tend to talk to the ancestors when I'm prayin' for real
Hopin' for better, while capitalists capitalize
You had a heart of gold once, don't matter the size
They put the pressure on a youngin', youngin' grew up to kill
And put that youngin' in a prison just to ruin his will
See, it's the hard pill to swallow and faith is your throttle
Still find myself prayin' for tomorrow

[Chorus: Mabvuto Carpenter]
Sam was born by the river (River)
And Martin, he had a dream
But that don't mean there will be harmony
Just because the choir sings
They say that change gon' come
(Change gon' come, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So when is change gon' come? (Change gon' come)
Somebody tell me, somebody tell me

[Outro: Mabvuto Carpenter]
Lookin' for a change to come
(When is change gon' come?)
Somebody tell me
Change gon' come, oh, oh, oh yeah
(When is change gon' come?)
When is change gon' come? (Somebody tell me)

Bus' her wide open, bus' her bus' her wide open

Get a dose of the purple potion, three wheel motion, toastin', cup to the sky
They say it's not the size of the boat, but the motion in the ocean, I say bitch you's a lie
When I insert, I'll have you gone
Make you leave your man alone
Having you begging me to take a picture on your camera phone
And it's on, it's out of sight

Crying in the shower, drinking in the afternoon, yeah
Taste is kinda sweet, mixed with my tears
Mixed with my memories
Never needed you, never need anyone, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I tried to hold you like a rose
But you kept killing me, yeah
You kept killing me, yeah

Till the bitter end, till the bitter end, yeah
Sometimes I hate you and sometimes I wish that we could be friends
So I just pretend, yeah, I just pretend
I never felt better

[Bridge]
Promise I can't feel the pain, promise I don't feel the same
No, I don't need you anymore

Promises don’t mean a thing when you see right through my skin
But I keep pushing on and on
Yeah, I keep pushing till you're gone

[Verse 1]
One day I was sitting in class
Got a note saying watch your back
Someone told me who it was from
She wasn't happy because she just got dumped
It was over but not in her mind
It's not my fault he left her behind
I always knew they had a history
I didn't know it included me

[Pre-Chorus]
She wasn't ready to let him go
Now I'm dealing with a psycho

[Chorus]
My boyfriend's ex girlfriend
I think she's going off the deep end
She loves him, she hates me
They broke up now she wants to blame me
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

[Verse 2]
Went to a party on a Saturday night
I wasn't planning to get in a fight
All I wantеd was to have some fun
You know I'd nevеr wanna hurt no one
She walked over thinking she was so tough
She stared me down but she had to look up
Then she started to lose control
What can I say that's rock and roll

[Pre-Chorus]
I wasn't sure but now I know
That I'm dealing with a psycho

[Chorus]
My boyfriend's ex girlfriend
I think she's going off the deep end
She loves him she hates me
They broke up now she wants to blame me

[Bridge]
Wake up girl
'Cause it's over
It's time to get a life
Go cry on your own shoulder
Can't you see that he's mine

[Chorus]
My boyfriend's ex girlfriend
I think she's going off the deep end
She loves him she hates me
They broke up now she wants to blame me

[Outro]

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Travel through my mind am I blind it's a shame
Young niggas gettin' murdered straight took out the game
As I sit here puffin' on a cigarette
Gotta be ready, never know who's plottin' on a niggas death
These are the rough times, best to hurry up
And duck muhfucka' 'fore I buck mine
It's gettin' crazy and everybody's strapped
Surrounded by niggas but nary a motherfucker down to watch my back
These are the bitch made niggas, you been played nigga
While you starvin' and broke they pullin' six figures
Oooh, what can you do
When you can't trust your crеw, time to bust out the twenty-two
Boo-yaow, ran out of weed, so I'm sippin'
On this Hеnnesey, tell me, do you feel me?
Hey, I have no remorse
As I take another sip of my liquor and spit my sick thoughts, oooh

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Thuggin to the fullest, got my strap, I'ma pull it
I'm the first muhfucka' that can outrun a bullet
It's them Thug Life niggas, them done like triggers
Got these punk wannabes and they jockin' like bitches
Now my riches is gettin' hoe-zone, it's on
Fuck a mystery, do you wanna get with me, then let's bone
I'ma take her to my hideout, cause I'm smokin' that spinach
And stayin' strong to the finish and then I ride out
See you on the freeway, sorry baby
But I gotta call my homey see what he say
I ain't got no time, I gotta get mine
I keep my mind on my loot, I'll shoot everytime
And ain't no way I'ma let bitch made nigga worry me
Catch me slippin', empty the clip and bury me
Hell nah nigga have to plug me twice
Ain't no slippin' when you Thug for Life, motherfucker can you see?

Dolla-la-la, ooh, dolla-la-la (Baby)
You 'bout that lifestyle (Lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle)

[Outro: Jason Derulo & Adam Levine]
Oh girl (Oh, oh, oh)
Get your money, honey, oh girl
Got that dollar, dollar for you (Oh, oh, oh)
Ooh, ooh (Oh, oh, oh)
You 'bout that lifestyle (Lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle)

[Verse 1]
Okay, it's Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ
Move white girls like there's coke up my asscrack
Move black girls 'cause, man, fuck it, I'll do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin’ PETA
In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over E's
Hot like a parked car
I sound weird like "nigga" with a hard 'R'
Fly like the logo on my cousin's 440
Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like Toejam
I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin' it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
'Cause I'm a beast, bitch, "grrr", Invader Zim
Gambino is a call girl, fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery
Told me I was awful and that shit did not faze me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
“You're my favorite rapper now”, yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin, kiss my ass, Human Centipede
You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
"Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?”
I don't know, all I know is I'm the best one

[Chorus]
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you mothafuckas talk about
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you mothafuckas talk about

[Verse 2]
You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin'
Fuck that, got goons like an archvillain
I'm from the South, ain't got no accent, don't know why
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di
Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit, "First of all, you talk white
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet"
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that's a mixtape
Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shoutout to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me 'cause your little cousin play me out
I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin' "Ow"
I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin' with a Filipina at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I'm screamin' "What the fuck is up?" like I ain't seen the sky
The shit I'm doin' this year? Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it, Casey Anthony
These rappers don't know what to do
'Cause all I did was act me, like a Looney Tune
And I'll give you all of me until there’s nothing left
I swear this summer will be summer Camp, bitch

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah (ProtegeBeatz)
Uh, gang

[Verse]
I bet that nigga get sprayed
I'm sprayin' out that cut with that chop
Ayy, benihana, whip it right in your zone
I'm still wearin' bust down, big Cartier
Bust down that Cartier, nigga, I trap with that AK
Don't play with the gang, nigga, play where you stay
I'm Zone 1, westside, nigga, that's Money Gang
I don't bust down no fire, like to put that on gang
Swing in the trap, nigga know I've been trappin' off quick bags
Young nigga smokin' on dope, nigga pussy
Nigga slide through my hood, need that chain, gon' be took
Nigga sell me a bird like nobody was lookin'
Flex on that Money Gang, blowin' on ZaZa
Young Drako, all night with the rah-rah
Pop out the cut, nigga pop like Impala
Whippin' up dope, magic, ta-da
Fuck nigga run and get popped like my collar
Young Drako real dripper, I'm rockin' Prada
Whip up that dopе in some new Balenciaga
Top of thе condo, I'm chillin' with

[Intro]
Uh (Eastside), yeah (Yeah, Eastside)
Welcome back, we've been missin' you
This what they been waiting for
Crash course (Rest in peace, uh, Eastside Steevie)

[Verse 1]
My mind like George Lucas, I think like Stanley Kubrick
House full of eucalyptus, that boy straight mucus
So, let's get straight to it, my chain is this humongous
Permanent bling my tooth is, yeah, I'm a strange human
This insane jewelry collection, it'll take a week to shoot it
Record an album with Mercedes, let GQ EQ it
I think I'm Frank Lucas, slang where my boo thing school is
A straight A-student, boy, the brain stupid
Leave it all in the past now, walls talkin' back now
Back to the wall, with your wall to the back
Don't back down, buck up
Tell 'em how the fuck your mama ain't raise no bitch
Gloves on the dashboard, mask on the lat' now
MAC on the lap
On the hip while the red-blue lights in the background
Cops wanna pat down, just pray the clip don't (Click, click)

[Chorus]
Merci beaucoup just like Moulin Rouge
And I know I can, can, and my spirit stand, stands
I say, "Voulez-vous coucher for eternity?"
Let's go meet the sandman, let our spirits dance, dance

[Verse 2]
Uh, on the skyway to Hell, with smiley face jewels
'Cause I'm a boss, I call the shots, you make the calls
'Cause if I take a L, then they gon' take a loss
If I'm on my way to Hell, then I'ma take you all
Girl, I'm not supposed to be here still
Rap careers last three years still
I'm a G here, that's OG times three
Triple OG, still just shows I'ma be here still
At 3-0, got bitches on me and the females still, let 'em be here still
At twenty-six, my nigga OD off of lean, codeine and pills
He'll be here still

[Chorus]
Merci beaucoup just like Moulin Rouge
And I know I can, can, and my spirit stand, stands
I say, "Voulez-vous coucher for eternity?"
Let's go meet the sandman, let our spirits dance, dance

[Interlude]
Rest in peace to Yams, I done lost some friends
Until we meet again, we gon' forever dance (Sleep)
Voulez-vous coucher for eternity?
Let's go meet the sandman, let our spirits dance, dance

[Bridge]
Uh, yeah, yeah (I'm just)
Uh, yeah, yeah (I'm just)
Uh, yeah, yeah (I'm just)
Uh, yeah, yeah (I'm just)

[Chorus]
Merci beaucoup just like Moulin Rouge
And I know I can, can, and my spirit stand, stands
I say, "Voulez-vous coucher for eternity?"
Let's go meet the sandman, let our spirits dance, dance

[Intro]
Those candles that you bought me for Christmas
I can’t burn them ‘cause they smell like you
And every time I walk into a Starbucks
I see you at every table
It’s been a while since I’ve had cold brew

[Verse]
Don’t you know how hard it is
To find a decent guy in the city of 4,000
Where everybody looks like you
Don’t even get me started on the way
You saw this song online and called told
Me you didn’t but you did and I have proof that

[Chorus]
You ruined the 1975 now I listen and think about getting high
In the bedroom windows open
Mom is home but we’re still smoking
You ruined the 1975 and now I listen and cry
‘cause you sang “we share friends in Soho,”
While you told me that none of your friends know
And I hated you for that, but it’s been two years now
And I really just hate you
For making me hate my favorite band

[Bridge]
You broke my heart and went away to college
You were only fifteen minutes down the road
And I always thought you’d show up to say sorry
But as time went on I started to lose hope

[Verse]
Don’t you know how hard it is to find a decent guy
When you never gave me closure
What the hell was I to do
Don’t even get me started on the way you saw this song online
I guess it must’ve thrown you
‘cause you called and said you knew that

[Chorus]
You ruined the 1975 and now I listen and cry
‘cause you sang “we share friends in Soho,”
While you told me that none of your friends know
And I hated you for that, but it’s been two years now
And I really just hate you
For making me hate my favorite band

[Intro]
Hey, hey

[Verse 1]
After a few drinks
I started to thinking 'bout what we had
It gets complicated in my head, in my bed, am I mad?
Yeah
And at the parties, nobody seems to care
It's like I'm not there
And I just want you to know

[Chorus]
One, two
That I still think about it
I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it
Try to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do

[Post-Chorus]
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you

[Verse 2]
When I left ya, I left hidden treasure
'Cause now no one can measure, it's pressure
And I don't know what to do
Do I comeback with the pride that I have left?
'Cause I know you were the best
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
One, two
That I still think about it
I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it
Try to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do

[Post-Chorus]
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you

[Bridge]
Now I've come undone
And if I could turn back time I'd choose you
I wish you were mine, I didn't know then but now I do

[Chorus]
That I still think about it
I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it
Try to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do

[Post-Chorus]
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you

[Intro]
I'll be your fembot
I'll be your fembot
I'll be your-

[Verse 1]
Go fuck your prototype
I'm an upgrade of the stereotype
Don't come with a guarantee
I'll use you up like you're my battery

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the sparks between us, electric shock
Hardwired, if you mess it up
I'll self destruct

[Chorus]
The way you look at me I short circuit
You make me lose control, it's automatic
Just push my buttons, see how I work it
I get what I want, like it or not
I'll be your fembot
I'll be your fembot
I'll be your fembot
I get what I want, like it or not

[Verse 2]
I got you hypnotized
I'll read your thoughts when you look in my eyes
You're only human, boy
And I am programmed to search and destroy

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the sparks between us, electric shock
Hardwired, if you mess it up
I'll self destruct

[Chorus]
The way you look at me I short circuit
You make me lose control, it's automatic
Just push my buttons, see how I work it
I get what I want, like it or not
I'll be your fembot
I'll be your fembot
I'll be your fembot
I get what I want, like it or not
Well, I opened the door
And I stood there waiting for hours and hours
Slowly losing my powers
So I stop, take a whiff of the flowers
And I’m back on the top of this tower
Dropping dimes on the head of the cowards
Making beds for the stragglers, sheds for the braggers
Wasting time on that shit that don't matter

First, I pause
Then, I pray
Now, I wait
Now, now

I am flying from this high
So clearly out my mind
Insanity's in style
I'll stay here for a while
I am flying from this high
So clearly out my mind
Now I'm slamming it shut
I was strolling, now I strut, faster and faster
Save my stones for the glass door
'Cause you know that I live behind plaster
You're the student and I am the master, blaster, faster, faster, faster, faster – Stop
I was bleeding, now I clot
I was tangled, now I'm knot

First, I pause
Then, I pray
Now, I wait
Now, now

I am flying from this high
So clearly out my mind
Insanity's in style
I'll stay here for a while
I am flying from this high
So clearly out my mind
He moves across the room like he’s dancing on a cloud
He slowly pulls his hair back just to make room for his crown
He leaves a trail of sanctity most everywhere he goes
He never says a word because he trusts in what he knows

He smiles with his childish eyes and stares from up above
He graces me with gentle touch and rough and tumble love
He hardly waits for no one but the crowd still trails behind
So finally I catch up and he's messing with my mind

Gotta take my time
With a baby like mine
So sublime
With a baby like mine
Take my time
With a baby like mine
Lost my mind
'Cause I'm working with a baby like mine

He throws his cares into the wind and lets them fly away
He carries something golden so his wealth is here to stay
He’s lifted ten feet off the ground and floats above our heads
He’s gifted cause he knows that he’s as good as what he says
I’ve waited oh so patiently to have him in my hands
I’ve given him my world, my word, and all my future plans
I’ve hoped one day he’d come around to see just what I got
So finally I catch up and he’s giving me a shot

All because I take my time
With a baby like mine
So sublime
With a baby like mine
Take my time
With a baby like mine
Lost my mind
'Cause I'm working with a baby like mine

Gotta take my time
With a baby like mine
(My time, like mine, like mine)
So sublime
With a baby like mine
(My time, like mine, like mine)
Take my time
With a baby like mine
(My time, like mine, like mine)
Lost my mind
'Cause I'm working with a baby like mine
Take my time
With a baby like mine
Take my time
With a baby like mine
Take my time
With a baby like mine
With a baby like mine

[Intro]
(Ha, ha, that's enough, that's enough, that's enough!)
Fifty grand I get this all in one take, ayy
(Turn it up!)

[Verse 1]
Now, all you high-fiving MAGA white boys drinking White Claws
Care about your taxes more than human rights, sign off
You no mask-wearing, big truck-driving
"Blue lives matter," talking shit about the riots
Double standard once the white folks went and tried it
"They're patriots," no, those are terrorists, Brian
And all you liberals out there being silent
While Black people dying at the hands of police violence
That care more about animal rights and recycling
And bicycling and the climate and toothpaste with iron
You, too, are complicit, you, too, getting brought up
I'll give it to you pro bono, you, too, are the problem
I'm white there with ya, silence on all us
Comfy in my privilege like, "Should I risk all this?"
Yes, and if you think I care to lose you as a fan
Peace out, bitch, you know exactly where I stand

[Chorus]
Trump's over, he lost (He lost)
Social media kicked him off, he gone (He gone)
Throw a party on the White House lawn, retire the liar
Impeach that orange ho, so long (You're fired)
Trump's over, he lost (He lost)
Social media kicked him off, he gone (Yeah)
Throw a party on the White House lawn, retire the liar
Impeach that orange ho, so long

[Verse 2]
It's like Trump is just a symptom that we ain't free from
Just old white supremacy that he would feed us
We celebrating, but to think a new era's begun
Still half the country feels the same way that he does, so
What the fuck are we gonna do now?
Biden my dog, but he's close to getting put down
Surprise, another old white guy in the House
Who's fine, we just hold our breath when he opens his mouth
We thought 2021 was gonna save us
We thought that we were gonna all love our neighbors
We thought COVID was over being contagious
Nope, America still armed, dumb, and dangerous

[Chorus]
Trump's over, he lost (He lost)
Social media kicked him off, he gone (He gone)
Throw a party on the White House lawn, retire the liar
Impeach that orange ho, so long (You're fired)
Trump's over, he lost (He lost)
Social media kicked him off, he gone (Yeah)
Throw a party on the White House lawn, retire the liar
Impeach that orange ho, so long (You're fired)

[Outro]
Dad, wait one second
Look, I want you to say the rest of the part and then I say
"Donald Trump is gone!
Donald Trump's gone, sick-a-nin-nin town?
Got that voice, now sick-a-nin-nin lime?"

[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
Call me Dracula ‘cause all I do is count chips
Young Money Minnie, I ain't talking 'bout the mouse, trick
These girls running like I just threw the bouquet
They know I'm headed to the top like a toupee
Now all these bums is wondering where I be's at
You ain't a Barbie, it's none of ya freaking bees wax
These little rappers I can see them in my dash cam
I know they're grouchy like Oscar by the trash can
I'm on stage, you can sit in the crowd
I be up in lear jets, take a left at the cloud (Haha)
I think she need the heimlich, she's the chokin' kind
She gets no burn, no smoking sign (Yeah!)
Metaphor heaven, so they approve Nicki like my credit score’s seven
Mac and cheese, six, fried chicken da guts
And I'm killing these bitches, Mike Vickin' it up, Chyeah!

[Intro: T-Streets]

They call me Young Gudda, I'm all about the dough still
And anybody in my way: roadkill
Everything my hands touch turn to gold
Money, knots, and jewels with no records sold, yeah
I'm manhandlin' rappers with no effort
So imagine what'll happen when I start applyin' pressure
Guillotine flow, who ready to get severed, nigga?
In or out the booth, you could get leveled, nigga

[Transition: T-Streets]

Millz!

[Transition: T-Streets]

My lil' G, Lil' Chuckee

[Verse 4: Lil Chuckee]
Young Money lil' G, battle juice in my blood
Jumpin' at the boy, man, you better have your bungee cord
Since Wayne took me off the leash, I ain't lose a fight yet
Now, come drag your dog out the ring, how you love that?
Young with an attitude, watch how you talk to me
Keep playin' Freddy, boy, I'll leak on your Elm Street
Trouble is what you want, dog, pain is what you don't get
It's Young Money to the bone gristle, you dig?

[Transition: T-Streets]
Now we got the hottest nigga on the internet
Lil' Twist Hefner, what it do?

[Verse 5: Lil Twist]
Ugh! Young Money, good night
And yeah, I'm gon' shine like a ultraviolet light
Lil' Twist gonna sell out like it's opening tonight
Going for the fist nigga to write
You need a telescope sight to try to see me, I'm so far gone
Even though I'm going off, kids, I'm so far on
I got a house full of chicks like the Playboy home
Wrappin' up my lifestyle and I smashed this song, Twizzy

[Transition: T-Streets]
Yeah, next up, we got the best rapstress alive, Nicki Minaj

[Verse 6: Nicki Minaj]
I'm in that cotton-pickin' Bent, put massa on the guts
White on white whips, Kunta Kinte on the clutch
You at the bottom of the pole—totem
Like Lamar Odom, I ball—scrotum
Flyer than a cricket so they call me "Nicki Jiminy"
And it's going down like Santa in the chim-i-ney
You don't ball, break your baby-back ribs
You need more assist than the handicapped kids
Oh, shit

[Transition: T-Streets]
And now, the beautiful Miss Shanell

[Verse 7: Shanell]
Young Money, we’re rockstars

We hit them and we see them comin' back for more
Back for more

[Transition: T-Streets]
Next up, my nigga Mack Maine
Stupid Mack-nupid, one hundred

[Verse 8: Mack Maine]
Microwave family in the building, you can't hold us
Me, Tez, and Wayne, we the three new moguls
Buffet around here, y'all boys scrape the plates
And we don't eat up in our whips, but they got paper plates
Soon as we leave the club, damn, where the models go
One word I forgot to say on his album: "Hollygrove!"
This track is the finale, nah, this the genesis
Young Money murderers, we killin' shit, forever

[Transition: T-Streets]
Toronto
Drizzy
Get ‘em

[Verse 9: Drake]
Alright, I got this, you can never get this
I built it up from nothing, you would think I'm playin' Tetris
Thousand-dollar sweater on, but I don’t never sweat shit
Swear the beats they give me got a motherfuckin’ death wish
Yeah, tell me, who controls kings?
I don't follow rules, stupid old things
I'm flyin' through the city in a coupe with those wings
And my team deserves some motherfuckin' Super Bowl rings
Young Money

[Transition: Crowd]
Wee-zy! Wee-zy! Wee-zy! Wee-zy!

[Verse 10: Lil Wayne]
I'm so in this bitch, CEO in this bitch
Lil Weezy stand tall, tippy-toe in this bitch
Blood Gang, motherfucker, da-da-doe in this bitch
Make your girl get Barry Mani-low in this bitch
In the body of the world, money is the blood
And every day, I be back and forward to the blood bank
Ugh, makin' deposits 'til I fucking faint
New Orleans, nigga: How 'bout them fucking Saints?
It's tight on our end, call that "Bubba Franks"
Matter-fact, it's too tight—add a couple links
I'm the bar’s tender, you a woman drink
Yeah, it's Young Money, but the money ain't
Gudda tough, 'Nelly nice, Nick' nasty
Streets bad, Tyga ill, Drake magic
Millz Harlem, Chuck wild, Twist Dallas
And Mack Maine rap, sing and manage, ugh!

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
It's Young Mula, baby!
Lyrics from Snippet

[Yak Gotti]
We all sin (All sin)
We all sin (All sin)
We all sin (Yeah)
I can't judge you 'cause we all sin
All sin

[Pre-Chorus: Bobby V]
I wanna do you at yo momma house, on the couch
Do you in the bathroom of the airplane
Do you on a balcony, in the taxi
Cause I can’t get enough of that thing

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
(Yo, yo)
Let's do up in Disney at the Magic Kingdom
You can tug on my Giuseppes and my Bagley Mischkas
I'm a ba ba ba, I'm a bag of fun
I'm a pro with them balls like And 1
Now lets go, Mexico that's where we next to go
Do him like his momma, make him eat his vegetables
Could call me a stage mom, boy you best to blow
Or you could even call me Wanda cause I'm "ret ta go"
You know I'm spoiled little daddy, stomps the floor
We could do it on Fifth Ave in the Department store
We could do it in Tokyo, we do it in Taiwan
All my Harajuku girls say I am they icon

[Pre-Chorus: Bobby V]
I wanna do you at yo momma house, on the couch
Do you in the bathroom of the airplane
Do you on a balcony, in the taxi
Cause I can’t get enough of that thing, girl

[Chorus: Bobby V]
Say we could do it anywhere (Crazy places)
I wanna freak you anywhere (Crazy)
We could do it anywhere (Crazy places)
I wanna freak you anywhere (Crazy)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Don't compare me to your ex-man, baby, he a local Joker
I'll take you to Six Flags and drill you on the roller coaster
Call your girlfriends over, we can have a sleepover
Buy your ass a Jeep so I can fuck you in your Range Rover
Pictures in the nude, on the cruise, we gonna make the news
Sex great, sex tape, ready for a YouTube
Damn, it turn me on, we do it in your momma home
Father long gone, but Gucci be your daddy, baby
I can fly you anywhere, we can sex in crazy places
Airports, train stations, going up the escalator
At the Dome, on the 50, I'mma throw it, you da center
When you hike it, I'mma spike it
Girl, don't act like you don't like it

[Pre-Chorus: Bobby V]
I wanna do you at yo momma house, on the couch
Do you in the bathroom of the airplane
Do you on a balcony, in the taxi
Cause I can’t get enough of that thing, girl

[Chorus: Bobby V]
Say we could do it anywhere (Crazy places)
I wanna freak you anywhere (Crazy)
We could do it anywhere (Crazy places)
I wanna freak you anywhere (Crazy)

[Verse 3: Trina]
How bad you wanna do me on a scale of one to ten?
You like the way I bend, now you asking where I've been
If I'm doing him, now you starting that again?
I don't wanna sex your friend, he don't got enough to lend
Plus he was doing Lynn and she ain't nothing like amazing
Her stuff run deep and he don't have a occupation
I'm known across the nation, Trina's that chick
Bow-legs, red bone, long hair, real thick
Do me at my mama house? Nah, I don't think so
I got too much class, but you can try San Pedro
I need the biggest mansion, ocean backyard
With the newest Maybach and inside a black card

[Bridge: Bobby V]
Tonight, I'll touch you in ya favorite spot (oh yeah)
Promise to get ya body so hot (we could do it anywhere)
So baby, don't be scared, if they see us baby I don't care
We could do it in the Gucci store
Close down the mall girl you just don't know
In front of the police, in front of yo daddy, girl it's you and me
And I don't give a damn that's why they call me Bobby V

[Pre-Chorus: Bobby V]
I wanna do you at yo momma house, on the couch
Do you in the bathroom on the airplane
Do you on a balcony, in the taxi
Cause I can’t get enough of that thing, girl

[Chorus: Bobby V]
Say we could do it anywhere (Crazy places)
I wanna freak you anywhere (Crazy)
We could do it anywhere (Crazy places)
I wanna freak you anywhere (Crazy)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Full of vanilla, flyin' over chocolate mountains
I stare at the Pacific while I'm smokin' on a kilometer
The feds, they hot on us, one hundred on the thermometer
They raided my private plane, I went got one that's more privater
R.I.P. Juice WRLD, wrote that on two cups
Cuz pour out a lil' juice for him, shit gave me goosebumps
Nigga been through too much, lookin' in the rearview to see the future

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And that just don't sit right
Living like I can't die, Bumbu in me
FBI arrest me, why?
They can't nail me so thеy just screw with me
I just try, try to hide
Somеtimes it's hard to find time to be the good guy and still be someone
Enjoyin' my good times more than sometimes, and I just hope

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I don't get time 'cause I ain't got time
I was high as fuck yesterday, damn, time flies
Where am I?
I admit I can't live when I think too much, too much on my mind
I don't get high, I got high
I was high as fuck yesterday, damn, time flies
Where am I?
I admit I can't live when I think too much, too much

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
But sometimes I'm at home and I gotta focus (Gotta focus)
I told bae, "Someday, I could be gone, and you might have to post up"
Fuck what I'm talkin' 'bout, I run my mouth too much
Got too much on my mind, think about too much
Said, "It's our time to shine," then the clouds blew up
She said, "You better lock me down 'fore they lock you up"

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And that just don't sit right
Living like I can't die, codeine in me
Just look through my girl contacts
I don't know what she see in me
I just try, try to hide
Sometimes it's hard to find time to be the good guy and still be someone
Enjoyin' my good times more than sometimes, but I just hope

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I don't get time 'cause I ain't got time
I was high as fuck yesterday, damn, time flies
Where am I?
I admit I can't live when I think too much, too much on my mind
I don't get high, I got high
I was high as fuck yesterday, damn, time flies
Where am I?
I admit I can't live when I think too much, too much

[Verse 3: Fousheé]
Oh, yeah
Can't get a plane off the ground, I feel, sometimes
But even the weights get to bask in the sunlight
Are you really listenin'? We're waitin' for the punchline
Is anyone listenin'? I'm waitin' for the punchline
But I just don't have the time
Watch the flash, don't blink your eye
But my head hurts, ooh, don't lie
But I'm think I'm livin' right
But some shit just don't sit right
Shit just don't right
But some shit just don't sit right
It just don't sit right

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And that just don't sit right
Living like I can't die, codeine in me
Just look through my girl contacts
I don't know what she see in me
I just try, try to hide
Sometimes it's hard to find time to be the good guy and still be someone
Enjoyin' my good times more than sometimes, but I just hope
This is my story
Yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts
This is my story
Money, cars, bad hoes
This is my story
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it

And I'm sticking to it

It's my story, I'm sticking to it
Drama, man, I've been through it
I'm turned on by this shit
Life's a bitch and I'ma put my dick into it

They wrote me off, counted me out
Now I make so much they can't count it out
Got your bitch so wet, I'm drowning out
New spilt milk, I'm making cream
The worlds a court, I own the team
And I cross these haters over, made them pull a hamstring
Yeah, I do big things, write big checks, good weed, great sex
Black panties is on deck
Constipated, it ain't out yet

Twenty years
What's that, like five careers?
I'm just a happy headed nigga from the Chi
I ain't even supposed to be here

This is my story
Yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts
This is my story
Money, cars, bad hoes

And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
Came from humble beginnings
Now I'm cocky with my spending
They say "life is just a game"
And I thank God that I'm winning
Models roll my indo
I beat the pussy, Django
Them niggas talking money, I got more digits in my gate code
She make a pole disappear like hocus pocus
You're ain't never gonna find another nigga this focused
I got every block, every street corners sold up
Whatever club represent my city, throw it up
I own the game, coach last player shown up
Okay, haters throw fitted, never showed up, yeah

This is my story
Yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts
This is my story
Money, cars, bad hoes
This is my story

And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
Pull up to the club at about three
I'm killing it, guilty no plea
I'm leaving out at 6 with a dime piece
By 9 o'clock we on round three
I speak of rain, they say I'm crazy like they didn't know
See, I'm not crazy but my talent, man, got bipolar
Say she's a church girl but man she's blowing holy smokes
Showed her the Jesus piece, now she got the Holy Ghost
They asked them in a interview, "why do he love these girls?"
The only thing he had to say was, "mother fuck the world"

This is my story
Yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts
This is my story
Money, cars, bad hoes
This is my story
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it
And I'm sticking to it

[Verse 1]
It was 7:45 we were all in line
To greet the teacher Miss Cathleen
First was Kevin, then came Lucy, third in line was me
All of us were ordinary compared to Cynthia Rose
She always stood at the back of the line
A smile beneath her nose
Her favourite number was 20 and every single day
If you asked her what she had for breakfast
This is what she'd say

[Chorus]
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If you sеt your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

[Interlude]
Oh-oh-oh
And I singing
Oh-oh-oh
All togеther now
Oh-oh-oh
And I singing
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Cynthia wore the prettiest dress
With different colour socks
Sometimes I wondered if the mates were in her lunch box
Me and Lucy opened it up when Cynthia wasn't around
Lucy cried, I almost died, you know what we found?

[Chorus]
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If you set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh
And I singing
Oh-oh-oh
All together now
Oh-oh-oh
And I singing
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse:]
Hey Hold up let me take this sip
Right here it's for Ice, (Sip)
Ahhh, Ice it's off the hook dog
Just let me know

[Intro]
Yo Pi’erre, you wanna come out here?

[Verse]
Call my mans
Not tough, no way you softer than Charmin
Late night she eat dick like hard ham
1500 for this FN, it won’t jam (Whew, whew, whew)
Die hard, no cap, Bruce Willis fan
All white plush couch, cost me 6 bands
Niggas gone give me credit, I don’t understand
Bitch said she can’t stand me, I told her sit
Might psyche out and rent the whole top floor out the Ritz
Quick to cut a bitch off if she start talkin’ kids
She ain’t gotta tell me, already know I’m lit
Young nigga lifestyle, vibin’ with that stick
Nigga mad at his hoe for askin’ for a pic
Ball down lil’ bro, ‘fore I send em to the clique
Lil’ bro off Vicodin like he Stefon Diggs (Aye)

[Chorus]
Mush mouth off a X, shawty lost for words
Still strapped with that thang, comin’ from the burbs
Real G’s fuck wit me from all different turfs (Mhm, Whoo)
Hidin’ in this lil’ coupe, she gon’ make me swerve
Find me a lil’ boo, tell her not to work
Bet she gon’ drip off of two percs

[Outro]
Mush mouth off a X, shawty lost for words
Still strapped with that thang, comin’ from the burbs
Real G’s fuck wit me from all different turfs (Mhm, Whoo)
Hidin’ in this lil’ coupe, she gon’ make me swerve
Find me a lil’ boo, tell her not to work

[Intro]

Ohh, ohh, oh! (Oh!)
Talkin’ ‘bout a brighter day now

[Verse 1]

4 those of U, on the way out—
U might not have a place 2 go
But that ain't what it's all about

Keeps yo life 2gether—

[Hook]

But it be's like that, sometime— (sometime)
Be like that sometime—y'all

All they want, is what they know
U just wanna have fun—

4 those of U, on U’re way down
Be’s-like-that, sometime— (sometime)

Hey, heyy, heyyy!

‘Cause on U’re way down, U can laugh now
‘Cause U did it yo way

[Hook]

Be’s like that, sometime, y’all

Be like that—sometime!
Be like that—sometime!

[Verse 1]
I told, I told, I told myself again
And now I'm going back on what I said
Trying not to cry but you're so far away
So far away
Won't listen to the devil in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Regretting all the things I never, never said, never said

[Chorus]
Our love was made to rule the world
I came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
I took advantage of your worth
Our love was made to rule the world

[Post-Chorus]
Forget forever
Forget forever, yeah yeah yeah
Forget forever
Forget forever, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I know, I know, I know I can't pretend
That you'll be waking up here in my bed
Baby, your illusion just won't go away
Don't go away

[Chorus]
Our love was made to rule the world
I came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
I took advantage of your worth
Our love was made to rule the world

[Post-Chorus]
Forget forever
Forget forever, yeah yeah yeah

Forget forever, yeah yeah yeah

[Outro]
Forget forever, mmm
Forget forever

[Verse 1]
I wish you looked at me the way you look at Mary Jane
The way you let her kiss you and the way you say her name
You like to call me crazy like I don’t know that I’m insane
But you used to look at me the way you look at Mary Jane

[Verse 2]
I wish you looked at me the way you look at Mary Jane
Knowing that you’re losing me, I wonder what you gain
My heart was in your hands, but now you got hold of my brain
I wish you looked at me the way you look at

[Chorus 1]
Oh, I wanna be that one, I wanna be that song
The one that you can play on repeat all night long
And, oh, we used to have that something
But we know that something’s gone
We know that something’s gone

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na, na na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na na

[Bridge]
Oh, having to pretend is getting exhausting
Acting like I'm livin' when you know I'm dead
And oh, was it something that I said?
Or something that I did?
To make you choose her instead

[Verse 3]
You used to look at me the way you look at Mary Jane
Knowing that you’re losing me, I wonder what you gain
You like to call me crazy like I don’t know that I’m insane
But you used to look at me, ahh ahh, the way you look at

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I used to turn you on, I used to be that song
The one that you would play on repeat all night long
And oh, we used to have that something
But we know that something’s gone
We know that something’s gone

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na
Na, na na na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na na

[Verse 1]
I’m a broken dream on the TV screen
Put me in my place ‘cause I’m feeling kinda crazy
(Oh-oh-whoa)
Gonna dance away the pain till it’s out my veins
I’m an overload, can’t you see you need to save me?
(Oh-oh-whoa)

[Pre-Chorus]
Have you got a secret? I just wanna keep it
Kiss me in the starlight, take me home
(You know I really need to feel the love)
Kinda feel addicted, now I really need this
Don’t leave me all alone
(You know I’m never gonna get enough)

[Chorus]
Can you heal my heart?
Can you put me back together?
Can you heal my heart?
If you can, I’ll be yours forever
Can you push restart?
Can you change how I remember?
Darker days and sleepless nights
We’re worlds apart, you heal my heart

[Verse 2]
Guilty wild heart, now it’s torn apart
Yeah, you made me cry ‘cause you never came around
(Oh-oh-whoa)
Gotta run away through the big blue sky
Got my bright white wings, I’ma see you in the clouds
(Oh-oh-whoa)

[Pre-Chorus]
Sorry ‘bout your secret, I just couldn’t keep it
Kiss me in the starlight, take me home
(I think I’m gonna end up on my own)

[Chorus]
Can you heal my heart?
Can you put me back together?
Can you heal my heart?
If you can, I’ll be yours forever
Can you push restart?
Can you change how I remember?
Darker days and sleepless nights
We’re worlds apart, you heal my heart

[Bridge]
Think I’ve got a problem, gonna take some action
Gotta move faster, you’re too slow
Think I’ve got a problem, gonna take some action
Gotta move faster, just let go

[Repeated]
(Oh-oh-whoa...)

[Chorus]
Can you heal my heart?
Can you put me back together?
Can you heal my heart?
If you can, I’ll be yours forever
Can you push restart?
Can you change how I remember?
Darker days and sleepless nights
We’re worlds apart, you heal my heart

[Intro: Young Thug]
Every night, I wake up
I hear sirens outside my window (I'm proud of you)
Ayy (Oh)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Waking up in the middle of the night
Bunch of babies cryin' and mad niggas fightin' and screamin'
Then I heard a couple more shots like, "Fah, fah"
Then I heard the cops (I'm proud of you)
They rushin' down the block to justify
Wish pity, hoping you black to push your top back
Firin' warning shots in your back
With no strings attached (Yeah)
Lookin' from the nosebleed
Watchin' everybody that's before me hold up my trophy
It's mine, mine, mine (Mine)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm proud of you (Yeah)
I swear to God I gotta bow for you (Yeah)
Keep it G with me, tell me if you love me, you love
You said you love me back, said you love me back

[Verse 3: T-Shyne]
Tell me that you love me, uh
Tell me that you love me
And you'll never ever put no one above me
I told you lies, but still you told me that you trust me
I need your love and, girl, I wanted you to hug me
No matter what they tell me, I'ma ride
I got the doors goin' up, they suicide
And, girl, I promise I owe you that 'til we die
I had to tell my homies 'bout this friend of mine
And shawty from the east coast
She takin' me back like I was repoed
And I will start to see 

[?]
Tryna rebalance
She want some drugs, she on a ecstasy challenge
No matter what, I know that I will never ever fall
Before I couldn't see and then I made it out the fog
Mirror, mirror told me I'm the baddest of 'em all (You), yeah
I went and got some money, I got paid to be a boss
You can't tell me 'bout the struggle if you never took a loss
You can't tell me 'bout this money if you askin' what it cost
Feel like I'm above the law, free my niggas out the yard
Have you ever felt pain? Have you ever been ashamed?
Have you ever brought glory to your family last name?
(Have you? Have you? Have you?)
I told my bitch I'm glad to have her
I told her, "No one else matters"
Havin' water like bad bladder
Whip clean, I'ma Dirty Diana

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You said you love me back, said you love me back
I got your back, run up you a sack
Show me that you love me
Ain't talkin' sex, but baby, tell me that you fuck with me
You said you love me back, said you love me back
I got your back, run up you a sack
Fuck gettin' Botox, I wanna see natural, yeah

[Intro]
I sit up in my room at night
Hold on to my pillow tight
My dreams are being invaded by somethin' I don't know

[Verse 1]
I hear these words in my mind
I don't know who put them there but they sure ain't mine
Who's inside everyone's brain?
'Cause recently everybody's been actin' all the same
But now I know

[Chorus]
Who writes the songs? The machines do
Who rights the wrongs? The machines do
Who plants the bombs? The machines do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
How did they get inside my head?
Makin' me feel so cold and dead
Your thoughts being captured as well
I'm locked in a trance, I'm under the spell
I feel their hands movin' over me
They're squeezing me tight
They're never gonna let me breathe (Breathe)
They take my heart and they rip it up
Change it for a broke watch and now my time is running out
But now I know

[Chorus]
Who writes the songs? The machines do
Who rights the wrongs? The machines do
Who plants the bombs? The machines do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus]
I can feel the tick tock when I turn my head
I can feel the tick tock when I lie in bed
I can feel the tick tock dancin' in my brain
And I can feel the tick tock runnin' through my veins
But when the tick tock stops yeah, my body erupts
When I close my eyes, I get electric shock
I feel the 

[?] in my skin, they're gonna win

[Refrain]
I am
I, I
I am, I am a machine
I am
I, I
I am, I am a machine

[Bridge]
You're one of me, I'm one of them
Say "Goodbye" to the world, we're never gonna be the same again
But now I know

[Chorus]
Who writes the songs? The machines do
Who rights the wrongs? The machines do
Who plants the bombs? The machines do
Who rights the wrongs? The machines do
Who writes the songs? The machines do
Who rights the wrongs? The machines do
Who plants the bombs? The machines do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
You

[Chorus]
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

[Verse 2]
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You

[Chorus]
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one

[Outro]

Dance in the feeling with everybody by my side

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
I keep on trying but shit ain't the same no more
I don't really care, tension in the air
Tell me what you want and I'ma tell you what it is
You just want attention, baby, I can see it clear
And I'ma give it to you, I'm addicted to the feeling
I don't really care 'bout anybody else
Whenever I'm with you, only care about myself
And you, and you, and you, yeah
And you, and you, and you, yeah

[Verse 1]
Everything I did, makes no sense
I was just into the voice in my head
I know it's long gone, but let me try
I need you near me

[Chorus]
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Oh baby, it’s true
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Oh baby, it's true
I wanna be with, I wanna be with, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with, I wanna be with, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with, I wanna be with, I wanna be with you

[Verse 1: Lizzy McAlpine]
I didn't mean to kiss you
I mean I did, but I didn’t think it'd go this far
I didn't mean to kiss you
Now you can’t focus on the road when I'm in your car

[Pre-Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine]
Now we're going one hundred
Your hands aren't on the wheel
'Cause you're just staring at me like you're not convinced that I am real
And now we're at one eighty
And I can finally see
But then it’s over in a second, crashed the car into the tree
Yeah, I can see it all happen
You’d rather die than take your eyes off me

[Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine]
I don't love you like that
I’m a careful driver
And I tell you all the timе to keep your eyes on the road
But you lovе me like that
You're a reckless driver
And one day it'll kill us if I don't let go

[Verse 2: Ben Kessler]
I don’t know how to tell you
That I feel safe when you sit shotgun
Never felt this way with no one
And I lie when I tell you
I know exactly where we're going
I get lost just for this moment

[Pre-Chorus: Ben Kessler, Lizzy McAlpine]
Now we're at one hundred
My hands aren't on the wheel (Hands aren't on the wheel)
And I don't wanna lose this moment
Want you to know just how I feel (Just how I feel)
Now we're at one eighty
And I can finally see
But then it's over in a second, crashed the car into the tree
I don't know how it happened
Guess I'd die to keep your eyes on me

[Chorus: Ben Kessler]
'Cause I love you like that
I'm a reckless driver
And you tell me all the time to keep my eyes on the road
Do you love me like that?
If I keep on driving
Would you hold me when we crash or would you let me go?

[Bridge: Lizzy McAlpine]
Don't wanna scrape you off the pavement
I can't be your savior
I don't wanna be here when you lose control
Don't wanna watch it as it happens
See the crowd's reaction
I don't wanna be here when you kill us both

[Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine, Ben Kessler]
'Cause I don't love you like that
('Cause I love you like that)
I'm a careful driver
(I'm a reckless driver)
And I tell you all the time to keep your eyes on the road
(And you tell me all the time to keep my eyes—)
But you love me like that
(Do you love me like that?)
You're a reckless driver
(If I keep on driving)
And one day it will kill us if I don't let go
(Would you hold me when we crash?)
'Cause I don't love you like that
('Cause I love you like that)
I'm a careful driver
(I'm a reckless driver)
And I tell you all the time to keep your eyes on the road
(And you tell me all the time to keep my eyes—)
But you love me like that
(Do you love me like that?)
You're a reckless driver
(I'm a reckless driver)
And one day it will kill us if I—

[Intro]
She said she likes my watch, but she wants Steve's AP
And she stay up all hours watching QVC
She said she loves my songs, she bought my MP3
And so I put her number in my Bold BB
I got a black BM, she got a white TT
She wanna see what's hiding in my CK briefs
I tell her, "Wear suspenders and some PVC"
And then I'll film it all up on my JVC

[Intro]
Hey, let's talk
Please call back, bye

[Verse 1]
Told you I needed time, a little space
I packed up everything, all the stuff you left at my place
Moved back in with my mom, just had to get away
Tried to get used to it, waking up not seeing your face

[Pre-Chorus]
I went out (I went out)
Trying to forget about
Killed some time on the rebound
Where are you now?
'Cause nothing really feels like you

[Chorus]
I'm getting back with my girlfriend
Ready to dive in the deep end
This time, it's gonna be different
I'm getting back with my girlfriend (Oh)
Gonna call her, drive on over
Wanna see her, wanna hold her
It hit me all of a sudden
I'm getting back with my girlfriend

[Verse 2]
Friends think I'm naive
I don't care what they say 'cause I'm not listening
Need you like I need to breathe
Never liked the chase much anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
I went out
Trying to forget about
Killed some time on the rebound
Where are you now? (Where are you now?)
'Cause nothing really feels like you (No, no, no, no)

[Chorus]
I'm getting back with my girlfriend
Ready to dive in the deep end
This time, it's gonna be different
I'm getting back with my girlfriend
Gonna call her, drive on over
Wanna see her, wanna hold her
It hit me all of a sudden
I'm getting back with my girlfriend (Girlfriend)

[Bridge]
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
I wanna see her (Hey)
I've got a fever
'Cause I really want her back
Guess I'm gonna have to ask
I wanna see her (Wanna)
I've got a fever
'Cause I really want her back
I'm feeling it hard

[Chorus]
I'm getting back with my girlfriend (Yeah, yeah)
Ready to dive in the deep end (Yeah, yeah)
This time, it's gonna be different (It's gonna be)
I'm getting back with my girlfriend
Gonna call her, drive on over
Wanna see her, wanna hold her
It hit me all of a sudden
I'm getting back with my girlfriend

[Outro]
Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum
Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't need a gun in my neighborhood
Back when I was, I was on tour with The Neighbourhood
I used to keep guns in my neighborhood
Now I wish a nigga would (Now I wish a nigga would)
Now I wish a nigga would (Cool)
I don't need a gun in my neighborhood
Back when I was, I was on tour with The Neighbourhood
I used to keep guns in my neighborhood
Now I wish a nigga would (Now I wish a nigga would)
Now I wish a nigga would (Cool)

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Probably gon' shoot me if they see me
Now I'm on your TV, looking for a genie
Told him I was genius, I don't do bleeding
I need another season, they ain't seeing what I'm seeing, no?
You might never wan' be me, no?
Even when my skin greasy, no?
McDonald's would've been the more fire option
The barely famous shit is getting really fucking toxic
I used to wanna be Ali, I tried to be a boxer
Until you told me I could sing just like Mariah
And started—right?

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Backup, I don't need no backup
Block out all the chatter
Missing all the gin lined up at the tavern
All the same pattern, chokin' on tobacco
Rinsing down my face in bathroom, ah
Up and down
I don't see me how you see me
Maybe not wanna be me, but I love me, love me down
Often I be with my baby, clear water runnin' navy
See me, are you ready?
Up and down

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't need a gun in my neighborhood
Back when I was, I was on tour with The Neighbourhood
I used to keep guns in my neighborhood
Now I wish a nigga would (now I wish a nigga would)
Now I wish a nigga would
I don't need a gun in my neighborhood
Back when I was, I was on tour with The Neighbourhood
I used to keep guns in my neighborhood
Now I wish a nigga would (now I wish a nigga would)
Now I wish a nigga would (Cool)

[Verse 3: Joba]
Nevermind what I thought I knew
How could I know?
These days I just stay on the move
Need to go home, everything I ever wanted I got
Doesn't really make me happy, is this really what I wanted?
Oh God
When it feels right it's wrong, I swear
They tell me let go, let God
So I let go sometimes
Just to play with the fire
I come alive late at night
Been workin' overtime, got too much on my mind
An out of sight state of mind

[Spoken Word: Jim Carrey]
"What I want doesn't stem from showbusiness, uh, generally. I mean- I started out with many many desires as far as- as far as this business goes and uh, I've so surpassed all of them that I- that it's- it's not as meaningful to me anymore. I really love the work itself. I've examined myself on several occasions: 'Why am I really doing this? Am I doing this because I want to be famous?' And I think there was an element to that when I first started out. I wanted to be a rainmaker."

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Now everybody talkin' 'bout it
I don't trust nobody
It's just me, myself, and I
That's what I tell my partner
Now everybody talkin' 'bout it
I don't trust nobody
It's just me, myself, and I
That's what I tell my partner

[Post-Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo!
Now check that 

[?]
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo!
Now read the tag, bitch
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo!
Oh shit, boy!
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo!
Oh shit, boy!

[Verse: Joba]
I can be your genie in a bottle if you stroke my spout
Your knight in shining armor if you wanna joust
Just tickle my tummy, make me blush, let me out
It really ain't that complicated
Y'all got me exacerbated
Spirit on the up and up, the ceiling comin' down
Set my sights for the moon and sun
I'm blinded by the light to come
Had glimpses of the life I want
Wеll I'm up in smoke, just leave mе alone
And I pack my bags to find a home
I found that shit, don't ring my phone
Bless myself like it's going out of style
Crack a smile, flip the bird, cement my feet into the Earth
I grant my own wish
No thanks to you, bitch
I'll be gone quick, I'm free and wild, shit

'Cause I can't get in love
You love to get it wrong
Get inside my brain
And I can't act the same
'Cause I can't get in love
You love to get it wrong

If you're for real, then I'll pick up
Don't deal with playas, don't give a fuck
Wanna be with a man who loves me good and loves me hard, rah

[Chorus]
You can have my digits, I always got my phone
Press my buttons in your system when you feel alone
Nervous when you call me, the nerves will hit the tone
But don't you leave me hangin', by the telephone

The way you text me, that turns me on
Vibrate in my pocket, the signal's strong

Breathe in your trouble, feel high
Dare me to jump, I just might
Hands all on me when we drive downtown
Take me where I'm not allowed

Hurt me for the hell of it, break me cause I'm delicate

You thought you were my silver sun
Thought you were locked and so secure
Despite the things you said and done
But you were wrong to be so sure
(Cause I'm not taking this anymore)

[Chorus]
You look at me and then you frown
Turn your back when I am down
You only touch me when it suits you
Hold me under til’ I drown
In my mind I have no doubt
There’s nothing left to talk about
You get the picture, I won’t shout
I’ll say my peace then kick you out

[Verse 2]
My bones were hanging on
Your medicine so strong
Now all our strength is gone
And wе don’t know where we bеlong
(Can’t you see you do me wrong)

[Chorus]
You look at me and then you frown
Turn your back when I am down
You only touch me when it suits you
Hold me under til’ I drown
In my mind I have no doubt
There’s nothing left to talk about
You get the picture, I won’t shout
I’ll say my peace then kick you out

[Bridge]
I’m not, I’m not just hanging on
Cause my heart, my heart’s already gone
Cause my heart, my heart’s already gone
Cause my heart, my heart’s already gone
Cause my heart, my heart’s already gone

[Pre-Chorus]
You thought you were my silver sun
Thought you were locked and so secure
Despite the things you said and done
But you were wrong to be so sure
(Cause I’m not taking this anymore)

[Chorus]
You look at me and then you frown
Turn your back when I am down
You only touch me when it suits you
Hold me under til’ I drown
In my mind I have no doubt
There’s nothing left to talk about
You get the picture, I won’t shout
I’ll say my peace then kick you out
I’ll say my peace then kick you out

[Instrumental Outro]
Keyboard funk is electronic
Guys at the front really want it
Girls in glitter, girls so gorgeous
Side zero up to enormous
All the boys get so distracted
Their dancing gets erotic
Party people like it loud
Ain't nobody ever gonna shut us down

[Intro: Heidi & Britney]
One more game
It's time to play
Play with me
(One more game)

Just one more game
It's time to play
Come play my way

[Verse: Heidi & Britney]
I'm no more Mrs. Nice Girl
No playing home ground
I'm not the same girl
You never rocked my world
You used me
Tried to abuse me
The fame, the life, the fantasy
Now back to reality
(You're dramatic)
The truth that lies can't hide
I'm not by your side
I'll let you drown in your drama
Run to your mama
See if she can save you
When I'm not around you're so dramatic

[Chorus: Heidi]
No, no, no, no, you're not the one I thought you were
Now there's another ringing my bell
I'm under his spell
You're too dramatic
Understand it's over

[Verse 2: Heidi & Britney]
Baby, fuck you
The things you did, and never thought I'd get a clue
Yeah, you wanted me to be that faithful to you
Not let nobody's body touch my body in positions that we only knew
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Now I'm gonna give him what he wants and more
Do all those explicit things that I told you "No"
Places you couldn't go
You know where I'm talking
You are too dramatic

[Chorus: Heidi]
No, no, no, no, you're not the one I thought you were
Now there's another ringing my bell
I'm under his spell
You're too dramatic
Understand it's over

[Bridge: Heidi]
Come and play
You wanna play
Come play with me

[Chorus: Heidi]
You're not the one I thought you were
Now there's another ringing my bell
I'm under his spell
You're too dramatic
Understand it's over

[Chorus: Heidi & Britney]
No, you're not the one I thought you were
Now there's another ringing my bell
I'm under his spell
You're too dramatic

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Shit, I was thinking, I've been drinking too much
Overthinking, doing everything I
Said I wouldn't do now I do it because of you
Said I wouldn't do, but it's hard when it's in front of you
Oh now, I'm in my head again
I'm thinking 'bout what I could've said, and done
But now, it's said and done
And I realized I need your love
It's getting late and now I realize, yeah...

[Intro]
Down-downtown, I'ma

[Verse]
Downtown, I'ma pull up to your condo
When it's late, there's no other place that I go
You gon' lie, you been heavy on my mind though
And every time, I be in it, I be mindblown
Oh, no-oh
Always be lying, do you know something that I don't?
And you love me, but baby, you know I know
Say you love me, but lately baby, I don't know...

'Cause you split my heart up in two
I get dressed about 'round midnight
I run through the pink neon lights

[Chorus 2]
I'm gonna paint the town
Gonna go all night
Gonna do it my way, yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh, I've been drinkin' whiskey from the bottle

Won't apologize for nothing

Oh, when I'm like this, can't be trusted
Won't apologize for nothing
When I'm like this, can't be trusted
Bad desicions good for something

Gonna do it my way

Gonna kiss their mouth
Won't remember nothing

Bad decisions count for something

Built a world all in my mind
All on my own, will I survive? Oh

Lyrics from Snippet

...(Oh)
Can't fly with a broken wing, thank you fate (Oh)
Don't run away from me, nothin' will change (It won't)
Don't run away from me, fighting thing...

[Verse 1]
Yesterday, I woke up on the hotel floor
Then I stole my ex's car
Signed it with a lipstick mark
Over it, had to kiss his ass goodbye
He was low and I was high
Popping Valiums on Valentines

[Pre-Chorus]
If he just gave you flat line when you want trampoline (Whoa-oh)
If you be in the penthouse when he on mezzanine (Whoa-oh)
Then you just gotta tell him "Catch my level or leave"
You gotta look him in the eye
Middle finger to the sky and say

[Chorus]
I do it too bad for you (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I do it too bad for you (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I do it too bad for you (Uh-huh-uh)
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa (Do it, do it)
I do it too bad for you (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I do it too bad for you (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I do it too bad for you (Uh-huh-uh)
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa (Do it, do it)

[Verse 2]
Yesterday I was countin' up big stacks
But you were tryna hold me back
Pedal to the metal, I can't get with that
No, over it, maybe you're just not my type
Should've swiped left, not right
'Cause I just wanna live my life

[Pre-Chorus]
If he just gave you flat line when you want trampoline (Whoa-oh)
If you be in the penthouse when he on mezzanine (Whoa-oh)
Then you just gotta tell him "Catch my level or leave"
You gotta look him in the eye
Middle finger to the sky and say

[Chorus]
I do it too bad for you (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I do it too bad for you (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I do it too bad for you (Uh-huh-uh)
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa (Do it, do it)
I do it too bad for you (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I do it too bad for you (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I do it too bad for you (Uh-huh-uh)
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa (Do it, do it)

[Verse 1]
I will drive for you through the dark of the night
With a broken headlight, it's too late, we feel
I would face every feel that I have
And I'd never go back just to know the truth
You're so real that I fall to my knees
Can't I just have a piece of what's left of you
I don't know anything about love, but I know what I want
You're the living proof

[Chorus 1]
I can feel my heartbeat running, running away
You got that special somethin', somethin' to crave
I think you're beautiful, you make me want to stay, yeah
I can feel my heartbeat running, running away
You got that special somethin', somethin' to crave
I think you're beautiful, you make me want to stay, yeah

[Verse 2]
Calling out with your head on my chest
In a 

[?] you can pass, that you're feeling lost
Try to heal me, your thoughts are your flames
And your 

[?] are your wings and I want them all
You and I, a 

[?] to the night, side by side

[Chorus 2]
I can feel my heartbeat running, running away
You got that special somethin', somethin' to crave
I think you're beautiful, you make me want to stay, yeah
Oh, you make my blood 

[?] rushin', rushin' my veins
I always hear you comin', comin' my way
I think you're beautiful, you make me want to stay, yeah

[Bridge]
Hold me up, don't let me down
Just call me up, don't let me down
You've called me up, don't let me down
You always save me, girl

[?] make me, I don't even know
I will drive for you through the dark of the night
With a broken headlight, it's too late, we feel

[Chorus 2]
I can feel my heartbeat running, running away
You got that special somethin', somethin' to crave
I think you're beautiful, you make me want to stay, yeah
Oh, you make my blood 

[?] rushin', rushin' my veins
I always hear you comin', comin' my way
I think you're beautiful, you make me want to stay, yeah

[Verse 1]
Some people claim that I'm born to play
'Cause I'm your Ice-T on a sunny day
I make the goers come, the leavers stay
I make the lovers kiss and the workers play
I make the runners walk, the quiet talk
I bust so viciously, I make the blind man see
I'm the ladies' cream, the virgins' wet dream
I got that kind of movement that makes the young girls fiend
I'm tired of these DJs going around
Talking about how they go down to town
'Cause I'm the best rappеr that you have found
So all you lovely ladies, lеt's party down
Take all your rapping records, throw them in the trash
Ice-T is the only brother that you got to blast
Hook up the stereo, turn up the watts
We're gonna rock 'til the neighbors call up the cops
We rock rock y'all with no fear, and
If you don't dig it turn off your ears
We rock rock y'all and keep on, and
If you don't dig it take your damn self home
'Cause I'm a player, the best alive
I prefer fast money to a nine-to-five
From the womb to the tomb, I run my game
'Cause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame

[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]

[Verse 2]
Well I'm Ice-T, I'm terribly bad
I'm here to knock out the windows and blow up the pad
I may be small but I'm willing to say
I jam this party in one hell of a way
The powers I've got are hard to find
I be breaking women's hearts while I'm blowing their minds
They be giving me money, and buying me things
But I spend their cash and pawn their rings
But if they treat me right, I'm willing to show
The coolest young brother they'll ever know
But if they do me wrong, I hate to say
I'll never teach them how to rock this way
'Cause back in the thirties when times was hard
I had a sawed-off shotgun, a marked deck of cards
A turned up collar, a turned up hat
A .38 hustle and I stole that
I walked in the party, there were women for days
And I started dancing one hell of a way
I was dancing so hard, couldn't no one compete
I turned out the party with my ice-cold feet
'Cause I'm a player, that's all I know
On a summer day, I play in the snow
From the womb to the tomb, I run my game
'Cause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame

[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]

[Verse 3]
We're born to play, and brought up that way
We catch the women night and day
And when I want to, I'll talk to you
And you'll become one of the chosen few
But can't you see that now I'm me?
I'm the brother known as Ice-T
And I'm the brother whose like no other
Whose black in soul but not in color
You can dig the race, and a hit to the case
But you can't get outta my...face
I'm trying to tell you I'm a brother that's nice
I'm sweet as honey, I'm cold as ice
But say something to me that ain't too down
You'll be picking your booty up off the ground
You can ask your father, sister or mother
I got a Rolls Royce in every color
I keep my rides tuned to perfection
I got a Stutz for every direction
I'm the pimp, the player, the women layer
The 

[?] dueler, the whorehouse 

[?]
I just play young whores, slam Cadillac doors
I'm the black mack of the heart attack rap
I don't smoke no whack, I don't cut no slack
I'm here to rock y'all, so rock rock
I'm Ice-T when I dress, I never jive
I do all my shopping on Rodeo Drive
When I leave the pad, I'm never loud
I'm just so sharp, I cut through the crowd
I got so many clothes in my wardrobe these days
When I put some in, I got to throw some away
'Cause I'm a player, some call us macks
With private phones in our Cadillacs
From the womb to the tomb, we run our games
'Cause we're cold as ice, and we show no shame

[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]

[Verse 4]
The ladies say that I'm heaven sent
'Cause I got more money than the US mint
I ride rag-top Rolls with rocks on my hand
Maseratis and Mercedes Benz
I have an ocean liner, private jets
Bel-Air bookies place my bets
I own islands off the coast of France
And I wear designer shirts and pants
When I was brought into this world
My mama never asked if I was boy or a girl
'Cause I rolled over to her, and gave her a kiss
She said "Your daddy don't rock me like this!"
When the doctor hit me on the behind
I broke on down with a funky rhyme
The nurses said, I was awfully cute
When I played out a joint, in a three piece suit
Yo yo yo, please, please, please check it out...

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Is this thing on? Word

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Wiz Khalifa]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don’t care who sees (Shit)
Aye lemme get a lighter, please
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Cause you know I’m high as fuck and I forgot one
Living young and wild and free
Keep that in there
Uh, uh-uh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
So what I keep ‘em rolled up?
Saggin' my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
It look clean, don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A
Uh, hahahahahaha

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, uh, you know what?
It’s like I'm 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I'm on the chase, Chevy
It’s gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Upfront, four blunts, like, “Khalifa put the weed in a J,” Hey

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun

[Chorus: Bruno Mars, Snoop Dogg & Both]

Living young and wild and free

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, haha
High school, man
Hey Wiz, I'ma get with you in third period tomorrow
I'll holla at you

[Verse 1]
Just before our love got lost you said
"I am as constant as a northern star"
And I said, "Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar"
On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
With your face sketched on it twice

[Chorus]
Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh, I would still be on my feet

[Verse 2]
Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
I remember that time you told me, you said
"Lovе is touching souls"
Surely you touched mine
'Causе part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

[Chorus]
Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

[Verse 3]
I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said
"Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed"

[Chorus]
Oh, but you are in my blood, you are my holy wine
You're so bitter, bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

[Intro: Jorja Smith & YG]
I can see your face, see the light in your eyes
I can see the change, feel the heat of the fire
If you can feel the pain, then you know you're alive
Both feet on the line, by any means, I will—
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Here I am, here I am, here I am
I know I said I wouldn't but I fell in love again
Know I said I wouldn't, but look at where I am
I just pray that you don't do me like the other ones did

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
All of these hoes and I still chose you
With all that I want and I still want you, oh
I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you
'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (Oh)
All of these hoes and I still chose you
With all that I want and I still want you, oh
I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you
'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do, oh

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
That's what I promised I was never gon' do
I said, "Fuck love" 'fore I ever met you (Oh, yeah)
Three different girls in a day, I'm ashamed
But with all that I've been through, girl, who could you blame? Oh
Trust issues, I still got 'em
That's why I'm always tweakin' with you on some lil' problems
And you know it's different for me, I came out the real bottom
Why the fuck you stressin' on me? You know I got real problems

[Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Here I am, here I am, here I am (Oh)
I know I said I wouldn't but I fell in love again
Know I said I wouldn't, but look at where I am
I just pray that you don't do me like the other ones did (Oh-oh)

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
All of these hoes and I still chose you
With all that I want and I still want you, oh (Oh, oh)
I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you
'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (No, no)
All of these hoes and I still chose you (Woah)
With all that I want and I still want you, oh (Want you, oh)
I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you
'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (Never gon do, oh)

[Verse 2: The Kid LAROI]
You know, out of anyone, that it's hard for me to show my love
Hope you don't go to everyone
Tell 'em everything that I tell you, no
Oh, 'cause I'm so sure 'bout you
I hope I'm not wrong
I know where this is headed 'cause I've been here before
But I can't blame nobody but me, it's my fault (Oh)
I should've known I wasn't ready to fall in love again

[Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Here I am, here I am, here I am
I know I said I wouldn't but I fell in love again (Fell in love again)
Know I said I wouldn't, but look at where I am
I just pray that you don't do me like the other ones did (Love)

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
All of these hoes and I still chose you
With all that I want and I still want you, oh (Woah)
I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you (No)
'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (Oh)
All of these hoes and I still chose you (Chose)
With all that I want and I still want you, oh (Woah, oh, oh)
I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you (You)
'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do

[Outro: Jorja Smith]
If you can feel the pain, then you know you're alive
Both feet on the line, by any means, I will—

(KJ, what you got goin' on man?)
(Yo, Nick Papz, make it slap)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk, Meek Mill & Lil Baby]
I got a little bitch from the hood, I call her, "Gang," she don't play with that bae shit
I be fuckin' this NBA nigga bitch 'cause she know I ain't ever gon' say shit
New contract big like I play ball, lil' boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
I told her, "Pull up," she told me she can't, her nigga be sharin' location
Yeah, I was ridin' in the Ghost with the ghost gun
Seen you out with your kids so you owe one
And my man in the can while you takin' out the trash, he gon' pop with the MAC like, "Don't run" (Don't run)
Gave her a pill, they all get high, you ever had a foursome?
It's too much cash for me to hide, I had to give lil' bro some
I fuck her raw from time to time, I don't show no emotion
But when he died, he had them racks, he had to make a GoFund
I hang with the hitters who train the killers who send all the niggas on store run
I got me a check and I brought me a 'Cat, and I went on the block and did donuts

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I hang with all the murderers
I'm payin' all the lawyers for the murderers
I'm puttin' all my last on the murderers
You don't wanna see me with the murderers, murderers

[Verse 2: Meek Mill, Lil Baby & Lil Durk]
Yeah, Rolls Royce, swervin', famous bitch curvin'
Seen you out in traffic, you was lookin' nervous
Ran it up on accident, they thought it was on purpose
I know for a fact, I'm blastin', man, I never get too worried
Hunnid racks in hunnids, stick like cursive, I been sellin' verses
One time I lied inside my song, I ain't gonna buy her no Birkin
Homicide on my mind when I slide, I ain't tryna see no hearses
He ain't even die by the gun, took a fake pill, nigga died off Percs
Shorty look perfect (Perfect)
Pussy was worth it, go get her some purses
My diamonds be hittin' like we in a Versuz
We stickin' together, this shit in a cursive
I'm fuckin' with Durkio
I just left the jeweler with Baby, bought two anniversaries
Go to Atlanta, they Copper and Cove me (Brother)
Bad lil' bitches all over me
Way too ranked up, ain't no exposin' me (No way)
She wanna go to the mall (Let's get it)
Got up and went to the pop-up in Louis in SoHo and ordered it all
I'm in this bitch with The Voice and The Hero
These niggas is weirdos, ain't goin' this hard (No way)
I'm from the P, that's gang
All these niggas know me, I hang with

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I hang with all the murderers
I'm payin' all the lawyers for the murderers
I'm puttin' all my last on the murderers
You don't wanna see me with the murderers, murderers

[Outro: Lil Durk]
Murderers
I hang with all the murderers
Murderers

[Verse 1]
She asked me where I was from
I said, "Somewhere you never been to"
Little town outside of Knoxville
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water
She left her flip-flops by my Red Wings on the beach

[Chorus]
Yeah but, now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

[Verse 2]
I said, "Let's go shoot tequila"
So we walked back to that beach bar
She said, "Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"
So we drank bottom shelf
She said, "Damn, that sky looks perfect"
I said, "Girl, you've never seen stars like the ones back home"
And she said, "Maybe I should see 'em for myself"

[Chorus]
Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

[Bridge]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, ooh-woah
I said meet me in the mornin'
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up

[Chorus]
Oh, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

[Intro]
(Without them I'm nothing at all)

[Verse 1]
You got a house in the hills
Turn it up, hundred bills
Swimming pool full of girls
Think they love you for real
Lose it all and they leave ya
Got a heart like a freezer
You got the things that you want
But I got the things that you need, yeah

[Chorus]
I've got friends, real friends
Got my back until the bitter end
Real friends, yeah, I got em, I got em, I got em
I got friends, real friends

Real friends, yeah, I got em, I got em, I got em
I got friеnds

[Post-Chorus]
(Without them I'm nothing at all)
(Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Pull up in the Mеrcedes, pick me up when I'm faded
Tyres screeching in the parking lot, keep it ride or die
Running from the cops
It's a fact that on the day I die, million roses laying by my side
Your friends will be here for now, but mine gon' be here for life, yeah

[Chorus]
I've got friends, real friends
Got my back until the bitter end
Real friends, yeah, I got em, I got em, I got em
I got friends, real friends

Real friends, yeah, I got em, I got em, I got em

[Bridge]
They would die for me, risk their life for me
Like my brother, like my sister, they're my family
I would do the same, 'cause we got memories
So if a year goes by, I know nothing's gonna change
Crushed your house in the hills, gasoline, hundred bills
Doing this for the girls, I'm doing this for the girls
By the poolside you're screaming, now you're so out of season
Yeah, you lost the things that you want
I still got the things that I need, yeah

[Chorus]
I've got friends, real friends
Got my back until the bitter end

Well, the secrets out
Clear and loud
So what do you have to say for yourself now?
Oh, you're so sorry
Of course I'm what you need
Really? Well, baby baby baby please
Save your breath

[Chorus]
'Cause there's no point in hiding
The feelings your fighting
Let me make this easy on you
Don't worry 'bout keeping
The facts or the fiction
'Cause now that I've seen the whole truth
You don't have anyone to lie to

[Verse 2]
Now you've got a bed all to yourself
Is it happy? Is it hell?
You've got all the space that you could ever want
And how, how does it feel?
To lеt go of something real?
And nevеr again have to conceal
Who you are

[Chorus]
'Cause there's no point in hiding
The feelings your fighting
Let me make this easy on you
Don't worry 'bout keeping
The facts or the fiction
'Cause now that I've seen the whole truth
You don't have anyone

[Bridge]
If you can't be truthful with yourself
You can't be good to someone else
It's the distance that you've always kept
But why?

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no point in hiding
The feelings your fighting
Let me make this easy on you

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh
Don't worry 'bout keeping
The facts or the fiction
'Cause now that I've seen the whole truth
You don't have anyone to lie to
No, you don't have anyone to lie to

[Verse 1]
I saw you in the mirror
Been stuck inside my mind since Saturday
Can't get you off my radar
You're lost inside my heart, I can't escape
I'm falling for you, I'm running from you
If I could lock you up and have my way
I'd drive you up to Bel Air
Let's escape, come here next to me, oh

[Chorus]
If you were mine
We'd take a holiday away from here
But you don't care
I never crossed your mind
Time passes by
Alone in paradise
You'll always be a fantasy
I never crossed your mind

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
My heart is getting hazy
I wish you'd whisper words into my еar
I drive you up to Bel Air
Let's еscape, come here next to me, oh

[Chorus]
If you were mine
We'd take a holiday away from here
But you don't care
I never crossed your mind
Time passes by
Alone in paradise
You'll always be a fantasy
I never crossed your mind

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-oh-ah-ah-ah-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Ah-ah-oh-ah-ah-oh
Ah-ah-oh-ah-ah-ah-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Ah-ah-oh-ah-ah-ah-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah

[Chorus]
If you were mine
We'd take a holiday away from here
But you don't care
I never crossed your mind
Time passes by
Alone in paradise
You'll always be a fantasy
I never crossed your mind

Howdy-do, motherfuckers, it's Weezy Baby
Niggas bitching and I gotta tote the (My nigga Don Cannon!)
Haha! Listen close, I got duct tape and rope (Oh!)
I leave you missing like the fucking O'bannons
One hand on my money, one hand on my buddy
That's the AK-47, make his neighborhood love me
Bullets like birds, you can hear them bitches humming
Don't let that bird shit, he got a weak stomach
Niggas know I'm sick: I don't spit, I vomit—got it?
One egg short of the omelet
Simon says: "Shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg
And tell him, 'Catch up,' like mayonnaise"; um—
I'm the sickеst nigga doing it—bet that, baby
These othеr niggas dope; I'm wet crack, baby, yes!
Get back, get back, boy, this a setback
Clumsy-ass niggas slip and fall into a death trap
Rest assured, I rest in a azure
Me and my chauffer got a (Cannon!)
Sometimes I gotta let my girl hold the (Cannon!)
I think I'm bout to put some pearl on the (Cannon!)
Yeah! And guess what boy?
You know a nigga just got papers on the (Cannon!)
And I just got off paper for the (Cannon!)
Now I can go and get some paper with this (Cannon!)
What you on?
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone
And if you strapped, we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush
And when it come to that paper, I stack books ha
You heard what I said
I can put you on your feet or put some money on ya head
Life ain't cheap, you better off dead if you can't pay the fee
Shout out my nigga Fee
See, every motherfucker at the door don't get a key
You're outside looking in, so tell me what you see
It's about money, it's bigger than me
I told my homies, "Don't kill him, bring the nigga to me" (Gangsta!)
Yeah, don't miss, you fucking with the hitman
Kidnap a nigga, make him feel like a kid again

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Straight up, I ain't got no conversation for you
Nigga, talk to the (Cannon!)
Yeah, have a few words with the (Cannon!)
Yeah, tell it to my motherfucking (Cannon!)
Yeah, straight up, I ain't got no conversation for you
Nigga, talk to the (Cannon!)
Yeah, have a few words with the (Cannon!)
Nigga, tell it to my motherfucking (Cannon!)

[Verse 1]
There's a hole in the ceiling, it drips when it rains
Hits the bottom of the bucket, again and again
I've been puttin' it off, lettin' it go
Like it ain't even there

[Verse 2]
There's a forty watt in the hallway, burned out last week
There's a number I can call to change it all, but you don't wanna speak
If it's better late than never
I can put it all back together

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got things to fix
Got you and me there at the top of the list
I've got things to say
Ain't gonna let 'em get away
I've got your love to earn
Don't want you to be some lesson I had to learn
Ain't too proud to admit
That I've got things to fix

[Verse 3]
The time I lied to stay out drinkin', I got way too out of hand
Drunk and careless with the trust that you'll never give again
I could close my eyes, pretend it's fine
But I can't go on like this

[Chorus]
'Cause I got things to fix
Got you and me there at the top of the list
I've got things to say
Ain't gonna let 'em get away
Got your love to earn
Don't want you to be some lesson I had to learn
Ain't too proud to admit
That I've got things to

[Bridge]
Patch up, to own up
It's about damn time, I've had enough
Of all this pain and all this rain inside
And I ain't too proud to say

[Pre-Chorus]
I got things to fix
Got you and me here at the top of the list

[Chorus]
I got things to say
Ain't gonna let 'em get away
Got your love to earn
Don't want you to be some lesson I had to learn
Can't walk away from this
Ain't too proud to admit
That I got things to fix
I got things to fix
Around here

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah

[Part 1: Young Deji]
Lean to clean like soap
I'm just trynna leave my folks
I'm just trynna give them hope
Used to have to take the long way home
Now we hop on the jet, we don't get checked
I be so far away from home
City to city, don't need no security
We ride around with that chrome
Shawty naked in my hotel suite, trynna sext me
I'm saying she trying to be grown
Don't give me advice, you ain't taking your own
I hopped off the porch, got the shit out the dirt
And I made some mistakes, am I wrong?
Momma wasn't home
Macauly Culkin, and I trapped home alone
We smoke the best, I'm not impressed
Allergic to

Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro: Post Malone]
Take my heart and put it somewhere safe (super safe, super safe)
These feet have walked over a few graves (super safe)
I can't see you walking away, cause in my world oh everyone stays
I can’t see you walking away, cause in my world oh everyone stays

[Chorus: Post Malone]
You want to put your heart on ice?
You sick of all the lonely nights?
You want to tell me that I ain't ready?
You want to tell me that it ain't right?
You really want to roll them dice?
Remembеr that you saved my life
How can I let you rеally gon' get it?
Sick of the flashing lights

Who are we to know what the future holds?
Who are we to know what we’re letting go of?
Take my heart and put it somewhere safe
Take my heart and store it in a cold, dry place

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Take my heart and put it somewhere safe (super safe, super safe)
These feet have walked over a few graves (super safe)
I can't see you walking away, cause in my world oh everyone stays
I can't see you walking away, cause in my world oh everyone stays
Oh...

[Verse 1]
He's so pretty that it hurts
Looks a mess, but it still works
And I'm a sucker for a trainwreck when I see one
I know my mama wouldn't approve
Daddy probably come unglued
But I got an eye for a guy who's a diamond in the rough

[Chorus]
My friends tell me that ill never win
That boys good for nothing but homemade, sin
But a woman's touch is influential
I see nothing potential
I'll love him 'til he give sin
I can fix him

[Verse 2]
Well, his whiskey talkin' sounds so sweet
Not so much that I can't see
He thinks he's making time, but I'm a girl on a mission
And I know exactly what I'm gonna do
That poor boy ain't got a clue
Yeah, he'll be walking out of line
And time won't know what hit him

[Chorus]
My friends tell me that I'll never win
That boy's good for nothin' but homemade sin
Well, skin tight jeans are influential
He's got nothing but potential
Love him 'til he gives in
I can fix him
I can fix him

[Bridge]
Clean him up, haircut
Rid of that nasty truck
Make him into what he's not
Get the boy a real job
Cigarettes, make him quit
LA, throw a fit
Bring him home to meet the folks
Hold on, I ain't done yet
Put him in a decent suit
And get up to the church quick
Drag him to the altar and teach him to commit

[Chorus 2]
I can fix him
I can fix him
Ooh, I can fix him

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm, hmm, mmm
I can fix him

[Intro]
(guitar riff and keyboard plays)

Sweet heat and stagnant air on a hot hot summer's night
Sensing the smell in the air- 

[cuts off to dialogue]

[Dialogue]

[Earwig]
Wow! This is great isn't it Custard?

(Guitar riff)

[Earwig]
Huh? Earwig, huh! No way!

[End of Dialogue]

Inside a freezing furnace coated with ash from head to toe
The sweet girl's chapped lips are chapped with a love she doesn't know
How long she'll have to wait until the prince of her dreams comes running through?
On his big white horse to take her to a palace
Up in his castle tower, all around him all his toy trinkets
Looking all pale and grey while her prince and guys cowards up like a kid
His door is shut secure
I hope his locks keep it quite and closed
The only lady who scares the prince is his mama

Oh, the foolish prince is all alone
Ah this gruesome girl sees what she is waiting for
Oh, they don't know the doors
What they've been waiting there for
Waiting to be unlocked

Don't disturb me
I'm here to stay
If you approach to disturb me, I'll whoosh you away
Don't disturb me, though you look great
If you bother me
Oh, I'll hex you twice

Don't disturb me
I'm here to stay
If you approach to disturb me, I'll whoosh you away
Don't disturb me, just wait and look
You'll feel the curse's ferocity

(guitar riff and keyboard plays)

[Dialogue]

[Earwig]
Wow!

[The Mandrake]
That's enough!
(snaps fingers)

[Intro: 24hrs]
Hey Tronny, I heard you with Wizzle
He won't answer now

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Chicken with the cheese, I could give you what you need
It's hard for you to breathe with all the kush in the air
I am not a dud, I swear that I was not aware
And apparently you only want the things that cost me money
Bobby Shmurda shmoney, I be gettin' money
Cartier protect my face every time that it get sunny
RIP to Camouflage, when I think about Savannah
It's middle fingers up every time that my niggas see the camera
My bitch know Country Grammar, my buss down MC Hammer
Don't fuck with no police, I own this shit, no leasе

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Gotta be a classic, if I put it on the streets
Supposed to spеnd the night, but end up staying for weeks
Gucci bathrobe, hair wove in Versacci sheets
All the niggas with me stay solid like concrete
Baby girl a freak, send pictures and then delete
Hundred million soul, we made it through the critique
Walk me through the kitchen, big plate im fixing to eat
Nigga talk crazy, next day he'll be missing teeth
Rolling J's over campfires
We hustle all night, sleep in the day like vampires

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Chicken with the cheese, I could give you what you need
It's hard for you to breathe with all the kush in the air
I am not a dud, I swear that I was not aware
And apparently you only want the things that cost me money
Bobby Shmurda shmoney, I be gettin' money
Cartier protect my face every time that it get sunny
RIP to Camouflage, when I think about Savannah
It's middle fingers up every time that my niggas see the camera
My bitch know Country Grammar, my buss down MC Hammer
Don't fuck with no police, I own this shit, no lease

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
I just touched down in LA, just tryna keep it player
I got all these rings on me, she treat me like a Laker
She see all this ice, yeah, I feel like Gretzky (Ice)
I'ma need that two on one, so baby bring your bestie
Nikes on my feet, can't never let these niggas check me
She pulled up with her chocolate friend, that's cool, I'm feelin' Nestlé
Look I just want the whole thing, all these diamonds on my body dance like Soul Train
I had to leave that bitch on read, I know that's cold game
I got the top, we was on tour, don't know what her name was
Can't make her famous, yuh

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Chicken with the cheese, I could give you what you need
It's hard for you to breathe with all the kush in the air
I am not a dud, I swear that I was not aware
And apparently you only want the things that cost me money

Cartier protect my face every time that it get sunny
RIP to Camouflage, when I think about Savannah

[Intro]
Oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Gave you my love and my affection all of the time
Thought you were the one
Thought you were the one, but you had to lie
Up in my house, straight to my face
Looking right through my eyes
Thought you were the one
Thought you were the one, but you had to lie
So...

[Chorus]
I'ma walk away, like a champion
Hold my head up high, like I'm on that throne
Made a mess of me in front of everyone
I'm done
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah
I'ma walk away, like a champion
I'm much better off, now I'm on my own
Made a mess of me in front of everyone

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, I'ma walk away, I'ma walk away
Yeah, yeah, I'ma walk away, I'ma walk away

[Verse 2]
Four in the morning
Got a groupie calling your phone
Thought I was the one
Thought I was the one, but I'm not alone
Gave you forgiveness
Gave you one thousand second chances
Thought I was the one
Thought I was the one, now I'm going home

[Chorus]
I'ma walk away, like a champion
Hold my head up high, like I'm on that throne
Made a mess of me in front of everyone
I'm done
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah
I'ma walk away, like a champion
I'm much better off, now I'm on my own
Made a mess of me in front of everyone

[Intro]
(Damn, Ryder)
Uh, oh, oh, oh
Uh

[Chorus]
I told my mama that we good, no matter the situation (Ooh)
Big crib in California, where I'm situated (Ooh)
And everybody think it's cool because I'm rich and famous (Ooh)
But they will never understand what my pain is
I told my dawgs we gon' be good, no matter the situation
I heard some people say I changed ever since I made it
But they the same ones on my line when they need something from mine
That's why they calls get declined, I don't need the fakin'

[Verse]
I'm done with doin' favors, I'm done with doin' fake shit
I'm done with fuckin' with these bitches, all they do is play me
I'm done with dealing with the pain, I'm out here, getting faded
Then retail therapy, I walk in and I buy the latest
I know this why they hate me
I know this why they mad, seventeen and in my bag
Got it out the mud, they said I wouldn't, always knew I can
I hear all the rumors, but I can't pay attention to that
My foot on the gas, in this 'Rari, I might fuckin' crash

[Chorus]
I told my mama that we good, no matter the situation (Oh, oh)
Big crib in California, where I'm situated (Woah, woah, woah)
And everybody think it's cool because I'm rich and famous (Oh)
But they will never understand what my pain is (Woah, woah, woah)
I told my dawgs we gon' be good, no matter the situation
I heard some people say I changed ever since I made it
But they the same ones on my line when they need something from mine
That's why they calls get declined, I don't need the fakin'

[Verse 1]
Your love was like a drug, was like a drug
I couldn't get enough of touch
Oh, your touch, that kind of rush
I couldn't get enough, but now

[Pre-Chorus]
Since we're not together
My life is black and white, I'd pay any price
For just one night together
So I can mainline, freebase, shoot up your love

[Chorus]
I'm an exaholic, call it what you call it
All I know's I want it, I-I can't help it
I'm an exaholic, call it what you call it
All I know's I want it, I-I can't help it

[Post-Chorus]
I can't help it, I'm an exaholic
I need a fix, just want my fix
Yeah, I can't help it, I'm an exaholic
Oh no, here I go, I think I need an intervention

[Verse 2]
Boy, you got me now, I'm turned around
You got me under your spell
Like I'm hypnotized, look in my eyеs
Baby, can't you tell that now

[Pre-Chorus]
Since we'rе not together
My life is black and white, I'd pay any price
For just one night together
So I can mainline, freebase, shoot up your love

[Chorus]
I'm an exaholic, call it what you call it
All I know's I want it, I-I can't help it

[Post-Chorus]
I can't help it, I'm an exaholic

Yeah, I can't help it, I'm an exaholic (Whoa, oh!)
Oh no, here I go, I think I need an intervention

[Chorus]
I'm an exaholic, call it what you call it
All I know's I want it, I-I can't help it
I'm an exaholic, call it what you call it
All I know's I want it, I-I can't help it

[Bridge]
I hope you don't mind me saying

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
(Ooh, SAV killed it)
I gotta get me a crib out here in Detroit (You do), for real

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Put that teeny eeny beeny little watch away
Somebody pass me a cup, feelin' parched today
Would've thought it wasn't summer how my steppas had marched today
This bitch don't fuck me the same, think she gave her arch away
Certified rack runner, I'm a stack doubler
Used to fuck so many hoes, needed a stunt double
Locked safe filled up with gold medals
On the pegs while my brother used to push the pedal

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
(Yeah, yeah, yеah)
That's how we got around
Used to clean up for my own food, wе had to buss it down
Now I buss a hundred pack (I do)
Bitch fucked me so wack, I want my number back
Slangin' wood in her ass, feelin' like a lumberjack
Got a private FN, guess what's up under that (Thirty)
She in love with my durag like Thundercat

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Put that teeny eeny beeny little watch away
Somebody pass me a cup, feelin' parched today
Would've thought it wasn't summer how my steppas had marched today
This bitch don't fuck me the same, think she gave her arch away
Certified rack runner, I'm a stack doubler
Used to fuck so many hoes, needed a stunt double
Locked safe filled up with gold medals
On the pegs while my brother used to push the pedal

[Verse 2: Rio Da Yung OG]
When I was young, used to drop shit, now I'm doin' better
My bitch know I'm half way rich, she let me do whatever
I'll hit you with twenty pounds if you moved in quicker
I got a clip in the PLR longer than a school semester
Me and Mikey slid on some niggas out a blue Tesla
Dog took off runnin', got away, but I let Scoob catch him
What the fuck is that, a 36 DateJust?
Every nigga in the clique got two watches, know they hate us

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Put that teeny eeny beeny little watch away
Somebody pass me a cup, feelin' parched today
Would've thought it wasn't summer how my steppas had marched today
This bitch don't fuck me the same, think she gave her arch away
Certified rack runner, I'm a stack doubler
Used to fuck so many hoes, needed a stunt double
Locked safe filled up with gold medals
On the pegs while my brother used to push the pedal

[Intro]
Do you feel me now?

[Verse 1]
Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Verse 2]
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I lovе what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

Intoxicate mе now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
Now (Now, now, now, now, now)

[Outro]
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round

[Verse 1]
Notice me, take my hand
Why are we strangers when our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?

[Chorus]
Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby (Need you, baby)

[Verse 2]
I make believe that you are here
It's the only way I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting mе
I guess I need you, baby

[Bridge]
I may have made it rain
Plеase, forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry
At night, I pray
That soon your face will fade away

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

[Verse 1]
Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air
And boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there
It's not complicated, we're just syncopated
We can read each other's minds
One love united
Two bodies synchronizing
Don't even need to touch me
Baby, just

[Chorus]
Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh, this is way beyond the physical (Too way beyond the physical)
Tonight, my senses don't make sense at all
Our imagination, taking us to places
We have never been before (never been before)
Take me in, let it out
Don't even need to touch me
Baby, just

[Chorus]
Breathe on me (oh, oh)
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe
Breathe on me (breathe on me)
Oh baby just, breathe on me (breathe on me)
We don't need to touch, just

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh-oh, lean with me, me, me
Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 1]
Told her if I die, I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shawty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, oh
I'm lookin' for trouble so you know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 2]
Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love beans, and I love lean
And I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Huh, smoke with me, huh, pop with me, uh
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
If I overdose, bitch, are you gon' drop with me?
I don't even wanna think about it right now
Let's get too high, reach a new high
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
I took too many drugs, now I don't feel right

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me, and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Verse]
I can't believe that you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons
I lost my shit, you know I didn't mean it
Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
So there you go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone

[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me, and now I bleed internally
Lеft here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what lifе could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah-oh
Oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you, ooh
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah-oh
Oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you, ooh

[Bridge]
It's gon' be hard here on my own
And even harder to let you go, I
Really wish that we, could have got this right

[Pre-Chorus]
So here I go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone (Oh)

[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me, and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Verse 1]
Never need a chick, I'm what a chick need (Chick need)
Tryna find the one that can fix me (Fix me)
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly (Six, six, six, six)
Yeah, I want it all now (Oh)
I've been runnin' through these girls, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down

[Chorus]
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Verse 2]
Said I'm heartless
So much of it, it be fallin' out the pocket
Metro Boomin turn this place into a moshpit
Tesla-Tesla got me flyin' like a cockpit
Yeah, I got her watchin'
Call me up, I'mma turn it to a faucet
Duffle bags full of—and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now (Star)
I'm talkin' Time, Rolling Stone, and Bazaar now (Bazaar now)
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down (What?)
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now

[Chorus]
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Bridge]
I lost my heart and my mind
I try to always do right
I thought I lost you this time
You just came back in my life

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm heartless (Ooh)
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Verse 1]
All along the Western front
People line up to receive
She got the power in her hands
To shock you like you won't believe
Saw her in the Amazon
With the voltage running through her skin
Standing there with nothin' on
She gonna teach me how to swim

[Chorus]
Ooh, girl
Shock me like an electric eel (Come on)
Baby girl, yeah
Turn me on with your electric feel
Ooh, girl (Ooh, girl)

Or you can do it all the time
Plug it in and change the world
You are my electric girl

[Chorus]
Ooh, girl
Shock me like an electric eel (Come on)

Fuck with you hard but don’t tell me what I can’t do
Baby girl trust me I can put a girl right in her place

Ain’t arguing over no bitch, especially not with no man

Sign the paper, I play for them bucks, I’m feeling just like Giannis
I'ma just let you go ‘fore I play with your heart

And I promise I’m conscious to what’s going on
Rather be single I could just get my ho-ing on

All black everything, throwaway, wall rub
Head on my shoulder 'til its all shrug
