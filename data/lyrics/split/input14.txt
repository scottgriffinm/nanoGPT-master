[Intro: R. Kelly]
Here is a story about a man comin' in and
Finding his woman in bed with
Well, listen

[Verse 1: Ron Isley]
It's 2 A.M., I'm just getting in, about to check my message
No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors
Cellular rings, somebody wants to borrow money
I two-way her, she don't hit me back, something is funny
So I called her mother's house and asked her had she seen my baby
(Oh I) Drove my six around, looking for that missing lady
Got back in, turned the TV on and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head cause I'm so confused

[Pre-Chorus: Ron Isley]
And then I turned the TV down (TV down)
Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound (Whoa)
Hm, something's going on upstairs, yeah
Cause I know nobody else lives here, yeah (Bump bump bump)
As I get closer to the stairways, all I hear
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear, screaming out

[Chorus: Ron Isley]
"You're contagious, touch me baby
Give me what you got" (Then a man said)
"Sexy lady (Ooh) drive me crazy
Drive me wild" (All I heard was my baby's voice screaming)
"You're contagious, touch me baby (Touch me)
Give me what you got" (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
"Sexy lady (Then I heard another man) drive me crazy (Yeah)
Drive me wild" (And I just can't believe this shit, aw yeah)

[Verse 2: Ron Isley]
I ran downstairs, looked in the closet, looking for that, ooh
Said a prayer cause only God knows what I'm gonna do
What I saw was enough to drive a preacher wild
I'm in the hall contemplating, "Not in my own damn house"
Who would have thought she was creeping with another man?
(Oh I) The down-low happening to me all over again

[Pre-Chorus: Ron Isley]
And then I turned the TV down (TV down, yeah)
Cause I know I heard a squeaky sound
Something going on up there upstairs
Cause I know that no one else lives here (Bump bump bump)
As I get closer to the stairways, all I hear
Then I hear my baby's voice in my ear, screamin'

[Chorus: Ron Isley]
"You're contagious (Whoa) touch me baby (Oh)
Give me what you got" (Then a man said)
"Sexy lady (Oh I) drive me crazy (Oh I)
Drive me wild" (All I can do was hear them say)
"You're contagious, touch me baby (Ooh)
Give me what you got" (Whoa)
"Sexy lady, drive me crazy
Drive me wild" (Oh, I can't believe this shit, bump bump bump)

[Verse 3: Ron Isley, Chante Moore & R. Kelly]
What the hell is going on between the sheets in my home?
Baby wait, let me explain before you start to point your cane
Girl I'm 'bout to have a fit (Oh it's about to be some shit)
How did I get in to this? Shoulda never came home with this bitch
You low down dirty woman, back to where you come from
(But baby, wait) "But wait" my ass, hit the streets, your ass is grass!
(Now Mr. Biggs, before you done) Wait, how you know my name son?
(Honey wait, I was gonna tell you) Move, this cat looks real familiar
Hmm, now don't I know you from somewhere a long time ago?
No, no, I don't think so
Yeah, yeah, I feel I know you brother very well
No, no, you're mistaking me for somebody else
(Frank!) Shut up! Can't you see two men are talking?
(But) Thought I told your ass to get to walking!
Now I think y'all better leave this place
Cause I'm about to catch a case

[Chorus: Ron Isley]
"You're contagious, touch me baby
Give me what you got" (Whoa, that's was she said)
"Sexy lady (Ooh) drive me crazy (Whoa)
Drive me wild" (And then he replied)
"You're contagious, touch me baby (Touch me)
Give me what you got" (Give me what you got)
"Sexy lady (Whoa) drive me crazy (Whoa)
Drive me wild" (Aw yeah, oh)
"You're contagious, touch me baby (I should've known from the shopping spree)
Give me what you got" (That's the only time you smiled at me)
"Sexy lady, drive me crazy (And making love girl, it wasn't the same)
Drive me wild" (I could tell how you say my name)

[Verse 1]
She says, "Kiss me like you miss me
Fuck me like you hate me
And when you're fuckin' someone else
Just fuck her like she ain't me"
Damn, those words are scary
Those words are scary, Virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love two years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It's all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don't I?
I get off-topic, don't I? I get it poppin', don't I?
I'll end up stoppin', won't I?
And by the time I end up stoppin'
You'll be rockin' one of the rings that you pointed out while shoppin' with a nigga, don't lie
Uh, she's losin' it right now
'Cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been movin' in by now
But instead we're movin' slow, I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusin' it right now
But this money comin' in is just confusin' shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit, I guess I'm provin' it right now, oh

[Chorus]
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they'd be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time, we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
So she's here and we're both so gone

[Verse 2]
Hotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight and you come to me
But she don't want a weekend, she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me, then she says she done with me
You say that you're over me, you always end up under me
You know how it goes, don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with your shit, I put you back in your place
She tells me, "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hangs up, yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you?
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with too?
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make, I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn, I guess I'm proving it right now, oh

[Chorus]
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they'd be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time, we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
So she's here and we're both so gone

[Outro]
Oh, oh
She's here, we're so gone
Oh
Oh

[Hook]
She loves me, she loves me not
I can't tell if she's down or not
Oh, you like me?
What the hell does that mean?
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Are we gonna fuck or not?

[Verse 1 - Mike Posner]
Maybe I'm just dumb
But I can't read the signals that you're givin'
And I can never tell
If you're looking at me or Clinton
Is this the way that you talk to every guy that you meet?
Or do you wanna come back and stay up
All night, all night, all night with me?

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Big Sean]
Baby, what's your favorite drinks?
I think I'mma buy a round of 'em all
I'm rollin' up the bestest
Come help me blow a pound of it all
I'm on that up-upper echelon
You should climb up and be down with it all
Come here, cause we go hand in hand
Like (*clap clap clap*), round of applause
Showtime bitch, action
I think it's time for that night scene
She go to sleep and dream about my sex
I guess it's a pipe dream
28, but I make her feel like she 19
Tryna stick around like wifey
But I send her home in my white T like
"Bye"

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Clinton Sparks]
Now, every time I see this girl
She be askin' all type of shit
Where is it I'm going to
And who is it I'm hanging with?
Can't ever tell if she into me
Or just wanna be a friend to me
Mixed signals she's sending me
Late night at the club, drunk texted me
Like, "Can I come over your house?"
Okay, but can I come over your mouth?
Smiley face, LOL
Back and forth, I can't tell
Without being conspicuous
So (don't be so ambiguous girl)

[Hook]

[Intro: Chantal Kreviazuk]
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 1: Drake]
I think I killed everybody in the game last year
Man, fuck it, I was on, though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong, though
Shout out to all my niggas livin' tax-free
Nowadays, it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga, yeah
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy, but I'm just playin' the field, nigga, yeah
Are these people really discussin' my career again?
Askin' if I'll be goin' platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man, all of your flows bore me, paint dryin'
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
And I be hearin' the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time, yeah
It's been that way from the beginnin'
I just been playin', I ain't even notice I was winnin'
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

[Chorus: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 2: Drake]
You say I'm old news, well, who the new star?
'Cause if I'm goin' anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a bar mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over fed time
But shout out to the niggas that's doin' dead time
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start, boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfuckin' funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever
You know, feelin' good, livin' better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back pavin' the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I was drinkin' at the Palms last night
And ended up losin' everything that I came with, yeah
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got ten years to go, huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

[Chorus: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Outro]
Three in the morning, still going down

[Intro: Drake]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Summer's mine
I swear I said it about a hundred times, I'ma need it back
Wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl, I needed that from you
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
I'm spendin' time just taking care of me right now
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
'Cause you'd be tired of taking care of me by now

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh

[Chorus: Drake]
But the good ones go
The good ones go if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long

[Verse 2: Drake]
But don't you go getting married
Don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older
Don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer
But you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it
I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chillin' in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you started to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-Town
But when it's all done, baby, I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh

[Chorus: Drake]
But the good ones go
The good ones go if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long

[Verse 1]
I told her that I missed her, put her on a plane
Goyard luggage, just a product of the fame
I told her that I dug her, I wasn't running game
And if she left a nigga, I wouldn't be the same
She met me at the W, she grabbed me by my chain
Then kissed me like she meant it, so glad she came
Told me she was in love, she wasn't running game
And since she got off the plane, she didn't feel the same

[Pre-Hook]
I made a change for my baby, a difference for love
And I ain't frontin', feel like you were the one
That got the ring, girl if you want
Could have my name, girl if you want

[Hook]
See baby I been looking so long
Feel like you let me shy and wasn't feeling them at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
Girl I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
If you been searching too long
You knew that it was over, wasn't feeling them at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
A sucker for love, a sucker for love

[Verse 2]
Summer lovin' in the winter, flaming in the rain
The only one I'm into, never gonna change
Cause when I said I dug her, I wasn't running game
Since she been rocking with me, the crush has been insane
She's a 1 of 1, D color VVS stone
My precious you're my everything, no please don't leave me lone
She told me she was so sprung, I never was a lame
And that the feelings so good, she wish that it would stay

[Pre-Hook]
I made a change for my baby, a difference for love
And I ain't frontin', feel like you were the one
That got the ring, girl if you want
Could have my name, girl if you want

[Hook]
See baby I been looking so long
Feel like you let me show you wasn't feeling them at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
Girl I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
If you been searching to long
You knew that other lover wasn't feeling them at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
A sucker for love, a sucker for love

[Bridge]
Love, said I only think about her when I wake up
Oh, love, we did for we did it for love, love, love

[Outro]
See baby looking so long
Sure you wasn't feeling them at all
A sucker for love
A sucker for love
A sucker for love
A sucker for love

Been searching too long
Sure you wasn't feeling them at all
A sucker for love
A sucker for love
A sucker for love
A sucker for love

[Verse 1]
If I go back to Cleveland with nada
I'mma have one disappointed mama, no!
I'mma have one disappointed fam, I'mma feel bad
That I can't provide for my fam
I can't help how my mom process
Mr. Hutch told a nigga "young, learn to be the best"
And if I can't do that mayne, what the fuck I'm living for?
I got a pack of Newports and a super-bad whore
I step out and I drink a lot of Hennessey
Battle in my sleep with the demons tryna ruin me
A bunch of discouraging words, saying that fame wasn't meant for me
Take it back to Cleveland, you heard?
I can't stop them from speaking
Their visions are intense, got me laid out leaking
Y'all don't know the half, kid cudi got issues mentally
That I scribble down fast, like
I won't fold, I can't fold
I won't fold dogg, I can't fold
Is what I say to myself over and over
Cruising through the city in my black Range Rover

[Hook]
Heard em' whispering, I heard them talking now
Now that I'm bubblin'
Thought I forgot how you
Tryna take me off my grind
Yup, yup, they tryna take me off my grind
But it's my time, boy
We going straight to the top
Watch me live, my nigga

[Verse 2]
When you making moves, everybody pounding you
But when you down and out, niggas won't acknowledge you
Sick to the stomach when I think about losing, but
I like this music, so this the life that I'm choosing..
I had to find out who the real Scott was
Meditated with the wolves, all focused to get my hunger back
So alone, just me and an instrumental
They say my music ain't normal
Must be something up with my mental
I don't spit about guns and drugs
Well dumb fuck I don't know about guns and drugs
I spit what I know, and you should too!
But you won't, we all know, you wanna jock the next dude
And you follow the next man
Well I was born to be a leader so you know that I'mma follow my heart fam
And I'mma roll with what my nigga Manny said
"Keep your individuality because that's what's gonna get you bread"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain't tryna make hits for the club no more
I'm just tryna make hits for my niggas at war
Day to day in the White Man's World
Getting head from the white man's girl, that's me
When I'm stressed
Having dreams of a dark-skinned chick with big breasts
While I'm thinking of steps to be king, just like in chess
Kid Cudi won't rest, that's when I'm at my best
Flow's good ? I see the rest mayne
A lot of cats tryna make it happen through the music
Truest thing about it is not everyone can do this
Gotta spit it different from another nigga living
If I ain't, I'm slippin
And I'm never getting up
With that in your head, dogg, I'm never giving up
Looking up at the ceiling, chillin at my wake
These lames gotta hate, see the lyrical wizardry
Airing out my dirty laundry for these niggas that ?

[Intro]
Shit, you want my shoes?
You want my shirt?
My jewels too, nigga?
Well you need gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha, gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha, gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha, gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some

[Hook]
Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Polo, Louie to Gucci, like that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga, like that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich, bitch, see the shit that this cash get?

[Verse 1]
You can't afford the price, so why the hell would you ask it?
These faggots try and snatch it, get they ass in a casket
Ya honey love me, she admire the fashion
And I call her baby girl, just like her dad did
There's 100's on my paper like a smart ass class kid
Because I'm on top my route, like an ad lib
And you should holla mamma, Dolce and Gabbana mamma
Gotta a whole lot o' mamma, Fendi and the Prada so you need to
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
But to get boy you gotta be rich or something
And my attire hard, hard like my dick or something
I made more then ends meat
My nigga BIG told me he was bout the Benji's
I'm in the lime light 'til the point my skin green
And living my dreams 'til the point you should pinch me to convince me

[Hook]
Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Polo, Louie to Gucci, like that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga, like that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich, bitch, see the shit that this cash get?
Well you need to, gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some

[Verse 2]
If I told you where to get it, you niggas still wouldn't grab it
Just to pronounce it, you gotta add an accent
And they ask, can they call me grocery store?
Cause my pockets full of paper and plastic
Man, you not avoiding my Asian persuasion
Excuse the lil Ape in ya face, it stays Bathing
And when the heat blaze on high beams
You scream, I scream
For some cold ass ice cream
You need to gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Pose for the hoes, they might wanna take a pic or something
Hop up in the ride, they might wanna let me stick or something
There's some things, I don't like, I love them Nike's
But not the white on white's, forget the price tags
Cause I get what I like, and your girl looking for me
Because she like the pipe, ya dig?

[Hook]
Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Polo, Louie to Gucci, like that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga, like that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich, bitch, see the shit that this cash get?
Well you need to, gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some

[Verse 3]
Dog, the fabric on my ass is satin and its sad n
You think you could afford this fabric
When it comes to the hoes I'm the man like Shaft is
Cuz I'm clean cut and handle them like baggage
Atheists turn Christian when I rock my True Religions
Dog, It's that real when I'm rockin pastelle?
These niggas wanna wonder what they have on me?
I'm stickin to my roots like LRG
Go n getcha some, go go an getcha some (x2)
Pose for the hoes they might wanna take a pic or somethin
Hop up in the ride they might wanna let me stick em some
The rag 'round my neck complement the outfit
I'm out with brawds you be watchin from your couches
But I'mma need money power respect
Find a little piece of Jesus and I threw em round my neck
That's

[Hook]
Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Polo, Louie to Gucci, like that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga, like that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich, bitch, see the shit that this cash get?
Well you need to, gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some

[Kendrick Lamar]
See y'all don't understand me
My plan B is to win ya hearts before I win a Grammy
Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I'm on point like period
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
Family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick
I ain't lying, it stand for king and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
From the coochie to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
Muscle in my heart
Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him I'm the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
Cause I means this with all my soul
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
Damn that boy good
Bright as Thomas Edison, but Gucci man hood
He stood alone for so long
Prolonged his whole career, but now he's here
You can shoot shots or cheer cause I... am

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Let the motherfucking beat build in this bitch
About that

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you
Why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you around

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
The words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean 'em
Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to
Why is that?

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away (But you're away)
I said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything

Tha Biz-Tha Bizness

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
It kills me to see you cry, even more when I tell a lie
And it's always something I do to you, baby
And I'm so sorry for all the things that I did
And I can't say goodbye, or let you just walk away
So I'll admit my wrongs, and I hope you hear this
'Cause it's a song I made for you
And I'm hoping maybe, I can win back your heart
So please don't say goodbye, I know the love's still there somewhere

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Wish I could give the world
And I know it hurts sometimes
When you deserve the world (World, girl)
Nothing comes in between us
So you can never separate me from your love
Oh, darling
I'm never, ever letting go
'Cause I love you more than life itself

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Just want you on my team, girl
And I don't give a damn about nothing else
But the way I feel with you is so amazing, yeah
If I never get to see you, oh-woah
Then I might as well never even open my eyes
I love you so, that I can't let you go
And I ain't tryna be selfish no, oh, oh
Just had to tell you that you've got my heart
And only you can tear it apart, yeah, ooh-ooh

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Wish I could give the world
And I know it hurts sometimes
When you deserve the world (World, girl)
Nothing comes in between us
So you can never separate me from your love
Oh, darling
I'm never, ever letting go
'Cause I love you more than life itself

[Bridge: Kevin McCall]
You make it easy, easy to love you
So I ain't gotta look nowhere else
I know I found the right one
Call me crazy, but I love my baby more than anything
And something's taking over
Anything you want, I'll hand it over
I'ma ride this thing 'til the wheels fall off
'Til the end of time, I'm forever yours, yours

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Wish I could give the world (Oh yeah, the world)
And I know it hurts sometimes (Sometimes)
When you deserve the world (Woah, woah, woah, hey)
Nothing comes in between us (Nothing between us)
So you can never separate me from your love (Never)
Oh, darling
I'm never ever letting go (No)
'Cause I love you more than life itself

[Outro: Kevin McCall]
Oh no
I love you more than life itself, woah

[Intro]
Ain't nothin' else like me

[Chorus]
I ain't nothin' like you, so what is going on? (Mac Miller)
There must be somethin' wrong, you'll love me when I'm gone (Aha)
I'ma keep on doin' me, 'cause you don't even matter (Nah)
You, you just an actor, and I just ain't a rapper (What you are)
No, I'm one of a kind, I'm one of a kind (Ha-ha, Mac Miller, uh)

[Verse 1]
Here's a prototype that I know you'll like, right
Head into the light on an overnight flight (Aha)
Never in your life you gon' see another me
I tend to catch the eye like a pair of double D's
I'm here, not the same, I'm a pioneer
Stabbed the game in the heart with a giant spear
Grind to see success, goddamn, it's clear (Uh-huh)

[?] shine like a chandelier
I'm goin' through this cake
Spittin' 'bout what you relate
Never can you duplicate
Any of the music made
Gettin' super paid
Lookin' at a future star
They recognize me when I pass 'em in a movin' car
Always worried 'bout findin' out who you are
You know somebody, you gotta look into his heart
Yo mind so blind
I'm ahead of my time
'Cause I'm one of a kind, I'm one of a kind

[Chorus]
I ain't nothin' like you, so what is going on?
There must be somethin' wrong, you'll love me when I'm gone
I'ma keep on doin' me, 'cause you don't even matter
No, you, you just an actor, and I just ain't a rapper
No, I'm one of a kind, I'm one of a kind

[Verse 2]
And my pops said:
"Young man, you ain't ready for the world ahead
Way too much marijuana, always havin' girls in bed
You gon' realize that life ain't a party
Fuck around, you gon' end up starving"
Fuck it, I stay fly, live free, die hard
No Bruce Willis, this the whole nine yards
Thought that I can rhyme bars
Go and buy cars, you gotta grind hard once the sunrise start
In my heart, great things in my future (Uh-huh)
'Cause broke rappers, shit, that's just a rumor (Right?)
I see these diamond chains, mansion in they videos
They must got silly dough, do they really though?
Or is it all just a scam for your eyes?

[?] in disguise, goddamn, I can't decide
All these words here come from a mind
Got nothin' to hide, boy, I'm one of a kind

[Bridge]
Walkin' through this world, I just take a look around
Ain't nobody here like me, don't nobody got my style
People say I'm different, I assure you that's okay
'Cause I'm way past tomorrow, and you stuck in today

[Chorus]
I ain't nothin' like you, so what is going on?
There must be somethin' wrong, you'll love me when I'm gone
I'ma keep on doin' me, 'cause you don't even matter
No, you, you just an actor, and I just ain't a rapper
No, I'm one of a kind, I'm one of a kind
(Trey Songz)
Woop!
(Lil' Wayne)
Don't love me, don't love me, baby don't love me. alright
(Trey Songz)
Yeah
Say she wanna do her own thing
Fine as fuck an' she ain't tied to no man
Head it up, and there's a party
Spending weekends in the tropics
Just to catch that even sun tan
Fast cars, fast love and a slow fuck
Shorty running game, so I never had to coach her
But, when you're getting money
You just don't know who to trust
Getting her open, but she hoping that the rubber bust

[Pre-Hook 1: Trey Songz]
Pussy on my dick
Money on my mind
You know what it is
Get yours, I get mine
I love the way you feel girl
Plus your kind of fly
Once I get this ticket it needs your ass up on the flight. oww

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I know you say you hear this all the time
So I won't start to saying that you're fine
Never was too good at being friends
So, we can fuck like that's gon' be the end
We only in town for the night
So, let me lay your body down right
Never was too good at being friends
So, we can fuck but that's gon' be the end

[Refrain]
So don't love me, don't love me
Baby don't love me, don't love me
Baby don't love me, don't love me, baby don't love..
We can fuck but that's gon' be the end

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
So go and take a shower girl
Say that cab pulling up in 'bout an hour girl
She say trigger can you hit one more time
'fore I dip, I'm like yeah, I'mma wear your sexy ass out
She still want it, time flies

Before you leave, need to see what that head 'bout

[Pre-Hook 2]
Pussy on my dick
Money on my mind
Girl, let's make a flick
Pull them panties to the side
She's somebody girl, but I got her in the ride
Say that she ain't want it, but it's dripping down her thigh. oww

[Hook & Refrain]

(Trey Songz)
And it ain't nothin' to it
Ain't no crying, ain't no boo-hooin'
Each and every time, shoot that pussy in the mind like a finish line
And a nigga run right through it
Anytime of the day
Anytime of the night
Anytime on the watch, that's so bright
That's right don't need no lights, that pussy tight
I stretch it right out, Tune

(Lil' Wayne)
Yeah, and when we fuck she say it's all mine

They say till death do us part
I say damn, life's a bitch without a wedding ring
Yeah, she say she love me but she know I'm social

[Hook & Refrain]

[Intro]
Thank you
Thank you for comin' out tonight
Ladies and gentlemen
I am the president of Dirty Money Records
(What the hell are you waiting for?)
New York City

[Verse 1]
Who you know fresher than Nick'? Riddle me that
Mami you itty bitty can't mirror me back
Everybody gon' see where I'm lyrically at
Used to hate Nicki, now they givin' me dap
I live and I learn,  but I wait my turn
I'm always on the run, got weight to burn
Ease off the gas, then I make a turn
Three off the pass, they don't play like her
Why I can't just be ill?
Why when they see me, bitches gotta to go "Ew"?
Why my lil' nigga, still gotta sell krills?
Why I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal?
The rain and the pain, I done paid my dues
I'm ready for the game, I done laced my shoes
Everything I say believe I'm gon' do
Came out the coop, Petite Vuitton boots

[Hook]
Can I get an encore I know you want more
I know you sick of all them girls, they such a bore
But it's my time I need y'all to roar
It's my time I need y'all to  roar
(What the hell are you waiting for?)
After me, there shall be no more
It's my time I need y'all to roar
(What the hell are you waiting for?)

[Verse 2]
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Know when I paid my dues, that I would aim for you
Straight from the streets of Queens and yet it seems
The only thing they know, is that I push a beam
All they see's a pretty face, how I ride the base
So I put my hoodie down just to hide my face
They don't see the tears I cry, the fears I hide
Tend to keep my cares inside, it's merely pride
Like my grandmother, I wonder if she next to pop
Said the next time I seen her she would be in a box
Damn she was right, she was dead right
How was I to know, that would be her last night?
If I could turn back the time
Dear God, somehow could you press rewind?
Won't come when I call, but He just in time
So I come when He call, like I'm next in line
When you got something good why the Devil gotta ruin it?
Guess she never know, I be the best bitch doing it

[Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park]
Tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

[Nicki Minaj]
Can I get an encore
I know you want more
(I've become so numb)
But it's my time I need ya'll to roar
It's my time I need ya'll to roar

[Intro]
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh

[Verse 1]
Drive slow, drive fast
Whatever the destination is
I'mma leave all the numbers on the dash
Sheriff's tryna come and see me, but it ain't my fault
Better say a prayer
'Cause I ain't tryna wait on the change
Like my name was John Mayer
I swear
I came here to give 'em a show

[Chorus]
It's 11:34, I'm on a roll
It's almost noon and I ain't got nowhere to go
Ah, yeah, yeah
And this is the road of my life
So I'mma have a little fun and ride till I see the sun, yeah
Whoa, yeah

[Verse 2]
Got the time, got a place
If you want more of these Heineken's
You better go and give me my space (My space)
Before I kick the dirt and head to the trunk to get you a little taste
Yeah, I'm superbad
I'mma get ya a little something that your sister and your mama never had
Coulda been your dad
I gotta go, but I'll be right back

[Chorus]
It's 11:34, I'm on a roll
It's almost noon and I ain't got nowhere to go
Ah, yeah, yeah
And this is the road of my life
So I'mma have a little fun and ride till I see the sun, yeah
Whoa, yeah

[Bridge]
The road that I'm traveling is where I belong, yeah
I said the road that I'm riding is where I belong, hey

[Chorus]
It's 11:34, I'm on a roll
It's almost noon and I ain't got nowhere to go
Ah, yeah, yeah
And this is the road of my life
So I'mma have a little fun and ride till I see the sun, yeah
Whoa, yeah
It's 11:34, I'm on a roll
It's almost noon and I ain't got nowhere to go
Ah, yeah, yeah
And this is the road of my life
So I'mma have a little fun and ride till I see the sun, yeah
Whoa, yeah

[Outro]
All of my life...

[Verse 1: Yolandi Vi$$er]
Yolandi-fokken-Visser all up in the place
Hosh pagamisa, raak fokken wys
Fuck crime, these days rhyme fuckin' pays
Fan myself with a milli while I laugh in your face

[Chorus: Yolandi Visser]
Fok julle naaiers, fok julle naaiers
Fok julle, fok julle, fok julle naaiers
Fok julle naaiers, fok julle naaiers
Fok julle, fok julle, fok julle naaiers

[Verse 2: Ninja]
All my fuckin' life I lived a normal fuckin' ife
'Til I went an got myself caught up with the mic
And the beats coming dope with the rhymes and the flows
In real life trying to cope with the highs and the lows
I got sick and tired of getting treated like a stupid fuck-up
So I fucked my enemies up one time and blew the fuck up
Before they was like, "Yo, who's this stupid weirdo?
Now it's like, it's a new breed of rap superhero
To defeat these devils, ninja becomes a devil
These god-forsaken wretches will never be on my level
(Wies jy?) Fuck you and your whole crew, I got you stressin'
Double guessin' 'cause I won't do what I'm supposed to
I don't know you, baby say hello to
My little two friends "I'm Telling You" and "I Told You"
What? Try to speak but your tongue's frozen
In South Africa, I sleep with both my eyes open

[Chorus: Yolandi Visser]
Fok julle naaiers, fok julle naaiers
Fok julle, fok julle, fok julle naaiers
Fok julle naaiers, fok julle naaiers
Fok julle, fok julle, fok julle naaiers

[Verse 3: Ninja & Yolandi Visser]
Mothafuckas tell me to slow my roll, but sorry, no can do
My style is so brand new, I try to make you understand it
I'm here to steal the fuckin' show 'cause, baby, I'm a bandit
Now you standin', lookin' at me like the aliens have landed
(All hail the great white ninja)
Every puss with a phone wants to take my picture
"Ninja! Jas, I dig dat ou!"
Is it real? No, it's just a big black joke
When dealing with an idiot, there's really nothing you can say
Next time you ask me "Is it real?" I'm gonna punch you in the face
To help you feel me, bitch I get paid to be funky
But be nice or I'm gonna change to be ugly
I'm zef like a young Hugh Hef', oh yes
May my enemies live long so they can see me progress
Put the peddle to the metal and I'm scorching my tires
Middle finger in the air, yeah, fok Julle Naaiers

[Chorus: Yolandi Visser]
Fok julle naaiers, fok julle naaiers
Fok julle, fok julle, fok julle naaiers
Fok julle naaiers, fok julle naaiers
Fok julle, fok julle, fok julle naaiers
Fok julle naaiers, fok julle naaiers
Fok julle, fok julle, fok julle naaiers
Fok julle naaiers, fok julle naaiers
Fok julle, fok julle, fok julle naaiers

[Verse 1: Yolandi Vi$$er]
Yolandi-fokken-Visser all up in the place
Hosh pagamisa, raak fokken wys
Fuck crime, these days rhyme fuckin' pays
Fan myself with a milli while I laugh in your face

[Bridge: Ninja]
Yo, DJ Hi-Tek, where you at, my nigga?

[Intro]
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say "Sabotage"
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

[Bridge]
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Whoa, whoa-ah-oh

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa (She deserved it)
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

[Outro]
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are
(So much better, yeah?)
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say "Sabotage"

[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
"I'm so happy, you know um
You know I looked at the crowd and you know
I look at my fans, I look at their faces, they expressions
And I know that damn well, we are some partying mothafuckas"

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Tired of these rappers, tired of these jackers
I'm tired of these dances by these fucking backpackers
And I'm sick of all these hipsters, I'm sick of phony niggas
I'm stickin' to these bitches 'cause I'm sick of all these sisters
I'm sick and tired of tryna survive
I'm sick and tired of my environment
Sick and tired of feeling deprived
I'm one of a kind when in my climate
Sick and tired of your façade
And all of your lying and your diamonds
Basically, I'm tired of feelin' sick and tired
A$AP (A$AP) born in money-makin' Manhattan
Every nigga on my block wanna be a Main Attraktion
Shout my nigga Squadda, shout my nigga Mondre
If you disrespect them niggas then I'm polishin' the nine-trey
And I'm coming to your casa for your madre and your padre
Comprende? Most of these niggas been gay or they strange
They say I sound like Andre mixed with Kanye, little bit of Max
A little bit of Wiz, little bit of that, little bit of this, get off my dick

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket
I'm a down to Earth nigga, we could kick it
Take a hit with me, hit with me, uh
Take a hit with me, hit with me, uh
Ain't on stage, behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean
Chilling with my niggas, with my team
Won't you come and take a sip with me, sip with me? Yeah
Take a sip with me, sip with me, yeah

[Verse 2: Squadda B]
Ay, ay, ay, once again, Mr. Back Selling Crack
It's an honor keeping real nigga music on the map
Street raps, new face, sampling with no credits
Doubting myself 'cause I don't think the world can relate
To my surprise, everyone does, so have faith
Half of the other side don't live it, they push play
The young illest alive, Harlem World to the Bay
It feels good waking up to money in the bank
'Cause last year, it was shoebox and lint
I only write raps just to give you niggas hints
Every verse a gift, as you smoke like a chimney
My album coming November, that's twenty years of memory
And that's assuming I'ma live that long
If I don't, don't cry 'cause I ain't live that wrong
Just an artist in a purest form, I live that song
An artist in the purest form, I live that song, Bambino

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket
I'm a down to Earth nigga, we could kick it
Take a hit with me, hit with me, uh
Take a hit with me, hit with me, uh
Ain't on stage, behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean
Chilling with my niggas, with my team
Won't you come and take a sip with me, sip with me? Yeah
Take a sip with me, sip with me, yeah

[Verse 3: Mondre M.A.N]
Okay, hold up, ay, why fuss? I'd rather fuck
Treat her like my enemy, I just wanna bust
Seven deuce, waiting on the bus
Before them boys bend the corner tryna make a bust
Tryouts, I'm tryna make the bucks
Purple and the green got me on stuck
So I two-step, move my feet and keep it pushing
Always bouncin' back, gotta keep the cushion
And that's somethin' fat, like eating all the pudding
A$AP, we got a slap, bruh, good looking
Fuck that, A$AP where I come from
456, Ice City slums
Weed in my pocket, coke in his tongues
Buying Swisher Sweets, no more honey buns
Fresh white tee, bright like the sun
Only nigga 'round here rocking Мишка

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket
I'm a down to Earth nigga, we could kick it
Take a hit with me, hit with me, uh
Take a hit with me, hit with me, uh
Ain't on stage, behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean
Chilling with my niggas, with my team
Won't you come and take a sip with me, sip with me? Yeah
Take a sip with me, sip with me, yeah

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
"This go out to all the rappers, this go out to the little darlings
The little kids running around in the schoolyards, I love you
Keep it good, keep it good kids cause you know I love you
I'mma always love you, forever"

[Intro: Sway]
DJ Wonder
We gon' rock at least 5 beats, to show your versatility
What you're made of
You gotta rock 5 back, aiight?
Here we go. Childish Gambino, let's go

[Verse 1]
As the world's turnin', I feel like I'm a worse person
My tongue's hurtin', from all of its work cursin'
And I'm not certain I think my father's Lavar Burton
'Til I'm walkin' in circles and I'm talkin' in third person
In the eighth grade I got high off paper maché
I put it in my desk and I let it ferment a day
Cause shit, ain't nothin' changed
I'm still known as a rude student
That'll walk inside your class and make fun of your school shootin'
I can prove it
I'm too cool as a matter of fact
I've been writin' these verses while I'm havin' a heart attack
I'm in your bedroom, crankin' No Doubt and Staring Back
Stereo blaring, Gwen Stefani can holla black
I'm not black, I'm a white boy with dark skin
At a Klan rally, wondering why they won't let me in
I'm drunk off this gin and I'm high off Ritalin
Fuck it, let me get to the next beat

[Verse 2]
I'm the nerdiest rapper ever
I'm wearing a Cosby sweater
And reading Oscar Wilde
Ripping my foreskin to make a washable condom
A bunch of assassins tried to jump me
They couldn't touch me
I rolled off in a yellow Humvee with a bunch of monkeys
My taste buds hate fudge, man
Plus I'm allergic
I'mma dress up like a surgeon so I could hurt Curtis on purpose
And girls see my dick size and they realize
That they can't handle it
I get more sodomy than Tommy Lee and Pam... Anderson?
With my du-rag in my left hand
And my iPod and my diskman
I get more kicks out of it than Jean Claude Van Damm
And I'm still spittin', I'm still hittin'
Big pimpin' like Hova
Yo, let me be the rap...run over
Yea, lemme go, lemme go

[Verse 3]
Childish Gambino, yo this off the dome
I gotta keep it goin' cause I came from home
Come from Rome, Athens
Or Atlanta, Georgia
Got somethin' for ya
Yes I got some s'mores cause I'll boil you
Like I got that Goya
You know how they play Reggaeton in the beats
When you in NYC
Meaning that me and I'm sickest
Yo, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters Like Ickis
Yo, this chick that I used to lick it
Now her name Aubrey Plaza
I didn't mean to kick it while I'm gettin' salsa
Like I'm eatin' salsa, cause she Puerto Rican
Some people speakin' like she ain't white
But you know that's alright 'cause I keep it tight

[Verse 4]
Nerdy word murderer in a purple convertiber
Niggas ain't heard of him until his girlfriend converted him
Bitch niggas is Ferguson, I guess I could explain it all
Like all these niggas wanna bone cause you datin' dogs
Or why the radio used to not play me
And why does every white girl love ukelele?
Where I'm from, the Jesus piece couldn't save me
And I'm still spittin' shit cause I'm gettin' like gravy
Eatin' like mashed potatoes, I hate those
Haters who say that I'm not black enough
Yo, you ain't wack enough to fuckin' touch my MC mic
You better keep it tight
Eat a dick like you starvin' homie

[Verse 5]
Yo, on this last beat I'mma goner
Gotta spit over somethin' hard, like Nirvana
And I'm crazy
With the beat when it comes to this spittin' it
Shittin' it, while I'm lickin' it
I ain't even need to get it
Man these other unC's, they need to get it
Why this LL Cool J shit
Yo I got pesos and mesos
Meaning I can only hack with they ghost
When they go there, when I go back
And I'm still that, I ain't backpack
But you know, with the fuck the rest
Yo they say that is lame like Johnye West
Or Kanye West
But I ain't Kanye West
I'm just tryin' to stay the truth
And I ain't tryin' to spit the truth
Yo, I do what I gotta do in a booth with Sway
Shay45 all day, y'all know what I'm sayin'

[Verse 1]
Sick boys don't die, they fresh to death
My shoes bright blue, so you watch my step
My hoody hot pink with the hat to match
So you ain't gotta know where my paper at
Pop tags cause I'm filthy, apes can bathe me
My home is the dirty but I shine like crazy
My hat tag up and it hang off slightly
My game 8-bit so you niggas can bite me
Nike like me cause my life is great
I'm married to the game, we should consummate
Brand new hoodies the color of light sabers
My name ain't Luke, but that dude date Leias
With fly ass sneakers
Bump them speakers
Pump this groove 'til your ear start bleedin'
White girls shake it 'til the black dudes notice
Black girls shake it so you can regain focus

[Chorus]
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out

[Verse 2]
Let's get one thing straight, I'm no average rapper
Born in SoCal, then I hit Atlanta
Then to New York, I'm an army brat
And I learn new things all across the map
In Cali, I was small taught need to be strong
And Atlanta had the hawk so I learned how to ball
New York had Starks on the New York Knicks
So when they came around I had my first round pick
And now I'm so sick that they call me Ebola
Sick girls all on my pole like totem
Life is a gamble, your boy done told 'em
Play your cards right like it's Texas hold 'em
Bounce dem shoulders, go ahead Bankhead
I can do it better even though I'm Stone Mountain
Georgia's on my mind, but I live in New York
So I got a Southern drawl and I limp when I walk
They used to say a nigga lame when I started to rap
Now them fake fuck niggas askin' me for a track
Pokin' me on Facebook tryna be my friend
Nigga, you get your face took you ask me one more 'gain
I'm a G that's why call the shit Gmail man
This is my space nigga, you can't make top ten

[Chorus]
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out

[Intro]
This that, fire!

[Verse 1]
It's your man Bambino, Sick Boi thriller
King of fly rappers, there ain't none iller
I'm into fly sneakers, colors like Gullies
So if you don't know me by now: "You's a dummy"
It's the Sick Boi anthem, girls take your coats off
Get the champagne, pop the cork like Sosa
Make some mimosas, get like me
Spanish girls holla say, "Aye papi"
Ooh la la, on the French Riviera
These other boys sandals, straight club benders
We some go-getters, you should know better
Your girl think 'bout me while she drivin' a Jetta
Used to blast Kelly Clarkson, now she a sick girl
Hot pink shirt and them lime green sneakers
Take a quick picture, put me on blast
Call the fireman, he need to come fast, I'm on

[Hook]
Fire (I'm on fire, fire)
Fire (I'm on fire, fire)
This that, fire! (I'm on fire, fire)
Fire (I'm on fire, fire)
Fire (I'm on fire, fire)
Fire (I'm on fire, fire)
This that, fire! (I'm on fire, fire)
Fire (I'm on fire, fire)

[Verse 2]
They call me Sick Boi 'cause they know I'm so sick
Purple on my starter cap, yellow on my kicks
Haters talkin' shit, they think they so slick
And if you don't like my style: "Eat a dick"
I'm a younger Denzel, say it ain't so
I'm all puffed up like I'm made of Afros
But my neck ain't froze, where's the boy's jewelry?
Don't need it nigga, clothes bright, shine beautifully
Used to sport Airs then I had to get Grind
Now I look great, now I'm top of the line
Used to go hungry when I'd buy them new shoes
Now I'm like "Mm..food" like MF Doom
Busy makin' moves like my name was Tetris
Money in the bank, you can check my mattress
Bright like Mantis and I ain't selfish
I got the game shook like a young black Elvis

[Hook]
Fire (I'm on fire, fire)
Fire (I'm on fire, fire)
This that, fire! (I'm on fire, fire)
Fire (I'm on fire, fire)
Fire (I'm on fire, fire)
Fire (I'm on fire, fire)
This that, fire! (I'm on fire, fire)
Fire (I'm on fire, fire)

[Outro]
This that, fire!
This that, fire!
This that, fire!
This that, fire!
This that, fire!
This that, fire!
This that, fire!
This that, fire!
This that, fire!

[Verse 1]
Is it really that bad that my clothes is tight?
That I hydrate babes like Pedialyte
That I stay rock hard like a meteorite
Thought your homeboy here was an idiot right?
Well, ya thought wrong, I got flavor
I rock shows with the blue lightsaber
I hit dimes but also date eighters
I make moves, blow up like Al-Qaeda
I'm in kicks that you can't buy yet
Ya kicks okay like your name Wyatt
Care Bear Clockers, pink highlighters
Haters wanna snatch my heat like firefighters
Boys out there think they just like me
Naw naw, y'all funny, y'all from UCB?
Y'all standin' in line, I'm in VIP
Y'all know shit 'bout me like TIP, hah!

[Hook]
Ooh, bum bumbumbum bum bumbumbum

[Verse 2: MC Chris]
Think your voice's funny man, that's kind of hilarious
I'm the rapper makin' noise when there's shadow in your area
I’m like a damager cause I’m a little loquacious
I do it for the hotties with the bodies bodacious
I'm high pitched, might flip if ya diss my node
Think Chris ain't the shit, you can kiss my chode
Weak ass sales, not too early to boast
Seriously bro, hand over the security code
Because my rhymes so fresh, greengrocers' gotta spray 'em
Fired all my lawyers cause I didn't wanna pay 'em
From the PM to the AM I'll slay 'em with the sawed-off
Make a little money and I'll smoke the marijuana
MC without Glover is Murtaugh without Riggs
Jam and peanut butter with the crust cut off for kids
One smokes Kinds, the other smokes Mids
Let's mix it up a little like the DJ did
Bacardi and Coke, black and white cookie
Smokin' in the alley cause you know we're playin' hooky
We're up to no good, please don't tell our mamas
Don't mock us 

[?] 'cause we got this for Obama

[Hook]
Ooh, bum bumbumbum bum bumbumbum

[Verse 3]
Sicker than Old Yeller, money like bank tellers
The chicks that I'm with are thicker than Nutella
Y'all need to switch quick and get with a sick fella
Cause I'm bout to go Rihanna like I'm an Umbrella
Come over to my place, we can cut like shears
And make some mistakes like Jamie Lynn Spears
I'm nasty? No. Forward? Yes
I'm hip to the game, you're a rook like chess
My money so long that they call it John Silver's
Your money so light that it fluff like pillows
Boutique killers, you can see
They close up shop when the clerks see me
I'm not Kanye, but my collar's popped
Cause the bro's like soda, I shit you not
This shit's bright orange, Fanta shade
You got the yellow face, that's my lemonade
I'ma try to stay tight like girls that fuck hard
Stay in the Bay with green like Brett Farve

[Hook]
Ooh, bum bumbumbum bum bumbumbum
Ooh, bum bumbumbum bum bumbumbum
Ooh, bum bumbumbum bum bumbumbum

[Intro]
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Damn shawty, look at you
I'm saying man, is it just me
Or do you have too much ass in them jeans?
Come here

[Verse 1]
Ay, I been watching you awhile now
And I just wanna find a way to make you smile now
Why you blushing?
Forget about them other guys now
I know you ain't going try and tell me that you shy now
I realize that your beauty could intimidate
Them suckers you ain't got no business wit'em anyway
Wit such a pretty face, big booty, little waist line
I wanna grind from behind to the baseline
Have a great time, pour yourself a shot girl
Chase it with a lime, now you feeling like a hot girl
I know you probably use to dealing with them wannabes
But honestly I gotta say I'm who they wanna be
I promise all I wanna see is you up under me
And we can disappear whenever, when you wanna leave?
I can guarantee the ride of your life
Any fantasies on your mind we can try'em tonight

[Hook]
We're sittin here
(I'm lookin at you like damn)
We're sippin on Patrãn, something's on my mind
(You wanna leave wit me tonight?)
It's been Killing me all night long and I wonder
(Listen shawty let me tell you what I'm thinkin bout)
Oh girl, I wonder
(For real, shawty let me tell you what I'm thinkin bout)
It's the end of the night
I thinkin your might, wanna leave the bar
Park the car, turn into porn star

[Verse 2]
Yes, I love to hear about your interest
I gotta say your intellect got me impressed
See your panties through your dress like a silhouette
Patrãn got me thinkin sex, is you feeling that?
No disrespect though, a simple yes/no
Hey let yourself let go, shawty let's go
Pull up to the crib, get you through the threshold
Kiss you from your pretty lips to your red toes
Time tickin it's the end of the night
And you can leave wit your friend if you like
But I'm saying though
We can ride out, back to my house
I wanna see you satisfied inside out
Once I'm in you ain't gonna want me to slide out
You tell your girlfriends they gonna wanna try it out
A little more of this will loosen you up
What we can't do in the club, we can do in the truck

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey would ya, stay?
Could ya play wit it with your tongue just a little?
You're such a sexy individual, physical and mental
And if you sentimental
Shouldn't the rules bend a little
Let me start at the top, stop in the middle
Use a popsicle make shiver, giggle when it tickle
I can talk to you dirty if you like that
I finish once, hit a blunt, start right back
I know you told me you a good girl
But shawty you a grown woman not a little girl
You can blame it on the Patrãn or the champagne
But sometimes being bad can be a good thing, ya now

[Hook - Repeat 2x]

Jumped out my bed and I head downstairs
Wiped the boogers out my eyes. put some braids in my hair
Grabbed my favorite toothbrush and then some crest
Rinse my mouth out, now I'm ready for the rest
Break it down, roll it up, pass if you've had enough

Have a seat, have a drink, now rest your feet
See that's the problem, you think that you can go with me?
Smoking cest your whole life, now you wanna blow with me
Go to the store with me and get some swishy sweet
And grab a bite to eat before you fall out

And that's a promise cuh, we got the bombest bud
And you can ask Ray J, he knows what time it was

Your friends turn to enemies (Yup)
Then enemies smile in your face (Ha)
And then try to infiltrate (What?)
It's all 'cause I entertain (Ha)
But still, it's quite entertaining (Yuh)
To see all these niggas' faces (Yuh)
They call me B.O.B now (Yuh)
But back then, I couldn't make it (Yuh)
They say that I came up
And I failed out of class (What's up)
But it worked out both ways
'Cause they ain't gotta see my Black ass (Ha)
So I grew up in the cul-de-sac
Where the coke and dro is at
Staying strapped and loaded, man
That's all they s'posed to know about
That's why I stay paranoid
'Cause these niggas hating now
So I keep my middle finger up until I make it out

[Hook: B.o.B & Boosie Badazz]

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Now, yesterday (Ooh), me and my dawg got loaded
Cracked a joke on my dawg, my dawg exploded
"Nigga, you changing!" Boy, you meant that
Where the love done went at?
Can't stand to see a nigga shining
Now, you under-eyeing the clique
Hate to see a nigga smile and laugh—fuck you
Hate to see me signing autographs—fuck you
All I need (All I need) is my voice and some fire weed
I don't owe a nigga shit
And I don't ask for you to ride my dick
How I'm gon' change? All I know is the streets
It's a lot of gutters on my street and a lot of gutter in me
Don't speak at me, don't wave, ain't no "Hip Hop Hooray"
By the way—suck a dick, you got some garbage-ass ways

[Hook: B.o.B]

[Verse 3: DG Yola]
Ugh, ugh, let me speak up so everyone can hear me
I ain't never had nothing, so you all should fear me
Young, wild, and ruthless, consider me grown
Every man for himself, and to each his own, huh
And ever since I made a statement, you bastards couldn't take it
That's a shame, look at how they obligating
Hating, steadily plotting, and wishing for Lil DG's position
They just blinded by the lights, ain't paying attention
To how I struggled with the hard, the green, and the soft
And how I learned to pay the cost to be the boss
You got people that follow people, screaming they need help
But I don't need nobody but my goddamn self, nigga

[Hook: B.o.B]
They say that I'm changing
'Cause I'm getting famous
Fuck you
Fuck you

This the I'ma Boss Remix
Meek Milly
Let's go!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm ride or die as I'm ridin' by, holla Westside right inside of my
Bimmer 760i, try me let off sixty shots
Again we got the city hot and popping like it ‘posed to be
Hoes who not ménaging got no business standing close to me
So cold, a ferocious G, niggas ain't as dope as me
Mind your fuckin' business, watch your mouth when you approachin' me
I fuck with hoes who fuck with hoes, do pills and powder socially
I like 'em, I don't love ‘em though, cold heart emotionally
Captain where the ocean is, riding in the Ghost again
Slap you with a lot of spit until she swallow all of it
Call the shots, run the shit, on some big money shit
Serious 'bout my hustle all these cowards on that funny shit
Rapping 'bout a bunch of shit and you ain't even done it yet
You the one they gunning at, how I'm ‘posed to honor that?
You all talk dawg, flaw and I ain't having none of that
I'm big boss dawg, floss all day and run it back

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Bitch, I'm a boss
Bitch, I'm a boss! Bitch, I'm a boss!
I play the shots, I call the calls
We in this bitch, it’s going down
Yeah, I'm the king, now where my muhfucking crown?

[Post-Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
You a boss, she a boss, you don't care what it cost
You just buy that motherfucker and you throw that shit on
You be popping them tags, we just throw it in bags
And then we hit the fucking block, we be droppin' them rags

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Started with a dollar, turn it to a M
Used to ride Impala, turn it to a Benz
Niggas used to hate me, turn into my friends
You should see how people treat you when that money coming in
Bad bitches calling cause I'm balling
And these niggas hatin' on me cause they starving
And I'm parking Aston Martins where they walking, these niggas ain't important
They informants really talking when the people get to honking
I'm a boss, really, Nino or Al Pacino
Hundred racks on this Rollie, it light up like a casino
Niggas really be fraud, I’ma keep it a C-note
Got shooters down in Miami, they throw it like Dan Marino

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Had a couple seizures, call 'em minor setbacks
Everybody praying for me, I respect that
Woke up in the hospital, where my checks at
Then I put eight chains, where my neck's at
Hopping in the Ghost, I feel I'm dead set
Worth 40 M's so respect that
I put all my jewels on just to bone your chick
You know the boss well known for leavin' bonuses
We making money, may it marinate
When the work clean, cut it like it’s carrot cake
D-boys love the way I narrate
I still whip it like it's Anna Mae
Remember Momma had a Cavalier
Now she living like a Cleveland Cavalier
Better check the stats, we fillin' arenas
And I got the gats, Gilbert Arenas

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Bitch, I'm a boss
Bitch, I'm a boss! Bitch, I'm a boss!
I play the shots, I call the calls
We in this bitch, it’s going down
Yeah, I'm the king, now where my muhfucking crown?

[Post-Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
You a boss, you a boss
7-5-7, showers on it
Spend about thirteen hours on it
757 with the showers on it
We spent about thirteen hours on it

[Verse 4: Lil' Wayne]
Look, I be probably on my skateboard, tryna learn a new trick
I just fucked an Avatar, now I got a blue dick
Money talks, bullshit walks if the shoe fit
You pushing up daisies, daffodils, tulips
I'm in my zone, I'm Angie Stoned
I point the pistol at you like a camera phone
I'm Young Money, Cash Money, I'm not human
I’m tryna get money, money like Mark Cuban
If she don't respect me, she gon' respect this dick
The world is an asshole and we the next big shit
Damn right I gang bang, tell 'em blood up slime
Fuck! I had to say fuck one time, get it

[Verse 5: Birdman]
When I came up in this bitch I was shining every summer
Took the whole thing, the young nigga doing numbers
Tote two nines, bitch, iced out stunting
Candy on the Ave, candy on the slab
Hundred Gs nigga, Cash Money millionaires
Hundred mil nigga, how we flipped it off the ave
Blood rich gang, you know we filthy nigga
The money do swang, behind a killer nigga
Catch me uptown putting it down
Moving all around, new fleets with my round
Touch another town, putting it all down
Pop a hundred bottles bitch, we wear the crown

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Bitch, I'm a boss
Bitch, I'm a boss! Bitch, I'm a boss!
I play the shots, I call the calls
We in this bitch, it’s going down
Yeah, I'm the king, now where my muhfucking crown?

[Post-Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
You a boss, you a boss
7-5-7 showers on it
Spend about thirteen hours on it
757 with the showers on it
We spent about thirteen hours on it

[Intro]
It's okay
Tomorrow'll be a better day
When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day

[Verse 1]
We all came in the world with a sparkle in our eye
Not knowing the only thing that we was promise is to die
But a promise is a lie can't nobody guarantee it
Cuz death around the corner can't nobody damn see it
I can't agree that God good at all time
But we all know shit ain't all good at all time
So I tote my strap in the hood at all time
Cuz respect ain't just something that's understood in our time
Especially by our kind man I hate it for the future
Police don't wanna lock ya up no more they wanna shoot ya
Ain't as half as bad as these hatas'll do ya
As soon as ya get ya loot up, ya body they wanna shoot up
Lord forbid they kill me I bet ya nobody knew what
But suckas get shot and polices come straight to us
Imagine how they do us ever since niggas blew up
I know ya goin through it know I'm goin through it too bruh

[Hook 1]
When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day

When ya daughter like 6 and her pops ain't shit
You don't wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day

[Verse 2]
I'm doin this for the hood, the kid wit no dad
I was just like ya'll don't feel so bad
Know it's hard when ya live so bad
They whoop ya ass and they wonder why ya still so bad
For long ya get whoopin's and just laugh
Momma washin' clothes find lil' blue bag
She ask what ya what ya doin ya tell her stuntin' like my daddy
You knew that I was gonna be a hustla when ya had me
Look around ma you sent me to the sto' to get some bread
And I'm passin' at least 8 J's or mo'
Ya know the rent been late for 8 days or mo'
But slangin' blow a better hazard than 8 days of snow

[Hook 2]
When ya speeding wit the white and ya see the blue lights
And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day
If ya son 14 and stand for a criminal
Hard to realize it Baby girl but God witcha
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day

[Verse 3]
My momma girl son 14 just got killed
Had to catch myself
Bout to tell her I know how ya feel
I'd been a damn liar
See her tryin not to cry
She know he in a better place
But she just wanna know why
Know somebody touch mine
And a nigga gon' die
It's goin down
I did tell her to calm down
I tried to convince her that he in God's arms now
She said I don't believe that there's a God right now
I know its hard right now and ya heart's light now
But God give new beginnings you can start right now
I know you're scarred right now cuz you apart right now
But shit he in better shape than we are right now

[Hook 1]
When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day
When ya daughter like 6 and her pops ain't shit
You ain't wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day

When ya speeding wit the white and ya see the blue lights
And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day

If ya son 14 and just died a folk criminal
Hard to realize it Baby girl but God witcha
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day

[Verse 1]
Weren't you the one that said that you don't want me anymore
And how you need your space and give the keys back to your door
And how I cried and tried and tried to make you stay with me
But still you said that love was gone and that I had to leave

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you, talkin' 'bout a family
Now you, saying I complete your dream
Now you, saying I'm your everything
You're confusing me
What you say to me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Chorus]
'Cause what goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back

[Post-Chorus]
I remember when
I was sittin' home alone
Waitin' for you
Til three o'clock in the morn'

[Verse 2]
And when you came home, you'd always have some sorry excuse
And explaining to me, like I'm just some kind of a fool
I sacrificed the things I want just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me, you never come through

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you, wanna be a part of me (Ayy)
Now you, have so much to say to me (Hey)
Now you, wanna make time for me
What you doin' to me?
You're confusing me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Chorus]
'Cause what goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back

[Post-Chorus]
I remember when
I was sittin' home alone
Waiting for you
Til three o'clock in the morn

[Bridge]
Night after night
Knowing something going on
Wasn't home before me
You was, you was gone
Lord knows it wasn't easy, believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceived me
And never do what you was supposed to do
No need to approach me, boo, 'cause I'm over you

[Chorus]
'Cause what goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
Gotta stop tryin' to come back to me
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down

[Outro]
It's called Karma, baby
And it goes around
What goes around comes around
What goes up must comes down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm obnoxious, I'm flowing crazy, I need to stop this
Don't knock this, you niggas lazy ya'll need to watch this
Preposterous if you can fathom how you can block this
My phantom was seen on Candler, you ride the transit
No options you niggas can't act like ya'll forgot this
I'm tired but switch ya flow up, it's so monotonous
It's my metropolis, I'll drop a 12 on ya so colossus
My swag plus my drop top yellow jag why they gossip
I'm the nigga upload your twitter, bitch I'm the topic
Profess it but Gucci didn't graduate from college
Your girlfriend says my ear rings are erotic
My lambo doors open upward they're robotic
It's Gucci

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
Birds in the living room, it's like Atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks, crocs, and gators for my shoes
Monkey niggas in my hood, I'm living in the zoo
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too
I'm a tiger in the bedroom, ask your baby boo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo (gucci)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Drop beam, off set things, color ice cream
White dreams, she can fuck me, that's a pipe dream
X-O, poppin' x-pills so exciting
My ex chick and ex homeboy uninvited
Cases of Ace of Spade, bitch getcha wasted
The waitress, I made her reload it like the Matrix
I lean laid with a bad bitch Black and Asian
On 20, headed to Buckhead, I'm racing baby
But take that fake jewelry off, that shit is fugazi
You think that you're hotter than the kid you're mistaken
Real and you niggas really really good at fakin'
So trill, I'mma keep it real, I'm back to the basics

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
Birds in the living room, it's like Atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks, crocs, and gators for my shoes
Monkey niggas in my hood, I'm living in the zoo
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too
I'm a tiger in the bedroom, ask your baby boo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo (gucci)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Heads up, my partner stashin' bricks up on his roof top
Whole key, half a key, quarter key
Gucci got more quarters than a motherfuckin' juke box
Pop-pop hear the Glock cock, and I gotta Colt 45 like Billy D
Semi automatic that I keep up in the attic and a shank that shape like Tennessee (ugh!)
I cut ya, I cut ya to the white meat
And my partner pushin' more crack than a bike seat
I smoke the best, I get my dro from California
Get high and go to sleep you couldn't wake me from a coma
I might wake up if these rappers got beef I smell the aroma
But these niggas ain't got no heart not even if they had a donor
I roam the streets, so who the fuck is you?
Southside, Collipark, king of the jungle
My name is Ludacris, living in Atlanta zoo

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
Birds in the living room, it's like Atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks, crocs, and gators for my shoes
Monkey niggas in my hood, I'm living in the zoo
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too
I'm a tiger in the bedroom, ask your baby boo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo (gucci)

[Verse 1]
Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all
But you never give
Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open? (Ooh-ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
(Ooh-ooh) You tossed it in the trash, you did
(Ooh-ooh) To give me all your love is all I ever ask 'cause

[Chorus]
What you don't understand is I'd catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

[Interlude]
No, no, no, no, oh-oh-oh
Uh

[Verse 2]
Black, black, black and blue
Beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said, "Hey"
When you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman
That's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face
Then rip the brakes out my car (Ooh-ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
(Ooh-ooh) You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did
(Ooh-ooh) To give me all your love is all I ever ask 'cause

[Chorus]
What you don't understand is I'd catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

[Bridge]
(No) If my body was on fire
(No) Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
(No) You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby

[Chorus]
But, darlin', I'd still catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I would go through all this pain, ha
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

[Outro]
No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Ooh, you'd never do the same
No, no, no, no, oh-oh-oh

I sell out arenas, I call that getting dome
Million dollar voice, came through phone
We heading to the top, if you coming, come on
I’m flying out to Pisa, just to get some pizza
Fly down to Jamaica, just to roll some reefer
Sex on the beach, left love speechless
They say that money talk, tell these other niggas speak up

You know what I like, now get it right

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Yeah
So much sound like dirt today
Turn on the radio and it make you thirst away
Like a dumb bitch lookin' for nerds today
Or like good food, dig in ya' purse to pay
Sometime it make me so sad like the worst of days
It's in the street makin' cats where the earth decays
Then I seen a little black boy with a shirt that say
Don't you miss the fucking classics like purple rain
You need something to cool you off
Man, my beat like a bitch because you and your car
It shine bright like the night and the moon and the stars
And I wake up and make more by noon tomorrow
Now, the critics ask will we be dumbing it down
Says N.E.R.D. is not coming around
What, sit and watch who you summin the sound
If I catch you when I see you I'm gunnin' it down
Because

[Hook]
I am the laser gun carryin

[Verse 2: Shay]
What did you expect, it's the reemergence
Loosin ya neck, shorty get to jerkin'
You rockin with the best, and that's for certain
It's almost like your ears are now virgin
Ready fresh, wet for insertion
It's like your first time with insurgen
Except you're screwed you're locked, you're sippin syrup
Now mami, close your eyes
Like curtains
Look who coolin it off
We be tearin down show for the moon tomorrow
Stay in the future, what you think you they can rule tomorrow
That's like Larry Bird came and just schooled Jabaar
You should be happy, that should be news to yall
Like a little boy hearin no school tomorrow
That's the point, ain't no beatin or runnin around
Violate me when I see you, I'm gunnin it down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
I am a product of flex
A product of clue
A product of Interscope
A product of you
A product of my parents, my little brother too
A product of cam
A product of ganoo
So the beat gotta be like stealth in dark
I mean, the beat gotta knock ya helmet off
Knock you crab ass niggas who's shells is soft
Show you're pussy and you only do well in talk
I kill pussy, kill beats, kill real word
I can't decide, am I Lucas or Spielberg
They pay a night to see me, a night to TV cause I'm bright like the finger that lights on E.T
In a flash a sonny went down
Didn't want to see it but you confrontin' it now
Draw your mind in the sand til you done in the ground
And if a nigga step across me I'm gunnin' it down
And tell em

[Hook]

Ayy, we can buy the whole bar, but when the club close off

You know what I told y'all, we pull up, your clothes off
Pussy fill the whole house, they tripping? Drop them hoes off
'Kay, no panty, no bra, no shoes, no socks
See how cute your toes are, it going good so far
They tripping, stripping, going in, drinking, smoking, rolling
Pussy wet as oceans, spray treys, ayy, put your nose in
First round, going down, pop another go again
Panties to the floor again, fuck her 'til she sore again
Pimping in motion, all sex and no emotion
I don't love nann one of you, I fuck who's ever closest
We be on that grown shit, that gangster Al Capone shit
You know what you gon' get: strong, bad, long dick
You say, "No", that's the wrong shit, that won't get you home with

Doggystyle splash, arch your back up, girl, holla back
We off up in the club, ain’t too much that we can do in here
But pop a couple bottles and see who I wanna screw in here
I’m riding Bentley Coupe tonight, I can’t fit none but two in here
Your girl was on that Red Bull, I think that broad flew in here
Bubblegum game, tell that chick I want some chewing here
If all these broads strip in here, I might just find my boo in here
I'ma leave from the club, show up at the house
Pink Rosé, shawty want it in her mouth
I'ma show her what I’m 'bout
When I push shawty head down south
Tell her, "Go 'head, blow a nigga out"
I’m showin' out, watchin' my behavior, I got flavor
The sex I have, I'm always wakin' up my neighbor ("Ahh! Ahh!")
And every time I see them hoes, I shock 'em like a taser
And when I leave the club, only dick is what I gave her, Dro

[Intro: Ab-Soul]
My nigga, what it look like?

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Niggas hatin', bitches hatin', babies dyin'
Bullets flyin', helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
Genocism, criticism, unemployment, racism
Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killin' no cure
Oil spillin', turmoil, poverty-stricken, police brutality
Kickin' ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan
Not to mention another prison, child molesting
Cow intestines, Botox injections, earthquakes that's government tested
Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
Then turn to crack then invested amongst us Blacks just a message
To hold us back, great depression amongst Iraq, no direction no Google map
Just a Tec for the soo-woop swerving, izuzu then blap blap blap
Adolescents go coocoo, mothers are boohoo crying
The governor keeps us starvin', these commercials keep us buyin'
These cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph
Distincted livin' with science, no place to live in, no Zion
See that's forbidden, we fryin'
My nigga, what it look like?
That's exactly what Hell look like

[Chorus: Alori Joh]
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up!
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up!

[Interlude: Ab-Soul]
My nigga, what it look like?

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Malcolm laughing, Martin laughing, Biggie spittin'
Pac is rapping, Gregory tappin', people singing, bells is ringing
Children playing, angels praying, 14 karat golden streets, collard greens
Red wine, potato yams, turkey legs, calling every human being...
Woo ah ha

I respect women when I'm on a date
I'll take 'em to the park or maybe the museum
And I only try to kiss 'em if they're ready
Whoo hoo what what what a what a say what what

Help out your mom and dad by gettin' a job
So you can help pay for school supplies
A whoo hoo say ho

Wipe your shoes on the mat when you come in the house
Someone just cleaned that floor
A whoo hoo say what what
Ha ha

[Chorus]
I can't come down
Not today, I feel alright
They believe every word I say
And it seems so jaded
Every place I go, it feels so jaded
There's people all around, but I'm all alone

[Verse 1]
The clock in my head won't stop ticking, ticking
The phone in my hand rings all day long
I've been in L.A. almost five months now
I try to pretend that it feels like home
Oh, oh
Maybe I flew too far
Shooting stars leave no mark

[Chorus]
I can't come down
Not today, I feel alright
They believe every word I say
It seems so jaded
Every place I go, it feels so jaded
There's people all around but I'm all alone

[Verse 2]
I know my dad only got a few years now
He's gon' cry when he hears this song
And things with mom have become so weird now
I gotta book hotels for my Detroit shows
(Oh, oh)
Maybe I flew too far
Shooting stars leave no mark

[Chorus]
I can't come down
Not today, I feel alright
They believe every word I say
And it seems so jaded
Every place I go, it feels so jaded
There's people all around but I'm all alone

Comin' to you live at Shade 45 Invasion
The only radio station that plays in rotation
The Shady the slash with the Aftermath with the little Jay on occasion
Maybe you may hear some Jada mixed with a plate of some D Block
Splash of 2Pac

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Pass the mothafuckin' Swisher, pour some mothafuckin' liquor
For my mothafuckin' niggas who ain't wit us, keep it trilla'
My gold teeth, my french braids, getting throwed since 10th grade
Wealth is in the mind, not the pocket, if that's the case, then I been paid
Herringbone chain, my gold frames, my Cartiers, you small change
You bitch made, I'm old school, like gem stars and switchblades
I spit game, I get paid, a pimp game
I be, I be that pretty muthafucka, A$AP is just my nickname
(I'm comin' down when I'm tippin' on them 4's
Cause we shittin' on these, shittin' on these niggas and these hoes)
Cause that purp shit I sip up, your bitch chose, you slipped up
I get-get my dick licked, I'm draped out, drip-dripped up
Top of the top of the line, all on my grind, purple be easin' my mind
We runnin', we runnin', we gunnin', we gunnin', we're gonna hit one at a time, time
Them bad bitches blow kisses by my earlobe
A weirdo but I'm real though

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvyy]
All these boppers wanna bop 'em, niggas wanna jock 'em
Not a red light or a city cop that can stop 'em
Going broke is not an option, always on that cash flow
She used to call me asshole, now she drop that ass low
Fuck it man I'm past dope, sour diesel slash coke
A$AP we the last hope, fuck it this my fast flow
I slow it down I pick it up, blue jeans I rip 'em up
That's swag bitch, you mad bitch, see you in my past bitch
I'm headed to the future, Twelvyy ain't no loser
Mixing up that syrup, call it Punky Brewster
I'm slurring wussup, don't tell me to shut up
I ain't tryna start shit, but man I'm really fucked up
I lucked up, I see it as a come up
I'm on my job man, I see you when the sun's up
Huh, young niggas run everything
A$AP to the top and these bitches love everything

[Verse 3: A$AP Nast]
God bless America, my flow is scarier
Style wild like my nigga Common after Erykah
Your bitch, I'm in bed with her, head so good
Make a nigga feel good to the point I wanna marry her
But I be on my pimping shit, check out my limp and shit
I be getting money, getting money, can you dig it, bitch?
Hoes get on my pimping ship all aboard, all aboard
East coast mothafuckas making all the noise, all the noise
I know you niggas heard of us, Raf Simon murderers
Fashion killa' word to Bigga Bars, I never heard of ya
Still sipping candy painted whips is what I'm sitting in
Kitchen chemist whipping up that shit that get these bitches in
New York Nasty flow, that's a little bit of crack mixed in with a fifth of Hen
Businessman, middle finger to your fucking business, man
Great adventure shit, rollercoasting take a flick of this
Motion picture shit, bitch I grind like a skater do
Always strive and prosper, Rock what level we gon' take it to?

[Intro]
Daddy no!

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Nigga bring the high hat in

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Jasper Dolphin]
Nigga bring the high hat in

[Verse 3: Jasper Dolphin]
Oh, nigga take the high hat out
Put your dick in, take the high hat out
Put your hat hat all up in my damn mouth
Take the high hat out now we headed down south
We headed up north with them horses
Eatin' hay 'cause we ain't got Porsches
We don't do nothin' but this
All up in your granny tub eatin' grits
In the kitchen

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Nigga I'm crippin'
Don't ask me what I'm doin' if I'm limpin'
That mean that cripple is simple

Bitch with the weave, come over here (Uh)
Bitches with real hair gotta go (Ah)
If you ain't wearin' fake shit from the swap meet
Bitch you ain't gettin' on the floor

You on your period? (Yeah)
Bitch I'm serious (oh)

[Verse 1]
Chilling at the house on a couch with the box crayons and a line of cocaine
My nose is on fire like a button with propane, it's dripping all red of old gangs
And now you've seen your stars and your face numb like a funny bone cupping at ice
And your nose white like your head's covered in lice
But we both dazed, and I think I found my wife

[Hook]
Dazed and Amazed and I'm dazed and I'm blown
Dazed and Amazed and I'm dazed and I'm gone
Dazed and Amazed and I'm dazed and I'm home

[Verse 2]
Chilling at the house on the couch, nose white
Mind is travelling, thoughts is mental
I'm trying to get into your pus just like a pimple
And I wait for the Cat in the Hat to pop through the window
The opium is in slow
Thin Though
Put My Brim Low
Let the lights dim low

[Verse 1: Taco]
I tell these bitches to eat my dick
They say no cause that will hurt your dick
I say ok, well I accept this
Get out this shit this ain't no reelection

[Hook]
This nigga ain't funny at all
This nigga don't be at the mall
This nigga ain't funny at all
This nigga don't be at the mall

They say I smell like ham

They say I smell like ham

[Brisco]
The definition: I'm clutchin' on my slippin in
The way I'm feelin' right now, a bitch could get the business
Just know my niggas squeeze on side
Only problem is we doin this head knock
I told Ross, "we gon show em how the Gutta do"
All black skis, black ones and the jumpsuit
Silde in the silder in and out night vision
Scopes on the AR to hit em with precision
And did I mention this one here’s for the thugs dummy
A little drugs bunny; we did it off of blood money
More pieces of Crown Vic surround us
We runnin up on niggas, they jumpin off of counters
One time for my allies
I’m a poe boy that like my guns, supersize
CMB what it is
I’m cookin up them ki's

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I’m countin blood money

[Ace Hood]
Okay we getting from us servin weight, get it cause we servin yay
See the way we get the cake, like everyday's a boring day
Blood money, and I’ma count it till they come for me
The feds hate it, they mistakin me for Blanco Buddies
I’m puttin blood, sweat and tears for this cash money
I’m talkin crooked unidentified bags of it
I’m talkin yellow table paper; put the tags on it
You play with mine, bet I turn you into crash dummies
Better not need heaters, I spit them shells like the beatles
I have my people go see you, I squash you out like a cheater nigga
I'm for that drug money underneath the rug money
My niggas love money, yeah, I’m talking blood money

[Hook: Rick Ross]

[Rick Ross]
Hammers in the Hummers, sticks in the lids
Sweets in the trunk, streets gimmie sneers
Money comin fast, blood comin slow
Who dem boys with the H? Feds wanna know
Gators on thief, neighbors gon sleep
You dealin with a G, and the haters gon see Boss
I’m in the dealership with a duffle bag
Couple Masaradis, couple hundred stacks
Far from peaches and cream, niggas deceased on the scene
I’m just countin my green, chillin', sippin’ my lean
Keep investigatin cause you got a job
Better keep your vest on bitch cause we got a mob

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I’m countin blood money
Ain’t mad cause I love money, came up gettin' drug money

[Birdman]
Well I’m the mob chief, given orders, callin' all the shots out
Make a nigga understand: we gangstas, we don’t play out
Came from under the sand, lift my own weight up
Bought a house off the curb, was patient so it paid up
No pleasure and pain homie, just the price for the flight
Don’t get’cha head chopped fuckin' with them five stripes
Eagle land it went south, now we got the cake
Paper plate money, every time I hitch a state
High on this pressure life, famous from the mud
Got the game from some old heads, I took it up in Blood
Yeah the only price nigga is a price
A mill on some whips, a hundred on ya life

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I’m countin blood money
Ain’t mad cause I love money, came up gettin' drug money
We countin blood money
Ain’t mad cause I love money, came up gettin' drug money

The gang in this bitch...
Young Wiz Khalifa man

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
California grapes, I'm breaking fine wines
Me I'm sky high, my bitch down to earth
Money in the bank, weed roller in her purse
And I ain't slackin on the job, my dog I been alert
Been gettin cake, bank being the verb
Big numbers on the net so niggas show love
And the diamonds on my neck should make these hoes trust
On the road, at the venue filled with model hoes
College shows, smokin grade a honor roll
Bad broad, light skin, hood niggas, white friends
And I ain't gotta talk much, it's in your face
Give me brain, cause she say she got expensive taste!
Let her rub my tattoos, now she flyin'
Smokin' zig zags too, nigga rap like crack so I

[Hook]
One spliff a day keep the ill away

One spliff a day keep the ill away

[Verse 2: Malik MD7]
Malik...Md7
Too Mucking Fuch lets go
Turn off my BB and my HTC
Please don't interrupt me when I'm smoking THC
I'm out to prove, what I'm about to do with this ounce of food (what?)
First class flights, higher altitude
Lead astray by the hash tray
I am half baked
If there's no smoking sign I'mma eat my hash cake
Only with my back up, I'm out to get paid
And I roll my spliffs backwards, the Amsterdam way
Hey, hey!
Got mental health problems, forget it!
I will give you two draws, you will turn schizophrenic
This smell of your police, pull us over for the hell of it
But fine often, cause we smoked out for the evidence

[Hook]

[Verse 3: S.A.S]

[Mega]
Inhale, exhale, on smoke...
There was big on... then I used to roll spillfs
Get the whole sip, now I'm in the days
On the... 'till I drift away
I'll be on it, on it all night
Yeah, that's super strong
Down to the last...
I don't know, should I roll, should I hit the bong
Paint the town red like the soles on the loboutins

[Mayhem]
Hydroponic (hah!), home grown (hah!) (hah!)
We're playing chronic, this is a smoke zone
Rolling flower power joints, nose cones
If I light this shit up I'm fucking up the ozone
I smoke that... is legit
Just a hit make you twitch like smoking on friday
Live your life, that's what I say
... while we speed, that's the highway!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Calliko]
Let's go!...
You can smell it through my pocket
Country boy from illinois yea im a pothead
Hyrdoponic you can smeell it through ya pocket
It ain't tricking if you got it, girl I got bread
Anybody feel like rolling up a blunt of kush?
I would, but she got me sleeping, feeling good
Sick of position body stiffer than a brick of wood
That's me feeling like a real nigga should
I'm addicted so consistent lets roll up another
Light green swisha sweet casa loma suites in the d
You know the ones wit the upstairs
When im powered up I devour blunts doing what I gotta do until a mothafucka
Up there, up where in the air you can't come up here
Real players do whatever that they want here...
Moving quicker than jamaicans in the fast lane
I'm babysitting, don't forget to tell em pass mane
Break it down, roll it up
Break it down, roll it up
Br-break it down roll it up
Calliko, Wiz Khalifa, roll up in there!

[Hook]

[Verse 1 -B.o.B]
Hahaha
Hahaha
You feel it?
Well if you’re trying to stop me it don’t matter
I got the power of a 40 caliber
Got the flow, got the style, got the stamina
Better call you a police and ambulance
Cuz Im rippin’ em down tasin’ em down
Slower than bone legged animals
All I need is a blunt of that canibus
And I leap in the air like a catapult
Look way up there it’s a bird it’s a plane
No it’s the savior to change the game
Doin my damn thing
Shootin’ em up like bam bang pow
Getting a little bit now
Lettin’ em know to bow down
Yup it’s b o bizzle and I’m letting em know what I’m about

[Hook - B.o.B]
They got the cameras on let em know it’s game time
Strap em up strap em up cuz it’s game time
Toe to toe

Hello Motherfucka, Hey hi how you doing

Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking Sigma
Bad to the bristle, Half to the rizzle
I’m so official all I need is a whistle
Bitch name Crystal
Let her suck my pistol
She open up her mouth and then I blow her brains out
You ain’t met a nigga like me
You probably never will
Ryders rolling with me like eleven wheels
Find out where you living
Kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us
But we ain’t even tripping

[Hook]

I’m goin in, I’m goin in, I’m goin in, I’m goin in

Dump his body in the lake
Let the bullets from the K throw a party in your face
Yeah, DJ Extra Clip, so go DJ!
I will kill you on your B-Day
Have a bitch with twin Glocks
Jump out your cake
Tell her merk em, and don’t forget about the safe'
We ain’t even walking, we runnin this shit

And I call cocaine my Columbian bitch
And my Columbian bitch like my Columbian ditch
Get it? got it? good I'm gone
Boy where you going?
You know where i’m going...

[Hook]

My style, My style, is second to none

A Tribe Called Quest
A guy called the best
Never lie for less

Young Me

And y'all suite like hotels
And you may be fly but I propel
High Profile, gun no smile
Warn your child, warn your spouse
And I would keep going in but the song's going out
Peace

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ahem
Young Money in charge
Yes it's Lil Wayne but the moneys enlarged
Priorities Young Money and God
Now they want to know how I be getting money on Mars
Cause I be getting paid like outta this world
Hip hop is a bitch and I'm proud of this girl
But when the sharks come see the fish curl
This is my game you gone need a referral
I know more bout tree then squirrel
We dont talk much but that heat so verbal
Brand new Marc Jacobs peak color thermal
Gun outside of the gear, external
Im so fly, yall still at the terminal
I put you in the dirt, just because I see the worm in ya
Dirty South bitch, admire and acknowledge it
&& respect my conglomorate!

[Verse: Akon]
Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her
They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

[Pre-Chorus: Akon (with David Guetta)]
She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen befo'
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood, hood
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
The way that booty movin', I can't take no more
Had to stop what I'm doin' so I can pull up close
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
(Damn, girl)

[Chorus: David Guetta]
Damn, you's a sexy chick, a sexy chick
Damn, you's a sexy chick; damn, girl
Damn, you's a sexy chick, a sexy chick
Damn, you's a sexy chick; damn, girl

[Verse: Akon]
Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her
They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

[Pre-Chorus: Akon (with David Guetta)]
She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen befo'
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood, hood
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
The way that booty movin', I can't take no more
Had to stop what I'm doin' so I can pull up close
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
(Damn, girl)

[Chorus: David Guetta]
Damn, you's a sexy chick, a sexy chick
Damn, you's a sexy chick; damn, girl
Damn, you's a sexy chick, a sexy chick
Damn, you's a sexy chick; damn, girl
Damn, you's a sexy chick, a sexy chick
Damn, you's a sexy chick; damn, girl
Damn, you's a sexy chick, a sexy chick
Damn, you's a sexy chick
Damn, you's a sexy chick

[Intro]
Aye now I could say my name but (say my name but)
Your bitch already knows it (knows it)
Got no problem spending paper (paper)
I got it so I blow it (I blow it)

[Verse 1]
Shawty what's your name put your number in my sidekick
Captain of the spaceship, you're fucking with a pilot
Say she wanna ride well I can give her mileage
Plus I live the star life won't you come and try it
Say I'm wrong I can do that pussy right
And when another time zone I can be there by tonight
Beat it I can like couple bottles of patron
Do some things tonight no problem cause' we grown
So Ima' pass go, and if you feel the way I feel then
Let's quit talking about it shawty let's go
Do you like it fast slow, say she gotta need for speed
If I can drive then I'm a need a crash course oh
So I threw it on her shawty threw it back at her freaky shit
You do it to me I'm a do it back and them scratches goin'
Ruin the tattoos that's on my back
So I don't know what to do with it but you know how to act

[Hook x2]
Looks like I'll be here with you all night long
And I wanna see it so I beat her with the lights on
I ain't no tease I wanna be your main attraction
Roll camera please I think it's time for some action
Some action, whoa

[Verse 2]
Then we can play it right back
I hope your kitty cat mean so I can bite back
Take off them jeans drink this night cap say men are from mars
You can be my venus fly trap
Damn your grip tight, let me put it on you slow
And then I'mma speed up at the light
Girl your body look too right to even try to put a price on
So I just leave the lights on
I'll have you tryin' different kinds of shit when you make it up in my room
I told you girl that I'm a hit it in high definition
Keep your lines in your head but in the bed we get unscripted
Aye... beat while they home I don't take them out to
Dinner, I need shawty on my camera aye

[Hook x2]
Looks like I'll be here with you all night long
And I wanna see it so I beat her with the lights on
I ain't no tease I wanna be your main attraction
Roll camera please I think it's time for some action
Some action, whoa

[Hook x5: Bun B]
Five on the kush, twenty on the drinks
So loaded in the club that a nigga can't think

[B.o.B]
I said I'm thrown to the side, like a lateral
I swear tonight I'm doin' major damage, it's collateral
Fifty on the potion, one hundred on the smokin'
Panoramic roof, but we ride in slow motion
Patron pass to you, top shelf we toastin'
Top models, tops poppin' off, Kelly Rowland
It's whatever, I never let up, I never feel better
A house full of freaks and they'll never say never
My seats all leather, my jackets all leather
Got PETA pissed off cause my pillow full of feathers
Since day one I stay down like a cellar
Bun B, K.R.I.T., B.o.B. we some fuckin' trend setters

[Hook]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Ok, I roll up and I pour up to the motherfuckin' top
Pimp C, twenty-four, what's a whip if it don't chop?
Subwoofers in my cushion, what's a trunk if it don't knock
Digi on the dash, if I want it then I cop
Cause it's G ho, let me work this wheel ho
Is there difference cause I'm young, huh?
What shit you think a real nigga live for?
Drink lean and pop pills folk
So far in the sky, you can hear God talk when I crack my window
And clear out this endo

[Hook]

[Bun B]
Well it's mista bigga, swisha picka up, but what's the deal though?
Rolling with your sister, twisting big and blow and kill bro
Trunk popped open, speakers kick it like a steel toe
With a big old bag of that southside swag that I pick up by the kilo
All the trill note till they recognize, haters get on the sideline
Killing roaches like pesticide, then lead em off of my timeline
Getting older, but I'm colder, better with age like I'm fine wine
Killer on the mic like Grind Time, how would you like to live my shine?
I'm too fresh and I'm too clean, getting thrown by routine
And I'm so wavy they like to pay me and this all gravy like poutine
Pimping baby, what you mean? I'm with B.o.B, you with K.R.I.T
And we on the job, trees is lit, so get off the knob playa, we the shit

[Hook]
What you smokin on nigga, what you smokin on?
What you smokin on bitch, what you smokin on?
I get so.......high
And fall off in the sky?

[Ludacris]
I've fallen and I can't get up
Somebody wake me up!
So high that my eyelids low, feeling like
I'm in a coma - better shake me up
What you wanna do Luda? Shit, roll up
Might as well. AK-47 to the head
And we ain't dead, we just high as hell
You may know about this weed, grass, marijuana
Cannabis, sativa. You may call it cheeba
Maybe reefer, Wiz Khalifa
Smoking on White Moonshine or that Anthrax or that Blue Dream
Spray a little cologne and my clothes smelling like
Versace Blue Jeans
Y'all smoking that huff weed, that dirt shit
That ragamuff, I'm smoking on that home grown
I pass out cause I done had enough!
Or that Sour Diesel, that Northern Lights and that killer Cali
You see me out up in Oahu, Honolulu, smoking that Maui Wowie

[Hook]

Don't fret, y'all niggas need a better connect
You need to get your status up
Y'all smoke that stress, we smoke that shit
That won the Cannabis Cup
Now I'm higher than a satellite
Eating everything like a parasite
Now we in the streets looking for the baddest dyke
To run a midnight train train like Gladys Knight
I'm higher than the prices of petrol
Higher than the balloon after you let go
Cause I'm smoking that loud in a middle of a crowd
And the loud is really louder than techno
I got my weed card on the way to the store to get medicinal marijuana
Luda! Study more Buddha than the Dalai Lama
Grand Daddy Purp, Bubble Gum or the OG kush
White Widow or the G-13, that Irene got your homies shook
But that Jack Herer and the Headband got my homies wild
And the Blueberry Yum Yum's that Fire!!

[Hook]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Smokin' on something grown at home
Sunken, blowin O's
Nigga I'm from PGH but all my weed from Californ'
Can't find the remote control: that's how you know I'm stoned
All you do is call me, I got all the weed, the papers, bongs
Brownies, trippy sticks and vaporizers, we could smoke a bowl
All these niggas smoking weed around me: it's a smoke-a-thon
Crowded and my whip is partly cloudy cause we smokin' strong
You say you can smoke them joints; Probably cause you rolled it wrong
My dollar's up, I'm getting em and I'm folding it
I'm lighting em, I'm hitting em, I'm not holding it
I'm passing em straight to Ludacris and he's smoking it
Security and a nigga that own the bitch askin'

[T.I.]
Long time no see now I'm back on my feet
Comfortably in back of a v, right back in the streets
Within a matter of weeks, thought they had me for 3
You can pose with the game but she married to me
Missed me while I was gone now I'm back in the zone
Got a message for the nigga who attacking the throne
You gon' make me put this heater to the back of your dome
Flip to the last from the front to the back of your home
Any idiot can see you should've left me alone
Cause they know the "Game Over" when I catch you alone
Flip, I'mma show you 'bout addressing me wrong
I'm after your lucky charms nigga let it be known
Anyway, see me shining with immaculate stones
Or somewhere riding through the city, rims have to be chrome
21's, 22's, left factory home
Stop, drop the top, hit the gas and I'm gone
From the box to the top spot where I belong
Could've swore that was my flow I heard on your song
But you should know that releasing mini-me's ain't offending me
Cause rappers always have a tendency to mimic g's
I guess that's just their way of telling me they're missing me
A million sold still there ain't a nigga real as me
Besides, imagery's the finest form of flattery
But now it's time to welcome back the nigga nigga's wanna see

[T.I.]
Keep my name out your mouth, I done said it befo'
Cause all them games I ain't 'bout, tell whoever you know
Befo' I pull this thang out, aim it dead at ya throat
Or bring the rifle out the house and put ya head in the scope
Pimp I'm trained for the drama shawty ready to go
See me hangin' out the hummer spittin' seventy mo'
You was talkin' 'bout a drought, I was peddlin' snow
And I doubt you'd get some blow as cheap as I'm sellin' it fo'
Hey I'm a G, what I'm worried 'bout a felony fo'?
When I get free bet I'll be ballin' hard as ever befo'
I got some chevy's but a benz what I'm usually in
Niggas hatin' on my crew I'll put a few in the wind
Keep it pimpin' till the end, while you choose to pretend
Shot a video in the pen and I'll do it again
Made news nationwide from eleven to ten
Headline CNN Peter Jennings and friends
Nigga, I'm so cool, been doing this since the old school
You turn into a gangsta when your vocals hit the Pro Tools
Ha! Look at him man
So don't get it confused, you don't know that dude
I'm hardcore no gold teeth, no tattoos
If you don't want no beef nigga don't act rude
I got a 4-4 fo' yo' attitude
We can talk or shoot it out, whatever you choose
Have it back in the county blues on the TV news
Only two rules when you walk in my shoes
One: Take no shit, number two: don't lose
I'm throwed off, plum fool nigga loose in my screws
Ima pass my patna the tool leave you wet as a pool
Lames get it misconstrued, g's you dont fool
I know bustin' a grape is somethin' you won't do
Super cool, nothin' to prove
I been bustin' them rugers and givin' you busters the blues
Since you were suckers in school
Hey, this is a situation you gon' wish you never pursued
You wanna push me? Pussy nigga do what you do
You think trappin' just in my flows? Nigga au contraire
Been sellin' blow since I was 12 years old my dear
Bustin' calicos just to let 'em know I'm here
Choppers in the trunk of every auto I steer
When you was in the classroom try'na pick a career
I was sellin' glass, countin' cash, drinkin' a beer
I agree this rap beef shit is so last year
But ask if I'll tear a new hole in your ass? Yeah
For flexin' and disrespectin', I don't play about that
But no mo' questions, I ain't got shit else to say about that
But my sentence'll be finished any day and I'm back nigga
Laughin' at you sucka ass hollywood rap niggas
Fakin' and they love it but this ain't for the public
So in interviews are cued to stay away from the subject
I just prove that I'm the truth if you don't like it then fuck it
We'll just keep it 'tween me you and this pistol I'm bustin', yeaaah
Pussy niggas ain't fuckin' wit' me
Cause pistol play in broad day that shit is nothin' to me
You need to pinch yourself nigga cause you livin' a dream
And I'm one of the realest niggas that this industry's seen
Think of me as John Gotti wit' a PhD
Or either Martin Luther King with a G-18
I'm ridin' clean, paint gleamin', blowin' T-H-C
For that reason haters wanna alleviate me
But I forgive 'em cause I know it ain't that he hate me
He just hate his situation hate that he ain't me
O.G.s say a lot of them in me they see
Cause I'm a scholar no diploma no GED
Now T.I.P. ain't sweet just so ya'll know
Had to tone it down for ya cause I know ya'll slow
Niggas tongue wrastle plenty yeah but they all show
Spread gossip like hoes 'bout what they don't know
Got mo' lies to tell than a nigga in jail
All my niggas from the streets I know remember me well
From how I used to take a key and put the weight on a scale
Now I'm seein' how many mills one record can sell nigga
You was on the low discussin' a g
When Urban Legend drop we'll see what the discussion'll be
Sissy ass nigga, hah!

[Verse 1]
Won’t say a thing
About the way you love me
Except for, I like the way
I love the way you touch me

[Pre-Chorus]
If I toot it, leave it tooted up
Then I drop it, drop it
Till ya making faces
And look like you wanna
Tell me stop it
Imma do it, do it, do it
Till you can't take no more
Till my lipstick ain't up on my face no more
I’mma do it do it do it
On the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only 'cause your lips ain't make it to my mouth
Just because I can’t kiss back
Doesn’t mean you can’t kiss that

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, baby, just like that
Slow, baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, it's your turn now

Watch and learn now, watch and learn how
Watch and learn now, eh-eh-eh-eh
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I’ll stay

[Verse 2]
Don’t ask me if
You were the first to sleep here
'Cause if he did, you wouldn’t even be here

[Pre-Chorus]
If I toot it, leave it tooted up
Then I drop it, drop it
Till ya making faces
And look like you wanna
Tell me stop it
Imma do it, do it, do it
Till you can't take no more
Till my lipstick ain't up on my face no more
I’mma do it do it do it
On the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only 'cause your lips ain't make it to my mouth
Just because I can’t kiss back
Doesn’t mean you can’t kiss that

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, baby, just like that
Slow, baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, it's your turn now
It’s your turn now, it’s your turn now
It’s your turn now, it’s your turn now
Watch and learn now, watch and learn how
Watch and learn now, eh-eh-eh-eh
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I’ll stay

[Bridge]
(Oh) Come put my love against your kiss (Oh, na-na-na)
La-la-la, just like this
Na-na, don’t be shy
Baby, all I need
Oh, do it on me
Like you aim to please
Show me how much you mean it
By the way you please me, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I’mma do it do it do it
On the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only 'cause your lips ain't make it to my mouth
Just because I can’t kiss back
Doesn’t mean you can’t kiss that

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, baby, just like that
Slow, baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, it's your turn now
It’s your turn now, it’fs your turn now
It’s your turn now, it’s your turn now
Watch and learn now, watch and learn how
Watch and learn now, eh-eh-eh-eh
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby

[Outro]
If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I’ll stay (Stay, stay, stay, stay)

[Intro]
Come and put cha name on it, put cha name on it
Come and put cha name on it, ya name
Don't chu wanna put ya name on it, put cha name on it
Come and put cha name on it, bay-bay-bay-bay-uh

[Verse 1]
It's not even my birthday (My birthday)
But he wanna lick the icing off (The icing off)
I know you want it in the worst way (The worst way)
Can't wait to blow my candles out

[Chorus]
He want that...
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
(But you wanna put your name on it)
Oh, baby I like it
It's so exciting
Don't try to hide it
I'mma make you my bitch
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
(But you wanna put your name on it)
I know you wanna bite this
It's so enticing
Nothing else like this
I'mma make you my bitch

[Verse 2]
And it's not even my birthday (My birthday)
But you wanna put your name on it
And it's not even my birthday (My birthday)
And he's tryna put his name on it

[Outro]
Oh, I wanna fuck you right now (Ooh)
Just get up on my body, I'll do anything...
Big Bada boom, Luda’s in this bitch
Pussy niggas clear the room
I came through the door, I said it before
I’m the truth in this booth and you niggas all hoes
Counterfeit rappers say I’m stealing their flows
But I can’t steal what you never made up bitch
Y’all some duplicate rap cloning niggas
I manufacture you hoes -- put on your makeup, bitch
Let me explain, nothing’s been new since Big Daddy Kane
Flows will get recycled passed around to different names
But what’s the same, that every verse I spit is insane
Got more styles than any rapper in the game, 11 years and still counting
And y'all get a couple hit records, make some noise and have the nerve to start shouting
Who’s gassing ‘em, they blowing smoke up your ass, you fired up but I’m just puff puff passing ‘em
Until they roaches, buried in my ashtray
Nigga burn slow, better pray like it’s your last day
You lying to yourself, just admit it
May not like the way I use it but you know you ain't invent it boy
Do your research before you make a claim so bogus
That's disrespecting pioneers in the game
Fuck the fame but go ahead and get ya 5 minutes
Then you front line cadets can report to your lieutenants
See I’m ya past, I’m ya future and ya present
So watch ya fucking mouth when you speak about a legend
16 times platinum, 6 number 1 peaks
So I can give a fuck what you sold in ya first week
You’s weak, softer than the Pillsbury dough boy
Don’t make me expose the truth, you’s a ho, boy
Don’t make me get on that "Stomp" shit and get back at it
You rappers ain't even in my fucking tax bracket
Why am I wasting my time
Yeah I admit I get a little ludicrous with my rhymes, sometimes
But my fans know the difference because “My Chick Bad” went platinum
Still winning, motherfucker
The nerve of you niggas man
You ain't got enough medals on your jacket to address me boy
Fall back in formation, y’all outta line
I was told not to kill a mosquito with a cannon
So the next time you gnats got a real problem
Don’t be a coward like a nigga that used to be signed to me going on twitter rants and shit
Nigga, say it to my face

[Intro]
Ayy girl

[Verse 1]
Fine, as she wanna be, that girl
Gentle, as she wanna be, that girl
When I sleep at night
I think about, that girl
Where she come from?
She's beautiful, that girl

[Bridge 1]
Ooo-ooo that girl
Ooo-ooo that girl

[Verse 2]
In my mind, I see her (My dream girl)
In my mind, I meet her (My dream girl)
Then, we dance, we dance, I wanna keep her (My dream girl)
Yeah yeah
That girl

[Bridge 2]
Ayy, oh-oh
Ayy, oh-oh

[Verse 3]
That girl, nice girl
I leave home to see you girl
Remember when I crept through the window (Yeah)
Remember when I crept through the window (Yeah)
Remember when I crept through the window (Yeah) girl
Remember when I snuck in your bedroom (Yeah)
Remember when I snuck in your bedroom (Yeah)
Remember when I snuck in your bedroom (Yeah) girl

[Bridge 1]
Ooo-ooo that girl
Ooo-ooo that girl

[Outro, Backwards Message]

[Intro: T.I.]
Yea, Ha! Ok well
I suppose it's safe to say
This is the end for you
And the beginning for me

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm a real nigga, nothing artificial
I run with former drug dealers and they all official
I know you soft as tissue, so ain't no arguing wit you
Say its all fun and games 'til them bottles hit you
Get ya issue if you wanna I don't play it dawg
You don't wanna see them killers wit the K's dawg
Zone One Westside of the A dawg (Bankhead!)
You thinkin we some suckas, you was way off
I ball all night, go hard all day, balls deep up in your broad all day
"T.I. not fly," that's all yall say, big bankrolls and massage all day
Never mind they blasé, blasé, just menagé and parlay
With some Latin hotties, outta Hollywood in my Denali
Aye, flawless bodies, gorgeous faces, safe to say they goin places
Great head, wet pussy, touchin' bust or bases
Aye, shawty goin in, won't ever go away
And all that goin ape shit, ain't no need to tell em they know!

[Hook: Drake]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Verse 2: Drake]
I be yelling out, "Money over everything, money on my mind"
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her, "I apologize, happened over time"
She says they miss the old Drake, girl, don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do
I'm like "why I gotta be all that?"
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like "All My Children"
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gonna hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it
They know

[Hook]

[Outro]
I be yelling out, "Money over everything, money on my mind"
Tell her, "I apologize, happened over time"
They know

[Verse 1]
Had an epiphany, and this what it seems
It's smoke and mirrors, don't wanna believe
For far too long they've been plotting on me
The story's unfolding now, it's a conspiracy

[Pre-Chorus]
Starting to feel like got déjà vu
I remember being here, must be a glitch in the matrix
Look around, they all got the same face on
I'm standing by the phone, someone call me

[Chorus]
Bring me to life (To life, to life, to life, to life, to life)
Show me how to live (To live, to live, to live, to live, to live, to live)
'Cause I lose control, feeling like Neo in the matrix
I just wanna live, I just wanna live, oh woah
I took a red and a blue pill, now I
I can't decide what's make believe or real
Am I awake or am I still asleep?
It's killing me (Killing me)

[Verse 2]
Into the oracle, I wanted to know
What I was supposed to do, she said I see on my own
And the craziest thing is that you already know
Try to decipher the signs on the side of the road

[Pre-Chorus]
Starting to feel like got déjà vu
I remember being here, must be a glitch in the matrix
Look around, they all got the same face on
I'm standing by the phone, someone call me

[Chorus]
Bring me to life, yeah (To life, to life, to life, to life, to life)
Show me how to live (To live, to live, to live, to live, to live, to live)
'Cause I lose control, feeling like Neo in the matrix
I just wanna live, I just wanna live, oh woah
I took a red and a blue pill, now I
I can't decide what's make believe or real
Am I awake or am I still asleep?
It's killing me (Killing me)

[Bridge]
I need you, you gotta help me
I'm part human, part android
I need your power so you can charge me, charge me
Oh woah, stuck in the matrix, oh, bring me to life

[Chorus]
Bring me to life (To life, to life, to life, to life, to life)
Show me how to live (To live, to live, to live, to live, to live, to live)
'Cause I lose control, feeling like Neo in the matrix
I just wanna live, I just wanna live, oh woah

[Verse]
See I was born back in '84
Without a damn clue what was in store
And furthermore even if I could bra
I do it all again real shit bra
Advocate rappin' and doing me
I ended up rapping renewing me
Ended up being better then the last
Whole new Cudder for the new class
Every time I think about the first step I ever took alone made me realize this prince was made for the throne
Defeated the beast, Sword from the stone, smoking so much weed I'm better off alone
In my own zone, in my own zone, I'm so gone never the less
I can't disappear stress, my life is way beyond your momma knows best
You can't forget I'm blessed, the feel is so curse, I can't stop the verse from spitting
Without feeling like I'm phony cause I speak my thoughts every time I think them up
I guarantee I will win if I was ever wrong this moment ain't it
So I am psychic in the in end, I think my thoughts and reality lets them
In, in, in, in

[Chorus]
Tell me who, is all ready to go
Tell me who... is all ready to go
Tell me who is all ready, to go higher up say higher up(x2)

[Intro: T.I.]
I mean forgive me for being so straightforward
But it’s been quite a minute since I’ve been here
And umm, I mean if you will
Just take a second to look around man
You know what I’m saying
Its a bunch of square ass niggas in here
And I know you don’t do this often but I’m the exception
Do it for me huh, pop that pussy for a real nigga ma Lets go

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Say bruh, I’m so official outta sight
What’s about me not to like
I put that pipe inside her
Like my diamonds are her guiding light
I’m dynamite, K-I-N-G, P-I-M-P, admire me
A plethora of fine freaks trailing right behind me
Killin shit dead, turn the club to a crime scene
Pocket full of money like I run a crime ring
Million dollar chain, everything shining
It’s safe to say I do my thing honey, nah mean?
Bunch of young hoes know Chinese
In bed stuck together like they siamese
I run in rod way to feel her, she say “Gah-lee”
I say I’m tryna touch her heart, close ya eyes, breathe
Now she running from me, but she ain't tryna leave
I keep a quarter key of pussy thats a nine piece
Legs open curtain closed, rock solid hurting hoes
Buss it open, sure she will, who else is there to do it fo'
Fo’sho

[Chorus: Drake]
She just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and tell me “baby, its real”
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere
But here baby you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won’t
Uh, but shit than again maybe she will
Yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I tell her “now go on, pop that pussy for me”
Haters can’t see me, but them bitches still looking for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in, and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I’m all about “I” give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her til she cry, call that “wine and dine”
Try to check me and I’mma have ‘em checkin’ pulses
They say chose wisely, thats why I was chosen
Rocking like asphalt, its the cash fault
Looked in the face of death and took it’s mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face South and her ass North
But I’m Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on my dick and do a full split!

[Chorus: Drake]
She just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and tell me “baby, its real”
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere
But here baby you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won’t
Uh, but shit than again maybe she will
Yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will
She just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and tell me “baby, its real”
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere
But here baby you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won’t
Uh, but shit than again maybe she will
Yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will

Couple of hours later I wanted to hug, love and kiss you
You said you can't take it no more
But you didn't walk out of that door
You say that you change

All out in public everyone watching like a reality show
But it don't matter no more

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Yeah
Just waking up in the morning and to be well
Quite honest with ya, I ain't really sleep well
Ya ever feel like your train of thought's been derailed?
That's when you press on, Lee Nails
Half the population's just waitin' to see me fail
Yeah right, you're better off tryna freeze hell
Some of us do it for the females
And others do it for the retails
But I do it for the kids, life threw the towel in on
Every time you fall it's only making your chin strong
And I be in your corner like Mick, baby, til the end
Or when you hear this song from that big lady

[Pre-Chorus: Travie McCoy]
Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gonna do y'all?

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
Give 'em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life til we're dead
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
There goes a fighter, there goes a fighter
Here comes a fighter
That's what they'll say to me, say to me
Say to me, this one's a fighter

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
And if I can last thirty rounds
There's no reason you should ever have your head down
Six foot five, two hundred and twenty pounds
Hailing from rock bottom, Loserville, nothing town
Textbook version of the kid going nowhere fast
And now I'm yelling kiss my ass
It's gonna take a couple right hooks a few left jabs
For you to recognize that you really ain't got it bad

[Pre-Chorus: Travie McCoy]
Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gonna do y'all?

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
Give 'em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life til we're dead
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
There goes a fighter, there goes a fighter
Here comes a fighter
That's what they'll say to me, say to me
Say to me, this one's a fighter
Everybody put yo hands up

[Breakdown: Travie McCoy]
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do? Ya'll
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do? Ya'll

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
If you fall pick yourself up off the floor (Get up)
And when your bones can't take no more
Just remember what you're here for
Cause I know I'mma damn sure

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
Give 'em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life til we're dead
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
There goes a fighter, there goes a fighter
Here comes a fighter
That's what they'll say to me, say to me
Say to me, this one's a fighter

[Outro: Ryan Tedder]
Till the referee rings the bell
Till both ya eyes start to swell
Till the crowd goes home

[Intro]
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Every girl that I met on tour
I knew none of them would last
Cause it wouldn’t work, nah it wouldn’t work
A hundred chick contacts in my phone
About half of them I smashed
I put in work, oh, I put in work
But there's something missin' there though
Feels like I've gotta lambo with no gas to go
And I've got all the world, nothing to show
That girl just let me know

[Hook]
I need love
Yeah, I need you, yeah, I need you
I need love
Yeah, I need you, oh I need
I need love in the morning
In the afternoon
I need love all night, all night
I need love, need love, need love, need love
Need love

[Verse 2]
Two weeks ago
I would've never admit I had it bad, oh
I wouldn't do it, nah, no
Cause fifteen days ago
Never knew you, so never knew how this felt
Had no clue, I was too cool
But now I can't go a day without ya'
I wake up eating breakfast thinking 'bout ya'
We'll go around the world, don't ever go
No, don't ever leave me 'lone

[Hook]
I need love
Yeah, I need you, yeah, I need you
I need love
Yeah, I need you, oh I need
I need love in the morning
In the afternoon
I need love all night, all night
I need love, need love, need love, need love
Need love

[Bridge]
I wanna wake up from this dream
No sleep full of dreams, I'll stay
And I know it'll work girl
There's no where I'd rather be
Because I need

[Hook]
I need love
Yeah, I need you, yeah, I need you
I need love
Yeah, I need you, oh I need
I need love in the morning

Money to blow, I’m limpin' off tour
Boatloads of cash, bitch, I’m overboard
I got money for these whores if you open up the door
Company accounts and they all on one accord
Real talk, I don’t speak, even if it’s “Hi, hater”
I’m on top and I done locked the elevator
All these bitches say I'm fly and I can never touch the ground
I’m not tryna be in your circle cause I don’t fuck around
I get that money, that money (money)
I live it, I want it (want it)
Drop the top on that Ferrari, now I’m in California
I let the hardtop down and the wind blow through
All I do is win, what the fuck you gon' do?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I go so hard they call me go so hard
You ain't a king, you a joker card
Fuckin’ up the Church money like a alter boy
I got them yellow Xannies, that's them Tonka toys
I go bonkers, boy, I put that on my mamma nem
These hoes are all alike, they put the 'ho' in homonym
I think all these niggas sound like me, that’s a compliment
I told a midget "Bitch, I do it big, hippopotamus"
Put that on my Slime and ‘em, no b-ball, we stop and pop
No b-ball, we got shit locked, swagger ill, wassup, doc?
Make that pussy pop like the gun I went to jail for
Shoot the doors off that Jeep, that bitch look like a mail truck

[Verse 1]
Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]
But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
The one
The one
The one
The one that got away

[Bridge]
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
The one (The one)
The one (The one)
The one (The one)
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
I'm ice grilling you, staring you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, cause Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac with a cranium packed full of more uranium
Than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spasmatic
Strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in a hospital in critical condition
I flat lined, jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai-weed
Looking Chinese with my knee's, stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope god forgives me for my sins
It probably all depends on if I keep on killing my girlfriends
True stories (what)
Miracles (what)
True blessings (what)
All because of love

True stories (what)
Miracles (what)
True blessings (what)
All because of love

I was riding in my car one day (oh)
In the express lane rolling down the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings
Then I reached down beside me
Then I looked on the floor felt, on the back seat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before I knew it
Here comes this truck now
The doctor said I don't think he's gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said unto me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
And for 10 years I've been straight
Chorus:
You saved me(woah) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me

Now I've been sitting in the chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone would call me with a job opening
Cause its been so hard for me month to month
Struggling to eat but still there was no answer(no answer)
I stopped believing in his word And got so mad at him
When somebody say Gods good I just laugh at them(oh yeah)
And in the nick of time his blessing rained on me
By his grace the phone ring a lady says were hiring
And that's when I knew

Chorus:
You saved me(saved) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me

Now I was 18 out on the block selling drugs
With a gun at my waist And for people had no love
See the streets was my home and family and friends were gone
Had no one to trust and deep inside I was all alone
And then a deal went bad one day and it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before I knew it I was on my knees
(Blood gushing out my body my hearts beatin fast
I don't know what I'm a do I don't think I'm gonna last)
Then I began to flash back on the thing I've done in my past
(Then I heard a small voice that said to me I'll give you peace if u believe)
I accepted Christ that day hallelujah now I'm free
Chorus:
You saved me(saved) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me

I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering where did it come from
(I got tested)and the results came back and the doctor said I'm sorry but you got cancer
I could not believe it so I called up my mama to calm my nerve
(mama)she got down on her knees (mama)she said a prayer for me
(mama) said just keep on thanking Jesus (mama)he'll give you all you need
That was five years ago don't have that pain no mo
Doc says you can go home cause all your caners gone

Chorus:
You saved me (said you saved me) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me

[Verse 1]
Riding something butter soft, interior smoked out
See you try to budget yours. Me? I don't care what it costs
Blowing hella cake I'm switching states to get my numbers off
Spin the parking lot and fuck the finest thing I come across
Phone full of missed calls, keep some bitches on my line
Conscious with my conversation, caking is my occupation
Keep them 'rillos rolling up, filled to the tipple
Good weed and I blow it by the zip, I'm in my whip
Riding weed and switching lanes, cruising to my newest shit
Hoes been acting funny so I'm fucking with my newest bitch
Everything designer on, diamonds look like Lemonheads
On the beach with foreign freaks, you tricking with them chickenheads?
Gotta get my bread (bread) so I hardly sleep at night
I do a show to studio, I'm just in time to catch a flight
Young but I'm paid, it comes from grinding everyday
And having patience, blowing Master Kush in my spaceship

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Cruising with my hat back, tat-tat-tatted up
Gucci on my loafers, getting chauffeured now my status up
Paid to cost, I'm the thinnest boss, fuck them other guys
Blowing weed I'm never sober, you can't tell me otherwise
Name well known, ranked at the top
Bad bitch in every city, big face on the watch
Kush on my clothes, big bank in my knot
Smoke a hundred cigarillos, pullin straight up out a pillow
Now I'm eating, staplin in cases for my pillows(?)
To my city I'm a prince so I sit behind tints
Mad I found an avenue to get my revenue
I'm with a model bitch cheifing in a tailor made suit
Taylor Gang president, heavy hustle under boss
In my car blowing smoke signals out the roof
Money conversation talking paper then come fuck with me
I'm in the air, that's why you look up to me, you know?

[Verse 1]
When I'm here in your arms, I feel love in my heart, I can breathe
Not even pinching myself, I don't care, I'm with you, you with me
I never wished on the star when the star ain't got nothing on me
'Cause I can wish you in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
When I close my eyes, I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep, knowing that tonight you'll be here with me
Ohh

[Chorus]
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Ohh
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)
So I'd rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh)
If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
I think the luckiest girl in the whole wide world could be me
I get to be with the one that I love anytime I please
I feel like I can stay forever beyond eternity
It's like I'm where I'm supposed to be

[Pre-Chorus]
When I close my eyes, I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep, knowing that tonight you'll be here with me
Ohh

[Chorus]
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Ohh
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)
So I'd rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
It took a lifetime just to get with you, to be with you, baby
And now that I'm here with you, I'm gonna take it in, breathe you in
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And if I am dreaming, let the dream be that I'm awake
'Cause I'd rather dream about you than living life without me and you, you

[Chorus]
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Ohh
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)
So I'd rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Ohh
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)
So I'd rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh)
If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Outro]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
JB, Jaden Smith, let's go

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don’t shed tears, girl, they bawl

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Got me thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you, no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
I be thinking 'bout you, and you know I do
When I be thinking 'bout them kisses girl, so are you
Man I heard some things but I don't know what's true
But people say you really like me and I hope that's true
You my baby girl and I hope you know it
A boy will tell you that he loves you, but a man will show it
That's why you in my arms, just for the day
Cause less than months go by, you be dancing away
But let's just have some fun girl, as long as you're here
Cause when you get up on that plane, you'll be gone for a year
And when you come up in my room I'll be bawling some tears
But people say just live in the moment, it's wrong to be scared
Girl is it wrong to be scared? Cause that's what they say
And everyday that I don't see you, you slipping away
And all the teachers in my class thinking I'm crazy
But they don't know that I think about you daily cause I be

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
Baby I could pick you up in the Rolls Royce
Anywhere you wanna go, it's your choice
Every time that I'm away, girl I miss your voice
And I promise that I'm nothing like them other boys
I came from the bottom, now I'm at the top
Tell you I love you every day and that'll never stop
They say it's true love, well is love true?
Yeah I think it's love, that's why I found you
And not a second that goes by that I don't think you are so fly
And I know why ain't no guy gon' treat you like I
Wanna, gonna be the man that treats you right, be the man to hold you tight
You know I know you right, let's go into the night

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh

Hey, before I eat an MC I say my grace
Leave you dead without a trace
Got a problem with me, Say it to my face (to my face)
To my face (to my face) To my face (to my face)
Put a pussy ass nigga all in his place
Didn't your bosses ever tell you niggas you could be replaced
To the fans yous a disgrace
Got a problem with me say it to my face(to my face)
To my face (to my face) To my face (to my face)
Put a pussy ass nigga all in his place

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Got a chopper, kinda like a helicopter
For any nigga that thinks it's sweet
And you better call the doctor, have you shakin' like a maraca
Drippin' like this beat, blood spillin' like a faulty faucet
Plug his ass, before you end up in a hearse
Put the gear in reverse then you better hit the fucking
Gas {tires screech}
You broke n' now you bitter
But how the hell is a nigga gonna start beef with me
On his fucking twitter? (for real?)
You know where I be
You know where I stay, I ain't that hard to find
All up on my D, when the DTP boy
You sweeter than a valen... tine
How can you call yourself a man boy (man boy)
You's Ludacris number one fan boy (fan boy)
Then you left and you're gone "goodbye" lazy
I don't miss you
Then you signed to a nigga, who signed to a nigga
Who signed to another nigga (what the fuck?)
Smart move, boy you dumb as hell
You should take your soul and have a end of the summer sale
But all your records are my theme song (why?)
'Cuz I'm still shopping off your ringtone

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Hey, before I eat an MC I say my grace
Leave you dead without a trace
Got a problem with me, say it to my face (to my face)

Put a pussy ass nigga all in his place

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Ah, to you internet gangsters, Facebook hoes
Email bullies I can see your camel toe (HI!)
Instead of talking to a nigga straight up
You'd rather send a text (text)
Well I think you a bitch and you should change your sex (sex)
Hiding behind your phone screen (phone screen)
Better run the other way you playin' for the wrong team (team)
Dick in the booty ass nigga (dick in the booty ass nigga)
Ol' take another dude to the movies ass nigga
I can see your Kit-Kat, gimme a break hit him in his face
How you keep it real when you know a nigga fake
Better hit the brakes when you see me nigga shake
You gon' run into convulsions, hater emotions and epileptic seizures
Put a nail in a nigga your career is over hang'em up like jesus
Amen (amen) sayonara (sayonara) ok then (ok then)
Next time you cryin' tell a bitch nigga
But keep in mind... yous a bitch nigga

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Hey, before I eat an MC I say my grace

To my face (to my face) To my face (to my face)
Put a pussy ass nigga all in his place

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Put a pussy ass nigga in his place
With that toolie on my waste like "huh"
I put it to his face and ask the pussy nigga
"How it taste like? huh?"
He said it taste like nine (nine)
Told him it's a Glock 10 though (10 though)
Niggas thinkin' this a game til' them shots hit his body
Bend his ass like limbo
Give my shooters yo' info
Send them right to yo place, put them right in yo face
Nigga like "what you say?"
Catch you night time and then brighten your day
Shots at your head they dont like what you say
Coroner’s comin' ta wipe you away
Think you a G, get hit right with the K
Wherever you standing, thats right where you lay (blah)
Y'all niggas run yall mouth just like a bunch of bitches
Pussy niggas talking just like a bunch of snitches
Lord be my witness, I ask for forgiveness
But if these pussy niggas keep runnin' they mouth
I'mma give them the business
Heard you pussy ass niggas talkin' bout me
When I'm not around
Told another nigga, so he told another nigga
And it got around (got around)
So I told the other nigga
Go tell the other nigga "move outta town" (outta town)
'Cuz my dawg playin' hardball with the sawn off
Like you out of bounds, BOOM!

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Hey, before I eat an MC I say my grace
Leave you dead without a trace
Got a problem with me, say it to my face (to my face)
To my face (to my face) To my face (to my face)
Put a pussy ass nigga all in his place
Didn't your bosses ever tell you niggas you could be replaced

It's clear to see that this is fucking manslaughter, bodies in the water
Beats in the casket, and preachers at your altar
Tweetin' from the sky like I'm finna land on ya
And bitches get pumped like Fishburne's daughter
16's'll cost ya, 20 years I'm boss(ta?)
You just in the closet, nigga I'm a monsta
Full blown sick, you niggas a little nausea
Snappin' on shit, like what's served at Red Lobster

Rasta; but no dread-head, I'm too proper
I'm breaking down the game for you niggas like Bob Costas
Impostors; mighty Wolf Gang, you can't stop us
And I'm getting neck from your bitch, like dog collars
Ya'll be bullshittin' but I dodge it like a boxer
Weavin' like a ghetto black bitch gettin' primed up
Can't knock me, and besides I'm too high up
I ain't seen you niggas in a minute like Von Dutch

It kinda feels like I'm living with my eyes shut
Walking on a dream, all the real niggas gon' rise up
Punks stay away my dro heads are like nine sluts
My old heads tell me go ahead, you doing fine son
I know that you faggots don't like us
But you'd be winnin' if you did it just like us
It's a celebration, so I might just-
Fly to New York, sour diesel light the night up

[Verse 1]
I got a corkscrew swag, they see me and get it popping
I wear their ass out and in the morning take ‘em shopping
Treat a ho so sweet, they get wit’ me, they spoilt rotten
They wanna be my baby, call me daddy -- no adoption
Shawty raw, ball, out at all costs
Hit the club twice as fly as anybody y'all saw
Training wheels on the hustle, I will never fall off
You can keep ya pussy baby, give me all jaw
I’m young dumb, cold as they come
Treat me like the drummer, give me some would ya hun’
Yeah I’m hung but I still get sprung with the tongue
Fuck her good all night, even the sun finna come

[Hook]
I’m on fire and ice cold
A black Benz, a white Rolls
Like loose women, and tight clothes
Say I’m the bomb bitch, I’m dynamite, pyro

I’m dynamite, pyro
(bow, bow, bow, bow, bow..)
I’m the bomb bitch, I’m dynamite, pyro

Rock a bad bitch, you with me, whats they name? who cares?

Go insane in that pussy but I never go fair
Debonair, so rare shawty it ain't even fair
Everywhere you see I be, I get that don’t handle my B.I
Money small thing to a giant, Eli
G4 flying, I don’t ever see the kiosk
I take a nigga little bitch and buy her a little Prius, yes
They ain't on fire like we is
Certified flyer, recognize us where you see us
Take no shit, no how, no way
We TNT C4, Okaaay

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Party at the presidential, if you with it, lets get it
No matter where you live, I’m the hottest in your city
They talking ’bout they balling and their flossing but I live it
I sit her in that Phantom, get her out that Honda Civic
In the VIP I’m chillin’, everythang ice cold
Black chicks, Latin bitches, Asian broads, white hoes
Fuck wit’ hoes who like hoes, only if they tight though
Purse game insane, shoe game pyscho
Black on black, credit card on deck
And a Black Maybach on the Boulevard
V.S.'s in the chain, filled wit’ clear stones
Hero as I can be, H.N.I.C., I'm gone!

[Hook]

[Intro: Macklemore]
Yeah
Bring my drums in, bring my drums in
Now bring my drums in, Now bring my drums in
Nod your head come on now nod your head I’m gonna do it a check in

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Yo, we all know that life can get hectic
But if you live in the second
You exist in the present
And that's how you stay connected
Through good times and hardships if you learn to just accept it
And know that every struggle in life is there to teach you a lesson
It's times like this that make you
It's always the darkest part of the night right before the sun has its breakthrough
The spirit's there to knock you down, but if you make that the end
You'll never know the beauty of being able to stand up again
And face it with patience
The basis is dealing with judgements and hatred, depressed hopeless feelings
But I've been told that you only create your own ceiling
And life is limitless and knowing this is what the spirit is

[Hook: Macklemore]
That's why I try and inhale deep
So I can find peace
In essence just find me
That's why I lose myself in these beats
As I become one with the drum and set myself free

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Whatever direction life leads me
There's a purpose behind it, that's the way it was supposed to be
At anytime you could turn over a new leaf
We all know the truth, it's up to us to use the key
It's been three years since my first album dropped
And it's been fear that's really got me stuck in this spot
Not wanting to put out anything whack
So instead of putting my licks on tracks
I put my lips to a sack
Cause it's easier to spend your life drunk and high on drugs
Than to put everything in a recording, put it out, and then get judged
We look for the audience to put their hands up and show love
But when their hands go down, our confidence really takes the plunge
So instead of making music that people might not like
I went into isolation and traded in my mic for the pipe
Started living the college life - drinking and smoking every day
Rationalizing to myself that I was going through a phase
That I'd stop, thinking my music would take its place
But when you live in fog, inspiration's hard to create
It takes more to get connected than to quit smoking for a day
And when I get frustrated I get a Swisher and get blown away
Then all of a sudden it hit me: these kids are listening
If I'm not making music then why the fuck am I existing?
How can I talk about the problems of something else
When I don't have the motivation and confidence to change myself?
It's been so long since I really truly felt
What it's like to live life without substances to help
Massive struggle, that's natural to one's health
But with addiction in my blood, I play the cards I was dealt
Knowing that it's the most calm right before the storm
And when you least expect it, it doesn't rain it pours
I swear to God you can never be warned
And with or without umbrella nature's still gonna' take its course

[Hook]
That's why I try and inhale deep
So I can find peace
In essence just find me
That's why I lose myself in these beats
Put away the weed and turn to my M.P.C

[Verse 1]
Know I'm missin' that kissin' in the rover
Boy, what I'm feelin', never feel it about another
I need you, why can't you come over?
And you my lover, but I love you like a brother
Babe, you the one at the end of the day
You are who you are and I love you that way
Lust ain't love, if you know the difference
You got a little game on ya, caught up in your feelings
We together like..
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I'mma do whatever, I'm not gon' leave
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
This kind of love don't come easy (Ah, yeah, yeah)
We don't care what they think, babe
Promise we'll stay the same
Say that you'll stay right here for me

[Chorus]
See, I know you like being 'round chicks
And looking at her hips, and a little outfit
Hey, what can I say? (What can I say?)
That's what I love about you, babe
(That's what I love about you, babe)
Yeah, I don't ask, 'cause I know you gon' lie
You're way too sexy, to ever be shy
Hey, what can I say? (What can I say?)
That's what I love about you, babe
(That's what I love about you, babe)

[Post-Chorus]
(Go ahead)
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya, do ya, do ya thang

Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang

[Verse 2]
You the shit
Yeah, baby, you the bomb
Middle of the day, give me what I want
It feels so special, it feels so good
And he ain't goin' no where even if he could
I got that ow, ow
You know what I’m talkin' about, 'bout
Make a nigga scream and shout, shout
Every time the lights go out, out
We out, out

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I'mma do whatever, I'm not gon' leave
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
This kind of love don't come easy (Ah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck what you think, babe
Promise we'll stay the same
Say that you'll stay right here for me

[Chorus]
See, I know you like being 'round chicks
And looking at her hips, and a little outfit
Hey, what can I say? (What can I say?)
That's what I love about you, babe

[Post-Chorus]
(Go ahead)
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang

[Bridge]
Ah, and I know what you're thinking of
That I don't know a thing about love
But what I know is I'm his girl
And he's the one for me
See, this shit ain't worth tripping over
Do your thing, it doesn't matter
As long as we gon' rock forever

And looking at her hips, and a little outfit
Hey, what can I say? (What can I say?)
That's what I love about you, babe
(That's what I love about you, babe)

[Intro]
That's thirty five thousand dollars cash money
No, that's thirty five thousand plus one right?
The one I gave you?
No, you gave me six though right?
I had one and it was thirty five thousand plus one plus six makes seven
Thirty five thousand dollars and seven right?

(Mothafucka can you buy that? Buy that? Buy that?) I could buy that
(Mothafucka can you buy that? Buy that? Buy that?) I could buy that
Awww, here this nigga Luda go again talking 'bout how much money he got and shit!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Luda! oh no, don't try that
Twenty million dollar crib motherfucker I could buy that
You can see me in a fly 'lac
Maserati's, Lamborghini's or a mutherfuckin' Maybach
Lay back making pay stacks
Conjure on the rocks, don't chase that
Buss all in your bitch face, and like Puff, tell her take that, take that!
Champagne by the boatload
Keep a bottle of a Veuve Clicquot in a choke hold
I'm rough I choke hoes, cockin' a magnum like 44′s
Get it? I'm loco! I know people mob like no does
All night with the door closed
Women jumpin' on my stick like pogo's
Higher, my rubbers all rotate like tires
I fuck the bitch before I fuck you
Damn right I'm tired!
I'm filthy rich, bitch, go spend some mula
I went to the dealership and the Ferrari dude was like errr Luda?

[Hook]
Muthafucka can you buy that? (buy that, buy that)

Muthafucka can you buy that? (buy that, buy that)
Big Bank take Little bank nigga, I could buy that
Muthafucka can you buy that? (buy that, buy that)
Your money is my money
I can buy that!

[Verse 2: Luadcris]
I can buy that shit
No nigga can even deny that shit
Pull up at the light with a hottie in a Bugatti
And whatever you driving you better hide that shit
Oh, fuck your life, kill yourself nigga
Go buy a casket, and bill yourself nigga!
You can find me freaking a Puerto Rican
Or down in Panama with the stamina of an athlete
Overlooking the women in Guatemala, Tahiti
They in bikini's I'm running them like a track meet
Bloaw! Ready, set go, I'm so outrageous
Yo' money is tied up, bitch my money is the dominatrix
Yo' money's funny, my money's mean
Yo' money's scummy, my money's clean
Yo' money is... stupid
My money is "get over here, finish him. hadouken"

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Ch-Ch-Ch-Children put on your angry faces
Mothers hide your daughters
I've been busy burning bridges
Hovering over troubled waters
City folk will never understand
The country mouse's jokes
They'd rather sit and watch the lemmings
Lead each other to the slaughter
This is me thanking you dearly
Sincerely, from the bottom of what's left of my misery magnet
Guess I been too busy being stagnant
And if I ever steer you wrong
Grab the wheel and jerk it left
I'm only human but admitted
I'm such a beautiful mess

[Hook]
With the mad hatter cackle
And the cheshire cat smile (Haha)
Put the jabberwocks cadaver
With derelict juvenile (Oh)
The futures got Travie engraved
On a name plate that I copped on fulton
While the passers poppin pills
Somewhere on the other side of Brooklyn
So this is me in front of the class naked
This reoccurring nightmare never ending
So I'm saying hello (So I'm saying hello)
And now I'm screaming hello (Now I'm screaming hello)
Is anybody out there?
Now this is me in front of the class naked
This reoccurring nightmare never ending
So I'm saying hello (So I'm saying hello)
And now I'm screaming hello
Can anybody hear me?

[Verse 2]
Baby let's ride the steel horse
Until it stops galloping
And let the nerds get revenge
On these stars with lamar's javelin
Here betty, put this vader mask on
And take me to the dark side bumpin your favorite song
And I promise i'll stand still
Until the feeling is gone
And if I slip and bust it's
Cause we must be doing it wrong
Oh by the way
If you happen to meet the asshole
That wrote the manual
Tell'em large marge sent me to murk'em and make it casual

[Hook]
With the mad hatter cackle
And the cheshire cat smile (Haha)
Put the jabberwocks cadaver
With derelict juvenile (Oh)
The futures got Travie engraved
On a name plate that I copped on fulton
While the passers poppin pills
Somewhere on the other side of Brooklyn

So this is me in front of the class naked
This reoccurring nightmare never ending
So I'm saying hello (So I'm saying hello)
And now I'm screaming hello (Now I'm screaming hello)
Is anybody out there?
Now this is me in front of the class naked
This reoccurring nightmare never ending
So I'm saying hello (So I'm saying hello)
And now I'm screaming hello
Can anybody hear me?

[Bridge]
So I'm leaving the grocery store the other day
Probably one of the hardest things I have to do
In a regular basis, you know
With my anxiety and all
And a women walks up to me (Hey aren't you travie?)
She doesn't say hello
She just grabs me
And I can feel my heart beating harder and harder and harder
(I'm from upstate too) (Uh, cool)
I can feel the skin on my chest getting tighter and tighter
Until I just, until I just
Fucking spontaniously combust

[Hook]
With the mad hatter cackle
And the cheshire cat smile (Haha)
Put the jabberwocks cadaver
With derelict juvenile (Oh)
The futures got Travie engraved
On a name plate that I copped on fulton
While the passers poppin pills
Somewhere on the other side of Brooklyn

So this is me in front of the class naked
This reoccurring nightmare never ending
So I'm saying hello (So I'm saying hello)
And now I'm screaming hello (Now I'm screaming hello)
Is anybody out there?
Now this is me in front of the class naked
This reoccurring nightmare never ending
So I'm saying hello (So I'm saying hello)
And now I'm screaming hello
Can anybody hear me?

Can anybody hear me?

[Outro]
Hi, did you like the music?
I liked it
It was awesome
Hey, my favorite song was the one where the base went
"bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum"
And the guitar went "wee wee wee wee"
And the drums went "drummy drum drum drum drum drum drum drum drum
Do you remember that song?
I liked that
I want more music
Hey, have you ever wondered if a seahorse could win
A game of backgammon against an invisible wizard?
I think the invisible wizard would win
Because the seahorse does not have hands
Hey, have you ever seen an invisible wizard?
Probably not
Because it's invisible
Hey, remember that time when we were on that spaceship
And there were talking dinosaurs
And then one of the dinosaurs said:
"I cannot talk"
And I said: "You just did"
And the dinosaur didn't say anything else because
He couldn't talk?
Hey, are you listening to me?
Remember that stick of broccoli that used
To play the banjo at the annual platypus convention?
He owes me money
Hey, I'm cool
Hey, good night
(Yea, yea, cle-cleveland style!)

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
84 Kid Mesc was born
On my own since they cut the umbilical cord
When I was born, witness to divorce and scorn
Ever since that happened, I was daily torn
Didn't understand nothing but I'm happy
Instead of being cool, my family kept on snapping
Cool out shit 12 a nigga was rapping
My father died, the pain is still
Look in the mirror man, I see real
Touch my reflection, feels what I feel
The letter is written: stamped and sealed
Intoxicated, spill for spill
And I ain't never seen a gang making deals for deals
Cover my mind and witness why
There's the time in the world and no time to die

[Hook]
I ain't trying to upset nobody
I'm just trying to be me
Everywhere I go man, people like "he's still rapping?
Yeah that's right man, you still gun clapping?
I'm on to bigger positive things
Trying to live out a dream
I'm the MVP, look at my ring
What y'all know about the street games, you're just
Dreaming em up. Not trying to make a come-up
Going to sleep at night praying to god
Wishing that you had that bad bitch in your arm
I'm that kid tryna make things happen
Up in the club, watching gangstas clapping
And I'm that kid that be steady rapping in the booth
Throw out my demo and that's a Hot 97 proof
And you don't wanna sign me, fuck are y'all on?
I go next to the next dude that wanna put me on
And that's real, cause I'm only me
The K-I-D, not trying to become the next OG

[Hook]

Relax daily 

[-]
Ya know what I mean, less acting
More me and me, less them
In the pool of magical ones, I will not swim
Not on the hottest day or the warmest night
I'm free like a bird nigga, I should take flight
Plain nigga, the one less hoes like
Even if I had jewels that could dim light
Off they would never look, rather read a book
Know I'm semi-wrong, got 'em shook
Now they know Scott, and they know I plot
Don't trust hoes, they just want the knot
Till I abuse it, baby I love music, not
Really ain't no question, just lessons
At confessions, never false preaching
Real recognize through deception and lies
So, keep it music, baby keep it going steady
It won't be long, my niggas, till everybody witness

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I hate when it rains
All I really do is sit on my ass
Thinking about the next scheme just to double my cash
If I ain't thinking about cash, nigga
I'm thinking about life
Making a change, no winners do the same shit twice
Rainy days are a pain just rest on my veins
Can't go to sleep somebody's looking through my window pane
Man, I swear I'm going catch em'
But maybe I'm trippin
Like Scarface, my mind's playing tricks on me homie, will it
Rain, shit! I just wanna know where Do is
Is he safe, warm and out the elements, mommy let him come home
I think a niggas done doing wrong
I get scared of the day when the soul will be gone
The spoken words to thoughts, never be spittin' in vain
Seems like the only way to sunshine is through the hard rain
I need to find a path leading to change
Ask God if he feels my pain
And please, won't you stop the rain?

[Hook]
Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Feels My Pain
Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Feels My Pain

[Verse 2]
Rain clouds started forming
Gathered around my father's homecoming
When his soul on this earth was summoned
I remember a white church
And my lips had a salty taste
From the tears running down my face
Can't erase the hurt
Watchin' my father's body lowered in dirt
While my uncle and cousin passed too
What's life worth?
If it rained
Sometimes I would just sit there and cry
At recess, didn't wanna play, I just wished I would die
Things rushed through my head back when I was eleven
Praying and hoping that my dad had made it to heaven
It was hard being the youngest
And no one helped me
Everybody seemed happy
And no one felt me
But regardless of the fact
I did the best that I can
Making the transition from boy
Straight to a grown man
But understand, I felt the shame
And I feel the same, that God just needs...
To stop the rain

[Hook]
Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Feels My Pain
Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Feels My Pain

[Verse 3]
Back then I was young
Now I'm grown here to fend on my own
I'm speaking and bringing the truth through this lyrical poem
And it's hard cause these niggas can't see...
Open up your eyes you can recognize me
I felt the rain like every other nigga did
Nigga always slip and stand up so I slid
It's part of the life
While every thing seems trife
And everything wrong very well may be right
It's just confusing and some people can't handle
There mind breaks down, and their hearts start to dismantle
But I'm that boy to use to have the evil dreams
Now I realize that this life is way more then it seems
It's just somethin you learn on the daily as your mind matures
Can't ruin the life with a heart so pure
And since I realize that things won't change
God you can keep with the same
Cause I'm a just deal with the rain!

[Hook]
I'ma Deal With The Rain
Tell God Just To Keep It The Same
I'm a Deal With The Rain
Tell God Just To Keep It The Same](id Cudi: Mumbles]
Ok. Whys that?
You know in Cleveland it rains, not all the time but
To a kid who wants to go out and play, it seems like it rains everyday
Kids expect it to rain sometimes but, for one kid it rained too much

[Verse 1]

But I'll be constantly fooling myself

To have what I've only been dreaming about

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody wants something, gotta want something

Always let love take the lead

You know I'm drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Whatever we do, it's between me and you

Don't mind catching up
I'm on my way
Just can't take the thought of you miles away

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know it'll be sadder
If you never hit the road

[Chorus]
So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's me

[Verse 2]
I will write to tell you what's goin' on
But you won't miss nothing but the same old song
If you don't mind catching up
I'll spend the day telling you stories about a land far away
But I know

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life (Oh)
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go

If you never hit the road

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Hey
Big Jerm, cool beat that we made here, man
I played the keys, you play the drums, did a little bass on this one
Uh
Hey
(Ha) Alright, alright, alright, alright
'92 'til infinity and beyond

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
You witnessin' ya gambles of infinity
Music in my soul, on the go, ain't gettin' rid of me
Peace and divinity in each and every inch of me
We livin' through this melody, you singin' in a different key
See, I'm nice with these rhymes, I might be blind
Just see inside of minds, I gets unkind
I'm like a psychic; I don't give a fuck if you like this
We here to party, had a little music to turn up loud
Uh, '92 'til infinity just some shit that you ain't heard in a while
I don't give a fuck if there ain't a party
We got a little music to turn up loud
We different, got our life that we livin', standin' out in the crowd

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
That boom bap rap
They ask me how I do it, I'ma tell 'em I'm just cool like that
Alright, alright, alright, alright, that boom bap rap
When they ask you what you doin'
Tell 'em that you cool and keepin' it movin'
Ain't nothin' new, I'ma do what I do

[Verse 2: Franchise]
Yo
Pullin' up in somethin' that you haven't seen
Clean and accompanied by one of the baddest queens
Peel the top back, feelin' superb as I pass the green
We just cool and vibin' without the magazine
Breezin' through 376 thinkin' 'bout my past ventures
Came from runnin', duckin' and jumpin' over fences
Used to play reckless tryna get the check 

[?]
Now it's visions with my camp from the triple deck yacht
I can't stop, won't stop, I keep runnin'
Unleash the beast, 

[?] and keep comin'
Nasty but we spit it so sincerely
Drip phlegm from the pen so they can feel me
Boom bap ones with the hip-hop
They say we different, wonder how we do it, but it's sealed in a ziplock
Killin' beats from '87 'til the end of me
And Mac been involved since '92 until infinity

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
That boom bap rap
They ask me how I do it, I tell 'em I'm just cool like that
Alright, alright, alright, alright, that boom bap rap
When they ask you what you doin'
Tell 'em that you cool and keepin' it movin'
Ain't nothin' new, I'ma do what I do

[Verse 3: Vinny Radio]
This that boom bap shit, return of mister boom bapstic
Most Dope makin' new classics
Screem beef dog, look, lose that shit
You ain't built for contact, better do glasses
Haters get mad, my view zoom past 'em
You lose that, bitch, you think local, I do atlas
Vinny Radio do that shit
It's like bird flu how I move that sick-ness
Got my money lookin' healthy, work to stretch it every day, we call it physical fit-ness
Made my name in the game from playin' no games but givin' these beats the busi-ness
It's a guaranteed conviction every time I kill a track, I'm lettin' you all wit-ness
We deserve a reward for bringin' back that boom bap rap that you miss-in'

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
That boom bap rap
They ask me how I do it, I tell 'em I'm just cool like that
Alright, alright, alright, alright, that boom bap rap
When they ask you what you doin'
Tell 'em that you cool and keepin' it movin'
Ain't nothin' new, I'ma do what I do

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Ahh!
Bitch, it's T-Raw, blood on my paws
Big booty chick back a nigga to the wall
Never get involved, murder every bar
Shit so illegal, need a green card
Different cars, different from y'all
I work hard, you work at the mall
Pass a bitch off like my nigga John Wall
Fuck her in the dark, gimme the light, Sean Paul
(Yeahhh), bitch I do this shit
Cooler than a motherfucking penguin limp
& my bitch pussy fire gotta extinguish it, Lebron James & shit
Got heat super freak Rick James ya bitch, leave a stain & shit
On ya couch in ya house like Brother Man
Hanging like Mr. Cooper Hahn

[Chorus: Tyga]
Posing, Heisman
Posing, Heisman
Posing, Heisman

[Verse 2: Honey Cocaine]
Yo, got a Asian bitch on my left side
Another Asian bitch, right, right side
They might send your ass off to the next side
Bitch hold your damn breath cause you might die
Gotta group of bad bitches and I feel good
Oh your hungry? Too bad cause my meals good
And I shouldn't beat a broad, yet I still would
But I won't try and be bad, cause the deal's good
Yeah, now look I got that urge to feed them off some gold and shit

[Type of stuff] and make them feel like alcohol and 

[gold] and shit
Hold the bitch, just sold the bitch, 'fuck you pay me' is what I told the bitch
You can't walk or talk, I own you bitch
Please don't make me hot, I'm the coldest bitch (agh)

[Chorus: Tyga]
Posing, Heisman

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Well, running from the cop, boy born to kill
Hand me the lock, bring it to your front door, doorbell
Knock knock, who there? Houdini dissappear
Got green, John Deere. More green, Paul Pierce
(agh) Amazing with the shot, you my son, I adopt dot dot
Pac-Man, that's for opening your mouth
Bust a nut, kick her out, lit a cigarrette now
Put the cigarette down, I'm the shit, loose bowels
Wow, Laughing, did I say that out loud?
Nigga getting busy like I work downtown
On to the next if she don't fuck right now (right now)
Harder than a pipe, can't pipe down
What you niggas talking about?
Man I'm what your bitch is talking about
Two months then the album out
Careless World drop, pewm, then I'm out

[Chorus: Tyga]
Posing, Heisman

[Verse 4: Honey Cocaine]
If a bitch fuck around, I'mma go off
My advice is she better get on the go
You came to shop at the mall but I bought the stores
I got a box of jewels, I call it pot of gold
Got the cop to go, as my pockets grow
Check the chains and the rings and the watches bro
And I boxed a slut, I just boxed a ho
You tryna pass me bitch? It ain't possible, nah
I'm cool as fuck, I suggest you dress for the weather bitch
It's whatever shit, whenever bitch
What a whore to a queen? Whatever bitch
I crop a kid, it's a hot to shit
Some Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Prada Shit
Tell them eat a dick, you ain't nada bitch
Find me at the club where my partners is
(Swag, Be-Betch)

[Chorus: Tyga]
Posing, Heisman

(Bitch I'm the shit)

[Verse 1]
It's still ringing in my ear, you screaming "I don't care"
And I can see it like it just went down, me walking out of there
I still see 'em on your face baby, so many tears
And I remember feeling like I'm 'bout to explode, gotta get out of here

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like my sun won't shine, it's like my ride don't roll
It's like the only one thing I love don't love me no more
It's like my right gone wrong, it's like my ice gone warm
'Cause the only one thing I love don't love me no more

[Chorus]
If I hadn't just slacked up on my pimping, you'd be here with me
If I'd a stayed instead of dipping, you'd be here with me
If I'd a prayed instead of wishing, you'd still be here with me
But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again

[Verse 2]
I wish that I could run that back, but in life you can't press rewind
'Cause the only way to fix this thang is to go back in time
'Cause if I had my way, yesterday would be right now
Instead of fighting we'd be making love 'til the sun go down

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like my sun won't shine, it's like my ride don't roll
It's like the only one thing I love don't love me no more
It's like my right gone wrong, it's like my ice gone warm
'Cause the only one thing I love don't love me no more

[Chorus]
If I hadn't just slacked up on my pimping, you'd be here with me
If I'd a stayed instead of dipping, you'd be here with me
If I'd a prayed instead of wishing, you'd still be here with me
But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again
If I hadn't just slacked up on my pimping, you'd be here with me
If I'd a stayed instead of dipping, you'd be here with me
If I'd a prayed instead of wishing, you'd still be here with me
But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again

[Bridge]
If I could just hold my shawty, if I could kiss my shawty
If I could get my shawty back
If I could just see you baby, if we could talk then baby
I would have my lady back

[Chorus]
If I hadn't just slacked up on my pimping, you'd be here with me
If I'd a stayed instead of dipping, you'd be here with me
If I'd a prayed instead of wishing, you'd still be here with me
But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again]
If I hadn't just slacked up on my pimping, calling you out on your name
If I'd a stayed instead of dipping, disrespecting my mane baby
You see Jesus would've told me something if I'd a called on him, still be here with me
But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like my sun won't shine, it's like my ride don't roll
It's like the only one thing I love don't love me no more
It's like my right gone wrong, it's like my ice gone warm
'Cause the only one thing I love don't love me no more

[Outro]
I keep thinking if, oh if, if I, you'd be here with me
I keep thinking if, oh if, if I, still be here with me
What good is if if you ain't here? Still be here with me
But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again
Won't bring you back again, it won't bring you back again
Ain't gonna bring you back

[Intro]
Yeah yeah, uh yeah
Yeah yeah
Carolina, nigga
Fayettenam, nigga
Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
This is for them street niggas to them deep niggas
Them politics, them geek niggas
To them freak bitches that swallow dick, it's real
Or them sheep niggas in Prada shit and still
Even them bleak niggas without a cent could feel
I never sleep nigga, I gotta get them mills
I never cheat nigga, my heart is with the Ville
When niggas greet niggas with hollow tips, but chill
You'll never reach nigga, I got an itch to kill
Word, a nigga bringing heat to the third
My shit in every street, like the curb
So bitches wanna meet 'cause I'm deep with my words
So them niggas wanna peep like a perv
But peep game
Before they start saying "he changed"
A real nigga can never forget where he came
So if I'm up in Carolina kicking deep game
Or if I'm riding through Queens like the E-train
I throw it up!
Yeah

[Chorus]
If you a down south nigga, throw it up, (and)
If you an east coast nigga, throw it up, (yeah)
If you a west coast nigga, throw it up, (ay)
If you a midwest nigga, throw it up, (ay)
If you a Fayettenam nigga, throw it up, (yeah)
If you a ATL nigga, throw it up
New York to L.A. niggas, throw it up
Yeah, Chi-town throw it up (yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
As you niggas smoking more kush
South niggas run you niggas, ask George Bush
Ask Bill Clinton, a nigga Will Smithin'
My jeans a lil less baggy, money still fittin.'
The streets a lil less rowdy, but they still kickin'
Them Randy Johnson O.G. niggas still pitchin'
And yeah, I know she got a man, but I'm still hittin'
So when he be up in that shit, he be like 'This feels different, "
No shit, throw dick like the veteran I am
I got that vitamin D, it's like medicine to them
I got her climaxing like it's never finna end
That's why she fucking me a lot better than her man
She try a new trick, she so wet a nigga swam
Like a salmon in this bitch, my dick drowning in that shit
They love a fly nigga on that frisbee shit
Plus a nigga get Gs like them Disney flicks
I throw it up!
Yea

[Chorus]
If you a down south nigga, throw it up, (and)
If you an east coast nigga, throw it up, (yeah)
If you a west coast nigga, throw it up, (ay)
If you a mid-west nigga, throw it up, (ay)
If you a Fayettenam nigga, throw it up, (yeah)
If you a ATL nigga, throw it up
New York to L.A. niggas, throw it up
Yeah, Chi-town throw it up (yeah)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Real niggas want the money, so that's where my aim is
Ho niggas love the attention, wanna be famous
Real niggas fuck the attention, they know it's dangerous
Rather make a mil' and nobody know what my name is, (uh)
But that's the price when you nice with it
And them ladies gonna like 'cause you light-skinned
I take advantage of the situation
I'm hitting dimes from Atlanta up to Pennsylvania
They catch feelings and I switch next
"I made it clear baby, just sex
I'm too young to settle down, shorty get dressed! "
Even them white girls tryna be my princess
But I only fuck with sisters like incest
I've been stressed, I'm so in-depth
I get this weight up off my chest like a bench-press
I sense death in the air, but it's nothing for me
Some niggas better be aware or meet the cousin of sleep, get it?
You slow niggas still ain't felt that shit
How she gonna upgrade me dog? I built that chick
Rapping's a cash cow, finna milk that bitch
You better hit up homicide, I just killed that shit, boy!

[Outro]
Throw it up nigga!
Throw throw it, throw it up!
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
I heard my teacher say that I’d be better off
If I just took what I’ve been given
They said I never know what to do
Unless I’m told
I feel underestimated, So unaccounted for
Then you want to call me to your office right after school
And tell me your version of my future

[Hook]
But let’s take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don’t talk me out of it
Don’t talk me out of it
It’s my life, Don’t talk me out of my life
It’s my life

[Verse 2]
I used to put an apple on Ms. Jacob’s desk
But she never liked me
She said I’m gon’ fail, no matter what I give
She said ’cause my skin wasn’t light enough
Tuition wasn’t high enough
I couldn’t understand just what I did
So underestimated, You left me unaccounted for
Now you want to call me to your office right after school
And now you wanna tell me, your version of my future

[Hook]
But let’s take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don’t talk me out of it
Don’t talk me out of it
It’s my life, Don’t talk me out of my life
It’s my life

[Bridge]
Just tell me how
You’re much better than me now
You tore me down till there was nothing left
Look at me, Look at me, Look at me, Look at me
I’m still standing
Look at me
Look at me now, Look me in my eyes

[Hook]
But let’s take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don’t talk me out of it
Don’t talk me out of it
It’s my life, Don’t talk me out of my life
It’s my life

[Verse 1: V-Nasty]
I think they mad cause I'm relevant
Big choppers put holes in elephants
I got a bad bitch and she's elegant
Bet a hundred thousand that bitch selling it
I'm on the block, bitch I'm doing hella shit
Them suckers over there, looking is irrelevant
I got a bolo coming from Mexico
And if the bitches talking gas, they ass like Texaco
I'm a reckless ho, you can't check this ho
Bitch, my outfit cost more than your necklace, ho
And I'm doing shit that you never seen before
Having withdrawals, man, hurry where my blow

[Hook: V-Nasty]
Fuck you! Bitch fuck your mama too!
You can't fuck with us
You can't do what we do

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I got a swag so sick make the whole crowd cough
I got a Lamborghini, hit the gas, the bitch get lost
You with a loser, need to lose him, it's not your loss
I got a suburban tender, she stay in Norcross
I'm a boss, you's a worker boy, go jerk off
Brick Squad on the stage, know our shirts off
And I'm horny as a rhino and her ass soft
I got a fetish for a fine ho: I break her off
Let's get it on, let's get it in
Let's get it on, do it again
So bring a friend if you want to
Don't tell me what you won't do
Want me like I want you? All night long!
Let's get it on!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slim Dunkin]
I fuck her, you lick her
I hit her and pass her
The number at the light, I'mma fuck her by tonight
She say a friend to dice, she allergic to the pipe
Angie ridin' around no shoes, fuckin' quittin' on dudes
10k from my parents
Same shoes on clearance
Fuck your mama, your sister and your kids
Would say fuck your girl but I already did
I be in and out her jaw, can't go in and out her raw
And I got them birds, man: I be stuntin like my paws
Do it private when I travel: plane
Louis in my baggie claim
Standing on them couches with V-Nasty and Gucci Mane
All the ice on my hands got my fingers cold
Call me Slim Dunk: I don't finger roll..

[Hook]

[Intro: Travie McCoy]
Oh, it's so sexy, yo

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & Travie McCoy]
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (Ya)
For one more chance to hold you close
(It's your boy Travie, Gym Class Heroes)
I don't know where you're going (Let's go, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions (No)
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets down right shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke I told you I wouldn't be long
That was last November, now December's almost gone
I'd apologize, but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong
I never know

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & Travie McCoy]
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (That's love, yeah)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, okay, what's that?)
Just get your ass back home

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
And you've been nothing but amazing and I'll never take that for granted
Half of these birds would've flew the coop but you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me every time you heard some bogusness (Tough love)
You deserve a standing O cause they'd have just been over it
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
'Cause you and I above all that, just let 'em wallow in it
And now they all choked up, yuck, 'cause they be swallowin' it

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & Travie McCoy]
I don't know where you're going (Yeah)
Or when you're coming home (Alright)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm coming home, mama)
(Mama, I'm coming home)
To our front door (That's love)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

[Interlude: Travie McCoy]
No one holds me down like you do, sweetheart
You keep doing that, I'll keep doing this
And we'll be alright, trust that
We put the "us" in "trust", baby
Ahh, let's go!

[Bridge: Neon Hitch]
I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & Travie McCoy]
I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Or when you're coming home (Okay)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm home now, baby, let's go)
To our front door (Uh-huh)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going
Just get your ass back home

[Outro: Travie McCoy]
I'm home, baby

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, Kendrick Lamar, do it again
Alright, here we go, third take (Dead)
Rigamortus Remix, it feel good
Real quick Ali (Kendrick Lamar, fuck it up this time)
Haha, yeah

[Chrous: Kendrick Lamar]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic
I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yessir (Amen) Chuuch
(He dead) I killed him (Amen) Bitch

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
And this is rigamortis and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus, the Matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme if you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on Cloud 9
And that's important when you morph into a angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply and tell me
That you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'mma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you could fight, we always making them duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI, just might investigate this fucking parasite
(He dead, amen) That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
Ferragami so many and cool enough for the 70's
Nigga, payback's a bitch and bitch you been living in debt with me
That I more than especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail
To say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, it's just me Jay Rock, Soul and Q
Solar system and barbeque, ain't nothing else you can do

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
(He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I killed him
(He dead) Haha (Amen) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) yup-yup (Amen) I know
(He dead)  fo' sho (Amen) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I rapped him and made him Casper, I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster
Your hypocrite-esque reaction a blasphemy
I assassin my casualty and it's casually done and tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds don't talk to be 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see any assistance, everybody done see
Some persistence, recognize I be really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the streets, better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see, putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitchin', getting mad at me, recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up and the catastrophe is charged up and the audacity
And y'all fucks, never could hassle me and y'all luck, just ran out you'll see

[Chrous: Kendrick Lamar & Busta Rhymes]
(He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I know
(He dead) For sure (Amen) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I know (Oh! Come on!)
(He dead) For sure (Amen) Amen (Busta Bust! I got it!)

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Pull up and park in my Caddy that's when I fuck it up badly
Frankly, I'm happy to tell niggas "Have manners 'front they daddy"
I carry the Anthony Mackie and put holes in you badly
Fuck sending you off in a hearse, I'll send you off in a taxi
Have you bloody leaky looking like you tampon or maxi
Retaliation talk (Shut the fuck up nigga!) Exactly
Nasty the classy the flashiest how I'm on it
Don't ask me no kind of questions and mention I'll leave your face in a pantry
And gladly lump up your shit and bumpin' your face up like acne
Break your teeth, replace them with veneers bigger than Little Scrappy
Feeling like growing my dread again letting my shit get nappy
Throw me on a New York fitted while reppin' like I'm a Yankee
If they wanna front then I hit em and I tap em
Eat a nigga's food like its a scampi
When it come to bitch niggas, I'm a little bit a racist
Governor Pataki Papi, here to massacre aunti
Now pops was a little bit manly, fuck all that aiming
I'mma hit him in the front, hit him in the back so substanc-y
Then I gotta Bit-a-bit-a-bit-a-bit-a-beat a nigga leave him in the alley
You don't really really know how you niggas always be making me aggie
Organs in your drawers now you wearing your pants saggy
Haggling niggas with scriptures I'm spittin, you should be happy
Gradually when I hit you I split you and leave you sadly
In a situation lay you out flatter than chicken patties
It's the God, you hear me talking whenever you hear the raspy
And when it comes to murkin' something you should never put it past me!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic
I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yessir (Amen) Chuuch
(He dead) I killed him (Amen) Amen

[Hook]: save it for another day
I ain’t try to hear that shit no way
Hold up
Let me take two steps
And you can miss me with that bullshit
Miss me with that bullshit
Miss me with that bullshit

[Verse 1]: you looking at a eight figure nigga
Gone of the liquor
And I'm Fired up like the booty of a swisha
Make the trunk shake like a California quake
And everywhere I go these bitches tryna take my picture
All white beamer accentuated features
Salt around the rim like a fucking margarita
Cops profiling but Im still wylin'
Hopin that they never find the cannabis sativa
Smoke in moderation like niggas on probation
I break it like a record then I put it in rotation
Pass it like a test cause this system got me stressed
So when they stop me askin for license and registration I'm like

[Hook]

[Verse 2]: Yeah, pass the lighter
I'm rolling like a tire
And yeah we are about to blow I got that bomb like alquaeda
The streets are not at ease so I keep the desert eeeg (eagle)
Any given day you can get this cannon like mariah
Yea I rock your cradle drop you like your label
Got some firearms come illegal like my cable
Try me and you wishin for a gang of ammunition
I'm handy with this cap people thinkin I'm disabled
Couple ladies with me cause I'm long like pippy
So you'll just find yourself in a manage like nicki
A sucker for them curves with over a billion serves
I said bitch get on Dees (this) and I ain't talkin bout mickey

[Hook]

Ugh Far from sober drivin on the shoulder
Bass boom trunk got that thunder like Oklahoma
Woofers and them tweeters My Acura got beat
My kickers go hard yea my speakers got a boner its
Chrome kitted five percent tinted
On the highway gettin head I told her push me to the limit
She got my balls sprung like I hit a home run
She make her mouth streeetch like the fuckin seventh innin'
So its one two three strikes you outta there
Luda got em playin with they self like solitaire
Birds of a feather 'spose to stick together
But thicker women sayin they friend look like Halle Berry
I'm like

[Hook]

[Intro]
You know, you don't see with your eyes
You see with your brain
And the more words your brain has
The more things you can see

[Verse 1]
Yes yes y'all, it don't stop, it can't stop, it won't stop
We used to be there rapping on the block
It was like hip-hop would never stop
But then we all got older, and a little bit bolder
The streets of New York got a little bit colder
I'm a young dude, I gotta learn and get over
1980, Brooklyn is crazy in the dark
But there I am in Wingate Park
Jamming to the DJs creating this art
I'm on E, but I'm free and I wanna be part
So I gotta be smart and then it just sparked
I'mma start with my heart, achieving the mark
Of being the number one MC on the chart
So on your mark get ready go
I Rock Steadied the show with DJ Scott La Rock, you already know
Yo, these were the days when bands were elected
Based on the jams they selected so check it
This man got respected
When fans detected that the South Bronx
Was the new answer record

[Hook]
And just like that, just like that, just like that
I speak into the air and
Just like that, just like that, just like that
My dreams they did appear so
Just like that, just like that, just like that
You speak into the air and
Just like that, just like that, just like that
Your dreams they will appear so

[Verse 2]
Just like that I was right on top
Me and Scott La Rock but then Scott La Rock got shot
I can hear him echoing: "hip-hop don't stop"
But we was getting robbed like a bank with no lock
By a record company that was taking a lot
People blaming us and shaming us, but then it all stopped
When By All Means Necessary dropped
It was like the whole damn hip-hop culture stopped
But that's when the vultures dropped, from the culture shock
Because we was showing people how they supposed to rock
With their hands in the air and they mouth on scream
But in '81 this was just a dream
But we kept dreaming, kept decreeing, kept seeing
Kept being hip-hop, breaking, MCing
Graffiti writing, DJing on the weekend
It's the proper use of your mind I'm teaching

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Just like that, I began to see
The true force and the power of M-I-N-D
Now I am free and yes I can be
The amazing MC I saw in 81
Back then I was the crazy one
Even the lazy one, the not sure, the maybe one
Now today I'm the sure one, the on tour one
The raw one, the one you want more from
But it was all a dream
Now this brother's on the cover of Word Up magazine
Hanging fliers on my wall
Boogie Down Productions vs MC Shan and Marley Marl
You know my tape rocks, I don't say pop
If I couldn't find OE, then I got the Private Stock
Way back where them Dapper Dan jackets at
With the hat to match, all that

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Just like that, now it's '91
And the West Coast Era now has just begun
And you can't run, crack cocaine affects everyone
Now we know the military, they brought in several tons
Forget them old guns they brought in better ones
The name of this new game is stack your set of ones
For me I remember 1981
When I first wanted to rap it was mainly fun
But hip-hop was made to run
So them dudes that think it's all about money their day will come
And it comes for many, and it's scary
To learn your whole career was really temporary
But on the contrary we can look at the past
And see the major recording artists that didn't last
But here comes the blast, in order to last
Be the real you, man, take off the mask

[Hook]

[Hook]
This world ends, this world ends
This world ends, this world ends
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now

[Verse 1]
She love her people so much
Came to my show just to throw her flag up and
Pray to God that I saw her
Wonder if she saw my scarf for Palestine all on it
Love the struggle, Valentine all on it
Put my heart into it
Like Noah's Ark I'm too into it
Like justice I'm just too influenced not to do this to it
This one dedicated to the soldiers
Throw up peace signs in the face of bulldozers
Never bow down or wrap their body in explosives
As long as your alive, fight your whole lifetime
The Horn of Africa needs you
Calling out to all you friends of the people
Be the change that you wanna see
Tell em no change just ain't what it gonna be

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, the people, united, will never be defeated
And on the People's Mic this forever be repeated
Whose streets, our streets, it'll never be deleted
No matter how many cops that you send to try and beat it
This is revolution in the making
A ragtag movement set to takeover the nation
Now isn't that fun
You just wanna make the world better, isn't that young
Well, blessings to the youth then
And don't stop, until they let the truth in
Once there, never let it leave
And protect it, they'll catch it and never set it free
And every set is free
Blood sweat and tears, no place I'd rather be
So, let's occupy Wall Street, all day, all week

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So again, I fight evil
This what I gotta do to live my life peaceful
So be it, outspoken and low key it
My heart big, limousine no Fiat
And you can hear it loud every time God beat it
Love always shines every time I see it
Exactly what they hated is exactly what I needed
And exactly where I started is exactly where I leave it
Cause I ain't never ever ever change
I say that because I ain't never felt better mane
Beautiful LASERS as fans, do me a favor, this is how I repay ya
Friend of the peeps, free Chill, Esco at peace
Holla at me if you see me in the streets
A picture costs a dollar, First and Fifteenth

[Hook]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Yield, to the forces of darkness
I bring you the torches of our shit
Reinforced with hardness of Wolverine's
Arms with the harshness and overall sharpness
Now how far do the arms get?
My nigga, from the stars to the starfish
From the baby to the Bar Mitz
It's a whole lot of light and a whole lot of arm length
My arms long, but I'm lawless
A strong arm, I can lift up all this
You gon' have to build a bigger farm fence
To keep them wolves out of Old MacDonald barn, bitch
Yeah, Team Jacob
We're long armed, put my hands on a lear
Everytime I put my hands in the air
Watch the throne as I dance in the chair
Throw my crown in the crowd, hope it lands on the heir
The weak niggas like to pass interfere
Spit a lot of meh over jams of the year
That act like the man up in here
That don't count when your only real fan is a mirror
That's subliminal to any nigga that he feel he is too
But you don't stand a chance, playa
I am there, Chi-Town, fan of the Bears
Love where they dance in the square
Yeah, Yankees too, but only cause Granderson there
And now wears khaki pants on La Brea
We all friends, why your man lookin' scared?
Turning whiter than Anderson hair
Came out the garage like he saw a phantom in there, huh

[Verse 2]
Old shit alert, Louis clothes
Callin women bitches, Louboutins and Gucci shows
Well, I guess there goes my Louis shows
More old shit, if your role model's a movie role
And if you live your life like it's a studio
Talkin' to us like we mics, a bunch of you ain't do befo'
Electric fences for a urinal
Also keep a toaster in my jacuzzi, yo
Shaka Zulu, call me Wasalu II
Oh shit, man these record labels prostitute you
Strap them to sushi bars, and feed em lots of fugu
Catch a bad piece
You can stick that 360 between your asscheeks
Artists let's mobilize and unionize like the athletes
Radio is making our craft weak
Forced to repeat the same dumb shit that work
Only as hot as your last beat
And rappers, they relating to that last piece
Album never leave they desk if you don't got no B.D.S
Sacrifice your publishin', they said you really need a hook
And they ain't gon' pay you, said that you received a look
And what's stupid real, is what producers feel
Twenty placements or you stuck in that producer deal
And R&B chicks so get it the wildest
All they money goes to hairdressers and stylists
Gotta keep up with that image
Label lose they mind if they ever see a blemish
ProActiv and peels, airbrushers and trainers
Managers suggest you fuck a nigga to be famous, huh
But it's all entertainment
Wonder when Cobain blew out his brains, did he blame it?
And if those snakes in the industry helped him aim it
Started pressing up records before the bullet left the chamber
I fight evil, everyday I'm livin'
Rest in peace to men, women and the children
And middle fingers to the Pilgrims that killed 'em
Friend of the People, happy Thanksgiving
Intro: 

[Howard Zinn]
We have to stop wars, we have to stop this war
And we have to get out the habit of war
It's more than a habit, it's an addiction
We have to get out of thinking that we must be a military superpower

We must get out of thinking that we must have military bases, as we have in a hundred countries
Is it possible that having military bases in a hundred countries arouses a lot of antagonism?
Is it possible that it promotes terrorism when your soldiers and your sailors are all over the world, occupying this country and that? Is it possible?

Why do we have to be a military superpower?
Why can't we be a humanitarian superpower?
Instead of sending planes for bombs
Why don't we send planes for food and medicine?

[Soldier One]
Oh shit, it's one of the machines
Looks like it's trapped under something, it's broken or something

[Soldier Two]
Let's get out here -- we cannot stay

[Soldier One]
Hold on lemme get my keyboard, I can re-program this thing

[Soldier Two]
It doesn't matter. Leave it!

[Soldier One]
No seriously, I can do it -- just give me a second!

[Computer -- continuously]
Reprogramming unsuccessful

[Machine -- continuously]
Enemy -- I kill people

[Soldier One]
I swear to God, man, I can do this! I can do this!
Cross your fingers
You have to work!
All right, this is the last time

[Computer]
Reprogramming successful

[Soldier One]
Yes!

[Machine]
Friend..I.. fight.. evil..

[Verse 1]
Cold blooded, chilly skin
Can't touch it like your front wheel when it's wheely-ing
Wanna see Chilly free like Free Willy friend
Wanted to see Free Willy really swim
I'm super cold, my jacket thin
I'm two below like a marching band
That means I'm super-deep, you surface skim
I'm the whole thing, you niggas 2%
Put em up on that carton, I think I'm losing em
Bring all those St. Bernards in
Let's get some booze in them
You know them dogs with them barrels on they neck
And I'mma keep it cool like airholes on a Tec
I be moving birds like a scarecrow's on the set
Part dope-ass nigga, an old man winter
Christmastime diamond singing carols on my chest
Step up off the jet
Looking like a Pharaoh in the flesh

[Chorus]
I'm super cold

[Verse 2]
I'm super-cold, my freezer deep
My cooler closed: air-conditioned seats
I don't trust them niggas, they conviction weak
They be thawing out, my commitment keeps
Twelve months, hope that well jumps
Seems like selling souls, is havin' sales bumps
I be in to win while your sales slump
Your chances getting slim, mine on their 12th brunch
And they smell lunch: Hercules Klump
Throw my weight around
Ain't left the scale once
Always bear in mind: even with your white fur
We still polar opposites: you ice picks to icebergs
I'm colder than Universal Soldier
Angel on my back everywhere I'm at
Niggas don't believe it just when I lay it down
And when I get back up and see my angel on the ground..

[Chorus]
Super cold
Super cold
Super cold
Super cold

Super cold
Super cold
Super cold
Super cold

[Verse 3]
Chicken soup for souls, now who could use a bowl?
Don't be salty now, trying to reduce my snow
Cause I just move em out: Ice Man
Fresh out a mutant school, I ain't no student though
Black Shaun White and he skis, and he skates
And he leaves all types of cold tracks all behind me
And you can follow those if you ever wanna find me
Better dress warm or you might end up like the Shining
Not that boy or that lady, but that nigga gone crazy
Pretty damn amazing: I can't get out
So I'm forced to ride this elevator anywhere it takes me
But when I hit my flow, I'm-a open up that door
Won't be three stacks or your cousin, but just that super cold

[Verse 1]
Let's go, hah
It's some fresh new Vans on my fresh new plans
Obama lied to you you nigga no you can't, ha
Change these nuts, shout to Fox News tryin' ta change me up
Sorry Uncle Rush but I still don't vote
Cause niggas on the ballot and there's still no hope
So I'm back in the hood, Englewood to Inglewood
Doin' work that politician should, good
Blocks do they best tryin' to break my heart
Just tryin' to make you smart when I make my art
Occupy forever, more tents to the park
Howard Zinn gettin' spins in the Benz
If it's not him, it' NPR, Diane Rehms
Kai Ryssdal, Amy Goodman
Sorry Bill O'Reilly but I'm so involved
Can you ask Limbaugh to return my calls

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Atlantic on the fritz
Cause I might not step foot back in that bitch
It disgusts me like Jerry Sandusky
Goodness gracious pedophiles and rapists, in high places
Not to mention slavery and slave ships
Come on Lu, gon' and keep it out the past
Tell Jerry's cellmate try and keep it out his ass
What happened to the class? All the low blows
I guess that most of the kids who black from the choke holds
As long as y'all win you can still put it in
Yup, hip hop back with a vengeance
Spirit of Chuck D with a whole lot of interest
Just inches from the entrance
Not to knock nice, but to knock it off the hinges, huh

[Break]
I'm just playin', I'm just playin'
You know I like y'all
Well, some of y'all
But you know who I'm talking to, I rock with y'all
You know we do it big
Atlantic records First and Fifteenth all day
Yeah, let's go

[Verse 3]
SNDCLSH in Vegas, only dropping those new Kaskade hits
Let's see how crazy the rave gets
Might play my 2Pac favorites
Me and Sky back in the Labs
Q came through with beats by the back
Shout to Bassnec, count all that cash
Whatever you do, don't drop that flag
Watch is stll gold, chain is still gold
Feelin' brand new, Ferrari still old
Got the dreads cause Marley still cold
GTR my car be real slow
Nah my car be real close
To the speed of the light when I be on roads
Flow like I be on roids and I be on ten when I be on tour

[Intro]
Really?
This is what you guys been doing?
Seriously?

[Hook 1]
Before daybreak there were none
And as it broke there was one
From moon to sun, it goes on and on
The winter battle was won
The summer children were born
And so the story goes on and on
Come on woman in your life beats
Those we buried with the house keys
Smoke and feather where the fields are green
From here to eternity
Become a woman in your own time
Far, far, far from the virgin vine
Rise on out from the dead leaves
Come back to me
Oh, she sings her favorite song
Left with tears and dreams, it goes and then on

[Verse 1]
Standing in line for the new one
Not the black, but the blue one
And I don't even know what it do, son
But Steve Jobs said that it's too fun
Fun in abundance what I need
It's cold out here, put my arms in the sleeves
I'll probably lose my place if I leave
But I really need to pee
If I do it right here they'll see
Makes you wonder, how do snipers
Marathon bikers
Next time: diapers
They say it has all new features
Faster processors and much better speakers
Great for kids, a necessity for teachers
For work or home
A revolutionary way of being alone
I mean, should we really get a loan?
Hey what's the matter, just tell it to your phone
Cupertino heart with Chinese parts
Built by the poor, but designed by the smart
They opening the door so you go
On your mark, get ready, set, buy
Imagine a world where everything starts with an ‘i’
But it still ends with a die
Probably got an app for that, you could try
From the iClouds, right into the great Wi-Fi
Siri, can iGod really hear me?
"Does not compute—can you repeat more clearly?"
"Woaaaaah"

[Hook 2]
A vessel in the bloodline
A thirteenth Zodiac sign
A stitch in time, it goes on and on
Become a woman on your own time
Far, far, far from the virgin vine
Rise on out from the dead leaves
Come back to me
Oh, she sings her favorite song
Left with tears and dreams, it goes and then on

[Verse 2]
Standing in line for some new Ones
Had a bunch of blessings but I blew them
Asked Google how to use them
They sent me to a section ‘bout used guns
New runs, nuns'll scream, moms with jeans
Match their teens' jeans and genies who try to chew gum
Aw man, it's so confusin’
Confusion in abundance what I have
Good thing that God accept cash
Maybe buy my way up out His wrath
Skeptically, why am I way up off this path?
Atheism's cheaper, and accepts Visa
My thoughts as I'm queuing up for sneakers
Won't discriminate – I’m getting all eight
In every color that they make
Beaverton hearts with Chinese parts
Built by the poor and designed by the smart
On your mark, get set, cop ‘em!
Imagine a life that revolves around shoppin’
Conspicuous consumption
That means it serves no other function
But to show off to someone, or others
Who only try to show off to you – look at your fellow loyal customers
Isn't harmony great?
Look at all these friends that marketing makes
How many fries can these arteries take?
I'll give McDonald's a little help here
I think they should expand into healthcare
And then you'll have all ends covered
Even make caskets, have it all umbrella'd
Can you make the corporation fear me?
"Couldn't hear your order, can you speak less clearly?"

[Hook 3]
That which was put in the ground
Will someday come back around
From dust to dust it goes on and on
Before daybreak there were none
And as it broke there was one
And still the story goes on and on

[Verse 1]
She said love is a hard thing
Somewhere between golfing and gardening
Or parole board pardoning
But she was still down for a hard swing
Flowers she would pick like guitar strings
For a real good whiff
Of how life behind par seems
Until then she a bar-teend
And pour hot lead shots out of carbines
If an inmate ever even think about departing
Before it's time for the theft of a hard thing
Wanna see what a bum riding BART dreams
Before he get gunned down, cause some sharp scene
Saw it all on the way to the art scene
Around the time they kicked us out, they had the park cleaned
She ain't living in a car she just RV-ing
Life on ice like the San Jose Shark team
Hard times, tryna duck em like Darkwing
Known for burning clothes and petty car-keying
And other less harmful skylarking
Bought a bag out of American Rag
A small Chinese-made American flag
Took a dollar bill then split it in half
The picture that she bought wouldn't fit in the cab
On the train trying her best not to live in the past
A bum probably asked could he spit in her ass
And that was it, fits, tantrums random
Helter-Skelter, a world gone Manson

[Verse 2]
And I'll spare you the details
Dinner is ceviche out of seashells
Annoyed cause her date really can't speak well
But she forced to press on like Lee Nails
Next table was abhorred by the weed smell
She was done at the moment that the tee fell
A thick wool jacket on a cool night
Unimpressed by poems or the moonlight
Doesn't satisfy her like a game of pool might
Thinking "what if Fantasia had a broom strike?"
Tuned right out of that school life
Soon as reality became a camera crew and a boom mic
So what do you do like?
She said "Absurd last words from a dude off a Zoosk site"
And then left him
Like the Roots left Geffen
And the state Howlin' Wolf left Chess in
Stop to watch flows have an unpaid session on the steps of a Westin
She really need to check in
And to apologize to her best friend
New bras to put her chest in
Love life and death in...

[Intro]
Ohio
Tennessee
California
Endlessly
Right on, right on
Right on, right on

[Verse 1]
Laid back, villain on the smooth tip
All things gravy, greatest fear to let the groove slip
Always tell the masses that it's never gon' stop
Cause you never gon' do shit
Magnify justice over long lost blues riffs
Mop up, sop up the tears for fears with a Q-tip
They proceeds to poke out they eyes with a toothpick
Remember when Larenz Tate beat Terrence with the pool stick
Or when Caine pistol whipped Chauncy and that fool snitched
Sent the tape to Bill Duke, would've went to jail
If he wouldn't have got killed in that drive-by by the dude he kicked
Cuz he was like, "It ain't mine"
And she was like, "You the only guy that I do it with"
'Member when 'Pac and Q start fightin' over Steel house
They broke a vase, Steel screamed, Raheem told 'em to chill out
The jheri curl Blood that bumped Ricky eating chips
The same guy they was looking for when Ice Cube stopped to let Cuba out the whip
And wan' it sad how Loco had the habit?
And wan' it funny when they caught T-Bone, dancing with that rabbit
Didn't Rocket have the same gun that the old man shot OG Bobby Johnson's son in the back with
Or do I got it backwards
And Bobby Johnson was the one that put his fist up to the glass
And Caine put his fist up and dapped it
Chicago and Regina had sex inside the mail truck
They left his ass, he reached down to get his hairbrush
And Tré lied to Furious, sitting down getting his hair cut

[Chorus]
Yeah, do you remember these
Double burger with cheese
Double burger with cheese
Double burger with cheese, huh
Do you remember these
Double burger with cheese
Double burger with cheese
Double burger with cheese

[Verse 2]
Caine told him as he jacked him at the drive-thru
A hundred bucks will tell who Radames put the knife to
Another hundred for the cop who chased New Jersey Drive crew
The group who took Ricky ball, Crip or Piru
Kicked Doughboy, told him he could buy a hundred balls
Little Bobby used his bed to iron out his overalls
Who knew in a few he would have a gun aimed
And Caine'd had a nigga's Daytons skatin' on his Mustang
'Member when the whole crowd stopped and got tense
Then they cheered when Steel put his hand up on the fence
Then when Gee Money first got married to the cocaine
And Chris Tucker OD'ed there watching Soul Train
Cam'ron shot him in the car and took his gold chain
Nino was free till he met up with that old man
Ice-T was there and he oversaw the whole thing
Mello lost his legs just to get up out the dope game
Why he throw his gun into the river, though?
Just to hit the roof to get the juice and let Bishop go
Show Hodges love, but the Pac Man day came
'Specially after sprayed the little ese with the spray paint
'Member when Bobby took off his tear
And when Doughboy disappeared
After his brother died and he said nobody cared
I still do, after all these years
Because he should've played ball
Ricky ain't deserve none of that at all
These are just a illustration
Of a few scenes that helped raise a generation

[Chorus]
Yeah, do you remember these
Double burger with cheese
Double burger with cheese
Double burger with cheese, huh
Do you remember these
Double burger with cheese
Double burger with cheese
Double burger with cheese

[Outro: Menace II Society excerpt]

[Intro: Lupe]
Friend! Friend!

[Verse 1: Lupe]
Lu, coupe, no, more doors
Porsche or, no, more doors, sedan
Hmmm, 4-more, no, more doors
More doors than that Lord of Rings that Frodo went to war for
You'll see more war than World War 4
Or Lord of War when Nicolas lost his brother
Brougham, no, man, too slow for my program
Need punk rock, not slow jams, mosh pits not hold hands
Or slow dance, or romance, I'll take this bitch like Lo Pan
Put her right into Do’s hands, tell her how this gon' go, man

[Hook: Dosage]
Animals, animals, we are more like cannibals
Follow rules, what rules? We don't ever answer to
No King Tuts, no presidents, this is more like a ritual
What am I scared of death for? Life is just an interlude

[Verse 2: Dosage & Lupe Fiasco]
Let's begin this interview, I know they got a lot of questions
I dont have on a unitard, but I can answer the detective
None of these dicks can trace me, I don't go that direction
This is the beginning of a massacre, I'm tired of getting treated like a step-kid
This where I step in, 'cause this Dosage from Philly and he so sick
And he my friend, so he your friend, it's who Lupe Fiasco with
They wanna know if I'm insane, I just don't accept defeat
But since I'm nominated this is gonna be my acceptance speech
Your big bro requesting me
'Cause I'm a friend of the people and I'm next to be
In the game, I don't hear the referees whistling technically
Dixie, let me sing!
(I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times, they are not forgotten!
Look away! Look away! Look away!) I forever see
Don't go back or forever be a slave to the nation
Touché, Lupe, this is history in the making

[Verse 3: Lupe]
We so in Smithsonians when the story ends
We was there when the story started, making history before we's artists
You know we's targets: Tar-get, we always start shit
Or shall I say hot-wired, ride around reckless and double-park it
Look how many fines that the car get
Take the boots off it, throw the tickets in the garbage
Then go to court just to get up on some smart shit
Tell the motherfucking judge it's all ours, bitch

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Well, well
What do you we have here
Still getting pussy from the gift I gave her last year
But it's a new day
She want a MacBook
So I showed her how the backseat of the 'Lac look
She talking hand bags and Gucci slippers
She served me like a waiter and all I can do is tip her
Shit talking bout she need gas money
You better hop up on that pole and shake that ass for me
Ho stop acting all bougie
Knowin you'll give it up fo churches chicken and a movie
Big bucks I got em
It's amazing what they'll do for a pair of them red bottoms, ahhhh!

[Hook:Ludacris]
Yeeeeah
She said she need some rent money
I told her hop up on this dick for me
She said she need to pay her car note
Uhhhh well I need some daddy long stroke
She asked me bout her phone bill
I asked her to show me how that throat feel
She said she need to pay tuition
Well drop down to the floor and assume the fucken position ugh!

[Hook:4x]
Do sumthing strange
For a lil piece change

[Verse 2:Ludacris]
I told her, ooh ooh Jerome is in the house bitch
Fuck the bed we bout to stay right in this couch bitch
I told her if she hit it right
Id buy that iPhone with 32 gigabytes
But now you say you want an iPad
Well get nekkid and bring yo ass over to my pad
Need some help moving out your old place
I need some help showing you my 'oh face'
Now you need a back stage pass dog
Well I need some back stage ass ho

But a little head will get yo hair and yo nails did

[Hook: Ludacris]

[Hook:4x]
Do sumthing strange

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
She super sexy so I treat her to my wing stop
I'm trynna wet my dick and shoot off like a slingshot
We run the game so my whole fucking team hot
My top down in that same whip you dream bout
I keep a pocket full of Franks, time to work my magic
My section similar to a bank, better check the balance
Spray the Chevrolet red, likes it's from Cincinnati
Baby be giving me head, with superior talent

I ring the phone like 'baby oye ven aca'(baby come here)
Take her to a spot she never been a lot
Them niggas lossers, me and Luda in the winnin' slot

[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeeeeah
She said she need some rent money
I told her hop up on this dick for me
She said she need to pay her car note
Uhhhh well I need some daddy long stroke
She asked me bout her phone bill
I asked her does yo (something) how that throat feel
She said she need to pay tuition
Well drop down to the floor and assume the fucken position ugh!

[Hook:4x]

[Intro]

Real talk nigga
It's your boy Gucci
Ay
745 baby
745 nigga
For all my niggas out there handling their business
All my niggas handling their mothafuckin business
NY to A dog I'm in New York right now

[Verse 1]

Came out of
Came out of jail on a monday morning
Whole world watchin' like I was performing
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror
6 months ago I was sitting my cell
Now I'm sittin in a new V12
Niggas always said that I wouldn't blow up
I touched rock bottom can't go but up
Left Big Cat and I signed Mac Breezy
Word on the street that I don't like Jeezy
But fuck that I'm tryna rape the budget
Beat them other rap niggas change the subject
Jumpin' out the plane with the Louis V luggage
Yellow diamonds same color as mustard
Blue diamonds same color the tarheels
Red diamonds like the section where Game live

[Hook]

745 with the Gucci interior
I see a real nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a real nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror

[Verse 2]

Niggas scared to sign me cause I beef too much
And they heard that I stay in the streets too much
Knee deep in the game
I'm ahead of my time
60 Gs I spent just for tellin' the time
I'm the hood homeboy
The ghetto trophy
Niggas hatin' on me so I can't stay focused
I smoke a nigga like a pack of them newports
Middle of the mall right in front of the food court
I might look gravy, but I'm smokin' that kushy
I'm not a killer, but you pussies done pushed me
I'm tryna live I ain't tryna die
So I'd rather your momma cry then my momma cry (bitch)

[Hook]

745 with the Gucci interior
I see a real nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a real nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror

[Verse 3]

Now what would you do if a nigga tried you?
And you chillin' with a bitch
And some niggas came through
Would you run like a chick or stand like man?
Nigga tell me when you piss do you sit or do you stand?
See my momma bring the drama
My daddy tote a llama
I learned from my momma so I hit him with the thunder
I coulda been dead, but im still breathin'
Do I smell pussy? Naw that's Jeezy!
You ain't a snowman, you more like a snowflake
Cupcake cornflake, nigga you too fake
Beyoncé, oh thats your fiancé?
Jeezy is the appetizer, you'll be the entrée
2 Glocks shawty, ay let's party
I'm at the 40/40 lookin' for Sean Cartay (uh)
Man I love to beef
Couldn't wait to get home cause I love the streets

[Hook]

745 with the Gucci interior
I see a real nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a real nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror
(repeats 2x)

[Intro]
So, this is my last song
"Oh no, don't go"
And, um... Yeah, it's um...
I'll end it with, uh... somethin' about love

[Verse 1]
She got me with her look
She got me with her stare
Bright blue eyes and her long blond hair
From the start it was easy to see
This was the girl for me
Who cares if she was 83?

[Verse 2]
She could make me silent, she could make me shout
And she drove me wild with those dentures out
When we ate, people said we were rude
Because I had pre-chew her food

[Verse 3]
Her skin was saggy, so was the rest
I put my hand up her skirt and I felt her breast
We made love, and the more I thrust
The more the room was covered in dust
Room was covered in dust

[Verse 4]
Then one day I felt a chill
As I woke up from my bed
She was lying real still
My little lady was already dead

[Verse 5]
The wake happened on a Saturday night
I just sat there and bowed my head
A little girl was on my right
Crying because her Grandma was dead
And that little girl she got me with her looks
Got me with her tears
Feminine beauty beyond her years
From the start it was easy to see
That was the girl for me
Who cares if she was only three?

[Outro]
A good note to end the show on
Pedophilia
See ya, guys

[Host]
Uh well, hello everyone!
Welcome to the Rehab Center for Fictional Characters
Um, alright
Let's just get right to it
Who wants to start us off?
How 'bout you Kris?

[Kris Kringle]
Um, alright
Hey, I'm Kris Kringle
I'm a sex addict

Hey I'm Santa Claus, I'm the king of snow
I hate my wife because she's a ho, ho, ho
She used to please me every day, then she made it clear
That Santa's only supposed to come once a year
Fuckin' bitch
Now I buy whores, rock and roll
And I stuff their stockings with my north pole

[Host]
Okay Kris, thank you!
Alright, who's up next?
Patrick, frowny face!
Get up here

[Patrick O'Reilly]
Alright
I'm Patrick O'Reilly, I'm a leprechaun
You all doin' good?
Yeah, I'm not doing so good
I had a wonderful life, with a healthy household
And beautiful wife, and a pot full of gold... hah
Then my wife spent my riches all by herself, and since women are bitches, blew a Keebler elf... Ugh
Now I drink all day and a part of me dies
'Cause my wife's gettin' gang-banged by the Rice Krispie guys

[Tony the Tiger]
Hey I know them!

[Host]
Oh, Tony, nice of you to show up
Where were you last week?

[Tony the Tiger]
I had some stuff
Hey, I'm Tony the Tiger
Uh, fuck it
I'll just sing
Every day I wake up, I get to work late
My boss says, "Hey, whats up?"
I say that I'm grrrrrrrrowing tired of this shit
The kids they laugh, 'cause I'm a sensitive cat
"Big pussy!"
I can't argue with that
If another kid gives me Frosted Flakes
I swear on my life I'll... eat his parents

[Host]
Okay, Ton, thank you
Um, so that's everybody
So let's just get down to it, um
Oh, who are you?

[Easter Bunny]
Hi, yeah, hi, yeah, hi, yeah
I'm the Easter Bunny, hey I'm back!
Used to be funny, now I'm hooked on crack
Heaps of heroine ain't no joke, Marshmallow Peeps covered in coke-coke-coke-coke-coke-coke-coke-coke
COKE!
Drugs for life, that's my plan, but now I have no attention span

[Host]
Okay, I'm gonna go get him, alright?
You guys, just please play nice, alright?
I'll be back in a second, okay?

[Kris Kringle]
Hey Pat, did you hear? All my elves got sick
I think they got herpes from some Irish chick

[Patrick O'Reilly]
Motherfucker
What are you laughin' at, Tony?

[Tony the Tiger]
I dunno
It's, uh
It's funny

[Patrick O'Reilly]
This is gettin' ridiculous
Santa, Tony, would you guys please stop?

[Tony the Tiger]
Oh, snap!

[Kris Kringle]
Crackle and Pop
Haha, 'cause they banged your wife

[Patrick O'Reilly]
I'm gettin' out of here
This is fucking ridiculous, huh
(Spoken)
I believe in the zodiac! Yeah, I do, I'm a Leo, I love Titanic
This is something morbidly ironic: my grandmother was a cancer, and she was killed by a giant crab
This is a song about the idea of irony, so strap in!

(Singing)
My dog's stomach was very upset
So we put him in the car
And we went to the vet
And on our way to the vet
I killed a cat

I say
Isn't that ironic?

I adopted a child from overseas
To rescue him from child labor factories
And on his very first birthday
We went to Build-A-Bear workshop

Isn't that I-R-O-N-I-C-I-N-O-R-I-R-O-N-I-C
Yes
And a waterpark is burned to the ground
And a tow truck is broken down
I always used to cry when I laughed
But then I was raped by a clown

I was watching Al Gore on CNN
He was talking and talking and talking, and then
Out of boredom
My pet polar bear shot himself

I dated an animal rights activist
One day she got really pissed
Because I was eating veal
That was wrapped in PETA bread
Get it? Because pita... fuck it

I-R-O-N-I-C-I-N-O-R-I-R-O-N-I-C

Yeah, I said
I'm a stand-up comic
But I always sit and slouch
And I got my girlfriend pregnant
On my sterile uncle's pull out couch

I-R-O-N-I-C-I-N-O-R-I-R-O-N-I-C, Ironic
Yeah
If everyday you play the board game RISK
You've probably never taken a risk in your life
And Monopoly has far from a stranglehold
On the board game market

And a little kid died from
Suffocation
When he choked on a game piece from
Operation

And I can't grow a beard
But that one's not ironic
That one's just sad
Bob Barker got all of my pets pregnant

My grandfather had Alzheimer's
And one day we were...

[Verse 1]
Everyone was saying hip-hop was dead
It wasn't dead
These niggas just wasn't makin no bread
Because the scared to be real so they fakin' instead
And when that happens rappin and rappin it's actin' instead
But like they say it's just entertainment
But it's a game so all this niggas is playin'
Even me
But what happens when the game changes
Your favorite rappers gon have to do some explainin'
Somebody turn the channel man this gangsta shit is boring
Nobody believes ya so please record another story
Now I'm not sayin' that I'm a save ya
But if no one else keep it real then I'm the answer to ya prayers

[Hook: B.o.B]
Look into the future tell me what you see
You a fool if you don't know it by now
Pimpin we the future
We the future
And you a fool if you don't know it by now (x2)

[Verse 2]
See kids only believe in what the perceive
And half of what they believe is what they be seein on the t.v
Hints the term monkey see monkey do
That's why they got all the kids rockin bathing apes to school
Why you think they call 'em bathing apes
They think we just a bunch of babies and apes
I may be disturbed because I'm disgraced
I feel like an alien in outerspace
That's why I'm singin' amazing grace to save this race
I do not know what it takes to make the dimension that I'm trying to create
We all got fucked we need to be hollering great
But like they say it's just entertainment
But it's a game so all this niggas is playin'
Even me
But what happens when the game changes
Your favorite rappers gon' have to do some explainin'

[Hook: B.o.B]
Look into the future tell me what you see
You a fool if you don't know it by now
Pimpin we the future
We the future
And you a fool if you don't know it by now (x2)

[Verse 1]
Stop the truck, hand my keys to the valet
That's the moment that I see her as she leaving
I say excuse me, how could I convince you to stay?
Then my phone goes to ringing in, ringing in
(No I don't wanna) but I gotta answer this call
Could you wait, it really won't be long?
(And then the kid came) told me he was my biggest fan
Camera flashes, turn around and she's already gone

[Pre-Chorus]
How'd I get distracted, I
Don't know what happened, I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
Oh you got, away, away, you flew away, away
Oh

[Chorus]
I lost my Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
Has anybody seen her?
I'm out here checking for my, Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
I'm posting pictures of her
(And where she go?)
She got me driving around the backstreets
I thought I saw walking right past me
I called you didn't answer to your name
Where's my angel?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
(No I don't wanna)
(And then the kid came)

[Pre-Chorus]
How'd I get distracted, I
Don't know what happened, I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
Oh you got, away, away, you flew away, away
Oh

[Chorus]

Where's my angel?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

[Bridge]
Oh Angel, tell me what am I to do?
Angel, I can't find another you
Angel search downtown, now I'm on the 10 West
Doing 90 tryna' get to you
Exit La Cienega, I'm looking, I'm searching
La Brea, Santa Monica, Sunset, Sepulveda
Robertson, Melrose and Hollywood

[Chorus]
I lost my Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
Has anybody seen her?
I'm out here checking for my, Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
I'm posting pictures of her

Where's my angel?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

I lost my Angel in L.A., L.A

Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I bought a whole O to smoke
I'm riding high
My niggas with me, they down to ride
I got my change up, they looking like they surprised
Got niggas hatin' on me hard cause my paper right
Money from the flo' way up to the sky
Now they wanna know and they wonder why
I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly
I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide
And I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide
I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide
I got my change up, they looking like they surprised
Niggas hatin' on me hard cause my paper right
But I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide
I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide
I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly
I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide
I'm killin' 'em

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa:]
First 48, first 48
Took out 50 racks and blew the first 48
I ain't worried about spending bread cause I got more to make
Soon as they see that Maserati they gone surely hate
Hundred for a show, can you afford a date
And that's just one show, imagine what my tour gon make
Police ran up on my tour bus
But hey my niggas more money more problems
More lawyers on the case
Niggas was at the Grammys, I was at the crib working
Heard they little diss but I'm just being the big person
Never been trained, still my aim near perfect
Everything I spits murder, bow

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I bought a whole Ounce to smoke
I'm riding high
My niggas with me, they down to ride
I got my change up, they looking like they surprised
Got niggas hatin' on me hard cause my paper right
Money from the flo' way up to the sky
Now they wanna know and they wonder why
I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly
I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide
And I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide
I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide
I got my change up, they looking like they surprised
Niggas hatin' on me hard cause my paper right
But I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide
I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide
I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly
I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide
I'm killin' 'em

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods:]
With black on black cars coming through
Presidential shit, tints on the whip
So dark can't see who riding in that bitch
Suits and tie's no questions why
Somebody get a box ready for these guys
No four door, had the coupe that ride
That eagle right here if you wanna feel fly
No games though, no names spoke
This crack right here, cocaine flow
I don't know what you doing but I'm paid, bro
Yeah I pitch that 9 like Pedro
Jump in the car with my nigga I'm ready to ride
We on our way to the top, watch that paper rise
Keep telling everybody what you gonna do
Middle finger like fuck what you going through
All I know is that money that I'm going to
And them gang gang boys run up on you
Like wassup cause I told you
Just money in the pocket, fold you
T-A-Y-L-O-R G-A-N-G Gang

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I bought a whole Ounce to smoke

I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love and I'm like
Forget you
Oo, oo, ooo
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough I'm like
Forget you
And forget her too!
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with her
Ha,ain't that some shh (ain't that some shh)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best I'm like
Forget you!
Oo, oo, ooo

Yeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess she's a xbox and I'm more of an atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair

I pity the fool that falls in love with you
( she's a gold digger just thought you should know sugar)
I've got some news for you
Yeah go run and tell your little boyfriend

I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love and I'm like
Forget you
Ooh, ooh, ooooh
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough I'm like
Forget you
And forget her too!
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some shh (ain't that some shh)
Though there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best I'm like
Forget you!
Oo, oo, ooo

Now I know, that I had to borrow
And beg and steal and lie and cheat
Tryin to keep ya, trying to please ya
Cause being in love with you ain't cheap

I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(she's a gold digger just thought you should know sugar)
(just thought you should know )
Ooooooh
I've got some news for you
Ooh! I really hate you right now
I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love and I'm like
Forget you
Oo, oo, ooo
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough I'm like
Forget you
And forget her too!
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some shh (ain't that some shh)
Though there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best, I'm like
Forget you!
Oo, oo, ooo

Now baby, baby, baby, why'd you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
(so bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my mamma but she told me
"this is one for your dad"
(your dad, your dad, your dad)
Uh! Whyyy? Uh! Whyyy? Uh!
Whyyy lady? Oh! I love you!! Oh!
I still love you!! Oooh..........!

I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love, I'm like

And although there's pain in my chest

Forget you!
Oo, oo, ooo

[Chorus: Josh Everette]
She lookin' fly, real fly in her Nikes
Fresh new Jordans or fresh pair of Ice Creams
Ooh, she's a dime, she keep 'em iced so nicely
The way she's rockin' them kicks, gotta make her my wifey, whoa

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
You lookin' fly, real fly in them Nike shoes
I'm lookin' for a wifey and it might be you
Ménage à trois, spend the night with two
It's alright with me if it's alright with you
Feel my hands rubbin' up and down your backside
Ma, you've got curves like a half-pipe
That's right, ma, you's a ten
And your man? You be rockin' nicer shoes than him
I'm in the spot with some juice and gin
Come to me
You a beauty with your Louis and Gucci
Baby girl, I ain't wanna be your man
But let me just write my number on your hand
At the party with a whole bunch of honeys here (Cheah)
You got your Forces laced up with some bunny ears
But now I got you all alone, and the booze gone
So slip outta your clothes, but keep them shoes on

[Chorus: Josh Everette]
She lookin' fly, real fly in her Nikes
Fresh new Jordans or fresh pair of Ice Creams
Ooh, she's a dime, she keep 'em iced so nicely
The way she's rockin' them kicks, gotta make her my wifey, whoa

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
You lookin' fresh like whoa
Goddamn, lookin' so fly that you probably got a man
You lookin' right and he ain't here tonight, so
I won't tell him if you don't (Oh!)
So let's roll, roll back to the crib
Grey Goose, lights dimmed, girl, that's how I live (You know me)
You got them kicks, fat ass, and some lips
Baby, you don't even gotta ask for a kiss
Shorty look proper, with kicks like Foot Locker
All done up, she a good shopper (Uh-huh)
New jeans, blue tee, and her shoes clean
Uh, lookin' like she 'bout to seduce me
Just touch me, tease me, cute caressin'
A hundred thousand pairs in your shoe collection
Shh, I know you like to tell
But let me just lay back while you light my L

[Chorus: Josh Everette]
She lookin' fly, real fly in her Nikes
Fresh new Jordans or fresh pair of Ice Creams
Ooh, she's a dime, she keep 'em iced so nicely
The way she's rockin' them kicks, gotta make her my wifey, whoa

[Intro: Mary]
Turn the track up a little bit
We need to rock in here
Oh, oh, oh
I wanna make you happy

[Verse 1: Nas]
I'm not at all happy or elated, this category ain't my favorite
It's my story, I'ma state it, you could love it or hate it
I'm just a misfit blessed with good dick and intelligence
Hood nigga holding no grudges on petty shit
I started, why are we cold-hearted, so guarded
Scared to get hurt, trying not to love the hardest
That's garbage, remember when we loved each other
Bathtub scrubbed each other, chillin', champagne spillin'
Uh, feelin' like the shit gon' last forever
Time went so fast, we had a blast together
Laughs we had, friends we spent time with
Now I be seeing your friends out, then I'm reminded
How we all used to gather up for the holidays
Now your friends all nervous to speak, they act afraid
I was your bestie, how it get to this
As I reminisce, takin' off my MJs in my empty crib
Mary...

[Verse 2: Mary]
I wanna make you happy
But you just don't see it
I wanna be around, babe
But I'm so tired of competing
We say all the wrong things
'Til we make each other cry
What are we doing?
Will it ever get better?

[Pre-Chorus: Mary]
My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
Boy, I love you
But you're pushing me away

[Chorus: Mary]
I gave you everything that I got
Watched my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside
I feel inside
This is how I feel, this is how I feel

[Verse 3: Mary]
Now I was hoping we'd get through this together
You said you'd love me through all types of stormy weather
Wasn't it you who said we'd be together for all time
But it keeps messing with my mind, oh oh

[Pre-Chorus: Mary]
My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
I need you here near me
But I can't make you stay

[Chorus: Mary]
I gave you everything that I got
Watched my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside
I feel inside
This is how I feel, this is how I feel

[Bridge: Mary]
I never thought that I would have this feeling
Do you think for once that you can truly mean it?
Wasting so much time disagreeing
See, I'm to the point where I don't know what I believe in

[Verse 4]

[Nas]
If you don't want this, I don't want this, I do my morning crunches
Play my jazz, pray to the east, and watch the sunset
Uh, but yet I was blowin' you up the other night
Could tell your girl was telling you what to write back
Tell me why it's like that

[Mary]
So make up your mind, boy decide
We can't go on like this, this ain't right (It ain't right)
Feeling really bad, feeling kinda low
Think it's time to go, oh oh

[Chorus: Mary]
I gave you everything that I got
Watched my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside
I feel inside
This is how I feel, this is how I feel

[Outro: Nas & Mary]
Sir Nas, Mrs. Mary J. Blige
And this is her life
Yeah, this is her life
Yeah, yeah yeah
This is how I feel, this is how I feel
Yeah
Let me hear that
Brook-Lynn, Brook-Lynn, Brook-Lynn, Brook-Lynn, Brook-Lynn
Say word to the nigga that took the rap for me
Free Chill I will, take rap to where niggas can't conceive
To the point where niggas can't agree on which song is best
And the argument is if I am better than me
Nope, me and school never agreed
So you can see that Lu never degreed
No fool but the promises of America's educational system
Were insufficient enough to convince him
I'd rather take my chances
And hope it's not enough evidence for a conviction (Breathe)
I push ki like Dragonball Z
You see what I'm sayin'
I'm tryna give you a piece of my mind like Hannibal G
And in the midst of it all make paper like tree
On second thought, make paper like mead
It's all in my notebooks
I hang like coat hook 'round gangbang and those who coke push like Tyrese
(My economy) Lemme make it real for you
The roots to my income is somethin'
To those opposed to hustlin'
"Is it solely music?" They question
Till I am embalmed
The end will retire in prom
L.U.P.Empire, F n F productions it's nothin'
Nigga please

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Teenage billionaires
He's beating records off the top the holes of money
He roll rover sell base for 12 a pop
Hodgy eating rapers whole, never digest I'm dope
Shit since they coming out of him like crack heads
Like fuck I should be illegal eagles flying over state
And the model bitch
(She look good)
And the head is great
The Pink stripe is for diplomatic immunity
I'm A-C-E-A-K to fuck up the community
(Holla holla holla, Spit another one real quick)
Niggas Stez biting like they Mike Tyson
Here these queers taking credit like their
Faggot card is debit fines hit me on my beepa
Could be on the keys then I push it out sneaka bitch
I'm bunny like the Basket-baller

[Ya]
I'm the dope dealer push man in the dream state
Your bitch sticks to me like purple schotch tape

[I'm lime green]
The Pink stripe is for diplomatic immunity
I'm A.C.E. aka Mr. Fuck Up the Community

[Verse 2: Blak tha Map]
I don't serve much but let me take your order
Guaranteed to get your chips while I gallop aforda
Flip a check quick like we betting with quarters
And I beat the cut like we talkin' 'bout horfa
Especially if she looks like canorfa
I not saying I would never do more than ork her
I'm just saying I would do never divorce her
But I don't know if I could afford her
But J.K. cause Ima I'm ballin'
If life was a chip then hommie I'm all in
Yesterday's money was talkin'
Yes the shit was callin'
Telling me to take over the world
Like a young Jospeh Stallin
Dirty dog records beating all the pussies
Never shopping unless were talking bout diamonds and stussy
Yo I'm probably with your chick
Playing with her cliteris
Yep
Her friend is coming for a lick
Look I'm not your father don't even bother
I pulled out early

[Verse 1]
I'm ridin' high down 85, we call it I-Ocho Cinco
In an orange & black gallardo state troopers be screamin' bingo
Chinchilla in my villa three hundred cash is my pillow
A gate with my initials and small militia with pistols
From Sun Valley to Cali to poppin bottles in Dallas
From shootin' dice in an alley to gambling at Caeser's Palace
When Gooch was playin' trafficker niggas was playin' Galaga
Can't be too specific my ticket was so spectacular
See I never been a stranger of sellin them white rectangulars
But I had to switch my angle 'fore snitches start pointin' their finger, bruh
So while y'all gettin' extorted and fakin' like y'all important
I got twin 40s on shorty I'll send yo bitch ass to orbit, Gucci!

[Hook]
White lambos and rallys, rallys
Sippin' on top Sun Valley, Valley
Robin Jean, Tru's and Ballys
That's right up my alley, alley
Just came back from Dallas, Dallas
Now I'm going back to Cali, Cali
Pretty girls, expensive furs that's right up my alley, alley
Yo girlfriend I'm 'bout to pull her
Don't blame me man blame my jeweler
Don't hate me man hate my aura
On my way to Bora Bora
She can explore like Dora Dora
No friends then I'll buy one for her
No clothes then I'll buy some for her
That's right up my alley, alley

[Verse 2]
These boys ain't on my level I'm smoking kush by the elbow
In a mansion that's so big when I talk I can hear my echo
I'm upper echelon watching Kobe take on Lebron
But you in lack of funds, can't be me ain't got the coins
I'm cooler than the Fonz just tryna off all the blow
So when you ????? then holla "I got the snow"
Pink diamonds for you haters we label No they ain't able
Coke bottles on my table and models be on my payroll
The goons that hang with me like to cut you up like a pizza
Boss bitches in my circle purse fatter than Queen Latifah
So don't chase waterfalls stick to rivers that's in ya city
And R.I.P. to Left Eye but Gucci necklace is chilly, Gucci!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I mingle with society, black diamonds match my tuxedo
I'm hot as a volcano these rappers are just mosquitos
Who'd ever think I'd get richer than slangin' kilos
My jewelry man's a weirdo, pink diamonds sit in my earlobes
VS is my preference, elegant while y'all negligent
Candy kush and Hennessy make me feel I'm the president
Your boyfriend is a cornball, Gucci Mane I'm a mob boss
I don't call that a corn toss, ride off with him it's your loss
My body's like a novel so read it when I take my shirt off
And I'll always be icy my bracelet cold as a Smirnoff
Jump in my vert and murk off, so pussy run off and jerk off
I'm still sliding through the six like my younger days droppin' work off

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Oh
I wonder what she's thinking when her eyes are closed
I'm hoping it's bout me but I will never know

[Bridge]
There's a CD and a T-shirt on the table by your bag
Plus a couple dollars, when you wake up call a cab
I really want to wake her so that I could say goodbye
But what would be the point 'cause

[Chorus]
You don't have to leave
Rest your head, baby girl
You don't have to leave
Rest your head, baby girl
When you open up your eyes
I'll be in the sky, somewhere far away
Trying to find my way
When you open up your eyes
I'll be in the sky, somewhere far away
Trying to find my way
Baby you don't have to leave

[Verse 2]
I wish that we could go back to the night before
Cause maybe she's the one, but I will never know

[Bridge]
There's a CD and a T-shirt on the table by your bag
Plus a couple dollars, when you wake up call a cab
I really want to wake her so that I could say goodbye
But what would be the point 'cause

[Chorus]
You don't have to leave
Rest your head, baby girl
You don't have to leave
Rest your head, baby girl
When you open up your eyes
I'll be in the sky, somewhere far away
Trying to find my way
When you open up your eyes
I'll be in the sky, somewhere far away
Trying to find my way
Baby you don't have to leave

You don't have to leave
Rest your head, baby girl
You don't have to leave
Rest your head, baby girl
When you open up your eyes
I'll be in the sky, somewhere far away
Trying to find my way
When you open up your eyes
I'll be in the sky, somewhere far away
Trying to find my way
Baby you don't have to leave

[Verse 1]
Uh, ya already know what it is, man
Taylor Gang and I’m still talkin' champagne
Good weed, bad bitches, and airplanes
Niggas get extra likes, spare change
Leave your bitch around my gang, then she fair game
Gets so hot, you standin' near a flame
Twenty thousand on my wrist, fifty on my chain
Club owners mad, we drinking all the rosé
And niggas hate, but I just go off what the hoes say
He a skinny nigga, but he do it big
Yeah, it's looking like a movie, but it's how I live
Young boss, Taylor Gang General
Drinking out the pink bottle, Rosé Imperial
And my bad bitch look like a centerfold
Cook like a chef, smoke weed like it’s medicinal
Smell the engine burning, you hear my tires murk
We be poppin' corks like fireworks

[Chorus]
I'ma' need more champagne
Tell the waitress just grab a couple more bottles and bring 'em up
We got a bar for every nigga that came with us
We got the buzz, now bring 'em up
Grab your drink and get fucked up
Champagne champagne, lah-ah
See bottles of rosé when they think of us
See all of 'em in the club, gonna pay for us
But you ain't gonna fuck the waitress, brah
I'mma need more champagne!

[Verse 2]
VIP's full of red bottles
In the city that I come from, I'm the head honcho
Ounces full of kush, bottles full of more wet
Seen me in my yellow car, she got all wet
Used to smoke blunts, now she roll plane
Quit fuckin' with her nigga, he was so lame
She said she love the taste, but she don’t know the name
Drinkin' by the case, I’m gonna need you to bring more champagne
I’m with my goons getting liquored up
Make this money, then blow it like I don’t give a fuck
Show up to the club, they pull them bottles out
You gettin' paper, you should know just what I'm talkin' 'bout
Uh, I live the life you write a song about
Bitches think I'm famous, favors come in larger amounts
Standing on the table, standing on the couch
Somebody tell the waitress that we almost out, hahaha

[Chorus]
I'ma' need more champagne
Tell the waitress just grab a couple more bottles and bring 'em up
We got a bar for every nigga that came with us
We got the buzz, now bring 'em up
Grab your drink and get fucked up
Champagne champagne, lah-ah
See bottles of rosé when they think of us
See all of 'em in the club, gonna pay for us
But you ain't gonna fuck the waitress, brah
I'mma need more champagne!

[Hook: B.o.B.]
If you think I’m outgunned
If you think that I'll run
If you think that it's over
You couldn't be more wrong
If you think that it's done
If you think that you won
If you think that it's over
You couldn't be more wrong

[Verse 1: B.o.B.]
I think it's funny that they think they got us all beat and defeated
I swear they must be dreaming 'cuz they think that we're retreating
Yeah, they be the type, constantly in search of beefing
Till they see it, then that ass become a vegan
That's why up on this beat it's no doubt
You already know I'm about my flow
Mother fucker say I sold out, must be talking about my shows
Matter fact, anytime that you finna reach for a dream or a goal or for anything
You will have many enemies, look at Jesus and Martin and Lincoln and Kennedy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B.o.B.]
Yeah, impostors hate the truth because you tell it
So I know when they around, they so jealous, I can smell it
The haters always die, the prestigious never perish
So I'll be never buried
That's why I'm never threatened by these little boys with big toys
They can't aim, it's piss poor, what you holding the clip for?
Put the gun down, get a clipboard
So tell them haters that they better pipe down just a bit more
'Cuz I bring Hell like a red man with a black beard and a pitchfork

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Spodee]
Uh, you totally incorrect if you thought that it was some pressure
When each endeavor I treasure raises my level of pleasure
I'm flabbergasted by fellas that think that they can see me
I'm saving my special specimens specifically for T.V
Whoa, what till they see me with a face so straight make a thing called hate
Me and Bobby Ray like this, okay, man a plastic surgeon can't fix her face
All these rap niggas shit so gay, keep pimping until that bitch locate
My foot in their ass I'mma pick, okay, say you harder than Grand Hustle, bitch, no way

[Hook]
(ey, ey, ye eye, ey ey) x3
Never seen a cloud
(upclose baby)
Never left the ground
(before baby)
Never fucked the hundred miles up (uup)
Never been in love

But if I never met yo ass
I would never know how it feels to crash

We get laid, smooth
It's heartbreak plus jetlag
Heartbreak plus jetlag
Heartbreak plus jetlag

(uuh, uuh, uuh, uhaaa)
(uuh, aaah, ha, uuuh)
(uuuh, oooh, oouh, ooh, aah, aah!)

Just stay alone
(this earth lonely)
Im watching everbody get on
But deep down im scared to drive back home
Cause last time it went up, it down, down down...
In flames
But if i'd never met yo ass i've never known have it feels to crash
We gettin laid, smooth (damn)

It's heartbreak plus jetlag
Heartbreak plus jetlag ooh..
Heartbreak plus jetlag ooh..

[Hook]
And then I remembered the magic
Forgot that you can't plan it
It's always there in front of us
Just trust and it happens
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it
And then I remembered the magic
Forgot that you can't plan it
It's always there in front of us
Just trust and it happens
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it

[Verse 1]
Now, I don't know why this world is a trip
See, I just float by hoping that I can live
With a pen I'm so high, using this medicine
I got a little bit of it to give
Come on, hear me now
My momma says the trip inside of you gon' hear it child
We all got it, if you want it gotta get it out
I know you know what I'm talking about
See it's the music from the magic, got me on top of these clouds, come on
Keep it poppin' with my favorite song
There's no feeling like the city walking with my walkman on
It gets to me, giving me goosebumps and I'm gone
And when I die just make sure that I got my pen and headphones on
In good times and upsets
Rain, hail, beats, sand, heat, land, and a lot of damn sunsets
They say that you can never capture the moment
Photograph or record it, but I swear I can when I bump them
As I bear witness to existence, setting in the distance
For a sheer instance I become one with it
Dismeant up to ten when I listen like I was set on this mission
Places I've been when I with them
I'm feeling the most high when I got my pen and I'm scriptin'
No engines speakin as I enter religion
No crosses, pews, prayers, or repentance for sinning
Just the RCA jack, a sentence and a vision
Inside of the gut, time with the cut, right from the plug
That feeling that goes right into us
Instead of bump live, but with eyes wide shut
You got some fire and a lighter, I'mma fire it up
Depending on the month, sometimes I feel high with just pen and pad
If the gab, the light's within us
I can apply my touch on the mic stand and bust
To the whole planet, and my headphones on

[Hook]
And then I remembered the magic
Forgot that you can't plan it
It's always there in front of us
Just trust and it happens
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it
And then I remembered the magic
Forgot that you can't plan it
It's always there in front of us
Just trust and it happens
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it

[Verse 2]
Now, have you ever done hallucinogenics?
Children, don't get it twisted, I'm not reccomending
But it's not fried brains and hippies and kids jumpin' off buildings
It can be spiritual epiphanies and medicine
Now I first tried shrooms when I was 16
And the universe became more interesting
I began to contemplate my place in this landscape
And reflect on what it meant to be a human being
What I went through felt as though I dreamt it
Through my experience, became aware of my breath, then
Began to cultivate my art with the intention of the heart
Started to use my sentences as reflections
And what I saw was God was in all of us
And we'd all come to be interconnected
And all that was depended on all of us
And had effects like a domino when you let it
Go with the flow, that the universe holds
Understand that there's more than you expected
I don't do shrooms anymore cause I don't need to explore
All that I was looking for was was the present

[Hook]
And then I remembered the magic
Forgot that you can't plan it
It's always there in front of us
Just trust and it happens
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it
And then I remembered the magic
Forgot that you can't plan it
It's always there in front of us
Just trust and it happens
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it

[Intro: T.I.]
Okay, aye
Yeah, that's right

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Bitches kissin’ and huggin’, niggas trippin’ and buggin'n’
You out ya mind, I’m on my grind and I ain’t quittin’ for nothin’
Tell your mothers and uncles, brothers, sisters, and cousins
My flow so nasty, deranged, that nigga T.I.P is disgusting
Gotta grip on the game, quit your pullin’ and tuggin’
Cause I ain’t clinically sane, I go to pushin’ a button
They get to clickin’ and bustin’, you get to dippin’ and duckin’
They empty clips by the dozen, you come up missin’ for nothin’
Hey, I can triple your budget, I’m in the business of hustlin’
If we ain’t talkin’ about money, I say, “Let’s end the discussion”
Hate off my shoulders I’m brushin’, all the ladies are blushin’
They all love when I fuck ‘em, Blacks and Latinas and Russians
Tell ‘em, "Be easy," no rushin’, mastered the art of seduction
I let ‘em blow me so much head I can catch a concussion
Seven chicks in the bed, touchin’, lickin’, and suckin’
Dick ‘em into submission and then I send ‘em to truckin’
Cousin, we nothin’ alike, you can say what you like
Do all that huffin’ and puffin’, then run away from the fight
Don’t know who gettin' you hype when you sit and you write
The great imaginary life you only live on the mic
I’m who you’d die to be like, cause I’m so fly with it, nice
To live my life you’d have to try to hit the lottery twice
Find it amusing, I’m gigglin’ at what you made in a year
Quadruple that while in prison servin’ my day and a year, nigga
Hahahaha

[Interlude: Mos Def (Yasiin Bey)]
Wow, it’s on right now Buckhead to Bucksound
Boogie man and rubber band snappin'
Bang, listen

[Verse 2: Mos Def]
No retreat, no surrender
No gimmicks, no hoax, no jokes, no pretenders
Strategic moves that elude all defenders
Another one for them, tell them haters hold they temper
But tell 'em feel, how they feel? Fuck it, let it go
That’s ineffective though, I'm an effective show
It’s that incredible, and I own special dose
Extra flow, quiet dawg, rest assured, let them know
Off the chain, I was born unleashed
And walk when and where I feel when I'm 'pon these streets
Spread love, Brooklyn on these streets
And I get it how I get it cause I’m from these streets
Holler back, your favorite Uncle Freak
D. Smith, keep swift from East End Di-strict
I touch your favorite rhythm and give it a me-mix
Could I flex how ya flex, go long, I mean this
Say it once, said it twice, you need this
That’s an affirmative, word to Big Bird, it is
1st and 15th, I got the fireworks, turn it in
Bonfire burn again, listen good and learn the hymn
Yay, and it's simple and plain
You feel it in your chest when the bass beat bang
Yay, and you know my style
I’m from the Killer K, known to take a money pile
Wow, we turn it on and turn it out
It get greater later and it's fantastic now
It go on and on and on and on
Everybody talkin' like the dude Black Dan'

[Interlude: B.o.B]
Yeah it’s B.o., B
Bobby Ray, international extraordinaire
Listen, uh

[Verse 3: B.o.B.]
I’m from the city where they hang out on the light pole
Tryin’ to get their weight up off ‘em, I ain’t talkin’ lipo
I’m talkin’ bout that city I take everywhere that I go
I do this for the niggas locked in solitary iso
Who grew up with kaleidoscopes, now they lookin’ through rifle scopes
Tryin’ to make it out the dark, that’s what we raise our lighters for
Smokin’ on that blue turf just like them boys in Idaho
I swear I’m eatin’ good playa, what you on that diet for?
I’m chillin’ with some fire hoes, so hot you’ll need a fire hose
Too much pussy on your payroll boy, you need to fire hoes
(You’re fired) That’s why my fans is who I’m ridin’ for
You swear they never tire cause they hands up the entire show
But what you hidin’ for? I’m speakin’ for your benefit
Me to you is like PlayStation 3 to SEGA Genesis
I have no archnemesis, I have no identity
I just go gorillas in your village and start pillaging
Your city, I still got it, I don’t need to babysit
I’m just magnificent like Magic back in ‘86
I told her, “Cook my eggs Benedict”
She say I’m gettin’ cocky, now I say, “I’ve been a dick”

[Outro: B.o.B]
Bitch, haha, haha, oh yeah
It's B-O, B-O, B-O, B-O-B
Grand Hustle, Eastside stand up
Decatur, Zone 6, uh
It's on lock
From the bottom to the top
It's real hip-hop
Nigga

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Shattered glasses and cigarettes
There's a lot built up inside of me
And I have so many regrets
This isn't how things used to be
And you're never satisfied
Guess what? I'll stop fucking trying
You suck
In case you didn't know, you're horrible

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
But it's always true, I'm always wrong, anything I do
And I always go to war with you and I lose, yeah, yeah
I'm a silly dude 'cause I keep coming back to you
This is feeling like deja vu
My head's spinning around and you got me saying

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I, I, I, I
You're way too complicated
I, I, I, I
I can no longer take it
I, I, I, I
We're no good, let's just face it
I, I, I, I
'Cause you're way too complicated

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You're such a snobby girl, used to think you were a queen
Damn, sure did rain on my parade (Oh-oh-oh)
Same old silly games you play, this is such a waste of time
I'm starting to think that you're insane, cuckoo cuckoo, cuckoo cuckoo

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
But it's always true, I'm always wrong anything I do
And I always go to war with you and I lose, yeah, yeah
I'm a silly dude 'cause I keep coming back to you
This is feeling like deja vu
My head's spinning around and you got me saying

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I, I, I, I
You're way too complicated
I, I, I, I
I can no longer take it
I, I, I, I
We're no good, let's just face it
I, I, I, I
'Cause you're way too complicated

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
I'm not sure, what else can I do?
I've had enough of your rules
Yeah, you, way too Soduku, true
Ain't in no mood for proofs and square roots
Go ahead, run and find yourself another man who, who, who could
Figure you wild, I'm sick of your mouth
'Bout to slip, don't have to listen and rather sleep on the couch
Yeah, stick to my decision, chick, I'm kickin' you out
No mathematician, take the digits and bounce
You got me screamin' out

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I, I, I, I
You're way too complicated
I, I, I, I
I can no longer take it
I, I, I, I
We're no good, let's just face it
I, I, I, I
'Cause you're way too complicated
I, I, I, I
You're way too complicated
I, I, I, I
I can no longer take it
I, I, I, I
We're no good, let's just face it
I, I, I, I
'Cause you're way too complicated

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'm in love with you
But this ain't the honeymoon
We're passed the infatuation phase
We're right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day
I know I misbehaved
And you've made your mistakes
And we've both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

[Chorus]
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow

[Verse 2]
This ain't a movie, no
No fairytale conclusion, y'all
It gets more confusing every day, oh
Sometimes it's Heaven sent
Then we head back to Hell again
We kiss, then we make up on the way
I hang up, you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you to stay

[Chorus]
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, yeah, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow

[Bridge]
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay
Maybe you'll leave
Maybe you'll return
Maybe another fight
Maybe we won't survive
Maybe we'll grow
We'll never know
Baby, you and I

[Outro]
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go, yeah, hey
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow, hey, hey
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go, yeah
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh
This time we'll take it slow

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Cold blooded, chilly skin
Can't touch it like your front wheel when it's Wheely-ing
Wanna see Chilly free like Free Willy friend
Wanted to see Free Willy really swim
I'm super cold, my jacket thin
I'm two below like a marching band
That means I'm super-deep, you surface skim
I'm the whole thing, you niggas 2%
Put em up on that carton, I think I'm losing em
Bring all those St. Bernards in
Let's get some booze in them
You know them dogs with them barrels on they neck
And I'mma keep it cool like airholes on a Tec
I be moving birds like the scarecrow's on the set
Part dope-ass nigga, an old man winter
Christmastime diamond singing carols on my chest
Step up off the jet
Looking like a Pharaoh in the flesh

[Gilbere Forte]
Let em know
Im super cold, im super cold

[Please let them know]
Im super cold

[Please let them know]
I'm super cold

This life we made for us

[Asaad]
Going going going gone
Phil Rizutto flow, politics as usual
At home in my zone like an eskimo at 2 below
Good could be better, still I wish I knew what I know
Super cold, freezer burn, ugly and beautiful
Been in my zone for days, fortune favors the brave
Talent outshines hype, and hard work always pays
My mood is taupe melange, the sky's Obama gray
The flow is carolina blue, I wear b/red 1s every day
I'm super cold
Free Chilly, Free Haas, Free Jimmy
Free Big Meech, Free Tony
The flow is swell, Free Willy
A long way from a snot nose
Free lunch and two pennies
I'm taking it to the Moon
And I'mma let them know I'm from North Philly
I'm with Liva and it's ironic
Super cold, Nostalgic
My bad bitch is cold hearted
Phoebe Philo rockin
Color temperature climate
You ask how I describe it
Hood meets Antartic
I'm out of here, Harry Kalas

[Gilbere Forte]

Let em know
Im super cold, im super cold

[Please let them know]
Im super cold

[Please let them know]
I'm super cold

This life we made for us

[Ab-Liva]
I'm super cold, In my Louboutins
Under Phillip Lims
What's them bitches? Super thin
Tag along with a superstar
See the car that I'm cruising in
The Coupe's color banana pudding
The same exact one the proof is in
Blinded by that glare off of that spotlight that they view us in
Mandarin - Oriental, Red Eye--they flew us in
She half black, Speak Spanish
She Afro and Peruvian
Gansevoort, Sofitel, K West and we lose it in
Like you pretend
But the bow on the hood of the 2 door crept up with the bluest tint
I'm flying off, wings out
Burning down, foolish sin
Love hurts, brush 'em off
Once again, drew em' in
Once again, this cold flow
I jotted down with my super pen
One man, All this power
Feeling like I'm a super fiend
Been a while, I'm working hard
It's my time, I'm moving in
Only God knows, my arms raised
Just waiting on him to just cue me in
The best writer, hands down
I'm blacking out, nigga, rufilin

[Let 'em know]
Im super cold, im super cold

[Please let them know]
Im super cold

[Please let them know]
I'm super cold

This life we made for us
You're never gonna take it

It's like I flicked a switch, and now I'm feeling good (Bounce)
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could

No regrets, do you know what that means?

Got 4 homies in the ride now, ashtray on each door

Slow it down, down, down

Picking up the pieces that we left in the past

And the player so high, feeling like I got wings
I'm floating in the sky, living like I'm in the dream
And we pourin up and blowing up, smoke up in the air
Drinking and we lighten up, it's a perfect pair
Rolling with my partners, we leaning while we roll
Four deep in the slab and we looking for some hoes
Let it go, roll up some more, pour up some more
After this I'm a be laid on the floor
Wasted, but it's so good when you taste it
I'm addicted to this shit, might as well face it
Can't shake it, white cup stay full
Keep the blunt lit till I get the last pull
If you trying to feel good mayne, this will work
Sleeping all day when I'm gone

[Hook:]
Henny and purple, up in the sky
Spinning in circles, chasing the life
Henny and purple, henny and purple, henny and purple
Henny with the purple, mix it in the circle
Side of that kush yeah... push
Hard to take it easy cause she like it so rough
And she tryna be tough (she still she still yeah)
Morning to the evening and she can't get enough
No she can't get enough (she still she still woo)

Daydreams of your kisses and
Nightmares you went missing, girl
Caught up in your world, Wanna live up in you girl
Yeah you got me tripping, Ohh you got me wishing

When you're gone I miss you, yes I do
So don't you make me suffer, you pretty motherfucker

My arms here to hold you, to console you
Wanna feel your body close to mine
So you can let your body be free with me

Hard to take it easy cause she like it so rough
And she tryna be tough but she still scratchin' me up
Morning to the evening and she can't get enough
No she can't get enough cause she still scratchin' me up
Kissing on my neck slowly turn to biting cause she like it so rough and she still scratchin' me up
Digging in my skin from beginning to end and I'm tryna be tough cause she still scratchin' me up
The sheets, the pillows, the dresser, the covers, the mattress
The passion, the pain, the pleasure, whatever
Going girl, I'm going, you just keep that river flowing
Turn this bed into an ocean, wanna swim up in you girl
(And don't you try to run) Girl don't you try
(Girl we just begun) Girl we just begun
So don't you make me suffer, you pretty motherfucker
Got me going through withdrawals, girl I really need to touch you
My arms here to hold you, to console you
Wanna feel your body close to mine
So you can let your love be free with me

Hard to take it easy cause she like it so rough
And she tryna be tough but she still scratchin' me up
Morning to the evening and she can't get enough
No she can't get enough cause she still scratchin' me up
Kissing on my neck slowly turn to biting cause she like it so rough and she still scratching me up
Digging in my skin from beginning to end and I'm tryna be tough cause she still scratchin' me up

The stars are now aligned, your body needs mine
The fact remains the same, I'll take your pain if you take miiiii-iiiiiiiiine
My arms here to hold you, to console you
Wanna feel your body close to mine so you can let your love be free with me, with me

Hard to take it easy cause she like it so rough
And she tryna be tough but she still scratchin' me up
Morning to the evening and she can't get enough
No she can't get enough cause she still scratchin' me up
Kissing on my neck slowly turn to biting cause she like it so rough and she still scratching me up
Digging in my skin from beginning to end and I'm tryna be tough cause she still scratchin' me upp
It's Anticipation II and the freaky things you do
They started Anticipation I and she ain't done (still scratchin' me up)
Digging in my skin from beginning to the end
And I'm tryna be tough, cause she still scratchin' me up

[Intro]
G's up
Yeah, yeah, come on
You know how we do

[Verse 1]
I'm the kind of brother
Who been doing it my way, getting my way for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life, I've hit, love and left in tears
Without a care

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I can't figure it out, why...

[Chorus]
I'm so (Caught up)
Got me feeling it (Caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (Caught up)
Got me feeling it (Caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold on me

[Break 1]
Let me go, baby
Now, listen...

[Verse 2]
My mama told me
"Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around"
Same old song, nah
But I was so sure
That it wouldn't happen to me 'cause I know how to put it down
But I was so wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This girl was mean (So mean), she really turned me out
Her body was so tight, I'm lookin' for her in the daytime with a flashlight
My homies say this girl is cramping my style
(She's cramping my style)
And I can't figure it out, but...

[Chorus]
I'm so (Caught up)
Got me feeling it (Caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (Caught up)
Got me feeling it (Caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold
I'm so (Caught up)
Really feeling it (Caught up, hey)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (Caught up)
Really feeling it (Caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold on me

[Bridge]
And I think I like it baby, oh no
Oh yeah, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This girl was mean, she really turned me out
Yeah, yeah, sugar
My homies say this girl is cramping my style (Style)

[Chorus]
I'm so (Caught up)
I'm feeling it, yeah (Caught up)
I don't know what it is (What it is)
But it seems she's got me twisted (She really got me twisted)
I'm so (Caught up)
Really feeling it (Caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold
I'm so (Caught up)
I'm so (Caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm (Caught up)
Really feeling it (Caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold on me

[Verse 1]
Say is this home
Widely received, whenever I touchdown
Call me Young Touchdown, nothin' deeper than the end zone
I had a good year, like the blimp Ice Cube's a pimp on
I lips poem, the same blocks where I made everything rock like Flintstones
Drop with the rims on, clock with the gemstones
Can't call it like blocks on a Sprint phone
Flow incredible, remember, L-U-P-Emperor
Nickname December, move birds like winter
Mind on my tender, move words like verb
Drop lines like "enter"
Go on and get it Crunk
I ain't really gotta jump like centers
Wait, while you popping and panicking
Peep the demeanor that I'm standing in
Unfazed like I'm mocking a mannequin
Don't think its fluff cause the pampering
I'm still ruff like the unpaid man
Like the unpaved Madison
Straight where I stay like dogs that don't move
Obedient school made me so cool
I was so unruly
I used to chase cars, run behind female dogs
Wouldn't sit with shit
Now you cats can't move me

[Verse 2]
I'm a chaser
And niggas tryin' to take me off my paper
Like erasers
Let me put you on to somethin'
All I got is the other end for them
And their brother men that wanna get it bubblin'
It's nothing
So be clear
Like I'll pretend that me here
Not just help a friend, believe it
But if you feel you need it
Then I can be your last one like Jesus
With the ease to speak your English
You could be as hard as sign language with no fingers
Drama for the Domas, sky it so it lingers
And you'll never forget, like elephants
Thought you had yourself a slippa, like Cinderella prince
But instead you got yourself pimpa
Who wasn't hesitant to help yo limp like impotence Jack
Viagra to be more exact, Emperor to Emgera
Perhaps I rap to much on the issue
It's back to my ritual
We'll be back
If I happen to miss you
Clappin' the pistol
Burning like clap when you piss dude
Laughin' a little

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
I be over here, I be over there
You be on the outside wishin you were here
I be at the club, I be at the spot
You be talkin big but you really, really not
Cause you ain’t me and I ain't you
I ain't even gotta try, this is what I do
Cause you ain’t me and I ain't you
I ain't even gotta try, this is what I do
This is what I do

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
This is how my day go
Wake up, cross over, fade ho
I wake up with that leggo, 28th floor but I lay low
No lease ‘cause it’s paid fo, stack chips with my queso
Straight shots no hangover, real bitches, no fake hoes
Two chicks in Barbados, we bake O's like begals
Hasta luego, pasta alfredo
Authentic Italian linguine, Pasta, no Prego
Call me lieutenant, riding in a whip windows tinted
Got a tour bus with a room in it, loud pack, no stems, no seeds in it
When I ride on the beat, man I groove in it, hell yessir, I handle bussiness
I'm so prolific, it's no impostor-ing and no pretending

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Roscoe Dash]
Do it, do it, I did it, did it; it’s done, it's done, it’s finished, finished
Since I gotta put in that overtime gotta make that mine - I spin it
Man I got hits on hits on hits so why the hell they keep on pitchin
Got a whole lot of haters who don't '@' me when they mention
My music is like a drug man I’m just filling another prescription
I'd duck school and put the beat it at the school dentention
Call me Captain Hook, man absolute, murder make me a burger
I’m so further like some place that you ain’t hurt the pound working
See I gotta handle my business, I am so ambitious
I got big dough, that's biscuit, 30 knots ain't trippin'
So when I walk around that’s fitness, I passport when I visit
Overseas ball no pivot, you talk about it and I live it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Since day one you heard me from the underground to the surface
I rose out of the fire, I emerged out of the furnace
But I knew that my time would come, And I couldn't be more deserving
Man I swear I'm good for life, but still I'm far away from perfect
Shit I’m straight like 12:30, I'm eatin' good, Im burping
Chillin with brown sugar and cinnamon, one butter scotch and one Hershey (Good God)
With a booty so big you can probably Google Earth it
I’ma hit it girl with that long jump, With that Jackie Joyner, that Kersee
Now squirt for me, twerk it for em
I’m the professor of Real Nigga University
I hold my team down, anchorman Ron Burgundy
I’m tryin tell you man, I'm sharper than surgery
Bobby Ray!

[Hook]

[Intro]
Haha (I got it)
I couldn't help it
I love this song
Ayo, TreeJay

[Verse 1]
Uh, look
Got a sack and a pack of cigarillos (Uh-huh)
Ready to crack it, put some hash up in the middle
Blow, gone, lights out like padiddle
Rhymes like Busta, jazzy like fizzle (What?)
Mac Mizzle, your girl probably heard of me
My spit game real tight like a virgin be
Currency keep my paper runnin' like a gerbil feet
I'm sprintin' on the wheel 'til it hurts to breathe
And girl, me and you is like the birds and bees
When the weed stay burnin' to the third degree
I'm high, fly, got your girl smitten
She keep comin' back, call her badminton
Uh, pullin' petals off your flowers
You can get shagged like Austin Powers (Haha)

[Chorus]
So I pick my L up
This is that bomb, and I'm tryna get high today (Today)
Hittin' on my weed like
Blowin' out the smoke like
Yeah, I pick my L up
This is that bomb (Yeah), and I'm tryna get high today (Mac Miller)
Hittin' on my weed like
Ooh, I got a bunch of haze (Uh, look)

[Verse 2]
And I ain't gonna stop, no, not a hour
I see the game's filled with lots of cowards
So I'm here to coach like Tomlin, Cowher
Twenty-four hours, call Jack Bauer (Jack Bauer)
Status: Mac is way above the average
And I'm Jewish like Lenny Kravitz
So original, gotta get a patent
"Party in the U.S.A." gettin' blasted (Uh-huh)
Switch it up, feelin' good, fillin' up
Gettin' drunk, sippin' suds 'til I'm sick as fuck
But I ain't slippin' up, flow too perfect
Used to be a little thief goin' though purses (Haha)
But now I'm business, blowed off my third spliff
Do it like a furnace and burn it

[Chorus]
So I pick my L up
This is that bomb, and I'm tryna get high today
Hittin' on my weed like
Blowin' out the smoke like (Yeah)
Yeah, I pick my L up
This is that bomb, and I'm tryna get high today (The High Life)
Hittin' on my weed like (December 1st)
Ooh, I got a bunch of haze

[Outro]
Yeah, uh
Now what I need everybody to do (The High Life)
Roll up another, and just admit to yourself
That you're listenin' to that Miley Cyrus jam (December 1st)
Bitch (We comin')
Mac Miller
I'm tellin' y'all, December 1st
The High Life
Luda!

[Verse: Ludacris]
They say that real recognize real -
And I'm as real as they come, don't ever doubt me
You ain't never seen, read, or heard no fake shit about me
I'm a G! So all you hoes can eat a dick up and die
While I puff the magic dragon, heat the weed up and fly
Tuck your tail between your legs, ya'll ain't made for this shit
Worth a hundred million dollars, ya'll ain't paid for this shit
I'm talking Empire Building, we got Prada flows
And y'all so pussy you should fit in Lady Gaga's clothes
Nobody really wanna go there with me
Nobody really wanna say my name
Nobody wanna put the pedal to the metal
And meet me up in the ghetto we can throw them thangs
When I come up to the spot, in the drop top
With the Glock cocked, that'll make a nigga pop lock
Ludacris, I'mma hot shot, straight up out the block
With a knot that'll get a nigga block knocked (OW!)
Somebody tell 'em that I ain't playin with 'em!
Put a pussy nigga 6 feet deep in the ground and you'll be layin with 'em
I just been watchin over, from my mighty throne
Ya'll Roberto Duran, so just leave it alone
No Mas! No Mas!

[Chorus]
If I brought it out the crib that mean I’m spending everything
What we doing, getting money
How we do it, every day
Order case, tell the bartender we need thirty more
Nig if you ain't spending money what the fuck you in here for
In here for, what the fuck you in here for
Nig if you ain't spending money what the fuck you in here for
In here for, what the fuck you in here for
Bitch if you ain't trynna fuck then what the fuck you in here for

[Verse 1]
You know me no I don’t talk my nig I be about it
Can’t even count it, need an accountant
I’m rich so now my bitch is bad I need a stallion
Ain't trickin', I just treat her like she need allowance
Smoke the whole pound, man we gone need an island
Keep my toys in the garage so bitches think I’m childish
Oh, I got money you could keep your talent
You ain't even getting money you just be around it
Engine screaming when I run it
Waking neighbors when I’m coming
Here'em talking but they don’t want it, them niggas frontin'
Smoking loud they shit you smoke ain't sayin' nothing
Them niggas talking shit but they ain't sayin' nothing

[Chorus]
If I brought it out the crib that mean I’m spending everything
What we doing, getting money
How we do it, every day
Order case, tell the bartender we need thirty more
Nig if you ain't spending money what the fuck you in here for
In here for, what the fuck you in here for
Nig if you ain't spending money what the fuck you in here for
In here for, what the fuck you in here for
Bitch if you ain't trynna fuck then what the fuck you in here for

[Verse 2]
Diamonds all up in my chain, it's like an avalanche
Nigga tryna race my car, man he don’t stand a chance
Everything is all on us, that mean you gotta know
Bitch if you ain't tryna fuck, that mean you gotta go
Drinking liquor smoking weed, and ballin' everday
Making money fuckin hoes, I’m repping Taylor Gang
That nigga, they telling me I’m that nigga
Like the room's full of white folks, I’m that nigga
If you ain't talking money I can’t even rap with you
Major cake but niggas hate because my stacks bigger
Raw papers, long ones
Fucking with them Taylors boy you got the wrong one

[Chorus]
If I brought it out the crib that mean I’m spending everything
What we doing, getting money
How we do it, every day
Order case, tell the bartender we need thirty more
Nig if you ain't spending money what the fuck you in here for
In here for, what the fuck you in here for
Nig if you ain't spending money what the fuck you in here for
In here for, what the fuck you in here for
Bitch if you ain't trynna fuck then what the fuck you in here for

[Chorus: Nikkiya & Poo Bear]
There's nothing like my insulated walls around you
It’s so warm
Don’t you want to celebrate it
You can find me, somewhere in the middle of you
Somewhere in the middle of you
When I’m looking for the truth
I find it in the middle of you (You, you, you, you, you)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
You know I keep that weed lit
Met her once and let me hit
You asking for the remix, calling me cause this ain't what she want
She say, she need this, g-shit
Rolling Papers, told the neighbors
I be tryna keep you quiet, once we grown we sure to wake 'em
Roll this weed, before you leave, be sure to bake one
Got a man, but when he gone the boy replace him
Smoking OG Kush, that's Californication
On the phone, you fussing, while we fornicating (tahaha)

[Chorus: Nikkiya, Poo Bear & Wiz Khalifa]
There's nothing like my insulated walls around you (Yeah)
It’s so warm
Don’t you want to celebrate it
You can find me, somewhere in the middle of you
Somewhere in the middle of you
When I’m looking for the truth
I find it in the middle of you (You, you, you, you, you)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, well, I'mma let you roll one
Let you light it
Nice car, let you drive it
Let you have the time of your life
Go on and get excited
Yup, all your friends invited
My jewelry the brightest
Loud weed, I’m smoking Leonidas
On my team, only cause we the tightest
Shopping spree’s, shit I should be your stylist
Them niggas try to beat
When you with me I pound it
Get you so high you gone need a pilot (Tahaha)

[Chorus: Nikkiya, Poo Bear & Wiz Khalifa]
There's nothing like my insulated walls around you (Yeah)
It’s so warm
Don’t you want to celebrate it
You can find me, somewhere in the middle of you
Somewhere in the middle of you
When I’m looking for the truth
I find it in the middle of you (You, you, you, you, you)

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
You roll one, I'll roll one too
You find me
Me in the middle of
You roll one, I’ll roll one too
Nowhere I’d rather be
Than the middle of you

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
Bottle after bottle
Got you ready for the world to see it, all
3 am in the morning, I’m the one you call
Got the car keys, pedal to the floor, I’m on my way flow
I ain't on no kid shit but I stay with some play dough
Keep it Taylored, every day she notice that
Roll it up, light with my homies, sit and hold it in
That's a fact you chilling too much
You need excitement
Now you sky high, on some first flight shit

[Chorus: Nikkiya & Poo Bear]
There's nothing like my insulated walls around you
It’s so warm
Don’t you want to celebrate it
You can find me, somewhere in the middle of you
Somewhere in the middle of you
When I’m looking for the truth
I find it in the middle of you (You, you, you, you, you)

[Verse 1]
It's 2 am
Got a call
From a girl
You should know
She heard a noise
Got a little scared
Now you of all people know
She hates sleeping alone
But still you ain't home
So since you're nowhere to be found
Don't trip bro I'mma hold her down

[Hook]
I'm your girlfriends best friend
Soon I'll be taking over
I'm your girlfriends best friend
You don't treat her like your supposed to
With your wandering eyes
All your cheating and lying
I'mma step up and do what I gotta
As your girlfriends best friend
Soon I'll be taking
Soon-soon I'll be taking your spot

[Verse 2]
Now I'm not hating
On your situation
But all I'm saying
These chicks are crazy
You've got a good girl
Who's all about you
It's gonna take you losing her
For you to know what you really had
On the spotlight
But as soon as you drop the ball
I'll be ready to pick up where you left off

[Hook]
I'm your girlfriends best friend
Soon I'll be taking over
I'm your girlfriends best friend
You don't treat her like your supposed to
With your wandering eyes
All your cheating and lying
I'mma step up and do what I gotta
As your girlfriends best friend
Soon I'll be taking
Soon-soon I'll be taking your spot

[Bridge]
To be honest, I ain't perfect
A saint by no means
But I'm on the outside looking in
And it ain't a pretty picture by no means
I could push up on her but that ain't me
I'm a just sit here and wait my turn

[Hook]
I'm your girlfriends best friend
Soon I'll be taking over
I'm your girlfriends best friend
You don't treat her like your supposed to
With your wandering eyes
All your cheating and lying
I'mma step up and do what I gotta
As your girlfriends best friend
Soon I'll be taking
Soon-soon I'll be taking your spot

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I have a dream of a scene between the green hills
Clouds pull away and the sunlight's revealed
People don't talk about keeping it real
It's understood that they actually will
And intoxicated and stimulated MCs
Staring in the trees, paranoid, are gone in the breeze
Watch them flee, hip-hop heads
Take a walk with me and what you'll see
Is a land where the sand is made up of crushed up wax
And the sky beyond you is krylon blue
And everybody speaks in a dialect of rhyme
And MCs have left materialism behind them

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Meanwhile, I just grip my mic
And hope me and my team make it through alright
Because say what you will and say what you might
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Because this is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to wherever music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same
And dedicated to the people advancing the game
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run
Who are hiding in the shadows, waiting for the sun

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I've seen a lot of ****, I've talked to a bum
Out on Sunset Strip, he asked me, "How would you feel
If everybody acted like you didn't exist?
You'd lose your grip, probably eventually flip"
So let it be known, the only reason that we do this
Is so you can pick it up and just bang your head to it
While MCs fight to see who can be the commonest
Be floating overhead like a space odyssey monolith
Over seeing the game, over being part of the same old thing
It's all gonna change in a hurricane of darkness and pain
And acidic rain and promises that you won't do it again

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Meanwhile, I just grip my mic
And hope me and my team make it through alright
Because say what you will and say what you might
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Because this is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to wherever music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same
And dedicated to the people advancing the game
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run
Who are hiding in the shadows, waiting for the sun

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide
Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to wherever music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same
And dedicated to the people advancing the game
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run
Who are hiding in the shadows, waiting for the sun
This is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to wherever music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same
And dedicated to the people advancing the game
What's real, everybody who doesn't feel safe
What's real, everybody who knows they're out of place
What's real, anybody with nowhere to run
Who hides in the shadows, waiting for the sun

[Verse: Earl Sweatshirt]
Yea I'm your new fetish
Rip through cyphers like rabbits chew lettuce
Young black fresh: Hugh Hef, you said it
Grinding with your girl while you're posted, two steppin' (you said it)
Pen in my right, mic in my left fist
Flow got more bang than two weapons
Undetected I'm the best: no question, who said it?
Couldn't find your style with two fuckin' detectives
Straight to the top please no prerequi-sites
I'm the shit's that's on ya face like zits
Cocky bastard, disappear when the 3/8 hits
Back and forth pacing, got no patience
Pulse racin' I’m amazin' as grace is, fuck Satan (uhh)
Leave his pussy ass with his face caved in
Face it, this adolescent's presence leaves messes keep stepping
Rep niggas with no rep, ho's separate
Niggas with no breath
Ain't no real kin of me
I'm clever, my endeavor sever several wannabes
I'm chilly, got the girls giddy, my flow silly
Roll with me and your crew ain't nothing but four 50's (Ouch!)
Hadn't noticed, that's a mid-200
Me and my crew, both of them, powered in two tundras
Open up your eyes, witness the boy wonder (open em up!)
Fire flow comparable to two summers
Strike like lightning and I don't need thunder
Hold up, hey now, the beast in me
Is no longer sleeping, it wants to eat MC's
So I let 'em free, let 'em feed peacefully
Until he cease, now a beast must drop feces
But I never let it free fall, I catch it and spit it
I kick shit that blows whole districts into tidbits
With pen in fist, I take tallys, of these scrimmages
Can't call it game, my juego wicked as witches is
The kid spits fuego sicker than syphilis
So sister and brothers grab a shovel start digging this
Matter fact, grab a Nikon and picture this
An icon with no assistance and no assist in this
Reminisce the number one plus twenty three
My days are sunny with steeze sweeter than honey bees
Waters are muddy, I'm cunning running from nothing be
Now I'm fucking muffin mothafuckas ain't touch me

[Intro]
Mmm, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm feeling like a star, you can't stop my shine
I'm loving cloud nine, my head's in the sky
I'm solo, I'm riding solo
I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo, solo

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm feeling good tonight
Finally doing me and it feels so right, oh
Time to do the things I like
Going to the club, everything's alright, oh
No one to answer to
No one that's gon' argue, no
And since I got the hold off me
I'm living life now that I'm free, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me get my shit together
Now I got my shit together, yeah, yeah
Now I made it through the weather
Better days are gon' get better
I'm so sorry that it didn't work out (Didn't work out)
I'm moving on
I'm so sorry but it's over now (Over now)
The pain is gone

[Chorus]
I'm putting on my shades to cover up my eyes
I'm jumping in my ride, I'm heading out tonight
I'm solo, I'm riding solo
I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo, solo
I'm feeling like a star, you can't stop my shine
I'm loving cloud nine, my head's in the sky
I'm solo, I'm riding solo
I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo, solo

[Verse]
Seven o'clock in the morning
And the rays from the sun wakes me
I'm stretching and yawning
In a bed that don't belong to me
And a voice yells, "Good morning, darling" from the bathroom
Then she comes out and kisses me
And to my surprise she ain't you
Now I've got this dumb look on my face like what have I done?
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here 'til the morning sun?
Must have lost the track of time
Oh, what was on my mind?
From the club, went to her home
Didn't plan to stay that long
Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes
Searching for my car keys
Tryin' to get on up out the door
Then she stretched her hands in front of it
Said, "You can't go this way"
Looked at her, like she was crazy
Said, "Woman, move out my way"
Said, "I got a wife at home"
She said, "Please don't go out there"
"Lady, I've got to get home"
She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs
"Shh, shh, quiet, hurry up and get in the closet"
She said, "Don't you make a sound, or some shit is going down"
I said, "Why don't I just go out the window?"
"Yes, except for one thing, we on the fifth floor"
"Shit, think, shit, think, shit, quick, put me in the closet"
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house
And he walks in and yells, "I'm home"
She says "Honey I'm in the room"
He walks in there with a smile on his face
Sayin', "Honey, I've been missin' you"
She hops all over him and says "I've cooked and ran your bathwater"
I'm telling you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar
Throws her in the bed and starts to snatching her clothes off
I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?
You're not gonna believe it, but things get deeper as the story goes on
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate
But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late
He hopped up and said, "There’s a mystery going on
And I'm going to solve it"
And I'm like, "God please, don't let this man open this closet"
He walks in the bathroom
And looks behind the door
She says, "Baby, come back to bed"
He says, "Bitch, say no more"
He pulls back the shower curtain
While she's biting her nails
Then he walks back to the room
Right now, I'm sweating like hell
Checks under the bed (Bed)
Then under the dresser (Dresser)
He looks at the closet (Closet)
I pull out my Beretta (Beretta)
He walks up to the closet (Closet)
Get closer to the closet (Closet)
Now he's at the closet (Closet)
Now he’s opening the closet (Closet, closet, closet...)

[Verse]
Well...
Now he’s staring at me like as if he was staring in the mirror
She yells, "Honey, let me explain"
He says, "You don't have to go no further
I can clearly see what's goin' on
Behind my back, in my bed, in my home"
Then I said, "Wait a minute, now hold on"
I said, "Mister, we can work this out"
She said, "Honey, don't lose control"
I tried to get him to calm down
He said, "Oh, I should have known
That you would go and do some bogus shit up in my house
But the Christian in me gave you the benefit of the doubt"
I said, "We need to resolve this"
Then he stepped to me, I'm like, "Whoa
There's a reason I'm in this closet"
He says, "Yeah, what are you talking clothes?"
"I met this girl at the Paje's club
And she told me she didn't have a man"
Then he said, "Man, please
I'd kill you if you didn’t have that gun in your hand"
And then I said, "But your chick chose me"
He said, "Don't give me that mack shit, please"
His phone goes off and then things get a little more interesting
He steps a little closer
I point my gun and says, "I'm not the one you after"
He says, "Something I bet you didn't know my man
Did she tell you that I was a pastor?"
I said, "Well good that's better, right
Why can't we handle this Christian-like?"
And I started to put the gun down
'Til I saw his face still had that frown
She started crying, saying "Baby, I'm sorry"
Then he said, "Baby not as sorry as you're gonna be"
I started inching out
He says, "No, I want you to see this"
Said, "I gotta get out this house"
He said, "Not 'til I reveal my secret"
I'm like "What is going on inside his head?"
Then he takes his phone and calls somebody up and says
"Hello" (Hello?) baby (Aha)
“Turn the car around” (What’s going on over there?)
Listen I just need for you to get right back here now" (Click)
He looks at me and says, "Well, since we're all coming out the closet
I'm not about to be the only one that's brokenhearted"
And she said, "What do you mean?"
And he said, "Just wait and see"
I said, "Somebody better talk to me"
And then his phone rings
He picks up and somebody says "Sweetheart, I'm downstairs"
And he's like "I'll buzz you up
I'm on the fifth floor, hurry take the stairs"
And I'm like, "Who is this mystery lady that you're talking to?"
He says, "In time you both will know the shocking truth
Baby, this is something I've been wanting to get off my chest for a long, long time"
Then I said, "Nigga, I'ma shoot you both
If you don't say what's on your mind"
He said "wait, I hear somebody comin' up the stairs"
And I'm lookin' at the door
He says, "I think you better sit down in the chair"
I says, "I'm gonna count to four"
"One..." he says, "Mister, wait!"
"Two...", she says, "Please don't shoot"
"Three...", he says, "Don't shoot me"
"Four...", she screams
Then a knock on the door, the gun's in my hand
He opens the door, I can't believe it's a man
(Man… man… man…)

[Sylvester scoffs]

[Tawn:] "Yeah bruh-in-law that's what I'm talking about shoot em"

[Sylvester scoffs]

[Sylvester scoffs again] "Shh"

[Gwen calls] Sylvester say "it's Gwen man calm your voice doooooowwwwnnnnnnn, hello" (staticing)

Meanwhile at the church, Rufus is getting his praise on
With the Reverend Mosley James Evans in the peace within choir
Oh they dancing, oh they shouting, so many people being broken
You gotta see the rest for yourself, the doors to the church is open
(Song changes as Reverend MJE and choir sings)
"He will (Jesus goin work it out) work it out (Jesus goin work it out)
God will (Jesus goin work it out) work it out (Jesus goin work it out)
Saints (Jesus goin work it out) don't cha get my offer (Jesus goin work it out)
Don't cha get my offering (Jesus goin work it out) uh, and the second offering (Jesus goin work it out)
Hey! (Work it out)
Didn't he didn't he work it out (work it out) didn't he didn't he work it out (work it out)

Hey, good God almighty, how many of y'all know that he worked it out? (Yeah!)
Choir help me (worked it out) hey, he done already did it (for you-ooh-ooh)
Hallelujah!"

Then Rufus goes to his office and answers his phone
Put his hand over the speaker told his assistant "I need to be alone" (work it out)
He watches her as she leaves the room (for you-ooh-ooh)

[Reverend MJE:] "Said I got the rest of the church is open, Pimp Lucus come on down, hallelujah! "
She closes the door, and then, he says "Chuck"
(Song changes back from beginning)
Then Chuck says "Rufus! "
And then they talk at the same time then Rufus says "Chuck you go first"
"Rufus I been try'na get in touch with you, I'm blowing up your phone"
Then Rufus says "I had a lot of things to do around the church Chuck tell me what's wrong? "
"What's wrong, what's wrong, I'll tell you what's wrong, Rufus I'm missing you"
"Chuck calm down, I miss you too"
"How come you haven't called me? " "All because I been busy"
"Ooh that is a lie" "Chuck I'm telling the truth" "bullshit Rufus that is not the real excuse
It's her" "Chuck wait a minute—" "It's her ain't it"
"Chuck listen to me, (Chuck weeps) now you know and I know that Cathy is my wife
I mean, you knew that I had another life"
"Yeah that's true, sure I knew and we vowed to keep it between us too
All of the hotels and things we do, how we told each other I love you" "Chuck"
"And you told me I was your dream come true" "Chuck"
"And now you're throwing your wife at my face, wasn't saying that shit when I was fucking you! " "Chuck not on the phone!"
Cathy walks in to let Rufus know she's back
Rufus pause for a minute and then says "Chuck I'll call you back"
He hangs up and then Cathy says "baby who were you talking too? "
He didn't know he pushed speaker phone, Chuck cries out "RUFUS I NEED YOU! "
Cathy starts snapping then Chuck starts snapping
Then Rufus tries to calm him down, Cathy took in the phone and throwing it around
Then Rufus says "Cathy go" she says "oh you putting me out your office?
All the shit we just went through Rufus" "Cathy go back in church I got this"
Cathy leaves out; Rufus gets right back on the phone and says "Chuck let me come see ya"
Chuck says "no" then Rufus says "we gotta talk" Chucks says "Rufus don't let me goooooooooooo"
He cries, but Rufus he ain't feeling it
But Chuck is steady going on and crying ("Rufus I really love you don't let me go") but he ain't feeling it
("Don't leave me!!") He's talking, coughing, cursing and screaming and crying
Then Rufus says "Chuck, this is gonna be hard" "Rufus" "but I love my wife" "Rufus!" "Besides I'm a man of God!"
"Rufus! " Chuck says "Rufus I'm not gonna accept that, I'm going straight to the news! "
Then Rufus says "Chuck, slow down you don't know what'cha saying you're confused! Rufus says "let come see ya! "
Chuck says "NO! " Rufus says "WHY!? "

[Coughs] "Cause I'm in the hospital"

[Verse]
Well, here we are, the four of us
In total shock, me and her
I closed my mouth and swallowed spit
As I'm thinking to myself, "This is some deep shit!"
And I said, "So you're gonna tell me he's the one you been talking to?"
He says, "Yes", I says, "No"
He says, "Yes", I says, "No", he says, "It's the truth!"
I yell, "All of y'all ass is crazy, let me up out this door
Because this is way more than I bargained for"
And then she says, "Wait, I'm sure we can all fix this"
Then I said, "I'm late, plus I ain't got a damn thing to do with this!"
But then she said, "But wouldn't you like to know just how it all began?"
Then I thought to myself, and said, "Quick, you got three minutes"
And then it got real quiet, I said, "Somebody start talking"
Then she said, "My God, Rufus! I've got just one question:
How could you do something like this? I'm so hurt!"
He looked at her and said, "Bitch please, you've got your nerve
With all your club hopping, lying saying you was shopping
And now here you are in our home, and you're calling me wrong?"
She said, "Okay, you busted me!
And that much I agree, you've caught me cheating!
But this is a little extreme!"
He said, "You are my wife sleeping behind my back
And now I come home and you got him in the closet, how extreme is that?!"
And she said, "But she's a he!"
Then he said, "Please, you can't judge me"
She said, "Rufus, this is crazy!"
Then I said, "Stop arguing!
I did not stay here to hear y'all chew each other out
So, get to the point, or I swear I'm out!"
"Excuse me, please, but I think I can explain what's going on in here
My name is Chuck and I been knowing Rufus about a year
At midnight creeping around with him has been a living hell
Sneaking in and out of hotels"
I said, "Brother, spare me the details!"
Then Rufus said, "Chuck, please! Don't say nothing else!"
Then she screams, "Rufus, you son of a bitch"
He says, "Cathy, go to hell!"
I said, "I thought you said your name was Mary
That what you said at the party
Man this is gettin' scary, I'm gonna shoot somebody"
Then Rufus starts yelling and screaming, saying, "Cathy, this is all your fault!"
She throws a pillow at him and says, "You were creeping too
The only difference is you didn't get caught!"
Chuck screamed out, "WE'RE IN LOVE!"
Cathy says, "Love my ass!"
Rufus said they're getting married, then I shoot one in the air!
Then I said, "Not another one of you sons of bitches say a word!
'Cause all this shit I'm going through is unheard!"
I grabbed my cellular
Said, "This is so wrong", I call up my home
And a man picks up the phone (phone, phone, phone...)
"Hello? Hello?"

[Verse]
Now I'm dashing home
Doing 85
Swerving lane to lane, with fire in my eyes
I got a million thoughts
Going through my mind
I'm thinking about what I'ma do
And who I'm gonna do it to when I get home
How could I have been so blind?
And then I look in my rear view
I cannot believe this
(Whoo whoo whoo)
Damn, here comes a policeman
He drove right up on me and flashed his lights
Then I pulled over without thinking twice
He hops out the car and walked over to me
And said, "License and registration please."
I looked up at him and said
"Officer, is there something wrong?"
He said, "No, except you were doing 60 in a 40 mile zone"
Then I said, "Officer
Let me explain please
You see the truth of the matter is
Is that I got an emergency."
He said, "No excuses and no exception."
He flicks his cigarette as he gave me the ticket
Said, "Have a nice day.", and walked away
I said, "Yeah right.", and drove away
Then I turned my radio on
And did 55 all the way home
I pulled up in the driveway
Hopped out and slammed the car door
Then go in through the back
Bust up in the house
Pull back the shower door
And she screaming, "What's all that for?"
Then I'm like, "Woman I called this house
And a man picked up my phone"
Then she said, "Calm down
Did you forget my brother 'Twan came home"
"Oh..."
And that's all I could say was "oh"
With a stupid look on my face
Said, "I forgot he came home today."
And she said, "That's okay
Because honey I understand
She said you don't have to explain."
Then I took her by the hand
I kissed her and then we went to the room
Then I turned some music on
Apologized one more time
Then went down and start getting it on
And she started biting her lip
Grabbing me and making noise
Now we making love and she's in my ear whispering
"It's all yours."
I said, "I love you."
And she said, "I love you, too."
Then a tear fell up out my eye
And then I called her my sunshine
And then she looked at me
And said, "Baby go deeper please."
And that's when I start goin' crazy
Like I was tryin' to give her a baby
The room feel like it's spinning
'Cause we keep turning and turning
As if we were in a whirlwind
The way our toes are curling
The next thing ya know, she starts going real wild
And starts screaming my name
Then I said, "Baby, we must slow down
Before I bust a vessel in my brain."
And she said, "Please no don't stop."
And I said, "I caught a cramp."
Then she said, "Please keep on going."
I said, "My leg is about to crack."
Then she cries out
"Oh my goodness, I'm about to climax."
And I said, "Cool, climax
Just let go of my leg!"
She says, "You're the perfect lover."
I said, "I can't go no further."
Then I flip back the cover
Oh my God, a rubber (rubber, rubber, rubber...)

[Verse]
And now, I'm like
"Well, well, well, what the fuck is this?
A condom in my bed
You better start talking, fucking bitch
'Fore I take a match and burn this motherfucker down"
I said, "You better start talking
And start talking right god damn now"
Then she said, "Baby, I'm so speechless"
Then I said, "My baby, you gon' be breathless
If ya don't start talking quick
Woman, I'm gon' have a fit
You don't know what ya fucking with
Girl ya better cut the bullshit
Now it's obvious somebody has been all up in my home
In my bed, and plus I smell cigarettes."
Now I'm sniffing and looking around
Suspicious like someone's here
And then I looked in her eyes
And in her eyes there was so much fear
Pull out my gun said, "Is he still here?"
She shook her head and said nah
I'm checking behind every door
She cried out, "He left right after you called."
I said, "What the fuck was you thinking?
Thought that I wouldn’t find this out?
Then I said you must be crazy or
On crack to have somebody off up in my motherfucking house"
She hopped up and said, "That's enough."
She said, "I can't take no more."
And then she said, "You made your point
But now it's time to even the score."
She said, "I know all about last night
And where you went when you left the club."
Said, "That's right, nigga I was there
With this guy in the back of the club."
I said, "I thought you was with yo' girls?"
She said, "I thought you was with yo' guys?"
She said, "You was at that bitch's house
And don't even try to act surprised."
I say "babe...", she said, "Shut up
Don't you say a word
It ain't nothing you can say
That I ain't already heard."
Then I said, "Woman, don't you try to turn it all around
'Cause the fact still remains that someone else was in my house."
Then she said, "You're right about that
Something did go down, but I don't have to turn it around
'Cause what goes around comes back around."
I'm moving a little closer to her
She's tripping over the furniture
She said, "Wait first, just let me explain."
I said, "No need to just give me his name."
And then she said, "Uh... uh"
I say, "Uh, what?"
She said, "please sit down in a chair"
And I say, "No, I'm standing up"
And then she cries out, "I'm so scared to tell you
Because of what you might do"
And I screamed, "Look girl, you better give me this man's name
And I'm not playing with you."
She says "Okay", wipes her nose and then asks me about a girl named Tina
I thought to myself said it sounds familiar
Then I said, "I probably know her if I seen her"
Then I said, "Anyway, girl
What the hell does that got to do with this man?"
She said, "He know my girl Roxanne"
I said, "Who the hell is Roxanne?"
Then she says, "Roxanne's a friend of mine
Who knew this guy named Chuck
Chuck's cool with this guy named Rufus"
And I'm sitting here like, "what the fuck?!"
Then she says, "Rufus wife, Cathy
We both went to high school
She introduced me to the policeman that stopped you"
Believe it or not
I just started laughin'
Shaking my head
And just kept on laughin'
Thinking about all the things I had been through that day
Then she cries, "What? Why do you have that smile upon your face?"
Then I laughed out said, "Thinking about the things that I've been through"
She wipes her nose and she sniggles and laughs out, "I've been through it too"
Then I start laughing again
And she start laughing more
Then next thing you know we both are
Cracking up on the floor
And she laughs out, "I can't believe this idiot really answered my phone"
Now meanwhile 'Twan just got out of prison and he's on his way home
Then she laughs, "Baby I'm sorry for all the lies and all the bullshit"
Then I say girl, "Just wait till I tell you all the drama that I've been dealing wit'"
She laughs, "I wanna hear it all"
Then I laugh and say, "Baby first of all
I got a hangover, been trapped in the closet, slept wit who knows, threatened to kill a pastor"
She says, "What?"
"Baby this is no lie, he had a lover, turns out to be a gay guy"
She says, "Damn you've been through a lot of shit"
"Plus I got a ticket"
Meanwhile the policeman he turns around
Just out of concern comes back to the house
Then he pulls up in the driveway
My car's parked crooked with the lights on
Then he goes around the back way
He hear the dogs barking like something's wrong
He gets to the backdoor and discover it's been broken in
He looks around, pulls his gun out, then proceeds in
Meanwhile we're laughing and laughing and laughing
But from his perspective he thinks somebody's crying
He gets closer to the bedroom and he would swear that somebody was coughing and sighing
Meanwhile we're in the bedroom laughing as I'm trying to continue to explain
She yells out, "Sylvester, you're killing me"
I said, "I swear that it went that way"
Then next thing you know, he bust up in the room said, "Muthafucka freeze!"
And then I looked back up at him and said, "Wait, you're that damn police!"
Then she screams, "Baby, I mean James." She says, "Everything is cool"
And then he yells, "Gwendolyn, I got this
I know you're sick and tired of this fool!"
Then I stood up, start walking toward him screaming, "Man, get out my house!"
Then he yells, "Freeze!" She screams, "Please!" And I pulled my Beretta out
She cried out "Sylvester, please don't!"
Visions of him making love to her
He said, "Man, put the gun on the floor"
I can't stop thinking about him and her
I slowly put the gun down and then I put my hands up
He winked at me and smiled
And that is when I went nuts
Hopped all over him grabbed the gun
She screaming, "Settle down!"
Going all around both handling the gun then all of a sudden, POW
There's total silence, blood everywhere
And confusion on their faces as they continue to stare
Then Gwen starts shakin' and cryin' screamin', "What did you do?"
And then the policeman looks at me and screams, "See, now I warned you."
Then he starts pacing the floor screamin', "God, what have we done here?!"
And she rushed to to door, blood on her hands screamin', "There goes your whole career."
Meanwhile, I'm freakin' out sayin', "We gotta do somethin' and gotta do somethin' quick."
Then he picks up the gun and says, "I have a wife at home, I can't have no parts of this"
She says, "James, I can't believe you just said what you said
Cause that's not what you said when your ass was in my bed"
Then I said, "Get married later, but right now we gotta use our heads
First of all, did anybody think to check if the man was alive or dead?"
Then he looks at her, she looks at me, I look at them and we look at him
Meanwhile, Gwen's about to have a nervous breakdown the way she's shakin' and cryin'
And then she screams, "You bastards! You've killed my brother"
And then I said, "Gwen, wait a minute, I didn't..."
She says, "No, you killed my brother"
She said, "He just got out of prison. He's been through a lot
He was talking about changin' his life and everything and to come home and get shot"
Then I said "Baby, it wasn't my fault. This man had a gun on me
And besides, how was I to know that you was getting down with this crooked ass police"
And he says, "Wait a minute..." I say "No, you wait a minute!"
And then I say, "Man, this is my wife. We had a life until you butted up in it"
She cried out "Sylvester, now hold on. Even though he was in our home
Let's not forget the fact that you was out there creepin' in another man's home"
*Cough cough* *cough cough*
Twan starts coughin' *cough cough*
She says, "Twan! Oh my god! Baby brother, are you okay?"
He looks up at her and says, "I'm not gonna die, at least not today."
And then he asks, "What happened?" and says, "Why did I get shot?
Sylvester what is this policeman doin' here?"
And I said "Go on, tell him cop"
He says, "Son, we gotta get you to a hospital and take a look at that wound"
Twan says, "No, I'm okay. It's just my shoulder. All I need is a bathroom"
Now five minutes has gone by and they tellin' Twan everything that happened
Twan says, "Shit, man, I would've been better off in prison"
And now somebody's banging at the door and I'm like, "Oh no! Here we go again!"
Thinkin' out loud to myself sayin', "When is this shit gonna end?!"
Then Gwendolyn looks at me and says "Baby, you got that?" And I say "NO!"
She says, "Why?" And I said, "Because I'm not openin' up another motherfuckin' door!"
And the cop says, "Gwen, I'll get it." Then looks at me and say, "Man of the house, my ass!"
Then I say, "I'll get it, but whoever it is, I'm about to put their ass on blast!"
And the the policeman grabbed me I snatched away and got my gun up off the floor
Then Twan says, "Man, that's what I'm talkin' about! Sylvester, point that shit toward the door!"
Then he snatches the policeman's gun and says "Officer, arrest me later."
I count to three, 'Twan opened the door and it's Rose the nosy neighbor...
Ooh, with a spatula in her hand
Like that's gon' do something against them guns
It's Rosy the nosy...whoo!...Neighbor....

[Verse]
The policeman gets in his car
And gets right on the phone
Backing up, shaking his head saying
"Let me get my crazy ass home"
And his wife picks up and says
"Darlin' where have you been
I've been worried about you"
And he says "Police business, honey, I can't wait
To tell you what I've been going through"
She says "Are you okay?" "Yes"
"Do you need anything?" "No"
"Well, I baked you a pie" "Mmm"
"Your favorite: cherry"
Then he said "I'll be there soon
Sorry I kept you hanging"
Then she said, "Honey, don't worry about it
Just take your time, I still got some cleanin'"

Now meanwhile Miss Rosie's back at Gwen's house
Tellin' it all
She said, "I knew there was something about that policeman
I started to cut loose my dog"
Gwendolyn looks at her and laughs and says
"Miss Rosie you are nuts"
And I say, "All I wanted to know
Was what was you gonna do with that spatula?"
And then we all laughed
'Twan says, "She's a G no doubt"
Now let's head right back on over
To the policeman's house
He pulls up in the garage
She doesn't expect for him to come that soon
She rushed to the door
Kiss him on the cheek says, "I was in the restroom"
Then he said "Whatcha say that for?"
And then she says, "I don't know"
Then he step back, look at her and says
"What you all jittery for?"
Then she says, "Sweetheart, maybe it's that time of the month"
Then he says, "Maybe? Maybe that time of the month?"
And then she said, "You know what I mean"
He says, "I know what came out yo mouth"
He said, "You said maybe"
Then she says, "Baby", he walks in the house
And she tries to lead him upstairs
But he goes straight to the kitchen
She says, "Hun, I bought you some pears"
And then he said, "I'mma heat this chicken"
Then she turns around thinking to herself
With this weird look on her face
Then he screams, "Woman, what's wrong with you
Why are you walking back and forth, pacing?"
Before she answers she's thinkin' to herself
"What am I to say?"
Because the truth of the matter is
That she just slept with another man today
And he started calling her name
"Bridget, I know you hear me"
But she can't turn around
Because the truth on her face
He will see it
Then he screams "Bridget!"
"Yes" "Look at me"
Bridget turns around and then he says
"What you got up your sleeve?"
She's scared out of her mind
Stuttering and shaking and
Still talking about some pears
He starts screaming saying
"Look woman I done told you I'm not going up no stairs"
Now he's got a funny feeling
Something just don't seem right
He's looking at her while she's backing up
Then he says, "With all my might
Woman, I swear I'll shoot somebody
If you been doin' wrong"
But little does he know that somebody is still right there in his home
He looks around the kitchen and says, "Something is really weird"
She says, "Why do you say that?"
He says "'cause you keep tryin' to get me out of here"
He says "Ever since I been in this house your face has went from white to red
And remember when I first walked through the door
You act like you had seen a ghost from the dead"
Then he says, "Girl if you hidin' something I'm gonna be so mad"
Then he hears something fallin' he says "What the fuck was that?"
She says "It sound like it came from upstairs, sounds like the plumbing"
He said "Woman that sound did not come from upstairs
I'll be damned if you're not up to something
Now the sound that I just heard, it came from this kitchen."
And then he looks over by the stove
While shes easin' over by the dishes
And then he walks over to the refrigerator and pushes it back
And then he looks her in her face, looks like she's about to have a heart attack
Then he notices the pie on the counter: one slice is missing
Now the story's gettin' scary
'Cause he comes to realize that Bridget is allergic to cherries
Then he slowly looks up at her and now her face is red as hell
He's breathing real hard, movin' closer, she says, "Hun, you don't look so well"
And then he says, "Move!"
She says, "No"
He says, "Move!"
She says, "No"
"BITCH MOVE!!!" She moves!
And then, he looks at the cabinet
He walks to the cabinet
Get close to the cabinet
Now he's opening the cabinet
Now pause the movie 'cause what I'm about to say to y'all is so damn twisted
Not only is there a man in this cabinet
But the man is a midget (midget, midget, midget...)
Now the midget jumps out of the cabinet and stomps the policemen on his toe
The policeman's hoppin' around on one leg screamin', "Son of bitch", while he runs under the table
He yells, ''Freeze'' dives over the table and lands on the midget
While the midget is kickin' real fast screamin' out, "Bridget, Bridget"
She yells, "Darlin' don't hurt him". He says, "Bridget get yo' ass back"
Then he continues to rough up the midget as if the midget was under attack
Then Bridget runs up to her room, goes in her purse and pulls a number out
The police puts him on the table and yells, "Man, what the hell you doin' in my house?!"
He wipes cherry pie crust off his mouth and says, "Man I was paid not to tell you"
Then the police pulls his gun out and yells, "Trespassin' man I've got the right to shoot you"
The midget says, "Mister, the man that pay me to this would kill me if I tell"
He points the gun in his face, the midget says "God I think I just shitted on myself"

Now at Sylvester's house, 'Twan got a patch on his shoulder playin' cards gettin' along
They're laughing and talking when Sylvester says, "Gwendolyn, baby, get the phone"
Then she walks away from the table picks it up and says, "Hello"
There's a lady on the other line, panicking, crying and talking all off the wall
Gwen says, "Wait, slow down, tell me, who am I talkin' to?"
"My name's Bridget and I found your number in my husband's pocket, I had to call you"
Two minutes later Gwendolyn's shakin' her head sayin', "Girl I understand"
Sylvester says, "Who is it, baby?" She hangs up and gives him the address
Now meanwhile back at the policeman's house, the midget is cryin' his ass off
While he lyin' through his teeth bout to get his little ass tore off
Then Bridget bust in the kitchen with a double barrel sayin', "James I can't let you do this"
Then he looks at her and says, "What? You'll shoot me for this fuckin' midget?"
She says, "I love him". The midget says, "No Bridget"
And then James points his gun says, "We all gonna die up in this kitchen"
Now Bridget and James are starin' each other down slowly backin' apart
Then the midget takes his inhaler out and says, "This is not good for my heart"
Then James says, "Bridget, don't make me do this, baby put the gun down"
That's when Sylvester and 'Twan bust up in the house and said, "You put the gun down!"
Woo, while 'Twan and Sylvester are sniffin' around
Tryna figure out what's that smell
As they turn and look at each other like, what the hell?
Now the midget begins to wake up cause he fainted from all the madness
See three guns pointed around the room he stand and says, "I have nothing to do with this"
Then I said, "Hold up you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?"
Then he says, "Man I get around. You might know my face from here or there"
Then James says, "Take a good look cause you might not ever see his face again"
'Twan says, "Man what the hell is that smell? Somebody done broke wind!"
And then Bridget starts cryin' while she's lookin' around
I said, "I'm sure we can work this out but first let's put the guns down"
Then Bridget cries, "James first." Then he said, "No you go!"
Then I say, "Just do it the same time" and they both look at me and said, "No!"
And then 'Twan says, "Man let me shoot 'em all" and I said, "We can't do that
And besides man you just got out of prison and I'll be damned if you're going back"
Then Bridget says, "I'll drop the gun if he promise not to hurt 'Big Man'
Then James says, "That's what you call him, that's his name, 'Big Man'?"
Then 'Twan says, "Man is that ya name?" He yells, "Yeah" We laugh, "Hot mess!"
Then I say, "Man, why they call you that?" and he says, "Because I'm blessed"
Then I start shakin' my head and put the gun down sayin', "This is too much for me!"
Said, "I can't take no more then heard it all this shit bout to drive me crazy"
And then I say, "Man I shouldn't never took my ass to the Paje's Club
Then 'Big Man' says, "Paje's, I been there, that's probably where you know me from"
Then James says, "Hey, hey Chuck and Rufus let's get back to the matter at hand"
Then Sylvester says, "Cool, but first there's just this one thing I've got to understand"
James says, "What?"
Then Sylvester says, "How do you know Chuck and Rufus?"
And the police says, "What you talkin' about man?"
"You said Chuck and Rufus!"
Then Bridget says, "Hun my stomach"
Then 'Twan says, "Who the hell is Chuck and Rufus?"
Pointed my gun and said, "Talk to me, James"
I said, "Rufus, Chuck?"
Then Bridget says, "I'm about to throw up"
James says, "My wife is sick"
'Twan says, "Man I don't believe that shit"
I said, "How did your wife get sick?"
He says, "She's three months pregnant!"
And then we all said, "OH SHIT!"
Then Bridget says, "Honey, there's something I have to tell ya"
Then James says, "No, baby, you don't have to say a word right now"
Then she says, "But James". Then he says, "Rest Bridget, while I get these fools up out my house"
Pointed the gun at us and yells, "Leave." Said, "My wife is sick"
Then 'Twan look at him and said, "Muthafucka you crazy! Watch where you point that shit!"
Then Bridget says, "James no!"
Sylvester gets a phone call: it's Gwendolyn askin' him, "Is everything ok?"
And he says, "HELL NAW!"
He hangs up, then 'Big Man' screams, "Look man, I'm just a stripper"
I say, "Stripper?" 'Twan say, "A midget?"
He said, "I strip at this club called Dixie's and that is where I met Bridget"
Bridget says, "James." He says, "Not now"
She says, "Hun please let me explain"
Then 'Twan whispers in my ear and says, "Sylvester let me do this nigga James"
'Big Man' overhears us and take his inhaler out again
I said, "I'm not killin' no cop"
James movin' closer to them with the gun
Bridget yellin', "STOP! STOP! STOP!"
And then she says, "I admit it, I did it, I paid him"
Then James cuts her off and says, "Baby you don't have to say nothing"
She says, "No, James I think you need to hear this
See I been covering for you a long time
Never said what was on my mind
I even followed you a few times
And when I saw you with her you act like I was blind"
James says, "Wait a minute Bridget
Just what are you tryin' to tell me?"
"Not only am I sleepin' with 'Big Man', but he's my baby's daddy!"
Woo! The midget faints again
While 'Twan and Sylvester is trippin'
The midget's the baby's daddy, woo!
Now let's jump back to Cathy's house, they're getting up off the floor
Then Rufus says, "Chuck are you ok?" Then Cathy closes the door
Then Chuck says, "Rufus what the hell just happened?"
Then Rufus said, "I tell ya
She just almost got us shot right here in this room"
Then Cathy says, "You got nerve, almost got you shot!
When you sneaking in and out of hotels with him ain't no tellin' what I got"
Then Chuck says, "What do you mean by that?"
Cathy looks at him and says, "Figure it out!"
He says, "Ooh Rufus she don't know me. I will cut this bitch right now"
"Whoa!" "Come and try it, muthafucka!" "Fuck you ho!" "I swear to God, just try it!"
"Let me at 'er!" "Come on bitch!" "Skank!" "Just try it muthafucka!" "Rufus let me go!"
"I swear to God, try it!" "COME ON!!" "Try it!" "Bitch come on!"
"CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!"
Rufus says...Rufus says, "Chuck we'll talk about it later"
Then Cathy says, "This shit is sad"
Then Rufus says, "Well it is what is
Cathy we might as well talk about it, and try to get some understanding"
She says, "Understand this shit? I doubt it"
They talkin' loud while the phone's ringin, ringin
Just steady ringin, ringin
But no one answers... just ignores it...
Rufus says, "I said, calm down...you both actin' like damn fools!
A wife and a pastor and a deacon, now how would that look in the news?"
Cathy says "A wife and pastor looks good on the news"
Then looks at Chuck and says "But a pastor and a deacon? Rufus you don't want me to answer you"
And then Chuck yells "Bitch, who do you think you are? I've got a right to love whoever I please"
Then Cathy says, "If you don't get your narrow ass out my house cause ho, this whoever belongs to me!"
And then Rufus says, "Nobody's going nowhere, until we figure this out, we're all just be right here"
And then Cathy and Chuck won't stop staring at each other
Cathy snares her nose up at him
Chuck rolls his eyes at her
Then a phone rings again (ringin, ringin, ringin)
But this time Cathy walks over and answers it
Says "Hello, Longs residence"
"Cathy, this is Gwendolyn can you talk?"
Cathy says, "I'm in the middle of something, not now"
Gwendolyn says, "Girl, this can't wait, please get somewhere quick to yourself right now"
Then Cathy says, "Hurry I'm listening, shoot"
Gwen says, "Okay, I'll make it quick
Girl, remember the policemen you introduce me to?"
She says, "Yeah, what about him?"
"Anyway girl shit was tight until this morning everything went wrong!"
Chuck looks at Rufus and says "what the hell?"
He says, "I don't know"
She says, "Dammit I'm on the phone"
She says, "Go ahead Gwen"
Gwen says, "Well it all started at this club that I was at last night"
"Mmm hmm"
"Girl, me and James sitting in back V.I.P. everything was so right"
"Mmm hmm, go on"
"Well me and James, sittin' there laughing and drinkin'
Next thing you know, here comes Sylvester up in there with some crusty wig wearing ass ho"
Cathy looks at the wig on the floor
She says, "Girl, what's the name of that club?"
Gwen says "Parje's" she flops down on the bed like 'what the fuck...'
Then Cathy says "Gwendolyn..."
Gwendolyn says, "Girl, I'm not finished"
Then she starts tellin' her bout the policeman's wife Bridget
Who was gettin' down with this midget
Then Cathy says, "Gwendolyn, girl, listen..."
But Gwendolyn's going on and on
She steady tryin' get her attention
But Gwen steady going on and on
Then Rufus screams, "Cathy, are we gonna finish this conversation, or what?"
And Cathy says, "Rufus, I'm on the phone"
Then Rufus says, ''Bitch, I don't give a fuck"
Then Cathy says, "Gwendolyn, shut up girl, damn, just listen to me!
You know that crusty wig wearin' ho you was talkin' about?"
Gwen says, "Uh huh"
Cathy says, "Well"
Gwen says, "Well, what?"
Cathy says, "Girl"
Gwen says, "Cathy"
Cathy says, "Gwen, I'm sorry girl, but that ho was me"
Come and take a walk with me
Through the streets of Chi-Town
Let's look back
And reminisce on all of the shit that went down

Pastor Rufus Longs comes home to find his wife been sleepin' around with Sylvester (Oh, shit)
Sylvester's cell phone rings; he comes outta the closet pointin' his Beretta (Oh, shit)
Then they go through this thing: arguing, fussing, then time goes by
And then Cathy finds out about Rufus' lover Chuck, the gay guy (Oh, shit)
And then Sylvester calls home, never knowing that a man would answer his phone (Oh, shit)

Then he got to his house; bust up in it
To find his wife, Gwendolyn
She was fuckin' around with this sausage-head-assed policeman
And then they got into a fight (Oh, shit)
Wrestlin' over a gun (Oh, shit)
And Gwen screamin' "Stop!!" Next thing you know
They shot her brother Twan (Oh, shit)
It was just a lick; he was barely hurt
Now here comes Rose, the nosy neighbor
She thinks she's the neighborhood Savior
And then things got real twisted (Oh, shit)
Police got home in his kitchen (Oh, shit)
To find his wife Bridget (Oh, shit)
Is pregnant by this midget
Well, so far, that's how the story goes
And now it's time to continue on
So get ready:
Here is chapter 13...

Sylvester and Twan get in a car; Sylvester says, "Man, first of all, straighten yo hat
Now, man, I'm about to go holla at somebody, and I'mma need you to watch my back."
Then Twan says, "Man, you ain't even gotta worry 'bout me, bra-lou, I'm straight."
Sylvester says, "Yeah, you straight, a'ight, witcha hot-headed ass, nigga, just like when you caught that case."
Twan says, "Aw, here we go, you bringin' that shit up. That wasn't shit but a misdemeanor."
Sylvester says, "Misdemeanor, my ass. You did three years."
Twan says, "Yeah, that was because of Roxanne and that bitch, Tina."

"Man...yo sister asked me about a Tina."
Twan says, "When I see her, I'mma kill her. What did Gwen ask you?"
"She asked me if I knew her; I said she sound familiar."
Sylvester says, "Hold up. Man, what you doin'?"
And then Twan says, "Man, what you mean?"
Then Sylvester says, "Man, is that a cigarette?"
Twan says, "Man, nah. This some weed."
Sylvester pulled (Whoo) over, sayin', "Aw, HELL naw."
"Nigga, what the--?"
"You forget where we are?"
Twan say, "One for the road."
Sylvester say, "You crazier than a fish with titties if you think I'mma let you smoke that shit up in my car. Now throw that shit out."
Twan looks at Sylvester like he ain't tryin' to hear that
Sylvester says, "Throw that shit out."
Twan looks around and say, "Shit," and throws it out
They pull off and Sylvester says, "Now this Roxanne and Tina, man, what's that all about?"
Now, while they talk about that, let's head on over to Rosie the nosy neighbor's house
She's peekin' out her window, sayin', "There's somethin' goin' on over there with Bernadine and Ted."
Then her husband turns over and says, "Woman, what's wrong with you? Bring yo old, nosy ass back to bed."
She says, "Now, Randolph, I don't like that tone you takin' with me."
He says, "Oh, shut up, woman; you always invokin', give them folk they privacy."
Rosie says, "I can look out my God-damned window whenever I want."
Randolph say, "Yeah? Well, what you lookin' at? What you lookin' at? Hmm?"

Now Rosie and Randolph are arguin', screamin' at each other loud as they can
Rosie says, "Randolph, ain't nobody studdin' you, so go on back to sleep with yo old, grumpy ass."
Then Randolph say, "Shut yo ass up, woman! Shit! Folk gotta get some sleep around here."
Then Rosie say, "Sleep? Shit! Mr. Can't-Get-It-Up, yo tired ass been sleep for the last five years!"
"Now, watch yo mouth, woman!"
"Go to Hell, Randolph! You don't tell me what to do!"
("Can't nobody tell you nothin'! Yeah? Yeah?")
"I'm a grown-ass woman; I can do whatever the hell I want to do."
"Well, do it, then."
"I'mma do it, then."
"Do it, then."
"I'mma do it, then."
"Go on, look."
"I'mma look."
"And I hope a pigeon fly by here and shit on yo face."
(Rosie gasps)
"Oh, Lord, forgive me for what I have said; this woman got..."
"If it do--if it do--then I'm gonna wipe the shit on you!"
Now meanwhile, between-while, back to Sylvester and Twan
They drivin' along when Twan says, "So, man, where we goin'?"
Sylvester says, "Man, don't worry about that; just be on the lookout, and Twan?
Yo hat."
"Oh, my bad."
"Gimme a light."
(The lighter is handed over)
"Now, when we pull up, you keep the car in drive and whatever you do, keep on watchin'."
"Man, like I said before, don't trip, bra-lau, go handle yo business."

"Now, I'm about to see if I can get this bitch to talk to me. We made a deal and she owes me some money."
"Man, I feel you, G, so call me if you need me."
"Man, everything should go smooth."
"Sylvester, don't make me have to come up in there and smack me a couple of--"
Time goes by (it's 30 minutes later)
Time goes by (45 minutes later)
Time goes by (and now one hour later...)

A car pulls up to a restaurant; the door opens as someone gets out
First thing you see is some heels and a dress black shades on scarf around her head and mouth
Who could it be, why are they here up the stairs there going
Through the door down the aisle like she's walking in slow motion
Checking out the place as she walks looking real cool
Peeping out through her glasses before she sits in the booth
She goes in her purse throws a cigarette out, put it in her mouth he lights it
Then she blows smoke, pause for a minutes and says "what the hell happened? "
"First of all woman keep your voice down I ain't try'na get loud up in here
Second of all how was I to know that'cha husband, was a fucking queer"
"Shh" (clears throat) The waitress walks by
She says "I'll be with y'all in a minute"
"Now we made a deal the plan was for me to come home with you, girl I did my part
So don't you go asking me what the hell happened when I didn't want to do this shit from the start"
And then she says "yeah right, you didn't want to do this shit but'cha ass got paid
And then she says "Sylvester" I said "hold up bitch are you crazy, don't be saying my name"
She said "whatever, how come you did tell me you was married to Gwen? "
"First of all between the fake wigs and fake names how the hell am I suppose to know that Gwen is yo friend, bitch I'm a-"
"Shh, here comes the waitress again"
"Sorry I kept y'all waiting, childish place is busy
It's always crowded about this time can I start y'all off with sumthing to drink? "
I said "I'll just have a coffee with two sugars light on the cream"
And she said "Vodka straight up, hell, shit I need a drink"
Then the waitress said "girl I heard that I'll be right back with your drinks"
And then she walks away, I look back at her and says "she look familiar too me"
And she says "what? " I say "nothing, it's just a thought
Anyway girl I thought the plan was for me to be in that house with'chu and get caught"
She says "It was" I said "what how? " She say "I changed my mind"
I blew smoke then I blew my cigar out said "I'm out this motherfucker cause you wasting my time"
She says "wait don't go" "well then god dammit, talk to me"
She says "you wouldn't understand"
"Try me" (Cathy sobs) "Cathy" "Yes? " "Try me"
She blows her nose and says "well it all started one night when I was sitting in the living room
And sounds like I can hear somebody in the bedroom moaning and groaning
And I knew it wasn't me, so my curiosity
Led me to believe that he was cheating on me"
"Well how come you just didn't ask him give him the benefit of the doubt? "
"Because a woman knows, a woman just knows what some shit is foul"
And then I said "calm down, here comes the waitress"
"Ooh like I said it's busy around this time, but thank y'all for being patient
Say can I get y'all anything else? " I said "no that'll be all"
Then Cathy says "Sylvester" he says "hold on", cause he's getting another phone call
It's Tawn saying "everything aight? " Then Sylvester says "we working it out"
Then Tawn says "well call me if you need me dawg you know I'm holding you down" and I said "no doubt"
I hang up then Cathy says "well anyway let me get back to telling you what went wrong
Where was I, oh yeah the day I heard him arguing on the phone"
Now the story goes on and on and she telling him everything that happened
While Tawn's outside in the car, radio on bopping his head just rapping
Sylvester said, "Girl are you saying he was having sex with another man on the phone? "
She says "yes" I say "I can't talk about this" she says "why? " say "cause this shit is getting uncomfortable"
Now back to Tawn he turns the radio down cause he gets a call
He says "yeah whattup? " and the voice says "Yo T I got that information on Tina" he says "talk to me dawg"
"Well the word out on the street is the bitch is stop whoring, doing hair out her momma's basement and got a job, hahaha
"Haha is right the day that bitch stop horring is the day they stop selling dops" (haha) "Ya feel me Joe? " (word)

"Nah, the job that she got suppose to be legit, I heard ya girl off on some ole waitress shit"
"Yeah, waitress where? " "Hold on I'm waiting on my people to hit me, Roxanne and aunty on the place"
"You shittin' me, where this place at? " He says "Hold up, I'm getting a phone call"

Now meanwhile Sylvester's asking Cathy "Well why you still love him? "
Then Cathy says "Cause when I saw Chuck I just couldn't lose him to him"
And then the waitress comes again but this time she brings the bill
I last her a fifty says keep the change she says "damn thanks, shit y'all keep it real"
Now meanwhile outside in the car, Tawn's getting impatient his homie comes back to the phone
Tawn says "do I look like En Vogue? " He says "why? " he says "nigga cause the way you got me holding on"
"I got'cha dawg, I got where the bitch work live information and all"
"Yeah nigga I'm listening" "well nigga first of all, you gotta keep me down cause I went through a lot of crazy shit to find her"
"Yeah whatever I got'chu"
"I'm dealing with some nigga in the jet free minders, round the corner is a place called Shay Shay's Diner
"Nigga you forget I just did 3 years, I need the exact address to where this place is"
"My bad you right kid, 9501 that's right off Halstead"
Pause it right there, now shoot back into the restaurant real quick

Sylvester looks up at the waitress and says "excuse me but it seems like I know ya"
And at the same time Tawn's in the car going "man this address sounds familiar"
Meanwhile in the restaurant the waitress blows her bubble and says "where you know me from? "
Tawn's homie gives him the name of the place again he looks up at the sign and says "what the fuck? "
Now meanwhile back in the restaurant Cathy's nudging me under the table going "Sylvester"
Then Sylvester looks at the name tag on the shirt and notices that shit says "TINA"
Then, the waitress starts backing up with this confused look on her face
While Tawn's outside on the phone telling his homie "man I'm right outside of the fucking place"
Then Sylvester says "hold up, I just wanna talk to you for a minute"
Then she starts screaming Roxanne's name real loud, this bitch comes running from the back with a skillet
Then Tina breaks her beer bottle on the table and says "nigga I will cut you with this glass"
Cathy walks by me going out the door saying "not try'na get loud in here my ass"
Tina starts wobbing around Sylvester real slow saying "we take Tae-bo classes"
Then Tawn runs up in the place and says "I will kill both of y'all knucklehead asses"

[Tawn:] "Well, well, well if it ain't Laverne and Shirley"
Tina says "hey Tawn" Tawn says "Pssh, bitch don't 'hey Tawn' me"
Sylvester says "Calm down T" he says "fuck that I just did 3 years for these hoes"
Roxanne says "who you calling a ho? " He says "you bitch"
She lost control and says "Muthafucker I kill yo ass"

[Overlapping]

[Sylvester:] "Stop! Wait a minute. Let's talk about it before some muthafucking body get hurt T"

[Twan:] What? With a skillet! Bitch I will... Mannn!

[Roxanne:] C'mon! Damn right! Jump nigga! You better tell em!

[Twan:] Fuck that!

[Sylvester:] "Wait a minute, nigga think about it" "3 years" "3 years this time will be worst... now come here"
Sylvester takes Tawn to the side
Tina tell Roxanne to calm down, then Sylvester says to Tawn
"Look now I know you mad but before you go around here making threats
Nigga let's not forget the fact that'cha out but you still on house arrest"
Then Tawn says "cool man I just wanna ask em some questions about what happened"
Sylvester said "I feel you but calm ya ass down or nigga you going back in"
Tawn says "I got'chu" "house arrest" "I got'chu I got'chu"
"T... chill" then Tawn walks over to them and says
"How you doing ladies, Tina, Roxanne, please excuse me"
I mean, where's my manners cause uh, that was very rude of me"
"Tawn" "Nah I admit the way I came up in here man it was kinda wild
But that ain't shit compared to the way things gone be ("Tawn! ") if these bitches don't tell me what went down"

[Roxanne:] Bastard!

[Sylvester:] T, Motherfucka slow ya roll calm down nigga stop this shit (c'mon)
"Sylvester fuck that all because of these bitches my ass got send up on a three-year bid" (c'mon muthafucka)
"What'chu goin do nigga kill these bitches? " "Yeah" "And then what, then what?
Life nigga... they'll lock yo ass up and throw away the key"
Then, Tawn starts thinking about it while Tina and Roxanne's watching him
And I say "man forget about it" he says "no" I say "well let me talk to them"
He say "they slick ass man you can't trust them"
"Nigga it ain't about me trusting them it's about you trusting me right now...
Nigga what's wrong with you are you crazy you forgot I did 5 years in the pen myself
Now I'm telling you I'm not going back for you, these bitches and no motherfuckin body else
So let me talk to em... I got this"
Sylvester takes out his gun and shows it to the ladies walks up to em and says "now ladies"
He takes the cigarette out of Roxanne's ear and says "ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies""
He walks over to the counter and sits down
He puts the gun on the counter, goes into his pocket and pull a cigarette lighter out
And then he lights the cigarette, blows smoke and then says
"Now ladies it's very obvious that we have a problem here
Alot of questions unanswered; let's answer em so we can get out of here
Hmm... safe that is"
He flicks ashes and says "ok, which one of y'all going start talking first? "
Then, Tina start crying saying "it was suppose to be a simple operation"
And Roxanne says "if we delivered muscle man here said it would be a vacation"
Tawn says "man I'll show you a vacation ("Tawn") send y'all ass straight to the motherfucking moon"
"Tawn, what did I tell you? Ladies, continue"
Then Roxanne said "on the way to Atlanta everything was going smooth
Up until, Tawn starts smoking trees and acting like a fool
And that's real, got the radio loud bumping Mary Jane just swerving and shit
"Did you tell him to stop? " "Yeah I told him to stop, but he just kept yelling out talkinbout 'I'm Rick James bitch'"
Sylvester looks at Tawn, Tawn says "man I was drunk"
Sylvester said "drunk... you was drunk"
Tawn said "man I don't know I was just try'na have a lil fun" "With a whole lotta heat in the trunk
Man I'm disguised, nigga know wonder why yo ass got busted"
Then Tawn says "man who side are you on anyways, theirs? "
Then Sylvester said "well let's see, reckless endangerment, loud music with drugs in the trunk, nigga yeah"
Tawn says "man this is some bullshit" Roxanne says "can I finish? "
"Please, " Sylvester says; she says "well to make a long story short"
Tina says "Roxanne, girl let me explain
See Tawn was kinda acting wildin' calling us all out of our names
Then Roxanne starts cursing and screaming, and meanwhile I'm in the backseat
Then all I know is I look behind me, I say 'oh shit, here comes the police'"
Roxanne said "next thing you know, Tawn started speeding yelling out 'they ain't goin stop us'"
Tina says "a few minutes later here come these squat cars and a fucking helicopter"
Sylvester said "did he stop then? " Tina says "no! "
Roxanne says "but luckily that raggity ass car he was driving stopped on us, or where would be who knows"
Then Roxanne says "anyway here we are the three fucking stooges laid down in the dirt
Now they putting us in the back of the car Tawn yelling out 'whatever y'all do don't say a fucking word'
And now we at the police station, they got us separated off up in these rooms
Yelling all in our ears saying 'ya man try'na set these drugs belong to you'
And I'm like 'what the fuck' they say 'sister yo light is looking kinda dim'
I looked up at Tina and said 'girl, I'm not going down, not for him'
So there you have it Tawn, I gave you up, it was me!
Tina she protected you" Tawn said "protected me for what? " Tina say "cause at the time I was pregnant by you T! "
"Hmm, I see"
Sylvester looks up at Tawn and says "Congratulations man it looks like you the one done have yourself a little T"
Tawn says "ah nah nah, eh, this girl is trippin' G"
Tina says "Trippin? " Roxanne says "chk-humph"
Tawn says "girl, with'cho lying ass, tell me how do you know-" "T" "That that baby belong to me"
Then I don't know where Tina's eyes start blinking real fast and she says to Tawn "how do I know Tawn? "
Sylvester say "are you ok? " "How do I know? "
Then Roxanne says "girl I told you his ass was goin deny this shit when he saw you, let's go"
Sylvester says "wait a minute" Tawn says "Bye" Sylvester says "Tawn" he hits "see ya"
They both paused turn around Tina looked at Tawn and says "—in court muthafucker wouldn't wanna be ya"
Sylvester says "Tawn, ladies please, wait a minute, don't go yet"
Tawn said "they need to learn some respect" I say "Tawn" he says "holla"
Roxanne says "nigga she goin holla at that child support check"
Sylvester saying "nobody going nowhere, now y'all resolve this so we can put this shit in the past"
Roxanne say "cool will talk to you but we ain't got shit to say to his ole Shrek looking ass"

[Tawn:] "Chill see man who this fever blisted looking bitch think she talking too? " "T? "
She says "you muthafucka" I say "damn baby calm down, " I say she says "what, what'chu goin do? "
Tina starts to blink her eye again but this time even faster than before
And she cries out real loud and says "I can't take this shit no more! "
Then Sylvester asks Roxanne "what's wrong with'cha girl's eye, it's like it keep it flinching"
She said "a year ago a pimp hit her in her eye and ever since then she got this nervous condition"
Then Tawn develops a soft spot and says "Sylvester, come here lemme holla"
Tawn pulls him to the side and says "man what do you think? " He says "what'chu mean? " he said "am I that baby's father? "
Then Sylvester says "I don't know it's hard to tell, especially when you was in the pen
But it's one thing I do believe and that is, is that the bitch didn't turn you in"
Then Tawn start walking around saying "man I don't know, a nigga feeling kinda strange"
Then Sylvester says "Gwen told me y'all that'chu was thinking about making a change
Roxanne yell out "I gotta lock this place up and y'all two got to go"
Sylvester say "what time do this place close? " She says "eight" He pulls his gun and says "well act like it's a quarter to four! "
Then he says "talk to the girl Tawn it might be what'chu need"
Tawn says "a family man me? Man I'm too deep in these streets"
Sylvester says "man that's exactly my point this shit will settle you down
You need to get up off of that bullshit and go holla at that girl right now"
Roxanne looking crazy I'm like "Go! " Tawn say "Sylvester man—" I'm like "Go! "
Then Roxanne moves closer to Tina, Tawn give me five and then says "fuck it cho! "
Then he steps to Tina and says "Tina, you wanna work this out? "
Then Roxanne tongue kisses Tina dead in her mouth and says to Tawn "I'm fucking her now! "

[Randolph:] “He got the package, Rosie! He got the package!”
“Secret sweet bridges, he done got the package!”

[Rosie:] “Lord have mercy, Randolph, what’s done got into you?”
“And who got the package and what is the package?”
“The package, Rosie! The big package”
“Aw hell, I ain’t got time to be playin’ with you”
(“Whaddya mean?”)
“These games and carryin’ on”
“If I wanted to play some games I’d go ahead and turn on the TV and watch me some Wheel of Fortune”
(“I wanna talk to ya, lemme tell ya!”)
“How the hell I’ma tell ya if you’re walkin’ away from me?”
“Hm? Hm? Hm”
“Well hell with it then, I ain’t gon’ tell ya nothin’”
“You must not wanna know”
“About the pastor”
“What about the pastor?”
“What? Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-what?”
“Did you hear that?”
“Did somebody round here say somethin’?”
“I thought I heard-“
“Now just quit playin’ and tell me what’s goin’ on”
“With the pastor”
“Well, now you wanna know”
“I tell ya this way better than peekin’ out them damn windows you be peekin’ out of”
“Ain’t no pigeon gon’ shit on you, you listenin’ to me?”
“Randolph!”
“Okay, okay”

“Ooh, saa-“
“I’ma slap you with this hot water bag if you don’t start talkin’ to me”
“Alright, alright, alright”
“I’ma talk to ya”
“And I’ma tell it all”

“I was at church in the pastor’s office, cleanin’ up, and next thing you know…”
“Mm, yes lord”
“Yes lord”
“Ye-“
“Ooh! Yes lord!”
“Wha-?”

[Rufus:] “I can’t talk to you about that right now, Sister Marie, I got a phone call”
“Shit, think, shit, think, shit, shit think Randolph”
“Mm”
“And that’s when I got my old ass in that closet”
“Now quit cussin’”
“Now just shut ya ass up and listen, Rosie”
“You say you wanna know”
“Then I got in that closet and it all started to happen”
“The pastor came in”
“He was on the phone talkin’ to a man”
“Now what’s wrong with bein’ on the phone talkin’ to a man?”
“Well it all depends on what you sayin’ to that man”
“Now to make a long story short, he said”

[Chuck:] “Rufus, I miss you”
“And I couldn’t believe my ears when he said”

[Rufus:] “Chuck, I miss you too”
“And then his wife comes in, starts pinchin’ the bitch”
“I normally don’t like bein’ in folk’ business, but Randolph this is some juicy shit”
“What else?”

“Anyway they arguin’ back and forth”
“Pastor Rufus start tryna convince this man to let him come see him”
“But obviously he said no”
“What else?
“Now calm down, damn it, wait a minute, let me think”
“Oh! Oh! He asked the pastor to stay in his life, but then the pastor said no”
“God must be workin’ on ‘em! Then what?”
“Pastor say ‘Chuck let’s meet at our spot, the Holiday Inn’”
“And then, that’s when”
“When what?”
“A-a-a-ah!”
“Took another shot of that gin!”
“Ooh, Randolph, this is gettin’ good”
“But what make you say ‘got the package’ though?”
“When Chuck let him know”
“Know what?”
“That he’s in the hospital!”
“He got the package”
“Didn’t I tell ya?”
“He got the package, Randolph, you was right!”
“Next time you listen to me when I’m tryna tell ya ass somethin’”’
“Oh my god, where’s my phone book?”
“Wh-what do you need a phone book before?” (“Lord have mercy”)
“Now don’t go tellin’ everyone around town, Rosie!” (“Hey, he got the package”)
“With you big mouth ass!”
“Shit”
“Should have never told her shit”
“Ooh, gin”
“Sleepy”
Sylvester goes home cause he had to change into more something comfortable like, another suit
Then he gets back in the car and Tawn looks at him and says "Man where's mine at? "
Sylvester says "where's your what? " Tawn says "My suit! "
Sylvester says "nigga what make you think you can fit a suit like this? " "Man I'm slim"
"Shit nigga you be looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger in my shit! Just stick to the jogging suits and Timbs
And leave the suits to me" "Cheah whatever you say bruh-in-law"
"Tawn listen... cause what we about to go I'm gonna need your full undivided attention"
"I'm listen" Sylvester starts reminding Tawn of his past and situations like this
When he lost his head, and then he looked at Tawn and says
"Now when we get there it'll be a whole lot of fine bitches in there, with drinks in they glass and they hands in the air
But don't get caught up just keep focusing on me
Then will go downstairs it'll be a hallway with a couple of pitbulls and armed security up the axe"

"Yeah I feel ya" "well make sure you do
Nah, they'll be a room will go in it it'll be about six or seven gentlemen there
Then they'll search and take my gun, say nothing just sit down in the chair"
"Man wouldn't it be better if I stand" "Nah because they don't like it when you stand
And Tawn, whatever you do don't stare"

[Joey:] "How ya doing Sylvester? " "What up Joey? " "Don't say my name, who's your new friend? "

[Tawn:] "I'm not a friend I'm his br... "

[Sylvester:] "Bruh-in-law, he's my bruh-in-law"

"Yeah whatever, okay so let's make it quick, what do we got here? "
"Thursday twelve-O-clock midnight a train comes in from Indiana"
"Pff, yeah so what about it? "
"Well here's the deal... "
While Sylvester's talking, Tawn sits outside and falls to sleep...

[Joey:] "Yeah well what kind of money are we talking here? " "Joey I'm telling you, you can own a whole pasta factory"

[Mob laughs:] "Gee boss imagine that, your own pa... (clears throat) sorry"

[Sylvester:] Now all you have to do is... "

[Joey:] "You shittin me? " "I'm telling you the shit is real, hold on" (phone rings as guns point at Sylvester)
"Jesus fellas, it's just a phone, I got a phone call, hold on"
It's Gwendolyn on the phone saying "Sylvester what's wrong you left out and didn't even eat"
While Tawn in the hallway mean muggin and sizing up the security
Sylvester says "Can't talk now put the food in the refrigerator; I'll get to it later"
Joey says "hurry it up" he hangs up and asks for a pen and paper
Now Tawn turns the chair around and sits down puts his hand up and says "asshole"
Security looks at Tawn like he goin shoot him Tawn yells out "arm wrestle"
Now security looks at Tawn like it sounds tempting but he has a tape
Sylvester's telling Joey if everything goes smooth this is what will make
And now Joey checking out the piece of paper, Sylvester checks his watch then looks up at his goons
Security outside laughing at Tawn cause it looks like he's about to lose
Then Joey looks at Sylvester and says "what is this a joke? "
He pulls a gun out and says "yes but I'm the only one laughing, nigga don't get your ass smoked"
Tawn's straining and looking at his watch cause he know his time is up
He breaks the table takes the gun and point it at the guards and says "what, what what! "
Sylvester says "guns on the floor" then Tawn says "guns on the floor"
Then Sylvester says "safe, open it up" Tawn say "shut them punk ass dogs up"
Sylvester says "get on the flo, Joey don't make me have to ask you again, open up the motherfucking safe! "
Joe says "forget about it" Tawn says "I'm bout to shoot me a motherfucker today! "
Joey goons start getting up off the floor
Sylvester says "Joey don't make me do this" and then the strangest thing happened
They start moving in on em, getting closer and closer and closer
They start moving in on em, they getting closer and closer and closer
They start moving in on em, they getting closer and closer and closer
They start moving in on em "I'm a SHOOT ME A MOTHERFUCKER TODAY! " "Tawn! "
"I'm a SHOOT ME A MOTHERFUCKER TODAY! " "Tawn! "

[Tawn panicking:] "Wha, wha"

[Sylvester:] "Wake yo ass up! "

[Verse]
I'm talking 'bout a revolution, I am Sly, kid ruthless
The booth's no spoofin', I spit it like I'm toothless
Food for the youth, while you niggas just fruit
And lies become truth, I drop shit like pollution
Stop fools quick, no problem, no solution
Your crew could sleep in the freezer and still wouldn't be cool kids
Cruisin' in the music with the attitude of toolkits
Hammerin' these babbling niggas, respect my two cents
I can give two shits, let alone a dollar
My flows make bros go whoa, hoes say holla
Wack niggas say nada, the best, I'm a synonym
Still my pocket slim like the Olsen twins and Em
Mr. Quick to Diss 'Em, is dismissing 'em quick in my sentences
Oliver Twist like Charles Dickens' death
Wishing competition, but listen the plot thickens
I'm a stand-up nigga, well hell, I'm not sittin'

[Outro]
Never, never fail like, feel me like braille, right?
Tiptop, zip-lock flow, bitches airtight
Yeah right, try and unzip it
Nigga poutin' 'cause he got his bitch stole by big lips

[Intro: ASAP Rocky]
Yo, ASAP here
We 'bout to kill a fucking game
You know who the fuck we are
You know my motherfucking name
I fucked your dame
And she bought me a chain
And a range
And a pinky ring, bling, bling
And all my niggas here, they about to kill this shit
What you say Nast?

[Verse 1: ASAP Nast]
Hold up dog, Nast in this bitch again
Sipping Hen, staring at that white girl from Michigan
She was with a friend, fat ass fly ho
I went in for the kill, ASAP, pronto
So wait boo, 'fore we hit your condo
Got another friend with me named Whitney from Chicago
Whitney love ta model? I'm thinkin' ménage
The truck parked out from, the Chevy get Ta-hoes
Haters all in my face, can't see, blindfold
? on my feet, blew right by folks
Stuntin' on sucker niggas is what I was designed for
Dead fresh, fresh to death, I should have designed clothes
But I'm blessing these tracks, sick flow, swine flu
Y'all ain't fucking with Nast, I been nice, y'all knew
Haha, nigga that shit times two
I'm who your bitches wanna kick it with, kung-fu
But what, dog? What is you saying?
Nast in this bitch, ho, why is you playing?
Like I won't slay this stage on some gang shit?
Turn into a mayhem, beat hard, flow hurtin
Cali swag bitch, snapback, no jerkin'
Fuck work, fuck money in hands, hoes know this
Fast forward, past focus, I'm that on it
One of the best to do, I think not, you bet on it
Giant ass you be lumberjack Paul Bunyon
Hoes love it, lover never put none above it
Wanna hug me tighter than jeans ass sportin'
Carry corpses to cemeteries, that's very often
Sport fortune, Matchboxes, that awesome

[Verse 2: SpaceGhostPurrp]
So what I say, motherfucker
Already know I never been a sucker
See I lust ya, I want ya
Baby come home, babygirl, what's your name, Wanda?
Do you wanna get up on me?

Do you wanna feel the stroke?
It's kind of like Facebook when you feel a poke
ASAP, no joke
Raider Klan, all back and we aiming at your throat

[Verse 3: ASAP Rocky]
I wanna rock but the bitches want me, though
D&G briefs fit a nigga like a Speedo
Skinny nudie jeans, though
Boots be 40 below
He flow, 100 degrees, the jewels zero
Rockstar rap, he reps Guitar Hero
Leopard Louboutins like Speedo on Steve-O
Charge me on the game, couldn't pause me on Tivo
Beyonce, the Kanye, I got a big ego
On to that next shit, you looking at the bestest
Married to the game, treat you niggas like my stepkids
Pull up in a Porsche, niggas get nausea
Didn't write the rules but my status like the author
Just crashed the range, so I pulled the Bent out
Probably getting brains, chilling in the penthouse
Swagging on you maggot and I'm about to lay my pimp down
Christian Louboutin red bottoms come in mens now
On to the next ones, skinny jeans fit in
Pull up to the shows and these hoes know to get in
Said they like my fitted clothes down to my split ends
Little do she know, I got a big ego
Automatic weapon need an order of protection
Killin Feelin all these records so my charges is molesting
An assault with deadly weapons, got these rappers feeling threatened
A hip-hop veteran, I'm a hip-hop felon

[Verse 4: ASAP Twelvy]
It's a war going on outside and we started it
Believe that or die, nigga, on some martyr shit
All my niggas on the scene like some Sparta shit
And we came to double up on that Harlem shit
We all eating, this is how it's supposed to go
Stop speaking, this is how you supposed to flow
The ins and out, never a winner's route
I never lose again, it's like every day I lose a friend
To some dumb shit, whore and dumb bitch
So a hating nigga, whore cuff wrists
I know a lot of niggas sitting in a cell now
For the shit I've done, I'm probably even hell-bound
But it's cool with me, jacking niggas' jewelry
I don't give a fuck about your foolery
Nigga keep a tool with me just to blast at you bitches
Marvelous at the top and our rags to the riches
ASAP, nigga

[Verse 5: ASAP Ferg]
On my Pokemon shit, you already know...
I said, I said, I said
I swear to God I want it all
He gon' give it to me back
And get on top above it all
Purple label sweats, I swear to god I'm rich
And once I get these many bitches, swear to God I'm in
I be on my fucking shit, toast to the Gods, tell me what God sipping now
Henny, and I'm out here and my dad was in bed
So I down a whole bottle on that bitch with the mink
I go haaaaaaaard
I'm sorry, Mama Ferg, for all of these curse words
But I'm so fucking serious
Shit I'm street, like a curb
And I'm tweaked, like a nerve
And I'm smart, like a nerd
Guess that's why my last name Ferg
Okay I'm glidin' like a fucking bird
Yeah my name is Ferg but I'm a fucking turd, ya heard?
Now I'm on some rider shit
You done got yourself in beef

Red line on some Prada shit
Now you want to know the deadline on some Project shit
Black bitch an actor, put em in some Tyler shit

This ain't no bullshit, I ain't letting no fools in
See my bitch ride that big thing, you on that little shit
Trying to make noise, you squeaking like a little pig
Put her into that dog, my attitude's a little Vick

[Verse 6: ASAP Rocky]
Next time my niggas fall back
ASAP Raider Klan and we all blacked out
Tell that bitch get it mapped out
And I fucked a bitch, now she flat out
Chest out, on the fucking floor, never hit it raw
Got a condom and I got a towel by the door
Just in case the smoke go into the hallways
Cause I be smoking weed and fucking all day
This is off the top of the dome, let me introduce my niggas before a nigga go home
We got Ty Beats, the illest producer in the streets
You know he come through with that motherfucking heat
Got Twelvy, motherfucking Twelvy, got a bad bitch, Jewish named Shelby
Got my nigga Nast in the back
Got a snapback to the back, he don't even know how to act
Got my nigga named Purrp, Spaceghostpurrp, do your bitch real dirt

And we living material, as long as the money straight they wanna see me fall

[Hook]
No matter which way I go, they tell me don't take that road
But I never put my foot on the brake oh no

But I never put my foot on the break oh no (It's the Planes and the Taylor Gang)
I never put my foot on the break oh no, ah no oh (Got your bitches slipping off their wedding rings)

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Livin' the life is just me
Some bitches my niggas in a crib full of vices
But I don't do drugs, just weed
Caution flags wave, and fuck it I still speed
And proceed to give them what they waiting for
Daytona 500 guess who lighting joints up in the pace car
Play hard, but I work way harder to afford
Boats, put your women on the water let 'em boogie board
Slightly older still, sexy broad, thank Demi Moore
Just strip for me without the tease, give me more
Still rockin' Golden Eye on the Nintendo 64
Sayin they don't make 'em like this anymore
Same goes for my whip, same goes for my kicks, rare
And I don't rush to the store, they save me a pair
Yeah, a nigga living in the air
Spending more time in the clouds then I spend on the ground
Do the opposite, fuck taking advice from these clowns
Thats why I mash the gas when they tell me slow down
Yeah!

[Hook]
No matter which way I go, they tell me don't take that road
But I never put my foot on the brake oh no

They found her there. Jada leaking, Tia screaming, she shaking, she drop
The pistol, he take it, he cock it back and he make it go -pow-

[Verse 1]
I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got that whole "in love" thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time, it didn't mean a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel

[Chorus]
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

[Verse 2]
Did it happen when we first kissed?
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me, baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give it to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel

[Chorus]
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

[Bridge]
How did I get here with you?
I'll never know
I never meant to let it get so personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted, I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry (Cry, cry, cry)

[Chorus]
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life (You'll never see me cry)
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart

[Outro]
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
All my life

[Verse 1]

My car ride by without the boomin' system
I'd rather spend that loot on my engine
Oh, hail to the chief, I been one hell of an Indian
But settling in tepees ain't sitting' well with me see
I need plenty green acres
And EZ Wider papers
Got the OG game in me Sega Bulls vs. Blazers
To the left I played her, but you treat her right
Sucker what I get in one night
You wait a couple months for
You love her, I cut up
She woke and I was gone, only weed crumbs on the cover
Yeah Spitta did her like that
Just like I said it in my raps
Respect it, don’t I keep it real?
Said I fuck you good and disappear, ain't that what I did?
Niggas talkin' down on The Planes better shut up
I'm fed up, waitin' on valet to pull my 'Vette up
You better get up
Tryna be cute bitch I'mma leave you
Her home girl she said "please" too
She no crazy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Drunk nights going through my phone
Tryna figure out which one I want to get at
You already home cookin' and grinding' my weed for me
I just left the club but I'll be there in a minute
Take the lock off the door
And that way you won't even have to listen for me
Oh yeah, and leave some light on in the kitchen darlin'
I mess with the baddest hoes
Gotta go overseas to buy their clothes
Trees she got 'em rolled
Don't gotta deal with jealousy cause she not involved
Ain't trippin' on her man cause she got her own, yeah
Independent as can be still I'm the one they're calling
Be there then I'm in the wind, no breakfast in the morning
Fill, I'm in and out like it's fast food
People get to know me say I'm more than just a rap dude
Pay the cost to be the boss - no tax due
Now my money feelin' like it's tattooed

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
A nigga so goddamn stressed out
I feel like fuck everything right now
See I've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life
But I'll be damned if I give 'em my handout
See my pride is one thing I will not put aside
I'm too proud to beg, I'm sorry Left Eye
If I don't make it in life, motherfucker I tried
What? Uh

[Hook 1: Kendrick Lamar]
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
It seems like, you can't win for losing
Whatever you're doing turns out to be "what-are-you-doing?"
Sick of pursuing, that your time will soon come
Nobody knows the position that you in
But it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
That feeling, hard to explain
When you just, just want to get away
Something like

[Hook 1: Kendrick Lamar]
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Away from it all
Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit
The smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision
I'm stuck on the studio couch now, thinking bout my daughter
Times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered
Just press record or, seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order
Instead of problem solving
From my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride
Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud
Shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread
As I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony
Nothingness surrounding me, living my life
Though it's better to write
Configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light
So how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real
A Schoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here

[Verse 1:]
You know I wanna stay but you know I gotta go (Girl I)
Really wanna sleep but you know I gotta leave (Girl I)
I'm scooping up my keys and I'm walking out the door (Girl I)
Hate it when you call my name cause you make me wanna change my mind

[Hook:]
You know I got a girl at home, home, home
Probably waiting by the phone, phone, phone
You know I gotta girl at home (All Alone)
And if I keep fucking round with you
She'll be gone

[Verse 2:]
I ain't trying to hurt your feelings (Naw)
But you just what it was before we started
And can't nobody ride like you do (No No nobody)
Don't nobody love me like she do
You look the other way when you see me in the street
I know it breaks your heart we ain't nothing but a secret
And that pussy so good you gotta a nigga straight cheating
Girl this ain't my bed and you know I can't sleep here

[Hook:]
You know I got a girl at home, home, home
Probably waiting by the phone, phone, phone
You know I gotta girl at home (All Alone)
And if I keep fucking round with you
She'll be gone

[Bridge:]
You know I gotta girl at home
And can't nobody take her place (No Baby)
And ain't nobody that loves me like she does
And I know I ain't been doing right
Even tho u got a fat ass and that thang so tight
I gotta a girl at home (ooooo)
And I know you gotta a nigga somewhere don't cha
And he probably somewhere mad tell him my bad I didn't mean to tap that ass (Well I did but)
You know what I saying (Why you looking at me like that stop)

[Hook:]
You know I got a girl at home, home, home
Probably waiting by the phone, phone, phone
You know I gotta girl at home (I need to take my ass on home)
And if I keep fucking round with you
She'll be gone
Bye, Bye, Bye, Bye

[Hook]
This concrete is too cold, to be walking on it
Or else walking on it with no shoes on
Don’t wanna struggle, oh no
Don’t want it to become a habit
I’ve been living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody

[Verse 1]
My momma need a crib, son needs some Jordans
This some bullshit, cause I can’t afford them
Pairs listening, and the band recording
Trying to dodge the pen, hoping I survive the morning
Shit is getting hot, man I’m talking scorching
Watching bodies drop, trying to make a fortune
Dancing with no top, trying to skip my fork and
Wanna own the block then you gotta put your work in
Because

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You got the biggest gun, I hope it’s for protection
How you never run, you just count your blessings
Beating down the drum, find me the connection
To get up off the slum, that’s my only investment
Throw you to the ground, book you for possession
Now it’s going down, now I teach them a lesson
Crooked as a clown, wishing I could arrest him
Guess they run the town, from the streets to the correction
So

[Hook]

[Bridge]

No way to dice that
Toss it against the wall
The way you like that
That’s what you’re doing dog
Gambling? What you like? Street gambling
Gambling? What you like? Street gambling
Gambling? What you like? Street gambling

[Hook]

[Hook]
We got 'em goin' down for the count
Lookin' at the ground

Haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go

[Verse 1: B.o.B.]
Yes sir it's the beast from Decatur
Cain't see enemies and the haters
Real sharp on my thing like a razor
Blade, come clean like a shape up
So guess I got a game of tape up
But e'rybody gonna feel the need to say sum'n
But can't speak up whenever you face 'em
Thats what I call microphone gangsters
Yea I got 'em okie-doke, yeah I'm raw you know my flow
Cause B.o.B. be actin hard like a Viagra overdose
Talkin that noise on all them songs
A buncha lil' boys but you all look grown
Those niggas there and these niggas here
It really don't matter cause they all just clones
Go to school, read a book, be a lawyer
Hell yeah man I'm all for the cause
Ain't tryin to get involved with the law sir
But a nigga will get caught with the Mausberg
And that just ain't a threat on the song
Don't get it wrong cause this track is my own
Cause niggas that slip they don't last long

[Hook]
We got 'em goin' down for the count
Lookin' at the ground
That's why we got haters, that's why we got haters
Haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go

Look up in the sky, it’s a bird, it’s a plane?
No, it’s just

While you count your list 

[?]
Haters never smile, they always talkin’ down
The more you start comin’ up the more they come around
I’mma, I’mma player, you’re a fucking hater
So just a 

[?] and tell it to me later
All that hate have you spilled it like some sour milk
Seen you up on FedEx and never ever ship
Haters tryna sack a player like a quarterback
If you wanna keep the bottom 

[?]
Been a player way back before the 

[?]
It’s all 

[?] money, haters keep the change
B.o.B and Rich Boy, we on that Grey Street
I got that hater tints, but a Ph.IV

[Verse 2: Wes Fif]
Hey - what the heck, breathe homie, me I'm doin what I always do
Grindin if you wasn't steady hatin you'd be ballin too
I know you see us fallin through, all the rich niggas is on my crew
Fuck it, they can't touch us, if stuck up is what you call it cool
Ooh~! You shoulda seen when I came down in that
Black on black, custom gator, haters face down on the mat
Splat! Yeah I can make a green nigga mad
Quick, fast, flash like ten cash on his bitch ass
You can tell I'm a G by the walk and the stance
How I play the game make 'em talk in the stands
Watch how you talk when you talk to the man
If it ain't about bread you can talk to the hand
I, I, show you how to get rich
You got a weak arm I'll show you how to pitch
Made it so play I'll show you how to hit
And tell the police I don't know about shit
Ay guy, I'm fly, something like the air
Ain't that somethin when it's stuntin man there's nothing like air
Homey hold it right there, homeboy hold it down
Spent five at the mall and had the haters goin down

[Hook]
We got 'em goin' down for the count
Lookin' at the ground
That's why we got haters, that's why we got haters
Haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go
Haters everywhere we go, where we go
Haters goin' down for the count (one)
Lookin' at the ground (two)
I think you're a hater, I think you're a hater
Haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go
Haters everywhere we go, where we go
Haters goin' down for the count

Tower over niggas, the way I see it from my fucking stance, niggas never had a chance believe they never had a chance. WolfGang got these lame niggas by a landslide, and they can have the shine, ima make my money stack right. Dropping in deposits man my bank is like a (indistinct), thats probably why these model hoes finally starting to act right. My act right cleans a house, even out flying over seas take the scenic route. The shit I really do is the shit that they dream about. I like to keep them hating, I know they see me now

She was a Friday night star
Everyone knew her name but the fame didn’t take her far
And she was in awe
Trying to imitate the lifestyle that she saw
And there was no cars
Living illusions
Dream illusive chasing cars
A tongue so harsh
She could persuade a million soldiers into the dark

[Hook]
So just wait up a minute lady
Pop them breaks for a minute you’re so mistaken
I say you look awfully shady
Or maybe you’re just contemplating a Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star
A Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star
Jessica, I’m thinking I could probably take her home and marry her
But everything I keep on hearing makes me scared of her
And now I know I probably should have never messed with her
But she got me grabbing my coat and keys and I did I did
I get on the express way and speed to her crib, her crib
I just loose control everytime I see all those hips and lips
And it feels just like an evil deed
But I slip, I slip

[Hook]
So just wait up a minute lady
Pop them breaks for a minute you’re so mistaken
I say you look awfully shady
Or maybe you’re just contemplating a Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star
A Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star

Yeah,yeah
She’s dressed for the Friday night lights
With her boots zipped up, her jeans tight
Wondering, tryna find the right type
But there’s dogs round here and they might bite
I sit back, then stare in amazement
As these girls go awfully crazy
They don’t know me
But they know that they play my song on the radio station
And I climb on top of the stage
Wait for the beat when it drop, then I sing
Everybody get poured up, then drink
Then by the end of the night they faint
After the pause, I fade to the dark
Everybody please give a round of applause
I leave to the car, she waits for me patiently by the bar

[Hook]
So just wait up a minute lady
Pop them breaks for a minute you’re so mistaken
I say you look awfully shady
Or maybe you’re just contemplating a Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star
A Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star

So just wait up a minute lady
Pop them breaks for a minute you’re so mistaken
I say you look awfully shady
Or maybe you’re just contemplating a Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star
A Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star

[Intro]
Ya'll ready know
When I walk the fuck back
You can't act like
That ain't the flyest thing you've ever seen in your whole entire motherfucking sorry ass life

[Hook]
Can't say I'm not the freshest nigga that you've ever seen
I keep a couple grand - nothin less in my jeans
That's prolly why your bitch keep ringin' phone
And when I pull up she can't leave me alone
Lil homie I grind - No sleep
I'm good in the hood errybody know me
I got my trunk on blast
Hit me when I roll through
Stunt'n like a young nigga supposed to

[Verse 1]
Stunt'n like I'm supposed to
Riding with my hat cocked
Smokin' something good - 3 blunts and I'm smacked out
City on smash, game on padlock
26 inch rims, chrome on a matchbox
6 bad hoes man I can't choose 1
3 cell phones I just can't use 1
You see how often I spit
You just off bread hun
This the shit they can’t do young
Talk fly if you look ‘em in the air
Too young, you wonder were I got these Gucci parachute from
A lot of ya’ll mad
To me it’s just funny
I see why ya’ll hatin man the hoes just love me
And you know I’m gettin’ shhh
Fuck it I ain’t gotta say it
The tab taken care of nigga I ain’t gotta pay it
Yea, I’m all day with it, year round
I bet if you was here now

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Got a fat knot, blunt rolled up
Me I ride clean
Neck froze up
Bad bitch on the side
My niggas all rich
Foreign whips what they drive
Yea, I smell like Gucci and big money too
See them guys with me? they gettin’ money too
Ride 22′s and got heat so
If a nigga try me you a big prob you runnin’ into
I smoke a lot need blunt or 2
At a time whole pounds I be runnin’ through
Yea, I got a dime bitch coming through
Cause I pimp like I’m supoosed to
Wonder how I get it like this, I could show you
Butter soft leather in the whip when I roll through
This year I’m a get shit cleared
Take a look at this kid here

Baby shake it up
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, Ooohhh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, Ooohhh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, Ooohhh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, Ooohhh

[Verse 1]
The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
The city fathers they’re trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere’s horse
But the town has no need to be nervous
The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce

[Chorus]
Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I am in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

[Verse 2]
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, “I’ve just been made”
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
And says, “My advice is to not let the boys in”
Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
“Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it’s not poison”

[Chorus]
Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I’m in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

[Verse 3]
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero, the commander-in-chief
Saying, “Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?”
The commander-in-chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry"
And dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Saying, "The sun’s not yellow, it’s chicken"

[Chorus]
Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I am in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

[Verse 4]
The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle
Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

[Chorus]
Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I’m in trouble
With the tombstone blues

[Verse 5]
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Causes Galileo’s math book to get thrown
At Delilah who's sitting worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter
Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

[Chorus]
Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I am in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

[Verse 6]
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college
Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

[Chorus]
Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I am in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

[Intro]
Before you go
I wanna talk to you

[Verse 1]
Thinking about the time we share
And how I wasn't there
It hurts me
These people overwork me
Then I heard maybe soon you'll leave
Excuse me lord if you have tricks up your sleeve
I'm not ready to be bereaved
I know I'm always asking for something
Or another
But this time, it's just time
Cause I love her
But baby if he don't change his mind
Or fate or time
Yo I want to leave you with this line

[Hook]
It goes while you're here
I want to tell you something
It's that I love you girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Yesterday I tied two rocks together
That symbolize our lives
And threw them in the ocean
Now they're on the ocean floor coastin'
'Til they stop rollin' so far
That no sonar would list them
To the point that no one would even believe that we existed
I know that may sound twisted
But my neglect is killin' me
I feel so guilty
Please have faith if you feel me

[Hook]
It goes while you're here
I want to tell you something
It's that I love you girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah
It goes while you're here
I want to tell you something
It's that I love you girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Though you're probably feelin' blue
And you'll do what you must do
I hope you know
I'd hand the skies to you
I'm so embarrassed for mankind
They have the nerve to let their weapon shine
They're so stupid
Do they not know you're about to fly high
Away
With the wings that God will give you someday
I'm not jealous
I just can't take it
S.O.S. to your ears
The only thing I ever feared was this day
And having to say

[Hook]
It goes while you're here
I want to tell you something
It's that I love you girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah
It goes while you're here
I want to tell you something
It's that I love you girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah
It goes while you're here
I want to tell you something
It's that I love you girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah
It goes while you're here
I want to tell you something
It's that I love you girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah
It goes while you're here
I want to tell you something
It's that I love you girl

[Nicki Minaj]

This is for the blings and niggas in the porches
This one's for Malcolm, this one's for Martin
Wish I coulda thanks them, look what they started
This is cuz I'm tired of losin' (Tired of losing)
Even though my music is crack, guess I'm tired of using
It's like I'm tired of rappin it, I ain't even ratchet I'm tired
And I'm askin am I, ready for the rapture?
See, I'm just a little girl, caught in a mixed up world
Shoutout my girls, that be callin me sista girl
A moment of silence, for all of this violence
For all of my men's that's locked in the pens, and trapped in the silence

[Angel De Mar]
I aee you, I see you, I see you, I see you, I seee youu
I see you, I see you, I see you, I see you, I seeee youuu

Keep trying
Kee-eep tryy-yinnn'
High on? What'd you say, trick? What am I on?
Two tubes of airplane glue and a can of Krylon
Eatin' a crayon, settin' fire to rayon
Flamin' the nylons of two white lesbians screamin', "Die, blondes"
Strike matches on white patches of dry lawns
And I run and jump right in front of the fire hydrants
Five blunts, and you expect me to die once
With nine lives, fuckin' chickens in front of my blind wives?
Suicidal, my friends tell me to try knives
You wanna mess with a mothafucka who skydives
Out of a plane to give the Statue of Liberty high fives?
Doin' drive-bys and miss you with five tries
It's Slim Shady and BET and Big Tigger, all y'all who see me flee

[Intro]
La la la la
Listen
La la la
Hey

[Verse 1]
Didn't you know I can help or hurt you
So there's no reason to lie
I bet you let those other niggas jerk you
Convince you that they are fly
I never said I was an angel
Said but I ain't like those other guys
Listen
You're convinced that our experience rearranged you
Well maybe you should re-examine how you tried
Or...

[Hook]
Am I high
Hey am I high, yeah or no
Am I high
Ooh high, yeah or no

[Verse 2]
I think I've loved you since our high school
But you only wanted friends of mine
So when they replied
Her she's cool
Only then you gave our friendship time
You won't say it but you think I'm changing
Is it because the whole world calls me drugs
Didn't I say I can help or hurt you
You should be paranoid without me
And with me feel a buzz
Is that cocky?
Or...

[Hook]
Am I high
Hey am I high, yeah or no
Am I high
Ooh high, yeah or no

[Verse 3: Malice]
It's the kinda high that got me leaning
120 speeding in the rain
Meaning of a hydroplane
Play both sides of the field
See I know 'caine
Keep 'em high like Kurt Cobain
Listen
I'm known for speaking my mind
Known for fleeing from the scene of a crime
Eyes redder than the beam of my nine
Eyes redder than the scene of that crime
All for the love of the lime
I'm so high

[Verse 4]
Insinuating you're not that way
I see how you look and use your eyes
But when I ask you can I jump in
Then you start again with the lies
But if I dare you you'd blow a kiss to another
Though my friends have no idea who you could be
Don't worry I would never tell another
But I ate your pussy as you laid there beside her yes she was asleep

[Hook]
Am I high
Hey am I high, yeah or no
Am I high
Ooh high, yeah or no

[Outro]
Why am I sitting here
Peering the sky
Is there something inside of me, or am I high?
From when we talk on the phone, 'til when we fuck
This sounds like deep lust to me
But I get high on your love
Am I high?

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I make niggas eat dirt and fart dust
Then give you a eighty dollar gift certificate to Pussies "Я" Us
I eat the whole pie and leave nothing but the crust
So you can feel what it's like with instinct, but no guts
A sack with no nuts or a mack with no sluts
Give me a full-body massage, I still can't be touched
They call me Seymour Butz, 'cause I get more ass than most
They say I'm Next and got that Butta Love, and get Too Close
Follow the leader 'cause I'm meaner than abdullah oblongata
My Tribe's on more Quests than Midnight Marauders
It's all piña coladas, no cops and robbers
Taking trips back and forth from here to the Bahamas
I hump more than llamas, get rolled more than tires
If you say I'm not nice, then you's a motherfucking liar!
Entitled to your opinion, into the next millennium
So many Major Coinz that I thought I had Amil-ion

[Verse 2: 4-IZE]
Yo, I am going to blow up the Earth
With my Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator
Buddha be praised, you meditator
Drop Squad interrogator, 85 percent regulator
The Educator and the Almighty Creator, dedicator
The separator of fiction, I spark friction
Smoking "Hay" without the Crucial Confliction
4-Ize prescription, microphone, Jackie Stallone
Psychic prediction, Egyptian description
Of my physical, my flesh is weak and it's pitiful
Spiritual is hooked up to the invisible
Umbilical cord of my Lord, Kumbiya Devine Kah
Remove paper of tar from every cigar
I slap authority like Gabor, Zsa Zsa
Half Allah, Half Antichrist Superstar
Rocking the microphone with a hand like Dr. Claw
While I'm hitting trees harder than Sonny Bono
Double Dragon, mixed up with an Abobo
I kill villains in slow-mo for talking crazy in my dojo
Got nothing to lose, like I'm a boxcar hobo
When I get Ludacris with Bridges on the promo
Niggas wanna clown, I'm Homey and Bozo
'Cause in the Grand Prize Game, my Life Calling like Jo Jo
The name sticks like pogo
I keep it realer than alien autopsy photo
You similar to a Spice Girl going solo
You lost like BeBe, or a dog named Toto
My statue of liberty is Rebecca Lobo
We Cop Robo, Virgo
Bust ass like a motherfucking homo, como estas?
Tony Del Negro, built to destroy these kids' blocks of Legos
L'eggo my Eggo 'cause I say so
Hold the microphone, 4-Ize, I stay gifted
Manifested, elevated, I uplifted
The elevator, the escalator, "That's not a knife?
That's a knife!" Crocodile Dundee, the alligator rustler
'Cause I hustle ya, under the China
Big Trouble, little sewer, but still I find ya
'Cause I'm stinky, manifest, throw you down the stairs like a slinky
Yo, my third eye is blinky

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm the shit
Bitch I'm the shit
Bitch I'm the shit
I ain't worried bout shit
Bitch I'm the shit
Bitch I'm the shit
I'm on my own shit
You don't see my outfit, bitch I'm
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
Bitch I'm the shit, see me
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
Bitch I'm the shit

[Verse 1]
Bitches all in my car
They wanna roll with a star
Got all these niggas mad, pop the trunk, blast ya face off
Nigga you ain't met T-Raw
Hit the bass so hard
Got bitches takin it off, I can't fuck if she too tall
Gotta bitch that play ball
Foul the pussy, I charge
Make that ass applaud, I don't cuff her like the law
I fly bitch to Milan
She don't know what I'm on
I play the game so crazy, she thinkin' ain't shit saw
Wheel 'em in, wheel 'em in
Like Vanna White, Wheel of Fortune
While you all up up in her face, man she thinkin' that shit torture
Win again, win again
Cause nigga I stay scorchin'
I'm the man man on fire, kill your style like abortion

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm the shit
Bitch I'm the shit
Bitch I'm the shit
I ain't worried bout shit
Bitch I'm the shit
Bitch I'm the shit
I'm on my own shit
You don't see my outfit, bitch I'm
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
Bitch I'm the shit, see me
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
Bitch I'm the shit

[Verse 2]
Man these hoes problems
So I fuck 'em, never call'em
But I love love black woman, and they love what's in my wallet
Got gold on and it's frozen
See that Last King, move over
Talking loud like my motor
You want some scary shit like October
Take a seat, have a soda
While you starin' over your shoulder
You good man, we don't want you
And you faker than Willy Wonka
Real shit, I told you
New styles, I showed you
Got green like it's a locust
Why you on my bumper, I'm focused
Wheel 'em in, wheel 'em in
Like Vanna White, Wheel of Fortune
While you all up up in her face, man she thinkin' that shit torture
Win again, win again
Cause nigga I stay scorchin'
I'm the man man on fire, kill your style like abortion

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm the shit
Bitch I'm the shit
Bitch I'm the shit
I ain't worried bout shit
Bitch I'm the shit
Bitch I'm the shit
I'm on my own shit
You don't see my outfit, bitch I'm
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
Bitch I'm the shit, see me
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
Bitch I'm the shit

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Let you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one hit will burn your chest, though

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Cut those cameras on cause my camos on
And my niggas back and we riding 'round town
With a big ol' bag of weed, Taylor Gang, we ain't in yo faculty
Me and Snoop Dogg done created a masterpiece
Smoke all day and I'm making this cash
And we 'bout it 'bout it like Master P
Go hard, stacking cheese, roll a joint, pass the trees
T-G-O-D, he's the O-G, real G shit what it has to be
My real niggas gon' pop tags for me
Fake niggas won't get bags from me
Say you just wanna shake hands with me?
Same fuck niggas used to laugh at me
Now I'm riding 'round town in a car that you can't even pronounce
And you can't go fast as me
Smoking marijuana and she know that I'm a player
So she wanna come up here and spend that cash with me
That pimp shit come naturally
That fuck shit is whack to me
My kush grown organically
My balling is actually

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Let you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one hit will burn your chest, though, fa sho
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Let me turn you on and turn you out
To make you feel like you really wanna feel
For real, sho will, nigga I got that kill
You know what I got:
Captain Crunch, soda pop
Light green kush cut from a bush
Mix it together, get it together
Hypo grow with the hydro flow
Smoking on some shit called I don't know
This is that shit that was caught
From my niggas on the block with a .44 Glock - oh no!
Cuttin it up, button it up
Homie don't speak at all
You might 'scape, you might be most likely like shark bait
I might hate, nigga you smoking that lightweight
Wrong class, featherweight, levitate
Set it straight: let me break it down for you
Flip it, zip it, let it fly
If it's good, it's gonna get you high
Drop it, stop it, that ain't the one
We don't even smoke that shit for fun!

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Let you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one hit will burn your chest, though, fa sho
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Yea nigga, I'm rolling up that high-grade
Chilling on the porch, smoking like it's Friday
Every day of the week to Juicy J's a high day
Niggas think I'm Chinese cause my eyes straight
I pour up a 6 into a 20 ounce
Smoked a half ounce of kush, felt like 20 ounces
Fucked around and popped a molly now I'm high as fuck
Every chick I'm seeing Juicy screamin out: 'let's fuck!"
I done popped a pill and hit the lean behind it
Where my mind? Somebody help me find it
Got a black and white bitch, they my mixed bitches
They keep my double cup full, OG in my Swisher

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Let you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one hit will burn your chest, though, fa sho
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on

[Verse 1]
So, what's a young man to do
Had a million in the bank when I turned 22, Alright
Am I the same me?
Doing impressions of myself so people say it hasn't changed me
If only that were true now
But ain't an artist in the game that can do what I do out
I ain't your little secret no more
But listen real close, and I give you one more

[Bridge]
See all of these American dreams, that I find myself living out
Mixed with all of these man-made women that I find myself digging out
They tell me all day long to get a bodyguard to help myself get around
But I ain't ever been afraid of other people getting inside
I'm more afraid of what I got on the inside, getting out

[Chorus]
And what was left. A perfect mess
And if we forget. A perfect mess
And what was left. A perfect mess
That we forget

[Verse 2]
Been a while since '09'member when I told you it was a matter of time
That you believed me
Did it take this long
I told Sean if I ever got on that I'd
Never ever buy a chain with ice
And I didn't
Before this all changed my life
From dreams in the dorm room
To doing big things
In the boardroom

[Bridge]
See all of these non-American bottles that I find myself sipping on
Mixed with all of the things I'mma have to relearn how to one day live without
Mixed with all of the things inside my head that I can't figure out
But I ain't ever been afraid of people seeing inside
I'm more afraid of what I got on the inside, getting out

[Chorus]
And what was left. A perfect mess
And if we forget. A perfect mess
And what was left. A perfect mess
That we forget

[Spoken Intro]
This next song, honestly, is not funny at all, but, uh, it helps me sleep at night

[Chorus]
Art is dead
Art is dead
Art is dead
Art is dead

[Verse 1]
Entertainers like to seem complicated
But we're not complicated
I can explain it pretty easily
Have you ever been to a birthday party for children?
And one of the children won't stop screaming?
'Cause he's just a little attention-attractor
When he grows up to be a comic or actor
He'll be rewarded for never maturing
For never understanding or learning
That every day can't be about him
"There's other people, you selfish asshole!"
I must be psychotic, I must be demented
To think that I'm worthy of all this attention
Of all of this money you worked really hard for
I slept in late while you worked at the drug store
My drug's attention, I am an addict
But I get paid to indulge in my habit
It's all an illusion, I'm wearing makeup
I'm wearing makeup, makeup, makeup

[Chorus]
Art is dead
So, people think you're funny
How do we get those people's money?
I said, art is dead
We're rolling in dough while Carlin rolls in his grave
His grave
His grave

[Verse 2]
The show has got a budget
The show has got a budget
And all the poor people way more deserving
Of the money won't budge it
'Cause I wanted my name in lights
When I could have fed a family of four
For forty fucking fortnights
Forty fucking fortnights

[Refrain]
I am an artist; please, God, forgive me
I am an artist; please, don't revere me
I am an artist; please, don't respect me
I am an artist; feel free to correct me
A self-centered artist, self-obsessed artist
I am an artist, I am an artist
But I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid, kid
And maybe I'll grow out of it

[Verse 1]
Mic check, one, two, on the way to third
Flow sick, put a straitjacket on my words
So sick, they think that something's in the herb
They think I'm gone, but I'm fine, like a woman’s curves
My personality is far from your reality
I'm closer to your girl, now come on, ho, don't embarrass me
There is no comparison, this right here be kerosene
Carousel, parasail, I'm higher than everything
What I spit? You can't drink it, like you're 17
I can show a million pair of eyes what they’ve never seen
And I can do this in whatever the weather brings
Picasso couldn’t paint a better scene
Colossal, now give me the mic and I rock like a fuckin fossil
I'm mad at the track and I beat it like Hector Camacho
What's poppin? What it do? What's happenin'? What's crackin'?
Que pasa? The hospital, mi casa su casa
Bad, I'm rad
And these niggas just squares like plaid
And if they’re cool, then I'm cold
I gets money all day like the toll, bitch

[Hook]
I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw
I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw
I got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'
I got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'
I'm 'bout to murder this shit
I'm 'bout to murder this shit

[Verse 2]
I'm a BET soldier, an MTV gangsta
I will be on VH1 when I'm done being famous
Explain shit, I have made my way
And you are just a stain, bitch, you will fade away
And I only leave my house to paper-chase
Yep, off to the jungle, where I feel safe
Like a home run in the bottom of the 9th inning
And I'm fresh like I'm by Mennen
I'm on the clock like 5 minutes
Tryin' to get passed the line of scrimmage
Yeah, and before I leave her thighs bendin'
She give me face first, like she done dived in it, haha
And if she tall, I can climb in it
I usually don't have a time limit
And eatin pussy ain't a crime, is it? If so
I should start working on my jail visits, you know
I'm in the game, they just sell tickets
Man, I got old bread, like stale biscuits
You feeling froggy, all you gotta do is yell 'Ribbit'
Turn ya ass to a statue, like an exhibit
Now let's get it!
Let me at 'em, leave my cage open
With no pyro, I leave the stage smokin'
Yes, it's Weezy F, bitch
The best thing since breath, bitch! Suffocate!

[Hook]
I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw
I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw
I got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'
I got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'
I'm 'bout to murder this shit
I'm 'bout to murder this shit, yessir!

[Verse 3]
It go; Uptown, Uptown, Operation Shutdown
Wake up to polices, go to sleep to the gun sounds
And you're not a gorilla, you're a dead monkey
'Cause I got a banana clip in these Red Monkeys
What you said? Don't be afraid to say it twice
And they say life is cheap until you pay the price
It's just like shaking dice, better hope you roll a winner
And if you are a rat, you're just a cobra's dinner
Y'all ain't fuckin with me, you niggas under a G
Like the light part of my feet
And so what them niggas left me?
When it get cold, I turns into Wayne Gretzky
I do's it like it never been done
So you can suck my dick with a elephant's tongue
Bitch, it's Weezy Baby
Motherfucker, I spit rabies

[Hook]
I'm raw, I'm raw
I'm raw, I'm raw
I'm raw, I'm raw
I'm raw, I'm raw
I got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'
I got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'
I'm 'bout to murder this shit
I'm 'bout to murder this shit

[Outro]
I murdered that shit
I murdered that shit
Rest In Peace to this song
See you at the crossroads
That's all I have to say, goodbye
'Til yesterday

[Intro]
Reporting live, Compton California
The good kid

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of doing it the same way
Gotta Flip it before I ruin it
Make it all make sense
Before you put your 2 in it
Opinions get thrown out the window
With Ron Browz so turn me up loud
So the world can hear
And when your favorite rapper
Be rapping you should cover your ears
And go deaf, go deaf I said
Go death and stay dead
A shot to the forehead'll kill em
But I ain't here for no ignorance
I’m militant, as Martin Luther King
In the penitent, aiming for my dreams
Till a bullet bounce off
One of my deep thoughts
And hit a nigga in the spleen
I got it in my genes
You probably think I'm talking bout a pistol
But I'm talking bout the blood of a warrior
My nigga what you worry for?
I ain't trying to jock your swag
I'm trying to better my craft and stay relevant

[Hook]
Yeah, as time flies
Hope that I'm soaring
Far from the boring
I'ma
Tell you why
It's important
I'm not the boring, (I'ma)
If I think and act like you do
The world would die
From not seeing something new
And if I don't speak on how I feel
The world would lose out on
What's really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music will take my place
The World
The Relevant

[Verse 2]
Id rather you call me that
Then a typical artist you call wack
On a Youtube blog holding AR's and stacks
Of one's but never could be the one
To rally communities or
Lead a crowd of blacks
Passion is to strong
Im pissed off
So there's a chance you get pissed on
R Kelly was in the wrong
But that dont make you an exempt
That dont make you a no go from hittin the fence
You ain't a blood and
Damn sure you ain't a crip
The crowd yell OH!
But I ain't a pimp
Im me, Im free as a 5 finger discount
See you on the flipside
Right after I dismount, if I
Ever feel like I ain't pushin myself
Ill find a cliff then push myself
Off the edge like a barber
At the tip of your head
Thats how I settle it
Life or death if I ain't relevant

[Hook]
Yeah, as time flies
Hope that I'm soaring
Far from the boring
I'ma
Tell you why
It's important
I'm not the boring, (I'ma)
If I think and act like you do
The world would die
From not seeing something new
And if I don't speak on how I feel
The world would lose out on
What's really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music will take my place
The World
The Relevant

[Verse 3]
So feel free to not mind me
If your used to boosters
Drug dealers and shooters its on wax
Cause most of yall niggas fabricate facts anyway
I could have easily cheat and let the 44 play
Like a 2 on 2 orgy
But I been there and it bores me
Got to the point where it did nothing for me
At 40 I want to afford not to record bullshit
In my story, and Im mad young so Id rather do it now
Before my careers done, this is pain plus glory
Victory is here, if I cried
You could see strength and pride in my tears
I do it for the kids, I do it for the 23
Hour lockdowns doin time in the pen
And my pen is the only thing I got for
Hip hop to change the game
They'll remember my name as the relevant

[Hook]
Yeah, as time flies
Hope that I'm soaring
Far from the boring
I'ma
Tell you why
It's important
I'm not the boring, (I'ma)
If I think and act like you do
The world would die
From not seeing something new
And if I don't speak on how I feel
The world would lose out on
What's really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music will take my place
The World
The Relevant

[Pre-Chorus: I Blame Coco]
I've lost
Control
And I've lost
My soul
My heart's turned
To cold
'Cause I've lost
Control

[Chorus: I Blame Coco & B.o.B]
Is that why you think I'm cool
Because I get fucked up, fucked up?
Is that why you think I'm cool
Because I get fucked up, fucked up? (Is that)
Is that why you think I'm cool (Is that why? Is that why?)
Because I get fucked up, fucked up? (Is that why? Why, why, I)
Is that why you think I'm cool (I)
Because I get fucked up, fucked up? (I, ha)

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
We're way too fucked up, but obviously
But, hey, that's just what happens when the bottles are free
Prestige like an alderman
I'm laid up in the suite like Solomon, y'all just followin'
I'm halfway across the world, it just occurred to me
I look down, wallet full of foreign currency (Haha)
Table full of shots, that's courtesy
Broke niggers fake ballin', that's perjury
I do my thing certainly
One black, one Asian, diversity
I got a girl, she got a girl, we do 'em both concurrently
I wanna see them lips move, and I ain't talking verbally
I'm at the peak, man, I'm Hong-Kong high
They wanna see me fall and I don't know why
I'm getting wasted at the Hong-Kong spot
And the room keeps spinning, but I don't know why

[Chorus: I Blame Coco & Playboy Tre]
Is that why you think I'm cool
Because I get fucked up, fucked up?
Is that why you think I'm cool
Because I get fucked up, fucked up?
Is that why you think I'm cool
Because I get fucked up, fucked up? (Ha)
Is that why you think I'm cool (Shoutout to my dawg, Shawty Slim)
Because I get fucked up, fucked up? (Ha)

[Verse 2: Playboy Tre]
First class on my ass, don't know how to act (Ha)
Tell the broad with the big rack bring a shot of Jack (Shot of Jack)
I need a lot of that, I should wear a party hat (Yeah)
I can't see you fuck boys, call it cataracts (Haha)
Hong-Kong, nice girls, interracial speaking (Yeah)
Goose with the Hen', call it interracial drinking (Yeah)
Living life, stock soaring, liquor pourin' (Yeah)
Hit a freak on one leg, call her Captain Morgan (Yeah)
Y'all all haters while we all in (All in)
Ye ain't heard, we the truth, fuck have y'all been? (Ha)
Baby, take them clothes off, I need all skin
And don't be stingy with that stuff, 'cause we all friends (

[?])
Tell me something freaky, now kiss my home girl (Kiss my home girl)
We out of here, Tre, boy, in my own world (Own world)
Call it Planet Hangover, no fat Jesus
Yours truly, Mr Potbelly, good evening (Yeah)

[Chorus: I Blame CocoI]
Is that why you think I'm cool
Because I get fucked up, fucked up?
Is that why you think I'm cool
Because I get fucked up, fucked up?
Is that why you think I'm cool
Because I get fucked up, fucked up?
Is that why you think I'm cool
Because I get fucked up, fucked up?
Is that why you think I'm cool

Hurry up, Usain Bolt to the money
Swear I'm the shit, everybody fly around me
Rap like hustle and you hustlin' with dummies

Fuck her for some money, fuckin' up the country
Pistol with the homies, you at home lonely
Call it my Macaulay, pokin' white boobies
Fuck the, fuck the police, these niggas know they know me
50 for the Rollie, niggas ain't brodies
Hoes got 'em trippin', cuffin' like cufflinks
Don't know where her tongue be - rinse it in the fuckin' sink

[Chorus]
Bitch better have my money (bitch)

She ain't got the cash till that bitch get to walking
I eat, sleep, shit, think about them dollars
Pop a pill, pop a nigga, pop my collar
I'm poppin' like a Tic Tac - bitch you better get back
Funny looking bitch, who been fucking? Sinbad?
I did that; do it all, go big never small
Got a crib with a closet, you would think you at the mall
And her mouth like halls in her jaws like wisdom teeth
You hear the beat; I bet you they gone bang this in the Middle East
I been a freak - 9th grade I was fuckin' in the bathroom
I was fuckin' at school like my house didn't have rooms
My best friend is named Benjamin Frank
So bitch better have my cake, fo' hunnid
Haha, tatted up, nigga

Fuckin' round with a real nigga and his shooter
Little dust bag bitch! Make a nigga rich
Shut the fuck up and jump on this dick
Nothin' but a motherfuckin' skank
Fuck what you talkin' bout and fuck what you think
I need money, I need it real fast
I need it real bad like white girls need ass
Baby you can help me, break this dub
20 motherfuckin' racks up up in the club (club, club, club)
Club, up-up in the front
That's why I sent a bitch to get at each one
Triple top rank, treat her like a bank
I don't give a fuck what the bitch thinkin'; bitch I'm just sayin'

[Outro]
Bitch better have my money (bitch)
Bitch better have my money (bitch)
Bitch better have my money (bitch)

[Verse 1]
So you wanna know about my politics?
Yeah I could show you things that could make you sick
There's a satellite above me that's taking pics
And an army from the west have started sending mix
And I'm sat in America doing tricks
So the army's looking on me like I'm a bitch
And I'm thinking bout the babies lying in the ditch
Thinking if they had a kite phone you'd see this shit
And what you see on MySpace just a little bit
And the stories always fucked by the time it hits
Why the hell would journalists be thick as shit?
Cause lies equals power equals politics

[Chorus]
I'm a sinner, never said anything else
I didn't lie to you, thinking of somebody else

[Hook]
Hater, ain't time for that
Hater, ain't time for that
Hater, ain't time for that
Hater, ain't time for that
I'm a—

[Verse 2]
Your ego and hate is your burning brick
You live in your mansions, stealing from the sick
Did my tsunami money go to your chicks?
For her Bentley, is she riding your dirty dick?
Your son can go to Harvard to learn the tricks
Like economics eats the poor like a Twix
In the third world sticks would sniff you out like Vicks
You write your own reviews to get away with it
You can talk shit to me, I'm used to it
You make me hard with the wounds that I have to lick
You can pick on me and I can see it at a click
You're a racist, I wouldn't trust you one bit

[Chorus]
I'm a sinner
(by their self, by their self, I live by the river)
Never said anything else
(make and take and you take a chance and you know that I'm a winner)
I didn't lie to you
(by their self, by their self, I live by the river)
Thinking of somebody else
(make and take and you take a chance and you know that I'm a winner)

[Hook]
Hater, ain't time for that
Hater, ain't time for that
Hater, ain't time for that
Hater, ain't time for that

Hater, ain't time for that
Hater, ain't time for that
Hater, ain't time for that
Hater, ain't time for that

[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

[Post-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Refrain]
You've been hit by—
You've been hit by—
A smooth criminal

[Verse 2]
So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?

Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

[Post-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

[Refrain]
You've been hit by—
You've been struck by—
A smooth criminal

[Interlude]
Choo-cha, choo-cha
Ow!
Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now!

[Breakdown]
Ow!

[Outro]
Annie, are you okay? (I don't know)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (I don't know)
There's a sound at the window (I don't know)
Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie? (I don't know)
He came into your apartment (I don't know)
Left bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why, baby)
And then you ran into the bedroom (Help me)
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie (Dag gone it)
Annie are you okay? (Dag gone it, baby)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (Dag gone it, baby)
There's a sound at the window (Dag gone it, baby)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie (Hoo! Hoo!)

Live from the city of dreams
You see I wrote and bag this dope in hopes of prettier things
If hope floats I took the boat up to the city of Queens
But phony niggas showed me quick this ain't the city of scenes
Hey! Fish out of water from the city of the dreamers

I was a dreamer then I came up with a plan
Where I land I put it all on gods hands

Boy I'm ready, it's my time, I got that flow to blow your mind

"This is Bo Burnham. He’s 21 years old. He’s a male. And he’s a little fucking shithead. He’s isolated himself over the last 5 years. It was due to Comedy. And in doing so, he has lost touch with reality. You’re an asshole, Bo. You hear me? You think you know better than me. You think you know better than everybody. You’ll die alone…and you’ll deserve it. But in the meantime, you might as well tell us a few jokes of yours. See if that helps."

You used to do comedy when you felt like being funny. But now, you’re contractually obligated. So dance, you fucking monkey. DANCE, MONKEY, DAN-

Welcome to the show. This is Bo. This is his show. And Bo likes to dance like this

Welcome to the show. This is Bo. This is his show. And Bo takes off his pants like this

Play the invisible drum. Play the invisible trumpet. (trumpet sound) Drink some invisible water. Oh, shit! That water’s real!

Bo wants to make you feel comfortable. Bo wants to make you feel comfortable. (random voice) Bo wants to make you feel comfortable. So, sit back, relax, and enjoy a healthy dose of prolonged eye contact. (prolonged eye contact) 8x

Prolonged eye contact. (prolonged eye contact) 3x Lick your lips to make it more comforting

Do you wanna see a magic trick? Do you wanna see a magic trick? Do you wanna see a magic trick? Then pick a card, any card. PSYCH

Magic isn’t real, you idiot. (read a book) 3x Magic isn’t real. Or is it?

And at that moment, Bo’s 20 year old cynicism melted into child-like wonder. He never knew there could be so much magic in the world. It’s a world of possibilities, Bo. What do you wanna do first? Run? Yea, sure. You can run. Fly? Oh, yea. You can fly

What? What are you-What the fuck are you-What the fuck are you doing? Sto-Stop. Stop it! The f-You fucking idiot. Stop. STOP. (alright!) Stop. (alright!)
In the distance, Bo saw a beautiful fairy. A fairy, so beautiful, that he felt proud about being called one in high school. He then came across an old bridge with a troll standing guard. Bo knew that he had to answer a riddle to get by. The troll spoke thus:

“Man, I don’t know why you keep calling me troll. Okay, I’m homeless. I lost my job. I really could use if you had any change if you can sp…spare…Why are you walking away, man? Wh- You’re everything that’s wrong in the world. You know that? YOU KNOW THAT??”

As Bo arrived to the other side of the stage, he saw a unicorn with 5 horns right in front of him! And the pentacorn spoke thus:

"Hello, Bo. I’ve been looking for you for quite a long t-" *shoots with a pistol x12 reloads then shoots x12*

He was safe. For now. But the dark thoughts would soon return

(It’s Godzilla! Stop!)

It’s so hard to be a lizard! It is hard to be a lizard. It’s so hard to be a lizard! (WHY IS HE SINGING?) It’s so hard to be a lizard. (WHY?) And it’s hard to segue

Is he skiing? Or is he in a gay porn? Is he skiing? (what?) Or is he in a gay porn? Is he skiing? (what?) Or is he in a gay porn? Here’s a hint: he’s in a gay porn!

Okay, Bo. This miming shit is getting pretty annoying. So give them the real thing!

My voice is so fucking natural. It’s naturally good. Naturally good. Naturally good

This is the end of the song and the beginning of the show. Welcome to the show!

You'll be my unregistered, sex offender
When my mom and dad are both at work
You'll be my unregistered, sex offender
I can lie about who ripped my shirt, ohh

[Verse 1: Danny]
You're my middle-aged angel sent from above
You're required to go door to door and tell them we're in love
We could be close together when you're far from your wife
I think that scars are really cool. You should scar me for life

[Verse 2: CJ]
If we do something dirty, I can just take a bath
Age is just a number, and I'm not good at math
Let's take it slow at first; I wanna remember it all
Because I'm gonna show them where you touched me on a doll

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
I know you think about me, when you're at work
Lets take a walk to your car and start an amber alert
I know you're friends with my dad, so you're closer to me
Lets do tonight, and I'll repress the memories

[Hook]
You'll be my unregistered, sex offender
I know how to keep a secret well
You'll be my unregistered, sex offender

You know she just moved out of Momma’s

She works hard for the money (So, so hard)
So hard for the money (So, so hard)

She be dancin’ for them dollars (Yeah)
Dancin’ for them dollars

Uh, same nigga that you knew since back when
You ain't had too many dollars, and you couldn’t trust your friends, used to ride around Impala
Drop you off right after high school
I don’t know too many like you, bitches hate but they won’t fight you
Uh, as far as nothing, too honest…
No time for no problems, it’s all good cause you bad
You just be fallin’ for the wrong niggas
I’m clicking all of her pictures, and she showing all of that ass
’Bout that life, you don’t even gotta act
You ain't gotta know how to know that

[Hook]

Money slaves, can’t save them
Her mind gone, she tainted
She getting double what she made then
Ain’t gotta man, but she paid man
She know the game, it ain’t fair
Just foul play, no referees
I’m falling back, just watching that
In the corner off with a couple of racks
I like that, I need that, I want that, I see that
Can I meet that, where you be at, everybody try to beat that
I’m clicking all of her pictures, and she showing all of that ass
Got that life, you don’t even gotta act
You ain't gotta know how to know that

[Hook]

I like that, I need that, I want that, I see that
Can I meet that, where you be at, everybody try to beat that
I- I like that, I need that, I want that, I see that
Can I meet that, where you be at, everybody try to beat that
I-I-I Like that…
I-I-I Need that…
I-I-I Like that…
Can I, Can I, Can I meet that…

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I'm who these ladies love, who your main bitch lust for
Mounts of dead presidents, and I ain't talking Rushmore
Codeine and syrup got my safe like the drugstore
Hating niggas, niggas hating, bitches hating -- fuck, boy
She a gold-digger, but who am I to judge her?
We above the law, who am I to cuff her?
It's obvious she want me, mayne
You could try to 

[fuck her]
I be swimming in these women, I'm the scuba diver lover
Known around the globe but Harlem's where I be at
Same home as Cam'ron, and I ain't talking Diaz
Flame spitter nigga, guaranteed to get a heat rash
Ballin' all seasons, subscribe for your league pass
Rap Simon London, Louis Vuitton Don shits
Christian Louboutin for guys with red bottoms
Yves St. Laurent kicks, Christian Dior sponsors
Thesis snap-backs like I'm straight outta Compton
Rick Owens, I own 'em
Margiela's, I did 'em
Y3's, we on it
Alexander, we miss 'im
I'm talking 'bout the king, yes, Alexander McQueen
May he live, rest in peace, and we do it through our jeans

[Verse 2: A$AP Nast]
I'm trying to tell 'em I see my future as crystal-clear
Shine like some crystal, yeah, so I keep pistols near
Not far at all, one reach, that's all
You sleep, sleep in the back of some old Ford pickup
On the side of the road
Cold, cold world, no J
No way, Jose
N.A. all day
S.T., that's me
Ask why, and you wonder why my flow go over guys
Who want a horse and drive
But you often find it's coffin time, no Pokemon
Plate still stuffed to the top, but ain't no pork on mine
It's quite often I could come up with Mighty Morphin rhymes
Fool think he fucking with Nast, must have lost his mind
Yeah, you lost your mind, the throne is mine
I watch the throne
Smoking reefer, slightly past my zone
I'll soon be back at home
I'm relaxing, homes
I got the Mac tucked in my jack
I might just act if you ain't acting right
Fuck it, I keep the Magnum
Bust it; niggas don't want it with my niggas, we steady coming
Hundred deep, three hundred we coming like Spartan
Fucker, just pardon my flow
I come through your deli department or market
Nah, check it out
I'm swagging, my niggas with it too
Your bitch with it, I probably just hit her then I'm through
Through, I'm chilling, I'm chilling with the homies
Rolling up a couple Swishers, couple bitches on me
I be chilling, homie
Get the picture? We all around the globe, check the flow on me

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
(Yeah, Fergenstein you never heard of mine
I'm sippin' Persian wine with your Persian Dime)
Medusa faceded mogul
Fergenstein too cool too
Hoodlum in these Owen boots
Ricky Owen but I ain't on you
Fuck burnin', I thaw the booth
Nigga I ain't lyin', I told the truth
Lil' kids gone hold the deuce
Sip holy water, tryna seek the the truth
Uh, that was just me startin' off...

[Verse 4: A$AP Twelvy]
Man I came to bring the pain
Twelve be spittin' flames
Live from the two twelve with my eight dollar gang
AP, Audemar
Running like a Viking back
It's the grand with the flow, all the hoes be liking that
Recite it back
Run it back
Play it over, play it over
ASAP everything, my young niggas takin' over
Pyrex, baking soda, loud and some roll up
Cookin' up some shit Ty Nast screamin'...

[Verse 5: A$AP Ferg]
Donatella on speed dial
Diamond teeth when these smile
Triple tongue, Jeremy Scott's
Margiela's on me, nigga no socks
Dropped in a bitch, nigga no pop

All your guns is borrowed, I don't feel sorrow
Actually your man passed the gat to me, now check this

[Hook: Notorious B.I.G.]
What's beef, beef is when you need two gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU
What's beef, beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU
Check it

[Verse 2: Havoc]
I done clapped at the best of them
Been caused the death of them
These dudes don't want no more, shit is affecting them
Tops popped off, them niggas from the bridge

Don't know or warn you, catch them all hogged up
Sober that ass up with clips, the ratchet spit
Number one with the buddhaka, henny-sour diesel
Ain't no telling what I do to ya
It's obvious ma you ain't fucking keep it moving ma

[Prodigy]
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow they shot 'em in their cars
I wish I was there, I would of shot back all em'
They fire return fire put it right back on em'
Sacrifice myself for you no problem, (no problem)
In the flames I burn for my niggas that's gone
And the niggas that took the hits on my niggas you been warned
P's not the one, Hav not the one
You try to run up on us, we already busting the guns

[Hook]

[Biggie]
They'll be nothin but smooth sailing (talk to em)
When I spit shots, now your crew's bailing (y'all don't know what beef is)
All I got is heat and tough talk for you
Tie you up, cut your balls off just for you
Man this is straight torture, look what that slick shit bought ya (c'mon)
A first class ticket to Lucifer, real name Christopher (yea, Chris)
Watch me set it off like Vivica (c'mon that's right)
Here lies your demise, close your eyes (close your eyes)
Think good thoughts, die while your skin start to glisten
Pale blue hands get cold, your soul's risen (damn)
It's bad cause I just begun
What make the shit real bad I was having fun (hahaha)

[Hook]

[Diddy]
Attention MCs........Attention MCs
Beef doesn't happen on records

Rapping motherfuckers!, (c'mon man)
Fuck outta here!, (fuck outta here)

[Intro]
...whole life for this, just to make it hot
(Ya'll never going to stop us)/
We worked our whole life for this, just to make it hot
(I've been doing this for a long time nigga)/
We worked our whole life for this, just to make it hot
(F I, A S, C O, listen...)

[Verse 1]
When you going to learn?
You're not breaking mine
Best change your mind like Frankenstein
From change to five to Franklin crime, I movement
I run with two chicks like I chamber nines
These playas praying that I gains a line
Or I slip into a gin popped frame of mind
Picture that, with this here, I'm solitary confined
You still behind my bars, commissaries reclined
Account's get low, and accounts get towed
Everything these niggas be about get flowed
These cats won't quit till a house gets sold
Jaws been thawed out, my mouths still froze
Niggas like women, but they don't love hoes
Cause if they get hit by them fourty-fours
They couldn't come back to life with soul to soul
Or Blige and kiss on the remix, I speaks it (nigga)

[Verse 2]
The kids and other crime that they trying to solve
Drop jewels like Ja Rule, no crying involved
Ya cool, How I do, don't even try it at all
Most rappers out there, can barely know me
Can only spit what I spit, with karaoke
Only person got what I got is my co-defendant
They like you, got to be kidding, no
No dependents, L-U-P, get it down from these holes to the ceilings
X5 driver, west side supplier
Grams from Nigeria, your hands from Siberia
Time is money, brisk by the hour, peace
Piece, bout' an hour at least, Why I
Wait by the minute, we count by the week
Cause when I turn the hands back, watch the cities turn black
No more V.I.P. or Champ.I.nin'
You can only get Do' when you can't be I.D
Listen nigga

[Intro Re-hash]

[Verse 3]
Niggas mad at son of Madison
Three o' fifty fo' for real
Where my dogs is still
Where we ducked police
Me, Huggy, Josh, J-Rock, Nick, E
County Reg, Quick, and Cocheese
Notice, where the first rhymes was wroted
First nine was holded
First dime was solded
I did it all, from the biggest to miniscule
Don't twist it who miss business to visit and get it charged
Set it dawg, aspirin, and Ty-le-nol, stitching on
Bandaging for your killing arm cause that feeling gone
I'mma spit it on, till we whipping with no ceilings on
Did ya's long sitting, from brisk it to Phillip Young
Sorry, it's going to be hours put in
To soup put on, box opened up and
Flowers put in, and I got some of them
Emergency room, cowards pushed in, listen

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]

Now look at my chains, all them things frozen nigga
Rolling up my Mary Jane before I smoke it wit ya
Hit this J, I bet this be a day you don't remember
Looking at the top and I don't see not one contender
Cooking out the pot, I like my weed for lunch and dinner
Got some cookies in the jar, OG in the blender
You paying for quantity, but quality is what you spend for
If there's a marijuana-ology, I'll be your mentor
And all the bombest chronic leaf is what you in for
So give your parents my apology for me again or
Get high like we Cheech and Chong
We gon' eat some brownies, we gon' smoke, we gon' need some bongs
Roll up so we can all-

Popping P's, chopping trees

All y'all invited, ignite it, light it, now follow me
Laid out, plush couch, flat screen television
Table full of vegetation so you just might smell nigga
That's what it is, that's what it's gon' be
East Side Long Beach where I'm from
Bring your girls, all y'all come
Give me some, now give her some
It's big Mac, I love to have fun
You are, you are the one
If you get it or do it, then it'll be just like 2 on 1
Break it down, lay it down
Baby work that body like
At the pad, acting bad
Baby what that party like?
Moving so schizophrenic
Baby pull down your panties

Back room that's my bedroom

Close the door, smoke, oh fasho

Smoke something

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Have a little party at my crib

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Having money and blowing hella chronic
Smoke I'm stunting
Cutlass on them chrome spokes with the engine running
Sounding like a dinosaur empty stomach rumbling
Your bitch at the window cause she know I'm coming
She tell you that she 'bout to go jogging and on the corner
She jump in, take her to the honeycomb
Stuffing kush in Raw cones, playing Megaman 3
Your Wonderwoman giving dome out Miami
Said she never leave me 'lone, She wan' have a family
She just high, tomorrow night, she'll be titties out, dancing
Trying to leave with the next nigga in a Aston
So why get caught up
I'm too swift up on my toes to have my name brought up
In sewing circles with them hoes
I rather be a straight G rolling up a whole
O-Z of that OG have them KO'ed

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Have a little party at my crib
And all the weed is rolled that's how it is
When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go

Nice to see you too okay

[Verse 1]

Baby don't be scurred, shake that ass like Mystikal
We got physical now she calling and beeping
Call when I'm sleepin, call my girl claimin we creepin
Bitch you nuts, look I only fucked you once
How you gone get the message, I ain't called you in months
Acting like Super Dave with them dumb ass stunts
Talking bout girls I could get her whatever she want (Whatever I want)
I'm like girls like you be wanted for warrants
Stalking of course, alone on the phone disguising your voice
Got your girls asking for Kay on the three way
Talking bout (You can't call a bitch on her BDay?)
Hmm, Tanisha its over with stop playin
Nah nah it's over. (So what you saying?)
Look you gotta bounce. (I don't wanna fuck with you)

[Hook]
I'm never letting go
Never letting go

[Verse 2]
You believe this ho, pop up everywhere I go
Pop up at the show, pop up at the grocery store
Pop up in my kitchen like, "Oh you wash dishes here?"
Pop up in my bathroom, "Oh you take pisses here?"
Listen here we gone need some distance here
(Where I'm gone go?) I don't care, just disappear
You ain't my main bitch not even my main squeeze
Anyway, how the fuck you get a set of keys?
First she used them on my crib, then she used them on my whip
And wrote on the side, "Kanye you ain't shit"
You believe this bitch? Man, did you see this shit!?
Did she just knock my windows out on my Escalade? (Ha yeah nigga!)
That's a twelve fuckin' hundred dollar estimate
She must've took off all yesterday just to hate
Restraining orders ain't stopping her
She the reason caller I.D. so popular
Across the street now with some fuckin binoculars
Screaming at the top of her lungs, "I'm never letting go!"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Had enough of the stalker shit got to put her in line
Count back from ten when I got to nine I grabbed mine
Before I gotta do what I gotta do after blue she lying
Like "Nigga you put your hands on me for the last time"
Tried to get you over your uncles to come and jump me
Take my cash and punk me
With my ass and trump me
I stump them fuckin chunkies
Just look at yo niece
She beat her own ass and called the police
(Pregnant with his baby yeah he still getting rough with me!)
And to my crib scuff me up and put the cuffs on me
My momma dropped that five hundo and got me out of custody
Girl left a note on my door (Nigga don't ever fuck with me)
And all the time I got to thinkin that I'm the man
Hottest nigga on the block and shit I got a fan
I'm like a swole nigga thought that he could lift the van
Somebody please come and take this bitch up off my hands!
You don't understand, man

[Hook]

Uh oh, uh oh, these hoes, these hoes, all the same, all the same

Smooth skinny nigga left bitch on my arm
Hoes be jealous, they like, nigga who's that ho?

Til you clap in the kitchen and she making me grits
Not to mention she be loving my hits (I love you Scotty)

When I get loot they'll be on my money
If a ho thick I'm caking serving' up blue
In Timberland boots, bitch you're wrong
Be my down asshole, take off the thong

She be chill about me cheating but still (be cool)

And I never mess a pussy (for sure)
That a nigga didn't have to hit
My gamepoint sick when I fuck with a chick
I never fuck 'em raw, so the cum never drips
I like 'em caramel with some sexy ass lips

And I play it low

Tyga- Slow It Down Lyrics

[Hook]
Now that shorties in my bedroom saying “what should we do?”
I said “hey, don’t slow it down”
Now that shorties up in my place saying do it her way
I said “hey, don’t slow it down”
Slow it dooooown. 

[x4]

Uh, gotta find her
Thought to my mind, don’t wanna be lonely tonight
Whatever

[VERSE 1]
Stepped out, threw my diamond s sweater
On to the grocery, quarter eleven
The aisles with the beverages, 347
Seen two college chicks, why you gigglin?
I asked, they said “you be on television”
“Wait, your Tyga, my friend wants a picture”
So you live close by? Next thing I’m looking in her eyes

[Hook]
Now that shorties in my bedroom saying “what should we do?”

I said “hey, don’t slow it down”
Now that shorties up in my place saying do it her way
I said “hey, don’t slow it down”
Slow it dooooown. 

[x4]


Uh, gotta find her
Thought to my mind, don’t wanna be lonely tonight
Whatever

[VERSE 2]
Later on, hit the club. I’m chillen
Funny how time flies when you in it
Valet Bentley, gently tinted
Seen misses, she use to stay in my building
Ten fifty
God, never seen you in a dress before
So you moved? Where to?
“To the hills of Hollywood, you should come.. visit.. soon”

[Hook]
Now that shorties in my bedroom saying “what should we do?”
I said “hey, don’t slow it down”
Now that shorties up in my place saying do it her way
I said “hey, don’t slow it down”
Slow it dooooown. 

[x4]

[BREAKDOWN]
Hoooou, ooooooh (no need to rush it, ya know)
So take your time
As the one for me
So ease your mind
As the one for me

[VERSE 3]
Uhh, I’m feeling better already
We’ve been steady
Put a diamond lump on your damn pinkie
I do miss you, just been busy
Do you miss me?
How bout I come get you?

[Hook]
Now that shorties in my bedroom saying “what should we do?”
I said “hey, don’t slow it down”
Now that shorties up in my place saying do it her way
I said “hey, don’t slow it down”
Slow it dooooown. 

[x4]

Told her to wake the fuck up she said what's up lick my nut up now I'm rubbing her ass
Mr. Nice Watch

Ah Mr nice watch ugh 

[x3]
My wrist frigid
It's exquisite

It's the sickest
No matter what watch I rock
Swear it's like a bad bitch just come with it
She said I should wear my Rollex
I know that
Bitch pick one
That platinum with that thick face, or that gold shit, that sick one
Audimar piguet, Audimar for Trey
Money grown on 4 all of most of date
For the time I never knew though
Got me two Hublot's oh
Plus I did for the bitches don't believe I twit pic it
Versace shirt on the boat and Cole video
I'm big pimping, niggas know
Money in the envelope watch you niggas watching I
Always fuck with the paper even when the fucking center folds

It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no you can't make that back
So let's ball while we here, let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I make that back, I make that back
Uh nice watch! (Uh Huh)
Uh nice watch! (I know)
Uh nice watch
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch
That Way

You see one thing you gotta know baby life is just complicated you know
I be moving around a lot I be city to city writing it's just
I don't know if we ever really be like that with with us you know

2 seater when I roll up
But it's two divas hold up
Ones a cool blower but the other I don't know of
She said something before on how I met her on the tour
I said are you for sure she said boy you a whore 

[x2]
Listen here bitch watch your mouth
This my shit and I'll kick you out
You so silly you so pretty
But I can't kiss you in your mouth
Same hoes now try to make the phone blow up
Wouldn't be around if the green ain't grow up
Lawnmower whores so it lawns over whores
I don't really have time how am I gonna get to know ya
You body like a rhyme I want to over flow you
Ain't want to fuck with your mind but I guess I overdosed you
And I'm so sorry and it so true

I apologize I don't recollect your name
Let me tell you that them heels really complement your frame
We can take them oh off
Then I gotta catch my plane
You say you miss me and you wishing for some private time
Girl how could we get that way 

[x2]

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Hook: Vali Porter]
Sometimes I don’t know if you’re tellin the truth
Everytime you get mad when I ask you what you do what you do
Seems that you’re runnin' around
Every night late comin' home when I call
And I don’t know what to do
'Cause I feel like you’re lyin' to me when I’m askin' you
Sometimes…

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I hear you talkin' to me
You sick and tired of the kid lying, sometime you feel like you talkin' through me
That’s when you walk up to me, trying for attention
Ma listen, you wild’n, stop trippin'
'Cause a nigga work too hard, too long
Always got a show or in the stu', new song
Them other dudes couldn't walk with my shoes on
Still I come home, hearin' 'bout what I do wrong
Pullin stunts and, rollin' blunts
With my dudes from the hood, but to you, they no good
I’m just doin' what I could, and that’s givin the circumstances
You only get one shot at these certain chances
Instead of trying to find dirt, and where your man is
Try and understand when that work demanded
And no, mama, that’s not a punch line
I’m always there when it’s crunch time
But still you say

[Hook]
Sometimes I don’t know if you’re tellin the truth
Everytime you get mad when I ask you what you do what you do
Seems that you’re runnin' around
Every night late comin' home when I call
And I don’t know what to do
'Cause I feel like you’re lyin' to me when I’m askin' you
Sometimes…

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Now I know you hear the "he say, she say"
Your home girls got my every move on replay
Screamin' how you know niggas, and the games that we play
But all the while I’ve been grindin' for this week's pay
Hustlin' each day, in order to eat right
Call me sayin' she need me in order to sleep right
Not really knowin' what these streets like
So you stay up until I come back
A nigga love that
Help me relax, warm plate and the dub sack
And after that, proceed to bend the back
Then I’m back to politics as usual
And sometimes I wanna talk to get through to you
But… damn…

[Sample: Ashford & Simpson]
I don't know if I ought to bring it up
Seems like such a funny thing to talk about
Don't know if it's right to do

[Hook]
Sometimes I don’t know if you’re tellin' the truth
Everytime you get mad when I ask you what you do, what you do
Seems that you’re runnin around
Every night late comin' home when I call
And I don’t know what to do
Cause I feel like you’re lyin' to me when I’m askin you
Sometimes.....

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa & (Vali Porter)]
I may get mad
But I don't really wanna fuss with you, I got love for you
(And I don't know what to do)
'Cause every man needs a home
But that sometime, that man can feel the need to roam
Say you know my type, can't leave the freaks alone
To each his own, I'm getting grown and
(I don't know what to do)
'Cause you always think I'm lying to you
I can't deal with all the crying you do, you say

[Hook]
Sometimes I don’t know if you’re tellin' the truth
Everytime you get mad when I ask you what you do, what you do
Seems that you’re runnin around
Every night late comin' home when I call
And I don’t know what to do
'Cause I feel like you’re lyin' to me when I’m askin you
Sometimes.....

[Outro: (Ashford & Simpson) & Vali Porter]
(I don't know if I ought to bring it up)
I don’t know if you’re tellin' the truth
(Seems like such a funny thing to talk about)
Everytime
(Don't know if it's right to do)
You get mad when I ask you what you do
We used to be, we used to be
Lovers
But now we don't, ever see
Each other

Hook:
And I know you think
I'm too busy for love
(No, no)
When did everything become
So fucked up? (Oh, no)
The blame can't all be mine (no)
Cuz it was just a matter of time
(I'm sorry)

Chorus:
Gotta hop on this flight
So let's skype, tonight
(Yeah)
What once was so easy
Girl please believe me
It's hard, but I'll try
We gon' be alright
So go ahead baby
Won't you poke it open?
While I can keep focused
Everything in slow motion
(Yeah)
So go head baby why don't you poke it open
While you got me focused
Cause baby in a moment
I'll probably be over the ocean

And I know you think I'm too busy for love
But when did everything become so Fucked up
The blame can't all be mine no
Cause it was just a matter of time

[Hook]

Gotta hop on this fights
So let's skype, tonight
(Yeah)
What once was so easy
Girl please believe me
It's hard, but I'll try
We gon' be alright
So go ahead baby
Won't you poke it open?

You so bad, you so bad
Of course I miss you
You know I love you
Why you always talking about bitches?
Like we just had a great moment..
And, no!
Listen, I'm on this computer
With yo pretty ass
I'm not worried about no bitches!
Woo

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
She reached her hand out with a pamphlet and I politely said "No, ma'am"
I mean no disrespect and I apologize if this fucks up your program
You tell me I'm gonna burn for lying but that He can turn water to wine? (laughs)
Well if there's a hell below then we're all gonna' be just fine
So there I stood six feet of sin, a walking contradiction
But am I wrong for posing questions "or am I just another lost soul searching?"
Then she gave me a look so unchristian and told she'd pray for my children
I said, "If you're so holy you'll probably out-live me but if I bought a Jesus piece do you think he'd forgive me?"

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Maybe I would be a fool to think
That somewhere in the sky's a place for me
What good would it be to pray for me
You won't save me, don't pray for me

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
Now I've never been religious
I'm just a big fan of logistics
And if it makes sense then I'm all for it
I even pray if the situation calls for it
Somebody asked me if I believe in miracles
I try to answer without sounding satirical
I'm 3 years past my expiration and yet I'm still fresher than a newborn
So I guess that's my explanation but it's safe to say I've never seen a unicorn and I never chase rainbows
But I hear the devil wears designer clothes
So does God have a favorite brand?
And for that matter, is he even a man?
And will I go to hell for even saying that?
Only time will tell I'm just relaying facts

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Maybe I would be a fool to think
That somewhere in the sky's a place for me
What good would it be to pray for me
You won't save me, don't pray for me

{Instrumental}

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Maybe I would be a fool to think
That somewhere in the sky's a place for me
What good would it be to pray for me
You won't save me, don't pray for me

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Maybe I would be a fool to think
That somewhere in the sky's a place for me
What good would it be to pray for me
You won't save me, don't pray for me
Met a retarded kid name Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with a 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and formula 44-D
Fuck an acid tab, I strapped the whole sheet to my forehead
Waited 'til it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leavin' you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers, we blowin' up your house
Killin' your parents, and comin' back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keepin' a promise as Nostradamus
'Cause I ain't makin' no more threats
I'm doin' drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head, maybe more
'Cause I smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a Labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Hello Gorgeous
This phone call's probably being recorded
Just know that I did it for the four of us
And those motherfuckers kept ignorin' us
After this I'm going underground
If they come asking give them the run-around
How does Costa Rica in the summer sound?
Couple days then we moving to another town
Yea I know them dreams, seams
Just know that time'll never come between
Space either, fake features
Things that we reject but connects all us believers
The insurrection's gone viral
They'll never stop it now, I hope it all spirals
Outta control, like a dam with a hole
From here on out it's all about survival
The way we left things they probably think we rivals
But don't be naive, they hate you more than I do
Remember always speak in opposites
I hate you so much, it's such a compliment
I know that defies the common sense
But we ain't never been right: honestness
We never fit in school, and never did rules
But who'd a thought we'd turn out bombing shit

[Chorus]
I'm giving you a nightcall to tell you how I feel
I want to drive you through the night down the hills
I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear
I'm gonna show you where it's dark but have no fear

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
He said he was just so tired
Of them fighting our water with fire
He said that we need something drier
To really impress the empire
Funny cause he really hated war
But why we went to war is what he really hated more
Said it's silly how that our schools make us stupid and our jobs make us poor
When he came back from the Corps
Is when he really got serious
Read a lot of books, started acting all mysterious
The VA is what really made him furious
Told him his condition didn't exist, period
That's why he started that petition
Went all the way to Washington, said they didn't listen
To a white male Christian
He just laughed when they took our father's pension
He said that you gotta act in opposites
Helps you hide your tracks when you stand up to the dominant
But I knew he felt bad
Told me later was the saddest day he ever had
To see our dad so hopeless
That was the turning point that's what really gave him focus
I didn't agree with everything, some of it made sense
But never thought that he would do something like this

[Chorus]
I'm giving you a nightcall to tell you how I feel
I want to drive you through the night down the hills
I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear
I'm gonna show you where it's dark but have no fear

[Verse 3 - Lupe Fiasco]
I know you don't watch but your brother was on TV
Couple guys in black suits came around to see me
They went through all your books and took all of your CDs
My granny said you'd be all right, she saw it in the tea leaves
All the operations going well, had a lotta contact from all the other cells
Everybody, everywhere is calling you a hero
They going through the rubble, but the body count is zero
It's all violent and bloodless
I know the government really loves this
This account is hacked, you know how to keep in touch
I'll never see you again, I hate you so much

[Bridge]
There's something inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same

[Chorus]
I'm giving you a nightcall to tell you how I feel
I want to drive you through the night down the hills
I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear
I'm gonna show you where it's dark but have no fear

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Okay!
It's ya boy
Hahaha
Young Wiz Khalifa
What up dallas texas
Houston!
ATL What's smackin'
MIA yo! Yeah! Hahaha
I don't do the stanky leg and all that you know what I'm sayin?
I got a lil' flavor though
Watch me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I never give 'em room keys hoes meet me in the lobby
And bring a set of friends for the niggas that's around me
Broad from Atlanta
My weed came from cali
Boss of my city on my team I'm a captain
All you see is action
Don't get it smackin' and don't compare us
My flow will put faith in you like a prayer does
I be tryin' shit make it seem fair but as soon as I get ready for my check I yell cut!
Cut ya girl
Cut a song
And my swag is opposite of yours, cut it off
Been a minute since I quit writin' in my phone cause I got too many broads tryin' call
And I don't own down time so I don't pick up
They wait until they see me at the club or at the mall
To run up with their friends wantin' pictures with us all
I could tell you how it feels to own a team, you just ball
Dog
So how could you say you do you when I show up stuntin' making Lauren London - New new
My team go out you in the zoo crew
Blunt stuffed like a new shoe
And my down south girl
Do da stanky leg
A nigga at the store look like he makin eggs
Got a whole loaf so I be breakin' bread
And gettin' so ill the doctor got me takin meds
Kush IV's
I drink till I think I'm 'bout to throw up
Then the nurse bring another bottle to pour up
Told me I'm livin' fast but how do you slow up
When you never learn to use brakes
Hold up
Everyday I'm in a new state and niggas hate but I can turn that beef to cube steak
Get a huge plate
Sit 'em down at the table and say grace
And stuff my face

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
Hahahaa im jus havin fun on you niggas man
08 was great but 09 is mine
Okay! Dumb bitch

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Talk about it, make 'em talk about it
Life to me is currency, prosperity, I got it
And your life to me is lifeless like it's livin' on life support
I license everything in my wallet
Lightest boy with the biggest heart
Nigga, play yo' part or parallel park yo' ego
Next to me and violence
Next to me is definitely no one, I'm one of one
And I musta won that from anybody who had it
Or better yet forgot it
Mack in the back of a 'Lac with a MAC
In the back of a 'Lac with a latch on the back
Of the trunk, hit a punk in the back with the pump
In the back 'til he's off balance
And I'm back in the front of the front of the future
When you are mentioning talent
And I'm back in the back of the block
With a cop, wanna cop anybody's allowance
Iraq on the block, he watch with a block
Or whatever and cut, no cut, mo' guns, mo' guts, fuck boy
You fucked up twice, you fucked considerin' you drownin'
Die in a lake with a date with a catfish, backflip head first smilin'
Cr-cry in the face of Jesus, we just pray we keep on stylin'
On you bitches, TDE, YMCM, big business, bitch!

[Interlude: Ace Hood]
Ace Hood
Birdman, what they do, big dawg?
Mack Maine, what's crackin fool?

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Okay nigga, riding in a May-B, and I'm probably with Baby
Don't talk nigga, fuck you, pay me, intercept your bitch like Bailey
Okay, big money on this side
100 grand for the whip my bitch drive
Need a new safe, money getting too high
Dead presidents all in my Levis
Boy I swear this nigga be swagging, and I'm living lavish
Might cop me an Aston, Martin on 'em
Anything I drive I own 'em, bad bitch and that ass ain't normal
Gotta put that pound game on her, beat it up, she deep in a coma
I'm super paid, two shows a day
My Rollie gold, no time to waste
What it do, Bird? My fuckin' brother
Keep that pistol by me like my lovely momma
Hot as the summer, cold as the winter
Stay on them charts, I heard that they plotting my timber
Young nigga, got a lot of flows
Any nigga don't believe me, I make it look easy, easy, outta control

[Interlude: Birdman]
Just like that boy
Death forbids honor, ya understand me?
Dedication, respect
Fully loaded, yeah

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Box full of choppers, hand on the trigger
Uptown gangsta, get it how we get it
Third Ward soldier, suicide rider
Militant minded, hundred mill on the counter
Hand Persian rug nigga, flame on the Bugatti
Christian Louboutin, Chanel for my models
Higher than Bugatti nigga, fishing on the fishscales
Nose diving for them hundreds, strapped up making mail
Fr-fresher than I been before
Higher than we even been, shining on them 24’s
Junior doing time ho
On the grind ho, while he doing time ho

[Interlude: Mack Maine]
Ya know, that time is money
And money still was made baby
Eight months ain't stop nothing, nigga
It’s like, jail was third base
And my lil' nigga still came home, ya understand? Yeah

[Verse 4: Mack Maine]
I’m from the hood where bitches hold coke in they baby diapers
That’s why when the babies grow up, damn, they be like us
I came a long ways from rhyming up in crazy cyphers
Man I’m so happy my lil' brother came home from Rikers
Shout out to BP, Thugga, Flow and Fail Boy
My flow Lucifer, I spit hell boy
My heart numb, ain’t no pain I can't withstand
And I hold my niggas down boy like a kickstand (Young Money!)
Get off my nuts, stop acting like a bitch fam
Lil’ nigga finish puberty, grow ya own dick damn
I went from watching time fly on Earl and Red porch
To cruising through the streets of Miami in a red Porsche
Me and Stunna fly, we should join the Air Force
Stand up niggas, the fuck you brought them chairs for?
I went from making money from people with crack habits
To thanking God I’m in a whole 'nother tax bracket
Amen

[Outro (Billionaire Minds): DJ Khaled]
Shout out to the YMCMB bosses
Birdman, Slim, Lil Wayne, Mack Maine
One time for that boy Cortez, aka Tez!
This is how we do it
We ain't never gon' stop either
(Olympicks!)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, line full of bitches
Hard fine bitches
The shit that I'm smokin' got me higher than tuition
Wanna know whats goin' on let me paint a picture
And if ya ain't around lemme give ya a description
Corks everywhere, hoes everywhere
Loud music playin' heavy smoke in the air
Its cups everywhere, flashin' lights
Bottles of Patron, sittin' in the ice like...

[Hook: Mario]
Its a celebration
Bottles by the cases
Tonight we goin' all get wasted
Then we goin' take off like spaceships
Oh, and I dont really want her to leave

[Bridge]
Order bottle after bottle
She say she can't drink, ay shut up bitch swallow
(we gon' drink the night away, we gon' drink the night away)

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ah Mr. Rose Raw
2 piece suit cuff link on the arm
Sex on the beach and some shots for these broads
And bring the biggest bottle of Moet for my dawgs
We on the couch leanin' on the wall
My old bitch hit me said I seen you with them hoes
But I'm turnt up so a nigga lost his phone
I gotta find a freak take her home
Hit it like uhhhh
Same day different chick ya'll
Took girls all around the world up on Crenshaw
In and out the crib, back and forth like ping pong
Me and Game got the ho jumpin' Kriss Kross
I'm the shit so piss off
Better yet, find me somethin' to piss on
I'm too drunk, how I take it this far
Wake up, and do it all again tomorrow

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Game]
Uh, uh sicker than cancer
Colder than Aspen
West side ridin' wit Tyga
Tiger fur inside the Aston
Martin dependin' on who askin'?
Got so many chickens, all my birds in one basket
And thats a coupe for you, retract the roof for you
Its a Doggy Dog world, and I can call Snoop for ya
Uh thats gangsta, thats fly
Yo baby mamas mama would say I'm one hell of a guy
Why do I start beefs, why do I drop Phantoms
Why I got 7 houses but none in Atlanta
(thats stupid)
Nah nigga smarter than Bill Gates
Clap ya hands I do it
With the sound that still make
I know the real Weezy, introduce you to the real Drake
My hoes more patient than Detox fans, they will wait
For me to go um, 10 times platinum
And cop more Patron and hatin' niggas imagine

[Hook + outro]
Its a celebration
Tonight we gon' all get wasted
Then we goin' take off like spaceships
But I dont really want her to leave
Dont leave, dont be scared
It ain't a game, meet me in the bed
And we gon' drink the night away
Ohh I dont really want you to leave baby
Wooah, I don't really want you to leave
Come celebrate with me baby
Yea

C3 ahah... Be ready, well I know you can't be... so be afraid... be very afraid

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

[Pre-Chorus]
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

[Bridge]
Throw your soul through every open door (Ooh woah, oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (Woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Ooh woah, oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

[Breakdown]
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could've had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all, yeah (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Chorus]
We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Verse 1]
If you don't like what you singing, you sing a different hook
If you don't like what you cooking, you get a different cook
If you don't like what you wearing, you get a different look
You wanna escape Armageddon, read a different book
When knowledge is right there, we don't even look
December 2012 got this whole world shook
But look, the last days for others are the first days for us
The question to ask is who can you trust
Respect to all that 2012 stuff
But when you really study it it's fear, it don't apply to us
Yo, Hollywood lies to us, all day
The question is what does your culture say
Where's your culture at? Who's your prophet?
What history guides your spiritual logic?
It starts with a story, then it's hypnotic
Then any myth that comes along, you just adopted it
Why? Because your culture, you forgot it
December 2012, let's continue this topic
Turn the page, the present world age
Began 3114 BC
According to the Mayan calendar, this age concludes December 21st 2012 AD
This 5125 years cycle of calm is one world age
Nothing changes overnight, it's all a process
A transition, it happens over many days
In the Mayan calculation a K'in, is one day
The Mayan Winal, that's 20 days
The Tun is 360 days
A K'atun is 7200 days
The B'ak'tun is 144,000 days
And they applied that to the Milky Way
In the cycles they saw the Sun
Moving across the Milky Way's equator
Lining up with other galactic neighbors
We've been shifting for 30 years it seems
From 1980 to about 2016
The shift is now, it's occurring now
But if you're learning from the movies you won't know how to survive
Or stay alive after the storm
Cause after that a New World Order is born
Oh, you don't know, man? About they programs?
You still watching Lindsay, you don't see that low hand?
Let go, man, the flood is coming
Don't be scared, get prepared, keep your motor running
Rock with me

[Hook]
Higher level

[Verse 2]
Yep, it's all mass control, here's the philosophy
Cortés knew about the Aztec prophecy
Before he invaded their society
He studied their cultural psychology
He knew they had armor, guns, and steeds
So he arrived in the Aztec year 1-Reed
That's the year Quetzalcoatl
Was prophecized to return from exile in fact
Cortés played out the Aztec myth
And took away those people's will to resist
Cortés played on religious beliefs
And blinded the Aztecs, cause he was a thief
Look, the Yucatan, that's a Mayan book of cycles
It lets the Mayans know when the Gods are gonna strike you
In fact, every 13 K'atuns you see
The Mayans were visited with a catastrophe
So every 200 and 56 or 7 years
The Mayan people lived with this fear
So on the island of Tayasal now Flores
The Spanish came armed with this knowledge
They knew according to the Mayan heavens
That the next cycle was 1697
So as the Mayans stood there fixed on the heavens
The Spanish showed up with all of their weapons
March 13th, 1697
The Mayan people learned a terrible lesson
Your fears and tears are used against you
Cause 80% of world control is mental
But back to the Mayans, they getting some more
257 years after Tayasal
A US-backed coup overthrows their democracy in 1954
That's exactly 257 years from when the Spaniards arrived at their shores
I'm getting to the core of the lesson
Lets see what happens in 2211
That's the next cycle, that people remember
Like 2012, the 21st of December
The consciousness may shift, you may turn the light
But you are the universe, you're gonna be alright
The pole may shift, your soul may lift
To higher consciousness but you know all this
The Edutainment style will persist
Forget the fear, it's knowledge that runs all this

I look down
Out my window
I see your face and your shadow
On the street below me

[Verse 1]
In room 34, in the third row
There sits a young brother and they call him Earl-O
There's a girl that Earl knows, also in the third row
And he wanna flirt, so he passes her dirty notes
Now she flirt back, even though every girl know
Earl-O popular, fuck taking girls home
So he asks her for her number, she said "somethin, somethin, 0"?
"Please call me after 7 cause my minutes very low"
So when the bell rang, the girl dip and hurry home
But Earl wanna follow, so he hopped in his Impala
Then he pulled up beside her on interior and chrome
He offered her a ride, "I'll take you where you wanna go"
She said "if you don't mind, I'm over there by ?"
She hopped up in the ride then he got his swerve on
They pulled up outside, he asked "were your parents home?"
She said "come inside, don't be nervous, we're alone"

[Hook]
I look down
Out my window
I see your face and your shadow
On the street below me

[Verse 2]
Now Earl called his homeboys, on his Chirp phone
Told 'em "come over" and no, he ain't let the girl know
Apartment 34, in the third door
To your left, there's a girl left on the dirty floor
She's staring at the ceiling as the ceiling fan blows
All the blood on her face at the tip of her nose
Her mama walk in like "what in the world's wrong?
Why you laying butt naked? Girl, where your clothes?"
But she ain't say nothing cause she just turned 14
The cuts hurt but her pride hurt mostly
Her mama pick her up and put her shirt on
Now she headed to the emergency room
She asked if dad was coming home from work soon
"Please promise me you ain't gon' tell a word to 'im"
It's just another day as the world moves
Moves, moves, moves, damn

[Hook]
I look down
Out my window
I see your face and your shadow
On the street below me

[Verse 3]
Well in room 34, on the third floor
There sits a sad family and they talking to the po
The cop ask her if she know if Earl-O sell dope
Then he get his information then he get back on patrol
When everybody leave, she go and lock the door
Then she walk up to the window while she standing in her robe
She open up the window then she write a little note
And take a deep breath and open it some more
She take her first step, her other foot on the floor
She hesitate a little but she know she wanna go
She look up at the sky then she look down at the road
And sing a little song and this is how it go

[Hook]
I look down
Out my window
I see your face and your shadow
On the street below me

[Intro]
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't, sex ain't better than love

[Verse 1]
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned
Every girl I gave my loving to was only a substitute
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned
Even though she's in my arms, this ain't where my heart belongs
Sex in the air, no loving here
Soon as I get through, I'm outta there
And it feels so bad, but it felt so good
Wishing I could care, girl, I never could
But then I fell into good love
Didn't let me touch the ground
Now I see it clear that your heart is there
And all these other women, they just can't compare, girl, I know

[Chorus]
Sex ain't better than love
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned that
Sex ain't better than love
I done seen it all, done done it all, so much better when you fall
Sex ain't better than love
Girl you've been my teacher and I've learned that
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't, sex ain't better than love

[Verse 2]
Feelings I thought that I would never have
Ooh, I'm so open and I got it bad
I got you now and I'ma make it last
She says my baby, she can't wait to have
Love in the air, never been so clear
So beautiful, bring your body here
Let me fall into good love
I wanna hear the lovely sound
Let me take my time while we in this bed
You were made for me and I don't wanna share, girl, I know

[Chorus]
Sex ain't better than love
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned that
Sex ain't better than love
I done seen it all, done done it all, so much better when you fall
Sex ain't better than love
Girl you've been my teacher and I've learned that
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't, sex ain't better than love

[Bridge]
Don't you ever leave
Baby girl, I need, need you love to breathe
Never been so clear to me
I was blinded but now I see because

[Chorus]
Sex ain't better than love
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned that
Sex ain't better than love
I done seen it all, done done it all, so much better when you fall
Sex ain't better than love
Girl you've been my teacher and I've learned that
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't, sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't better than love
Girl you've been my teacher and I've learned that
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't, sex ain't, sex ain't better than love

[Verse 1]
Need some cure for this disease
I’ve been cursed with L.U.V
My visions bleed, my memories, of all the times we spent
Now I’m left with only me, and my body’s feeling weak
I can’t believe I didn’t see, this moment come so fast

[Hook]
You’ve been swimming through my veins, veins, veins
I need a dream, dream, dream to cure the pain, pain, pain
I need that someone to replace, place, place
She needs to clear, clear, clear, my mental space
Now it’s over, baby girl it’s over
I need a cure, to wash my past, all away
Cause it’s over, my mistake to chose her
Need a cure, to wash the past, all away

[Verse 2]
I let your soul inside of me, and your pain refuse to leave
It’s hard to breathe when memories refuse to fade away
Won’t stop when you shut the door, all my life never think you'd go... go

[Hook]
You’ve been swimming through my veins, veins, veins
I need a dream, dream, dream to cure the pain, pain, pain
I need that someone to replace, place, place
She needs to clear, clear, clear, my mental space
Now it’s over, baby girl it’s over
I need a cure, to wash my past, all away
Cause it’s over, my mistake to chose her
Need a cure, to wash the past, all away

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want nobody more than you
Just want your body on this morning dew
I got these covers laying right for us
Ain't nobody looking, it's just mother nature watching us

[Verse 1]
I feel like tonight we should switch it up
No couch, no bed, no kitchen floor
Oh, can I take your body on a ride?
Take you to the park, then hit it on the slide
I basically, wanna do it to you outside
Top down with the stars looking inside
Always wanted to do you in the pool
And all night all our light is the moon

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want nobody more than you
I just want your body on this morning dew
I got these covers laying right for us
Ain't nobody looking, it's just mother nature watching us

[Chorus]
Outside, front seat of my car, underneath the stars
Let's make love outside, I don't really care, if anybody sees us
Making love, I want you to keep going baby
Making love, I don't care if they call us crazy
Outside, I don't even care, anyone can stare
While we're outside

[Verse 2]
If you catch someone looking all you gotta do is close your eyes
Girl, don't you say a peep, dig your nails into my spine
We can take it to the roof top baby
Or the elevator then take it to the roof top baby
With you on top baby, no need to be curious about what I'm gon' do
I wanna make your you know storm tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want nobody more than you
Just want your body on this morning dew
I got these covers laying right for us
Ain't nobody looking, it's just mother nature watching us

[Chorus]
Outside, front seat of my car, underneath the stars
Let's make love outside, I don't really care, if anybody sees us
Making love, I want you to keep going baby
Making love, I don't care if they call us crazy
Outside, I don't even care, anyone can stare
While we're outside

A little crazy, but you're amazing, you ain't scared to show your bad side
Ooh, baby, you're the one I want, the one I love

Then I'm right back for the sex, for the sex (Babey Drew, turn it up)

Don't nobody else make me mad as you
But when we making up though, I'm glad it's you

Tat tatted too ink like Kinkos
I put a dollar in the pot watch the pot grow
I pop up with the heat like hot toast
You would be psycho if you see what I knew
So keep your eyes closed and lower your IQ
I feel like two, they can judge me but there's no gaffle and stool
Only gospel can save you good music you're immune
I'm flu, sick my lyrics like puke

(Chorus)

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woo

[Verse 1]
Ruth Cris with them Juice Lips, XO you take two sips
Puff the dro, you take two hits, my show, you get four tickets
Three friends that you roll with, ya got little sisters that want pictures
Two seats, when I roll with ya, top back, let the wind hit ya
You know I'm the man round these parts here
You know, don't you know, if you need something, I’m here? Yeah
Baby meet me downtown, we gon' get your hair done
You say all your gas gone, I’m gon’ fill your tank up
Fill that piggy bank up, care 'bout no recession
While you second guessing, answer this one question

[Chorus]
Now when you with that other nigga, is you with a winner?
He don’t do it like I do
If you say I ain’t on yo mind when y’all spending time
Girl you telling lies, gon’ and testify
He don’t do the thangs, he don’t do the thangs no
He don’t do the thangs I do
Girl, you know he don’t hit it right, you living a lie
He don’t do the thangs I do

[Verse 2]
Penthouse suites for 'bout four weeks, private beach with them palm trees
You can buy it all in the Beverly, show you thangs, he’ll never see
Even let you drive my Bentley, though you love him
You, he don’t deserve
Listen, I’m the man round these parts here
You know you know that
Dont you know, if you need something, I’m here?
But let me ask you this one question

[Chorus]
When you with that other nigga, is you with a winner?
He don’t do it like I do
If you say I ain’t on yo mind when y’all spending time
Girl you telling lies, gon’ and testify
He don’t do the thangs, he don’t do the thangs no
He don’t do the thangs I do
Girl, you know he don’t hit it right, you living a lie
He don’t do the thangs I do

[Bridge]
I’m only here, to show how much I care
And I know you’re having second thoughts
About your love at home
You need to let that go
I’m tired of seeing you hurt and cry
When you know inside
He’ll never be the man that I'm, oh
He don’t, do the thangs, I do
He don’t

[Chorus]
When you with that other nigga, is you with a winner?
He don’t do it like I do
If you say I ain’t on yo mind when y’all spending time
Girl you telling lies, gon’ and testify
He don’t do the thangs, he don’t do the thangs no
He don’t do the thangs I do
Girl, you know he don’t hit it right, you living a lie
He don’t do the thangs I do
I do, I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I do, I do
When you with that other nigga, is you with a winner?
He don’t, do the thangs I do
Do, yeah, you know

[Verse 1]
See the rides pull in
And the place pack up
Only enter if you've got a dime
Saw a cutie on my right catching everybody's eye
Man nobodies going home tonight
She said she P-A-R-T-Y
Took a shot of 'trone left her worries on the side
And she down for whatever, everything anything but clever
Then the track starts to play

[Hook]
She started singing like woah oh
Ooo she started singing like woah oh
Everybody raise your cups in the sky
Take another hit getting high off of life
Screaming like woah oh
This is my song, this is my song

[Verse 2]
Now She's drinking all her problems like a god damn alcoholic
Ain't no way she is going to remember tonight
Shawty show me how you do it, hold your drink before you lose it
Panties dropping by the end of tonight
She say she P-A-R-T-Y
Took another shot now she is tripping on a guy
And she's down for whatever, ain't know way it gone be clever
Then the track starts to play

[Hook]
She started singing like woah oh
Ooo she started singing like woah oh
Everybody raise your cups in the sky
Take another hit getting high off of life
Screaming like woah oh

[Verse 3]
P-A-R-T-Y hear she got a twin on the side like fries
Her eyes are glowing, her mind is blowing
And they better look this good in the morning
Show off the pairs, better yet I got two
And you know they all loose with ru-ruffle tattoos
Call me mike myers I'mma kill this grey goose
I'mma take my last shot and we gonna make glue
Wipe the shit off the floor, don’t take off your shoes
Girl I got a sweet tooth I can bite you if you choose
And if I catch ya man I'mma swing like babe ruth
So it’d be best for him if you kept this on the low-que
I can beat that pussy up girl I can bruise you
And talk dirty in your ear like a Bluetooth
Girl put your worries in the pot add some water stir it up
And watch me make magic so long to tragic
And when we get to morning make it scramble like static

[Hook]
Woah oh, Woah oh
Everybody raise your cups in the sky
Take another hit getting high off of life
Screaming like woah oh
This is my song this is my song
Woah oh, woah oh
Everybody raise your cups in the sky, take another hit getting high off of life
Screaming like woah oh
This is my song this is my song
Baby, let's get faded
Hell yeah, get wasted
We can have a little fun
But you ain't my lady
She got a pretty little girl
But it ain't my baby
When I see her in the club
The girl drive me crazy

(Gucci Mane)
Man this shit get drastic
She bounced back like Magic
Pass by like Magic
She see my flying through traffic
It's Gucci Mane, you bastard
And I'm a known shoe-addict
Got em fallin out the attic
I'm a real hood classic
Zaytoven is nasty
Teamed up with V-Nasty
Came in a V-12
You ain't even gotta ask me
Hundreds falling out my safe
Hundreds falling out the case
Spent a Million on the case
Half a million on the bracelet
Quarter-mil for the anklet
Got her flexin on her famous
Money flying out the anus
My swag in Uranus
Baby you ain't my baby
But your swag something crazy
Yeah she got a little son
But it ain't my baby
Baby, let's get faded
Hell yeah, get wasted
We can have a little fun
But you ain't my lady

[Hook]

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I fuck her one time, then I cut her loose
I just like to win and I don't like to lose
Say the spot getting hot, we gonna have to move
Shaquille O'Neal couldn't fill my shoes
All I hang around this woman I don't like to lose
I done proved everything, it ain't nothin' to prove
Fuck a lot of hoes, rock a lot of jewels
Dikembe Mutumbo couldn't fill my shoes

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Got a girl from the city and she dance real pretty
Got a big fat ass and some nice round titties
Wanna fuck her downtown, call it sex in the city
She gone off Cïroc, I should thank P Diddy
She come around the town, say I'm always on her mind
And I swear I ain't never had a girl so fine
She want it, then I buy it, if I'm lyin', then I'm flyin'
When I drive it, she riding 'cause the girl so crazy
Amazing lady, she fascinating
So much that I call her the candy lady
Swag so sick like a cancer patient
She feel herself like she masturbating
Had a man with a 

[?] it's complicated
Bumpin' our heads like bumper cars
Making love to her every night
But I'll make her love 

[?]
Daytime, she's a soap opera
Nighttime she's a porn star
Put a LoJack on that bitch, man
Better cook that bitch with All Star
50 bottles in the crowbar
Now you see me on Worldstar
Brick Squad boss, I'm a living legend
You can call me a scrape mobster
It's Gucci!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I fuck her one time, then I cut her loose
I just like to win and I don't like to lose

I done proved everything, it ain't nothin' to prove
Fuck a lot of hoes, rock a lot of jewels
Dikembe Mutumbo couldn't fill my shoes

[Verse 2: V-Nasty]
If you want the bitch, I let the bitch choose
Don't give a fuck about the ho, cut the bitch loose
I'm solid though, so you know I won't lose
Gucci V-Nasty link up (Bitch), that's the truth
Leave a bitch broke (Nasty) like my tooth
He ain't even fucked the bitch, so I just take the juice
Bad bitches, they getting wasted
Lost my main bitch, so I had to replace it
I'm high now, lying in the spaceship
Y'all know damn well V-Nasty ain't racist
I'ma let y'all know, that's all just hatred
Turn your TV on, white girl, bitch, I'm the greatest (Nasty, bitch)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I fuck her one time, then I cut her loose
I just like to win and I don't like to lose
Say the spot getting hot, we gonna have to move
Shaquille O'Neal couldn't fill my shoes
All I hang around this woman I don't like to lose
I done proved everything, it ain't nothin' to prove
Fuck a lot of hoes, rock a lot of jewels
Dikembe Mutumbo couldn't fill my shoes

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Say the word, touchdown, let me drop a deuce
Hope this shit jump back, I don't like to lose
Got like 75,000 dollars in my Trues
Worth 8 mill', but I got the county blues
Hit my head a couple times, I don't like to lose
Won't be a broke ass nigga, man, I just refuse
And I don't fuck one girl, I fuck them by the 2's
I buy my cars brand new, I don't like 'em used
I'm tryna tell you how to get it, you don't have a clue
Slap a nigga in his face 

[?]
CEO of the company, but don't wear a suit
And if you all about the lute, fuck it, I salute, Gucci!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I fuck her one time, then I cut her loose
I just like to win and I don't like to lose
Say the spot getting hot, we gonna have to move

I done proved everything, it ain't nothin' to prove
Fuck a lot of hoes, rock a lot of jewels
Dikembe Mutumbo couldn't fill my shoes

[Intro - Gucci Mane]
My neck and wrist coolin' and the champagne coolin'
I know you wanna fuck me baby girl who you foolin
I know you wanna fuck me baby girl who you foolin'
My neck and wrist coolin', and champagne coolin'
My swag so sick major labels try to clone it
My swag so sick major labels try to clone it

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
I get money regardless
Say I'm one of the sharpest
Pull up just to park my jewelry game
And my cars are retarded
I walk around with a sharpie
I throw my top in the garbage
Say i’m Gucci Mane, when they hear my name
They pull out the red carpet
That’s your girlfriend charge it
I got her rolling with the heartless
Is she only like me ‘cause I talk good game
And my watch cost a fortune

[Hook - Gucci Mane]

[Verse 2 - V-Nasty]
Said it’s V-Nasty, I’m with Gucci girl
I put you in a scene and let you pop that coochie girl
Let’s make a movie, it gets juicy girl
Ain't gone touch it but you know that juice will sell
I’m in ATL, with ounces on the scale
I’m a bitch but I rock like a male
Last place you gonna see me is in a cell
Got a room full of bitches in a five-star hotel
I’m with my rollers so you know we on
Ain't down with the bitch til the money gone
If you ain't’ got racks don’t hit my phone
A bitch that's broke gone be left alone

[Hook - Gucci Mane]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
When I’m alone
Smoking weed, sitting by the window in my home
Often thinking why the fuck is it I’m not in Rome
If I had a little motivation, money, and a hot body
I see it now, Bronson, the heart-throbby
No more pigging out, binging on the late night
No more sneaking juice in the syringe to get the game tight
No more pack of hot dogs on my neck right by the fade right
40 pounds to go and then you hookers getting laid right
I’m eating salad but I’m leaving off the croutons
'Cause ever since a youth your dog's huskier than UConn
Savings on the cookies, mommy clipping out the coupons
Passing out from over-eating, sleeping on the futon
Lock the refrigerator, there’s no controlling me
Steak and chocolate got they muthafuckin hold on me
Ain’t trying to be laid in a box, roses on me
Bronsolino running 5 miles for the glory

[Bridge]
Lets go, 20 more to go baby boy
Yo you want that V by the crotch right?
Yeah lets go (I want it)
Gimme some pushups
Gimme some dips (I can’t no more)
Let me get some jumping jacks (Gimme a sandwich!)
Yeah you want that steak dinner don’t you? (AAAAH)
Your gonna work that sandwich off now (I need marshmallows!)
Yeah lets fuckin go
20 more miles, lets go you fat fuck
(AH MARSHMALLOWS, GIVE IT TO ME)
You motherfucker, you, fuck you!

[Verse 2]
From philly cheesesteaks, lobsters on the barbeque
I’m getting twisted eating chicken with a prostitute
An hour later eat the burger with my drug dealer
Then add the butter to the fudge to make the fudge realer
Every five minutes look in the fridges as if magic happened
Sneak a cookie, rip the bag, and fix the plastic wrapping
I don’t want know one to know that I took it
Cause I'm an over-eater (Ay yo ock, ay yo ock, fry the mayonnaise for me, man)
Life is a smorgasbord to me and I’ma over do it
I wanna wear Italian clothing but it just don’t cut it
Not the type that show the package with the crystal studded
The shit they model in Milan that’s looking crispy custom
5 and 6 bitches, lickin’ my dick twitches
Serve up a facial, Mister Belding, bitches dismiss ‘em
For now I’ll take what I can get till this shit switches
Whatever fuck you stupid bitch
Peace to the Drums of Heaven
Peace to beef ribs
Extended lunch time I eat enough for three kids
Go on a diet, then fall off because I’m weak kid
Since I was young I’m eatin’ candy on the sneak tip
My day is based upon fine drugs, cholesterol
Though at my height and weight im probably still the best at ball
I’m tatted up, I have no shame to show the chest at all
I bet I have your lady humming on my testicles

[Outro]
Yeah, Bronsolino
Bout to be fuckin, summer time in the winter
Shirtless
S'Gucci! Ziggy!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Well my trap house be bunking hard all the time
Money sticking out my pockets like a porcupine
I hope this cocaina cross the borderline
I made a million dollars just with this lil fork of mine
I'm in the kitchen whippin deuces up like half the time
The other half the time I'm busy somewhere on the grind
Any ? trappin 9 days
Don't give a fuck about what they say, my nigga: crime pays
Gucci! Twenty thousand in singles but I tossed it
I used to have a top but then I lost it
I used to have a conscience but I lost it
I boss so hard that I'm exhausted! It's Gucci!

More, more
Hate me some fuckin more!
I love it when you hate me
It make my money grow

[Verse 2: V-Nasty]
Where my money? I think it's on that new shit
On my fucking block I ain't never gotta prove shit
Every time you see me, you know I'm rocking new shit
I got a new whip off of a new bitch
Shit I do this, you know what the truth is
Bitch ain't like me cause I'm cocky and I'm ruthless
The bitch is bummy, no money, she is useless
I got them fuckin choppers that'll really go through shit
Hold up, I'm way better than the average
In my city, I ain't nothing but a savage
So many cars, garage look like traffic
When I pull my whips out, you know I'm causing damage

(Hook)

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I'm a quarterback, I take a quarter out
And but a quarter back and help harvest that
It's that ice attack when I rob my chain
When the girls see me, catch a heart attack
Told her scrubbin, that's a well-known fact
? what you know about that?
Kill the ho, where your hoes at?
Nigga, beef with me, now how smart was that?
I'm goin in like a curfew
Like yesterday you old news
In the studio with chrome tools
No engineers, them pistols
I should walk around with toilet tissue
Til the end time bring ?

[Intro - Mystikal]
I'm a political refugee
That's how the fuck I felt

[Hook - Birdman]
Birds for the summer
Hummers for the runners
Candy on the paint
Nine for the thunder
Throw a couple of hundreds
Fishing on the fishtail
With big money, cash money everywhere
High roller, shot caller, big boss
Original, real nigga from the start
Head hunting, price on a nigga tab
Hit ‘em up for playing with a nigga mail

[Mystikal]
Say I’m better than Beethoven
To the beat that I rap over
Stay outta that medicine cabinet
Yeah, that what they told me
Giving us piss tests, cause we stay rolling
And know a nigga act better than a .45 caliber pistol when they loaded
They penalize us, tryna slow us down
They constantly fucking us up
That's why we’re buck wild
Call me porch monkey, call me jigaboo
When you know you wanna fuck my woman and eat my barbecue
How the fuck you wanna watch my house
But don’t wanna live on my street
The ape man taught Tarzan -- how the fuck you better than me?
Rap, I run that rock, and got a jump shot
Who we got that black wife up in that White House
I took my lick and didn’t sell out
I was in the bing, I didn’t bail out
Hoping motherfucker run and fail out
Back to the top from the jail house
Lace ‘em up, tie ya shoe
Catch a cut, you know what pressure do

[Hook]

[Mystikal]
Who out chea fucking with me, huh? Tell me that
I’m bout to drop that shit, where my Pamper at?
Try to answer that, or give me my mantle back
I bury you cockroaches, shoulda left me where I was at
You done made that fucking bed
You done built this fucking castle
Buckwheat and his friend Alfalfa
Couldn't do nothing with this little rascal
I wonder licking retarded
Yeah nigga what the hell
Talking baby business, yeah
Yeah bitch, dumb shit
Don’t be fucking with me
Cause you won't get off easy
I feel just like Drew Brees
When they kick off football season
How I cut the ref, you can’t stop from bleeding
Rappers betta leave me alone
If they gon’ keep on breathing
Now keep on starving and I’mma gonna keep on eating
And you keep on sucking, and I’mma keep on skeeting
Nigga, you gon be the one bussing or be the one fleeing
Nigga better keep on trucking
You don't want no fucking trouble this evening

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
Uh, ain't it crazy how shit be
Thats why I flush it
I got the Tommy gun with the drum
Thats percussion
I just popped a couple pain pills, self destruction
I made something out of nothing, thanks for nothing
I pistol whip you pussies, knock her out Robitussin
Ran up in your house, killed everybody, no discussion
Rep, that muthafucking red flag like a Russian
Yeah, look, I told her baby I’m a thrasher
We kissed, I lit her ass up than I ashed her
No hard feelings, no card dealing, but I shuffle my queen
Duffle bag too heavy to carry to the car
My Mary in a jar
I’m food, I let the haters add a little salt
Thats cool, I do it for all the niggas that try
And all the bitches I’ve fucked, and all my niggas that died
Tunechi

[Hook]

[Verse 1]

Message Erased

[Intro]
See when I do joints like this
I do it for the youngin' in the ghetto
That ..never hear story ‘cause he gonna make it to tell you
See you know what’s crazy
I want to court all the day the DA say she hate me
How you gonna hate me when me and Lu just took twenty racks
And put coast on them kids back
It’s 30 degrees outside

[Verse]
Twenty-four how could I ask for more
I got my deal it's getting real I'm making cash for sure
Stuntin every chance I get because I had it poor
But every time I go to sleep I hear the devil at my door
And I'm on them papers so them courts I'm going back and forth
Dealing with probation man they all said I'll be back for sure
Mommies turn to zombies from that raw because it's crack galore
You wonder why them babies running crazy steady clapping off
Getting life before they get pussy
Cuz ain't nobody love 'em so they lives get tooken
Locked in cages have 'em fighting over cookies
And lunch trays, just happy them days ain't never kill me
Yea I remember, it was a hot December
Niggas dieing top of winter cuz them kids need them toys
But Santa Claus don't see the boys or see them girls around here
There's jack boys downstairs
No man with the big bag just man with the big gat
Tryna take his shit back cuz he feel the world owe him
And his daughter want a Barbie bike for Christmas
He gon show her
That the love is there, no mother there
Just her and little brother there
We wash our pain with Belvedere
And use the drugs they brung us here
We get high to get by, hot dogs no rib eyes
Where tears drip from red eyes
Where ends don't meet the deadlines
The D.A. said she hate me but I don't understand
When I just rocked a show in front of fifty thousand fans
I think that bitch racist she probably in The Klan
She take her pain out on me but she probably need a man
I took my mom from public housing, put her in the sticks
We came a long way from welfare and getting W.I.C
That shit just made me hungry and now we getting rich
And all these niggas getting sick
I know they wanna get me hit cuz I'm ballin
Yea, cuz I'm ballin

[Outro]
That bitch say she hate me I felt some type of way about that
Last night we just came out giving three hundred pay
She was just at the schools to the girls and the boys basketball teams
Why you hate me, you hate me ‘cause i’m doing and i’m supposed to
And i’m making more money than you
But bitch you can hate me for that
Let’s get it

[Wiz:]
High school nigga

Hook:

Bags are packed, posted by the cafeteria
Eatin on a snack, boy I make it crack-a-lack
Days goin to my nights, live a young wild life
King of the zoo
Devin what it do
Knockin all trees down, Devin and Mac with the sac
Rollin up with knees down, baby girl ease down
It's a holiday, we smokin pot today
I got alot to say, I keep it locked away
That's how it is
Dealin with the pressures of my school life
Livin on the edge, joints to the head
And so the man said...

[Hook:]
I keep one rolled yeah I'm always puffin
Yea I stay baked cause nigga I love it
Had nothing but now we stuntin'
Tell em roll something cause nigga it's nothn
Niggas gettin mad cause my pockets swollen
And everywhere I go yea I'm loaded

[Intro]
Songbook baby
I'd like to than Mr. Bryan-Michael Cox for helping me illustrate my feelings
This is getting too hot baby, this is getting too hot baby
This the last time, it's the last chapter
But for real, this is gotta be the last time
It's gon' be the best though, promise
Just one last time

[Verse 1]
'Cause if she catch me with you, she gon' kill us
These hotel rooms is looking too familiar
Your love is so, so serious
Girl, you keep me coming back that is
I be with her thinking of you
I be with you thinking of her, my boo
She just don't deserve this
Ain't nobody perfect but I just can't take no more 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm living two different lives
One girl in the day, you at night
And even though this ain't right
I just can't get enough of the way you put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
Girl for the last time
Yep I said the last time
Girl, this is the last time
All caught up  and it's time to put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
This the last time

[Verse 2]
See the problem is I'm too deep involved
To be playing with your emotions, you really got me open
I gotta figure it out, can't let no pussy come before my baby
Not my baby, no
'Cause she's the only one that ease my mind
But girl, you just so fine, give it to me one last time
Baby, let your hair down, take it to the bed now
Spread them lovely legs now, one last round

[Chorus]
I'm living two different lives
One girl in the day, you at night
And even though this ain't right
I just can't get enough of the way you put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
Girl for the last time
Yep I said the last time
Girl, this is the last time
All caught up and it's time to put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
This the last time

[Bridge]
Let me see you take off your clothes for the last time
Let's keep this thing on the low for the last time
Tell me how you wanna get it, I know your favorite is the kitchen
From the way I used to kiss it, girl, I know you're gonna miss it
But there's only one condition, baby, please don't fuss
Don't be tripping, keep it pimping
Baby girl, let's just make love
I'm living two different lives

[Chorus]
I'm living two different lives
One girl in the day, you at night
And even though this ain't right
I just can't get enough of the way you put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
Girl for the last time
Yep I said the last time
Girl, this is the last time
All caught up and it's time to put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
This the last time
I'm living two different lives
One girl in the day, you at night
And even though this ain't right
I just can't get enough of the way you put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
Girl for the last time
Yep I said the last time
Girl, this is the last time
All caught up and it's time to put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
This the last time

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
If I asked to kiss ya
Would you say yes or turn and walk away, oh baby?
See I must admit, girl
'Cause all the crazy things that go through my head
Whoa, oh-oh, nah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
It seemed just like the perfect move at the time
For me to make you mine
Girl, you sexy from head to toe
You said you think we should wait a while
And it might be hard, but

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
But I won't complain
You could've been anywhere else but you're here with me, oh yeah
We can travel to space
And as long as I got you right here next to me, I'm straight
No-o-o-o-o
Girl, I'll wait fo-or, for you, yes, I will
You kno-o-o-ow I said I'll wait for you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I just wanna love ya
Lord knows that I can't wait for the day in love
I said I must admit, girl (Girl)
Baby, I swear I'll do whatever it takes to keep you here with me

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
It seemed just like the perfect move at the time
For me to make you mine
Girl, you sexy from head to toe
You said you think we should wait a while
Girl, it might be hard, but

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
But I won't complain (No, no, I won't, girl)
You could've been anywhere else but you're here with me, oh yeah
We can travel to space (Oh, no-no-no-no)
And as long as I got you right here next to me, I'm straight (Yeah)
No-o-o-o-o
Girl, I'll wait fo-or, for you, yes, I will
You kno-o-o-ow I said I'll wait for you

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
It's been a while and we both know that I've been patient, girl
'Cause you ain't been tryna give it up, no

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
But I won't complain (Yeah, yeah)
You could've been anywhere else but you're here with me, oh yeah
We can travel to space
And as long as I got you right here next to me, I'm straight
No-o-o-o-o
Girl, I'll wait fo-or, for you, yes, I will (Ooh)
You kno-o-o-ow I said I'll wait for you

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

[Chorus]
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

[Verse 2]
Under haunted skies, I see you, ooh
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

[Chorus]
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
Turning tables

[Bridge]
Next time, I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
When the thunder calls for me
Next time, I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
Standing on my own two feet

[Chorus]
I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

[Outro]
Turning tables, yeah
Turn, no, no-oh, mmm

[Verse 1]
When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any sins
I had no idea of the state we were in

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head

[Chorus]
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

[Verse 2]
When was the last time that you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head

[Chorus]
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

[Bridge]
Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you'd find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

[Chorus]
Why don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

[Outro]
When will I see you again?

[Verse 1]
You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows
Why it's taken me so long
To let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine

[Chorus]
I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
Promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

[Verse 2]
Have I been on your mind?
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name?
Will I ever know
How it feels to hold you close?
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine

[Chorus]
I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mmm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

[Bridge]
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it) I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it) I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it) I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it) I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

[Chorus]
So, I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

[Outro]
Come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

[Intro: Drake]
Ladies and Gentlemen
We are now broadcastin live from London England

[Verse 1: Drake]
Back then it was me plus you, we us two did every single thing that we must do
You trust me, me trust you, plus there's no one else that I see just you
Now a days I'm riding on the bandwagon driver of a porche caiyan wagon
Ice in the necklace light skinned and hectic and all these simple things got a man braggin
And boastin a little never drank much in the past but now they got the kid toastin a little
So cheers to the fact you here in the track you shoulda been shotgun his career in the back
And his two month lease expires right now knew I shoulda got me a truck with two front seats I assume it's
Done I'm lookin at my passenger side I realize that there's room for one oh

[Chorus: Voyce]
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
Cause I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back

[Verse 2: Drake]
Now a days you be all cried out no more tears no more planes cause you all flyed out
Need the lord in your life on a Sunday no more fashion nomore spendin your life on the runway
Deal with it you hardly can all this hype around Drake whatever happened to Aubrey Graham
Well it's her he’s needin you gotta say leave in the word but I know leavin has crossed your mind
You jealous of some autographs I often sign I try to make it to dinner never often time
But I often find myself hearin your voice you said you never felt a touch soft as mine
I was sayin how the range and the loft is mine had to change in the planes and the porche is mine
It's a deal I was forced to sign but I never imagined that youd end up fourth in line no

[Verse 3: Voyce]
Shes got a feelin lonely (feelin lonely)
Like she don't even know me (don't even know me)
I thought that she would be the one for me but now I see that
If I could turn back the hands of time she would be mine
You’re on my mind girl let's rewind it back

[Bridge: Drake]
Look this for that girl that you use to see for anybody that want it how it use
To be all the love afection and all the cash I wanna rewind but we movin forward fast

[Chorus: Voyce]
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
Cause I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back

[Verse 4: Drake]
And I adore all the pictures that everyone in the media is dyin for
Back when there was one camera to smile for
There was only couple things I could buy you compared to now where I'm kinda like heres a thou
Drop grands through appear in style but I could still be chillin in sweat pants and a stainless ring
Without you I havnt gained a thing oh

[Chorus: Voyce]
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
Cause I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back

[Intro]
I’m just smokin a trippy stick on this one
OG Hash Oil

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Roll a joint, roll another one
When it's all said and done
I'll be at the top bitch
Cause I hustle a lot
Them cars, we pulling 'em off the lot
Don't even test drive it before I cop
Just boarded a yacht
We're at the craps table in Vegas
The dealer saying how he admiring my watch
I'm placing my wager
Don't even care how much paper I blow
Cause how to get this money and stay on
A couple things that I know
I'm blowing that stink by the O
My weed so strong I swear to god you would think it's cologne
I go anywhere in the world and just make it my home
Staying at the highest level but I ain’t make it alone
Now that my money right them suckers keep thinking I'm wrong
But I'm just switching lanes, foot off the brake and I'm gone
If you ain't talking money homie, you can't get a call
Cause this a muthafuckin life that you can't live at all
I'm getting high while I drive, I ain't thinking of y'all...

[Hook]
I just wanna ride in my ride with my top down
And smoke weed with my niggas
I just wanna ride in my ride with my top down
And smoke weed with my niggas

[Verse 2]
Still rolling weed on my XXL
Only difference is that's me on the cover
Once in a while call my little sister and tell her I love her
Cause shit can get crazy in this industry
Most of your friends become your enemies
That's why I stay down with the ones that's been with me
The niggas who started and they down to ride to the end with me
Make sure the positive energy keep flowing
All the weed keep rolling
And all of us keep getting high, the sky
We gonna keep from falling
Niggas keep hating, but baby I'mma keep ballin'
A lot of y'all turned fake, cause you found out what I make
Now I'm buying estates
Going on private island vacations
Flying on private planes
I'm cool with the pilot, he let me roll something
Put on a movie, let my girl watch it
At the dealer, high, lookin' at that Ferrari options
Just an everyday life, when you young and bossin'

[Hook]
I just wanna ride in my ride with my top down
And smoke weed with my niggas
I just wanna ride in my ride with my top down
And smoke weed with my niggas

[Interview: Wiz Khalifa]
It's a cohesive thing
But the focus is still getting my thing out there
And to have people understand
This is the world that we're creating
And it doesn't exist without all of us

[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
'Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"

[Pre-Chorus]
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

[Breakdown]
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you
Please don't be in love (Ooh)
With someone else
Please don't have somebody (Ooh, hey)
Waiting on you

[Chorus]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless (Please don't be in love with someone else)
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck (Please don't have somebody waiting on you)
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever (Please don't be in love with someone else)
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Outro]
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you

[Verse 1: Drake]

[Outro: Uness]

Baby everybody love a Summer day. But can you trade the sun for just a Rainy day ? in the Darkest hour would love find its way ?

[Refrain]
Its been a long time coming and the clock says a quarter to 4
I'm feeling like its now or never and your body's telling me its a go
So what are we doing? What are we doing here?
What are we doing? What are we doing here?
What are we doing? What are we doing here?
What are we doing? What are we doing here?
What are we doing?

[Verse 1]
On a late night weekend showcase event
Kinda liked you at first but I noticed your friend
So I got my folk to approach both of them
And they both came over and poured up some Hen
And we ain't say much but we spoke
Cause you don't have to speak when you know
Their eyes said to me "Systems go"
Its about that time we should go
So allow me to flow as I propose a toast
To the good life, on a good night we go, grab a bottle and go
Tell her hold on, yes a beautiful night, colorful Kodak photo
But as soon as you enter the room I guess you froze

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Its the end of the week but the first of the month
When the moon gets full but the night is still young
With a crowd like this you dont know where you'll end up
So I just play it cool like the cubes in my cup
Huh...but then you came through tryna body me up
And I ain't know what you was thinkin' but your eyes said enough
And everything we felt was obviously lust
Which I thought was kinda cool I ain't gonn' bluff
But look at the clock its about time that I duck
Outta the door dont mean to be in a rush but later
You can hit me up so you hit me up shoes at the door
Smoke in the air, temperature's up
But I guess when the lights went out it froze you up

[Refrain]
Come follow me and take my hand now
Out of body and in a state of mind
But, beat is taking over my—
And this is my favorite part, part, part
I need it here, and hear it louder now
Tell the DJ turn it up
This can be addictive, I know, I don't want it to stop, stop
'Cause I'm not ready to go, go
Now let the beat drop

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tonight it's you and me,  glad you like to disagree
This ain't all in my mind
Spinning slowly, need you to pull me closely
We'll party till morning time
I need you to push me up higher
Push me up higher, turn me up louder
Turn me up, t-turn me up
Push me up higher, push me up higher, turn me up louder
Turn me up, turn me up

[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
I don't wanna stop, stop, don't wanna stop
I got a smile on my face now, 'cause the DJ's playing what I wanna hear now
And he better not stop, oh
Baby, won't you come along and take my hand
Spin me around, take me to the ground, ground, oh ground
And tell me how the sounds, sounds, sounds, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tonight it's you and me, glad you like to disagree
This ain't all in my mind
Spinning slowly, need you to pull me closely
We'll party till morning time
I need you to push me up higher
Push me up higher, turn me up louder
Turn me up, t-turn me up
Push me up higher, push me up higher, turn me up louder
Turn me up, turn me up

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Can you feel the beat, it's making me lose control
Going out my mind babe, you know
I don't wanna leave the dancefloor, whoa, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tonight it's you and me, glad you like to disagree
This ain't all in my mind
The room is spinning slowly, need you to pull me closely
We'll party till morning time
I need you to push me up higher
Push me up higher, turn me up louder
Turn me up, t-turn me up
Push me up higher, push me up higher, turn me up louder
Turn me up, turn me up

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, What up y'all? Yeah
Soundtrakk, what's popping baby?
If y'all ain't know
I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representing that First and Fifteenth, yeah, uh
And this one right here, I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying? Legally and illegally, haha
You know what I'm talking about?
So, check it out, uh

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week, he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, uh
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick
And push
And coast
Uh, uh, uh

[Break: Drake]
What up, Lupe?
Chi-Town, check

[Verse 2: Drake]
My style is very Tennessee mixed with some Terry Kennedy
People barely remember me from back in the day
I done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
The time it took me to get cool was a massive delay, but check
It gets boring growing up in Memphis
Tryna become a pro, but keep showing up apprentice
Mama probably would've done anything to prevent this
Cause every single time I break a board, it gets expensive
Luckily, my aunt workin' as a nurse
So every time I needed something, she just reach up in her purse
And plus, she'd always give me speeches on the first
If I'm stayin' in her house, then I need to get some work
I tell her I was there on vacation
She said, "You need to be doing something other than skatin'
Why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?
I'mma let him know that you comin', honey, he's waitin'"
So now, it's me in old school checkered plaid
Playing chess, looking through some old school record ads
He knew I didn't really wanna post here
Opened up the window and told me that the coast clear
And now I coast clear, take a deep breath
Feeling like the Pope's here, homie, this is recess
This is each test life's ever given me
A-plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
Yes, I'm literally Larnell Lewis with a
Kick and a snare, a kickflip in the air
The kid's sick denim jeans, put a rip in a pair
Just so the space ain't restricted in here, breathe again
Think it's obvious that they need my soul
My cousin's after Doe, like re-mi-fa-so
I said, "Auntie, this is a safe career"
She said, "Drake, I told you there was no skatin' here"

[Hook: Drake]
So I kick, push Kick, push
Kick, push Kick, push Coast
Fast as the wheels replaced
I gotta find another hobby just to fill the space
So I kick, push
Kick, push Kick, push
Kick, push Coast
Peep the way I roll
Just a rebel, lookin' for a place to go
So I kick Then push
And coast

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, yeah
Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said "There's no skating here"

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick, uh, uh
And push, yeah, yeah
And coast
Ah ha, Swanky

[Intro]
K.E. on the track

[Verse 1]
Uh, sneak peek through the window panes
Girls all aboard this Young Money train
Haven't since fame, shit'll never be the same
The world want a show, so I'ma be the stage
Dim the lights, listen to what I'm gon' say
Got a fanbase, nigga, fuck what a hater say
They sleep all day, I'm up early though
Scrollin' through the phone, watchin' videos (Videos)
Not much competition though ('Tition though)
I mean of course just the same old
Bitches in plain clothes
Playin' the same roles
Rentals of Lambos
Bend over, bitch, gettin' one
You know how game goes (Game goes)

[Pre-Chorus]
Shame on all these models (Models)
But I'ma still buy all these bottles (Bottles)
You got a lot to learn, young man
Life is your only friend, one day you'll understand

[Chorus]
If I ever get the chance to say hi (Hi)
Probably wave goodbye at the same time
They say I'm movin' too fast (Too fast, too fast)
They say I'm movin' too fast (Too fast, too fast)
Couple good drinks, Patrón with the ice (Ice)
Come to my suite, baby, you could spend the night
Say you movin' too fast (Too fast, too fast)
She said I'm movin' too fast (Too fast, too fast)
(So slow it down)

[Verse 2]
Y'all be gossipin' more than the barbershop
Walked up in the shop, errybody lookin' shocked
Why all the talkin' stop?
Maybe 'cause I was the one bein' talked about
Lookin' at your face
I can tell you don't know what this money 'bout
Four accounts, can't bounce, nigga, check the amount
I took a pill, gettin' drowsy now
Gotta finish this verse, can't write it down
Early flight, now I'm out of town
Freakin' out, all I see is clouds
Hawaii lookin' nice, man
Why every time I leave L.A. it's an earthquake?
Why every time I leave home bitches thirsty?

[Pre-Chorus]
Sayin' she be with a nigga all night (All night)
Tellin' her friends I'm the only girl that he like (That he like)
You got a lot to learn, young man
To all your loyal fans, I hope they understand

[Chorus]
If I ever get the chance to say hi (Hi)
Probably wave goodbye at the same time
They say I'm movin' too fast (Too fast, too fast)
They say I'm movin' too fast (Too fast, too fast)
Couple good drinks, Patrón with the ice (Ice)
Come to my suite, baby, you could spend the night
Say you movin' too fast (Too fast, too fast)
She said I'm movin' too fast (Too fast, too fast)
(So slow it down)

[Interlude]
Yo, T, wassup? This your uncle, D, man
Just the chance to call and check on you, my nigga
Shit, you know 'bout this game, man
Mad respect for the homies, man
You see all these cats movin', man
Wanna thank you for everything
Shit, out the game, fact
This shit moves slow, man
Let it continue, man, you ain't gotta run to it
Shit, you a child, homeboy
Holla at me

[Chorus]
If I ever get the chance to say hi (Hi)
Probably wave goodbye at the same time
They say I'm movin' too fast (Too fast, too fast)
They say I'm movin' too fast (Too fast, too fast)
Couple good drinks, Patrón with the ice (Ice)
Come to my suite, baby, you could spend the night
Say you movin' too fast (Too fast, too fast)
She said I'm movin' too fast (Too fast, too fast)
(So slow it down)

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Opening doors like an answer key, I make the life answer to me, no fantasy
An evil genius, I leave my mark of the beast on the beat
Actually, I'm all like a natural disaster, I make you a causality
Added up, mathematically, putting numbers up, like 23
And I'm Manning up like Peyton be, game is over, I should take a knee
And bow out gracefully, even if you look me in my eyes
See you wouldn't be facing me
So what the fuck is pain to me?
And what the hell is rain to me?
My life is very impressionable, like a Van Gogh painting be
Call me Vincent inside the dimension, that's my mantra
Listen there is no competition, the mission's conquered
Did I mention? These girls at my concert, addicted, no double entendre
Which is why I'm colder than a tundra on Christmas, put your hands up, can I get a witness?

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Why kill? the dark side's where I live
Horny devils in a red dress and high heels
You don't have an idea how many niggas done took my ideas
I take flight, I'm so bright, I don't even get no light bill
You road kill while I'm driving
I'm high-fiving, my dime riding, My time shining
From at the club and I'm outta town but I'm lying around it
Deuce chains I'm feng shui, everyday is my birthday
2 gats at the park, you don't wanna see these guns play
Patron and lemon lime, I got her back, all in her spine
I look my wife up in the eyes, and I think about  another dime
My atmosphere is ratchet here this right here is Bally gear and
I keep on killing shit
And I don't even have no tatted tear
You can put the motherfucker Caddie here
You can put the motherfucker Beemer there
Still got 2 more garage places, Louies on I unlaced it
Every verse I'm going crazy, every girl it's going crazy
2 guns, 2 chains, 2 rings, 2 bracelets

[Instrumental Solo]

[Intro]
Hey, this is for my girls
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
I do the same thing
Be in the party every weekend
But tonight it's just a little bit different
I love to bang bang
And all these shawties got me feeling
Like they wanna do the same thing with me
Double take, it's two of 'em looking at me
Like they ready to leave
I can't explain it 'cause I ain't even ready to leave
But they pressuring me

Girl, I can hear you thinking, hear you thinking out loud
I can hear you thinking, hear you thinking out loud, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Y'all must be on one
One too many shots of Henny got you hella touchy feely on each other
I'm 'bout to go dumb
And I can tell what you been thinking
Reading your bodies like closed captions
Loud and clear, sound so sexy to me
Shawty, if you agree, let's get out of here
Y'all ain't even got to say a damn thing
'Cause I can tell

[Pre-Chorus]
They want me to tap that (Yeah)
And I can feel them all over me
Or maybe it's just all in my head (Oh, woah)
But if you want it, girl, I'm good for it
Good for it, come on, come on

[Bridge]
Ladies, we can slip right out the back door
So we can get into some wild things
All that Patron got you loose huh, loose, huh
Let's head back to my place
Not thinking Nicki but ménage
You want it now and I can't wait
Y'all gon' make me love you tonight (Oh, woah, woah)

[Chorus]
I know what you're saying (I know, girl), I'm feeling it too (I feel it)

Motherfuck my opponent, started with a vision and a nigga got on it
Met success and a introduced it to my homies, now every single girl in the room gon want us
(x2)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Hell yeah I hope they hearing us
Imma want the beef, broccoli, and asparagus
Tell them rich folks they can couple up a chair with us
They can sure brag , but I know they can't embarrass us
And motherfuck the opposition (fuck) your bitch wanna make a proposition
Remember when a nigga barely had a pot to piss in, now I'm on my paper
Mr. Composition (what, what?) Excuse me, What? Competition? What?
To me that word is non- existent
And he sound like uhhhhhhh
Quit comparing me bitch
Fuck you with a Ron Jeremy dick
Hell yeah I'm apparently pissed, sonnin' niggas
I could give a parenting tip, I'm too good to really care about shit
Cause I'm young with money like I inherited it, biotchh

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: Tyga]

Get a buzz, champagne and club in the dusk
Wonder on top of the drums before the ambiance
Trying to get the sun involved, reflect on these hoes
No mirrors, my vision is simply through carrera gold
What's your goals when your interests ain't the (?)
Synopsis flow
I give it as the story go
Legion of Doom the superheroes have entered the room
Everyone move, everyone move, except for the Betty Boops
I'm Coming for you
Reservation at pussy pool, let's make it for two
Amateur addict get this long dick stamina
IChat the camera
Screw faced and hammer her
Can't touch it if it's funk
That R&B and bitches say they won't
Hip-hop around '94 'til my soul (?)
Ante up, like M.O.P., fuck your thoughts
It's GED, Young Money until the casket drop

[Hook] (x2)
Motherfuck my opponent (x2)

[Hook] (x2)

[Intro]

I get it cracking like a bad back
Bitch talking she the queen when she looking like a lab rat
I'm Angelina, you Jennifer
C'mon, bitch, you see where Brad at?

[Refrain]
Ice my wrist-es, then I piss on bitches
You could suck my diznick if you take these jizzes
You don't like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah, they know what this is, give bitches the business

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I pull up and I'm stuntin' but I ain't a stuntman
Yes, I'm rockin' Jordans, but I ain't a jumpman
Bitches play the back, 'cause they know I'm the frontman
Put me on a dollar, 'cause I'm who they trust in
Ayo, SB, what the fuck's good?
We ship platinum, them bitches is shippin' wood
Them nappy headed hoes, but my kitchen good
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish a bitch would

[Chorus]
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho

You could suck my diznick if you take these jizzes
You don't like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah, they know what this is, give bitches the business

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I pull up in the Porsche, but I ain't de Rossi
Pretty bitches only could get in my posse
Yes, my name is Roman, last name is Zolanski
But no relation to Roman Polanski
Hey, yo, Baby Bop, fuck you and your EP

[Bridge]
Stupid hoes is my enemy, stupid hoes is so wack
Stupid ho shoulda befriended me, then she coulda prolly came back
Stupid hoes is my enemy, stupid hoes is so wack
Stupid ho shoulda befriended me, then she could've probably came back
You a stupid ho, you a stupid ho

And I ain't hit that note, but fuck you stupid ho, just fuck you stupid ho
I said fuck a stupid ho, just fuck a stupid ho
I said fuck a stupid ho, just fuck a stupid ho
I said fuck a stupid ho, just fuck a stupid ho

[Outro]
I am the female Weezy
It is not good enough, it is not good enough
It is not good enough, it is not good enough

Nah, I was good enough for the shows and good enough to rock 'em
Good enough for people in the projects to college
That bump my shit, say my shit
Not good enough for radio to play my--
Said not good enough for the hood, too hood for Hollywood
Fall back like August, figured he probably would
Not good enough to make it, they figured he probably should
Then a couple years later, a nigga all good
Not good enough for her man but good enough for access
Too good for the racks, not good enough for the actress
Looked in the mirror, saw things more clearer
Said I look too good for my bitch not to be the baddest
I work too hard for my nights not to be the gladdest
A little too good just for trying to be average
And when they trying to do what I did
They trying to be big, they ain't good enough for that
My bad
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough

Still waiting, scheming on my come-ups
Shooting for the stars, the reason I got my guns up
But maybe my aim off of, maybe I came off
Way too fly they ain't like that, they trying to delay my take off
Can't call it and can't ball if
I'm on this bitch, warning, how should I take all this
Say I ain't good, man you can't call, this that
And ass niggers give me no breaks, keep the Kit-Kats
Listen I been all them places you never been at
Made so many moves and all
Even them Jabbawockee niggers gotta ooh and aah, but in fact
There's no dancing but my hustle's definitely intact
Yeah, but let's put this all in perspective
I compliment this game like Lebron with the nets
And a charm with a necklace - a king, I'm not - respect, miss
Making this a long shot but I'mma all net this

It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough

[Intro: Mac Miller]
This one right here, whew, this the one
Not you, bitch, the song (Haha)

[Chorus: John Record & Mac Miller]
Baby, if I don't have money (What?)
Then I don't have a heartbeat (That's right)
I know you gon' love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (I know you gon' love my name)
I know you gon' love my name

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & John Record]
I usually write rhymes in the BlackBerry
But I went back to the pen for this one (What?)
So I'ma let my fingers do the talkin'
And she probably what they talkin' bout (Uh-huh)
Girl, you got to listen (Uh)
I'm in this situation where you got me sittin' waitin'
And I'm losin' all my patience, I just need a vacation (Vacation)
Your friends all player-hatin' (What?)
'Cause I'm the one you always stay awake with (Uh-huh)
Then spend the day with, always wanna walk ya home
And you hate the way my day-to-day is on the road (It's okay)
Front row, know every single song
When she know she comin' home with me, she always bring her thong (Haha)
And bring her lingerie whatever mood she in
Put a movie in, got the lights dim
We gon' make love 'til the nights end (What?)
Have you callin' up ya friends like, "Ooh, I like him" (Haha)

[Chorus: John Record & Mac Miller]
Baby, if I don't have money (What?)
Then I don't have a heartbeat (That's right)
I know you gon' love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (I know you gon' love my name)
I know you gon' love my name

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I know I take ya breath away, darling
Smooth playa, treat you like a princess (Uh-huh)
'Cause love tricky like parallel parking (Haha)
A business I won't invest
But I show interest in that slim waist of yours
And I smile when I see that pretty face of yours (What's up?)
Givin' you flavors that you ain't never taste before (Uh-huh)
We gon' make love 'til you achin' sore (Achin' sore)
And baby, don't worry, I'ma be rich
Name in the neon lights, haha (In the neon lights)
So how about you give me that kiss?
'Cause you don't wanna sleep tonight (Haha)
Your one night love, gon' get swept off ya feet
Yes, get undressed from your breast to ya feet (Breast to ya feet)
Light a cigarette just to stay awake
Liquor got us bangin' like a 808

[Chorus: John Record & Mac Miller]
Baby, if I don't have money (What?)
Then I don't have a heartbeat (That's right)
I know you gon' love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (I know you gon' love my name)
I know you gon' love my name

[Bridge: John Record & Mac Miller]
Throw your hands up, people, party all night
Celebrate my name in the neon lights
Throw your hands up, people, party all night
Celebrate my name in the neon lights
Throw your hands up (You gon' love my name)
Throw your hands up (You gon' love my name)
Throw your hands up (You gon' love my name)
(You gon' love my name) Throw your hands up (Haha)

[Chorus: John Record & Mac Miller]
Baby, if I don't have money (What?)
Then I don't have a heartbeat (That's right)
I know you gon' love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (I know you gon' love my name)
I know you gon' love my name
I hope you notice the lack of social contact
It's not that you're not all that
It's just I know how this will end
Don't try to say you'll change for me
But that's not the way to go
And even before
I don't wanna try again with you
That's not the move, Nooo

You're just caught up in a web of me
Don't realize the reason why we never speak
It's you not me

You're just caught up in a web of me
Don't realize the reason why we never speak
It's you not me

And you should know
I never tried to hurt you girl
Just got tangled up in the idea of being together
We can live different lives
Together, Gotta move on
Just let it go, Move on
I'm not the one for you and I know it
Call me you need me
I got chu
Don't call in vain
Cuz I'm warning you
You might regret it
Ask me for help and I'm running
But make sure it's real
Or this friendship’s over

You're just caught up in a web of me
Don't realize the reason why we never speak
It's you not me

You're just caught up in a web of me
Don't realize the reason why we never speak
It's you not me

You're just caught up in a web of me
Don't realize the reason why we never speak
It's you not me

You're just caught up in a web of me
Don't realize the reason why we never speak
It's you not me

[Verse 1]
Her state of mind is constantly changing
To hell and back
She drives, switching lanes
Not knowing what she has til she knows where she's going
If she can just get past this traffic
She tries and tries to find peace of mind
But these days everything's in your face
So she stays soul and in her mind
Blowin' smoke in the sky
Cause it's her only vice
I wonder why

[Hook]
She blows smoke in the air, in the air, in the air
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck, no

She shaved off all of her hair, of her hair, of her hair
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck, no

[Verse 2]
Some people seem to think she needs changing
They don't know the struggles that she was raised with
So shut the fuck up
Just shut the fuck up
Stop thinking that you know everything
You don't and you never will, so just let it go
And be free as long as you're kind and and you've been born with the fight
So don't wonder why

[Hook]
She blows smoke in the air, in the air, in the air
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck, no

She shaved off all of her hair, of her hair, of her hair
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck, no

[Verse 1- Kilo Kish]
I see you, I see what I need
Upside down cause it's not how it seems
Intricacies, making believe
Your diary is inside of me
Come fly with me, way down below
And scream silently in the undertows
It's society that makes it hard to sleep
I close my eyes but I still see
Back...back...back...

[Hook-Syd tha Kyd]
I know that I'll never forget you girl
I know that I'll never forget you girl
I know that I'll never forget you girl
Cause I see you in my dreams

I know that I'll never forget you girl
I know that I'll never forget you girl
I know that I'll never forget you girl
Cause I see you in my dreams

[Verse 2- Kilo Kish]
It's hard to tell whether or not I wanna know
I'm thinking all the time and I guess it shows
It's tough for us to go back in time
To the night before everything was fine
When you talked to me and I talked to you
We watched pedophiles on the morning news
And the water dripped from my faucet top
If I collect it all, could we get it back
Please

[Hook]
I know that I'll never forget you girl
I know that I'll never forget you girl
I know that I'll never forget you girl
Cause I see you in my dreams

I know that I'll never forget you girl
I know that I'll never forget you girl
I know that I'll never forget you girl
Cause I see you in my dreams

[Bridge- Kilo Kish]
Baby, will you forget a-bout me
You're at the front of mind
Sitting behind my eyes all the time
Baby, will you forget a-bout me
You're at the front of mind
Sitting behind my eyes all the time

[Hook]
I know that I'll never forget you girl
I know that I'll never forget you girl
I know that I'll never forget you girl
Cause I see you in my dreams

I know that I'll never forget you girl
I know that I'll never forget you girl
I know that I'll never forget you girl
Cause I see you in my dreams

[Outro- Coco O. & The Internet]
There's gotta be reasons
That you mistake me for another one
Will you mistake me for another one?

[Verse 1- Matt Martians]
Open the door
I look you in your face, realize I don't love you no more
You ask me why
Reoccurring thoughts of him are there
You'll never understand
You
You asked to be put on this level and I ignored you
And now I see
What life is like without you there
So the bong is where I stare

[Hook- Syd tha Kyd]
Girl
You know I love you, girl
You know I care
Girl
You know I love you, girl
You know I care

[Verse 2- Syd tha Kyd]
Rain clouds
Seem to like to follow me around since I lost you
Ask me how
I could leave with something so small and unsure like I didn't love you anymore
But you
Pushed me to a level of insanity, I know
Now, all I ask
Is if I ever had a chance
Or were we never gonna last

[Hook]
Girl
You know I love you, girl
You know I care
Girl
You know I love you, girl
You know I care

[Verse 3- Pyramid Vritra]
Texting me "I love you" as you were getting dicked down by an old flame
At least you asked first while you would flirt at them home games
Fuck it I'll let it slide, like everything that you do
For everything thing that you do, innocent girl while in school
But as the moonlight crept in to her vacant room
She she's in the cooper
Naked, breaking curfew, nuts, and zippers too
Sea ocean blue after the hundredth argument
Dipped just as quick as you
Re-equiped with a new beau and my crush hates me now
I'm 50 states away, still asking about your day
And If you listen to the album I sent you
You shouldn't expect an answer
And it's it fine
Shit, I'll find some new bitches, and if you do return
By any chance, it stands that you want me
I'll be in the same state you left me
Alone
Or maybe I'll be with a bad bitch and I'll reject you
And tell you that you're nothing special
But you are
But I probably won't

[Verse 1]
Drivin' in my car
Damn near cut me off
Now you're in the fast lane
So you better not slow me down
And I refuse to change my direction
So you best make up your mind
Before I get caught in the intersection
And minor traffic lights

[Hook]
Sending me mixed signals
Get right or get left
Don't seem like you're ready
So just get out of my way
Sending me mixed signals
Get right or get left
Don't tell me you're sorry
Just get out my lane
Slowin' me down
Slowin' me down

[Verse 2]
And now we're moving faster
You're catching up to speed
And yes your car looks good to me
And you know it, don't try to speed off
Like I didn't teach you, all you know
Are you ready for the open road

[Hook]

[Outro]
Warning signs were there
But we never cared
So we crashed
And learned a lesson
And to take care of the damage
We need to admit that accidents happen
So if it's cool with you
I'll just be on my way

(Reversed Instrumentals Psychedelic Notation.)

Canada
You know the wooden beads
Uh, Swavey, baby

[Verse 1]
Hola how you do me, this that Polo with that Louis
I'm Pacino in this bitch and you Manolo in that movie
This that Uzi, I'm no thug, no bitch can't use me, I'm no drug
But I put that toolie to your mug, hot as a two-piece to your tongue
Canada conglomerate, blammers I've got on my back
You ain't gotta go to the zoo to see where them llamas at
Put them 24s on my coupe, it look like I'm tryna stack
Higher than a pile at the laundromat, Swavey
I be stackin' books, so I'm a time-is-money author
Please don't hit my phone, unless that thing a money offer
I be ballin' so hard that my name fill the whole roster
I can never go to jail 'cause boy I own a law firm
Bitch, I got that twista in my swisha
This the shit to hit ya frame until you niggas get the picture
I just hit 180 on my jigsaw, that's your lady? She my bitch
Look I'm so mixed up, where my fix-up?
Hola, cómo está? Spanish women on my jock
Spend so much guap at the club that they had to ban me from the spot
I live in Miami where it's hot and I get in them panties, where your spot?
I be sippin' that liquor that put me inside the position to get me to gettin' that guap, boy
Hop in my delorous-lorious, y'all niggas should forfeit, forfeit
My new chick is so bad, so bad, she used to be your bitch, your bitch
Hear you haters talkin', but I just ignore it
My money, my lady, she overweight, I feel like I'm Norbit

[Hook]
Don't take a picture, take a look at me
Boy, I goes hard, this my wooden beads
Hatin' on money, you couldn't be
Oh and I'm so sick, these niggas sick of me
Aww, Swavey, these niggas sick of me
Aww, Swavey, these niggas sick of me
Aww, Swavey, these niggas sick of me
Boy, I goes hard, this my wooden beads

[Verse 2]
Back in this bitch and I'm packin' a fifth
And I'm ready for action, you actin' the ish
And you talkin' that trash, it's a smack to your lips
I don't give a fuck 'bout it, I'm packin' a clip
That'll give you that static with that automatic
I let niggas have it who's back in that ratchet
Despite all the havoc, I have what you lackin'
You assholes, fastfo'd
Rewind, now we are on me time
Niggas got them pies and I ain't talkin' 'bout them Key Limes
Ooh, I'm sayin' this more than two times
Sayin' this more than two times
Thousand-thousand-thousand dollar necklace out of Dubai
Look up in the sky and you would see me if I flew by
Put that .22 right to the middle of your two eyes
If you in the building, bitch, meet the new guy
If you in the building, bitch, meet the new guy
Oh you love me? Me too, I'm ridin' with no G2
I just call her up before I beat it, get her pre-juiced
Tryna get this cash but if I smash, she can be loose
I'm too busy bein' me, so fuck tryna be you, Swavey

[Hook]
Don't take a picture, take a look at me
Boy, I goes hard, this my wooden beads
Hatin' on money, you couldn't be
Oh and I'm so sick, these niggas sick of me
Aww, Swavey, these niggas sick of me
Aww, Swavey, these niggas sick of me
Aww, Swavey, these niggas sick of me
Boy, I goes hard, this my wooden beads

[Outro]
Ay, ay Jae Fresco, ay, ay, ay Jae Fresco. Give these niggas a fuckin' year supply of thermometers, some Tylenol, and some robitussin. These niggas sick of us nigga. Yeah, Swavey, Canada. And I say that to the death, nigga, uh. Yo Cirraco take my beat out man, I don't want these niggas loopin' it

[Verse]
Talk to me, baby
Tell me what you're feeling
You say you don't need to go
Don't you pretend you didn't know
How all of this would end up?
Girl, I saw it in your eyes
And, baby, I can read your mind
And expectations were not in sight
You knew that talking dirty to me on the phone
Would get me here
'Cause we both wanted to do this
But I could tell that you were scared
'Cause you thought there was more to us
But you knew how this would end
It's gonna end how you expected
Girl, you're such a masochist
And I ask why
And you reply
I like the thrill
Nothing's gonna make me feel this real
So, baby, don't go home
I don't wanna spend tonight alone
Baby, please
Would you end your night with me?
Don't you leave me all behind
Don't you leave my little life
Don't you leave my little lie

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
You been picking my voice to dance to
You say my money no good in here
Even though I didn't ask you
And it's the most you've worked
Even though I probably don't deserve this girl
But you been dreaming for this moment so you have to
Baby, it's OK
I got show money, baby
I wanna show you how I blow money, baby
I wanna show you how I throw money, baby
I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby
Cause I'm a star, don't get it twisted
Got some trappers in my car
What kind of caps I got the brownest of them all
Somebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all, before we pop 'em all

[Hook]
Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I've felt the ground before
I've felt the ground before
I've felt the ground before
I've felt the ground before
Cuz I ain't scared of the fall

[Verse 2]
Mama, I understand why you're mad
And it hurts to accept what I am
And how I live
And what I do
But I've been good since Thursday
Yes I've been good since Thursday

So you can watch my love vanish
In a girl with no talent
But to make mula vanish
Call her friend for my friend
And friends name's Lexus
I let my niggas test it
Her morals worth a cent
And best believe I already spent it
My blunt full of B.C
My cup full of Texas
Flown on that OVO jet, yeah I said it
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
So you ain't gotta ask "Who's next? Who's next?"

[Hook]
Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good

I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I've felt the ground before
I've felt the ground before
I've felt the ground before

[Bridge]
The fall
And I ain't scared of the fall

I've been here times before but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time you won't seduce me
She's saying that's ok, hey baby do what you please
I am the stuff that you want, I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes, she touchin' me so to start
She say there's no turnin' back, she trapped me in her heart

[Hook]
Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no... Oh no... Oh no...

[Verse 2]
She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtains come down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
She's saying that's ok, hey baby do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say, I want to go too far
I'll be your everything if you make me a star

[Hook]
Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no... Oh no... Oh no...

[Verse 3]
She said I have to go home ‘cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleepin' alone, why don't you come with me
I said my baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright
Diana walked up to me, she said I'm all yours tonight
At that I ran to the phone sayin' baby I'm alright
I said unlock the door cause I forgot the key
She said he's not coming back because he's sleeping with me

[Hook]
Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no... Oh no... Oh no...

[Part I: XO]

[Verse 1]
Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patrón
Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more, lost your C notes
Cabbed all day, took the bus back home
Evictions on your door, blame it on the weed, blame it on the booze
Blame it on the night life, light's passin' you, yeah
Just don't blame it on me, that you wanna come and party
With a nigga like me, 'cause I get it
You're built like a Goddess
And it seems like you been stressin'
'Specially when your nose red
From that K, special Diet Coke
You need more bread, ‎now you got no rent
You blow that money, money
You try to window shop, you blow another hundred
She's fuckin' goons in the day
Hipster nights downtown and your daddy don't know you're out

[Bridge]
If they don't let you in
You know where to find me
'Cause if you wanna go again
You can always call me
'Cause all we ever do is love
Open up your mind, you can find the love
Girl, you ain't alone
We all been alone
Baby, just be honest

[Chorus]
(XO) Woo, don't you forget
(XO) Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(XO) We'll be everything you need, just believe
(XO) Yeah, (XO) yeah, whoa

[Verse 2]
I love it when your eyes are red, oh, yeah
Are you on my cloud yet?
'Cause I got a brand new cam, can we video feed, can we POV?
Why? I wanna catch you at your best
When your hair's a mess
You look so depressed
And you're filled with regret
And you feel like you gotta go home, oh
'Cause these nights pass, so much quicker than the days did
Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
But you up, you need money for ya' face lift
Lust over love is your mindset
Waken up with most of your side wet
Another room, you hear your mom cryin'
Cause she found your bag stuffed in the laundry
And the Bacardi from the last party

[Bridge]
If they won't let you in
You know where to find me, oh
And if you wanna go again
You can always call me
'Cause all we ever do is love
Open up your mind you can find the love
Girl you ain't alone, we all been alone
Baby just be honest

[Chorus]
(XO) Ohh, don't you forget
(XO) No, no, don't you worry 'bout a thing
(XO) We'll be everything you need, just believe, yeah
(XO) Yeah, (XO) ooh, whoa

[Part II: The Host]

[Breakdown]
I need, I need something from you
Oh, there's so much love to pass around
There's too much love
Girl, the night's almost done
And who you came with is already gone
You said you want me
But I remember who you are
And girl, it wasn't long ago
Didn't think I'd go this far

[Outro]
Well, I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby you can have it all
There's just something that I
Need from you is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and ride it out
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Ride it out
Oh, oh, whoa yeah
Ride it out
Ride it out
Just ride it

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Where were you when I needed you eight months ago?
All your girlfriends talkin' bout me, now you ringin' up my phone
I bet you miss me now baby, I bet you'd kiss me now baby
Especially since you know that this ain't nothin' and I only just begun

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
You never thought that I would ever go this far
You said potential could never last this long
Well baby, I've been alone for almost all my life
What makes you think that you can ever do me right

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
And now I'm poppin' yea
Ain't nobody showed me how
I made it big poppin' yeah
Tell me how you like me now
I swear I loved you girl
And you probably went and fucked the world
Well you can take another shot everytime you hear me playin' in the club

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
You never thought that I would ever go this far
You said potential could never last this long
Well baby, I've been alone for almost all my life
What makes you think that you can ever do me right

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song

[Outro: Juicy J]
Listen to that shit, man
The Weeknd music make the ladies panties get wet!
Jam that shit my nigga
I'm high as a motherfucker
I don't give a shit
I'm going to the strip club
I'm throwing 30 thousand dollars nigga, 30 thousand!
Fuck that shit
Spend that shit nigga, it's Christmas!
Shutthefuckup!
We trippy mane!

[Verse 1]
My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

[Refrain]
Swimming pool, glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples
You sittin', sippin' on your Black Cristal
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins
Gimme them coins

[Chorus 1]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

[Verse 2]
My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rollin' stone

[Refrain]
Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom
Chateau Marmont, slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me
Gimme them coins

[Chorus 1]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth

[Chorus 2]
Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it

[Bridge]
My old man is a thief
And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord
To watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said, "Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man"

[Chorus 3]
And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is down and now we're goin' in
To Las Vegas, chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

[Outro]
You are my one true love
I put my mind and my time all up in this shit
I sacrifice the whole life I'm not witnessing
They ask me why I do it...
I tell'em that I do it tell'em that I do it for ya'll
...for ya'll for ya'll.....

[Verse 1]
If life is a game I guess everybody watching my....
Swell days when its well played...Dwayne wade I guess kev is my L.J
Soaring super high when the L blase...
But as the jay fades way I'm victim to expectance
Never knowing what they will expect of me or what they gone suggest I be...
I probably fall short media of all sorts
Break a nigga balls then they piss a nigga off
Going through liquor withdraws tell the women in my life I couldn't catch em if they fall
Cause attention is expensive and the cost will leave your heart broke
Heavy is the pressure she just want to take it off though...
I'm I know winning but its still a steady lost think back to those days when it was just me and my dogs a Petersburg nigga with dreams of being a boss... and being me wasn't difficult at all....

[Hook]
I put my mind and my time all up in this shit
I sacrifice the whole life I'm not witnessing
They ask me why I do it...
I tell'em that I do it tell'em that I do it for ya'll
...for ya'll for ya'll.....

[Verse 2]
If home is where the heart is
Tell me why I'm losing my mind inside of this suite that bigger than your apartment
Victim of circumstances sometimes standing in the sunshine camera flashing dumb times
Made now I'm famous now everybody know my name
But where goes old Tremaine seems as if he's fading now
Why do we get famous just to wish to turn the famous down
Normal seas in life are something very far away and close to vacant
Now but the currency I'm making now brick flips can get a whole shipment then picth em in
The dealers in your town break it down sell it out
And the numbers are a slumber compared to what's in my bank account
I put your bread to bed go head rest boo why you think I said I wanna be successful
Cause I did and I'm is and I want that...
But still the life I had before this I want back...

[Hook]
I put my mind and my time all up in this shit
I sacrifice the whole life I'm not witnessing
They ask me why I do it...
I tell'em that I do it tell'em that I do it for ya'll
...for ya'll for ya'll.....

[Verse 3]
Now that my dreams have become my reality
I surely see that everything that glitters ain't gold
I'm only human and we breath the same air heavy as the load I bare
My family and fans just understand that a nigga really do for ya'll
That's why a nigga do it I said that's why a nigga do it ugh
Don't you know I do it (I do it) said don't you know I do it (I do it)
Don't you know I 

[x2]
Don't you know I do it

[Hook]
I put my mind and my time all up in this shit
I sacrifice the whole life I'm not witnessing
They ask me why I do it
I tell'em that I do it I tell'em that I do it for ya'll
For ya'll 

[x5]

[Intro]
'Cause I ain't goin' out like a sucker, no way
See, I'm nice right now, haha

[?] your L

[Chorus]
That party last night, I don't remember, I'm so hungover (Yeah)
We stayed up drinkin', twist an ounce as the girls come over
Drink my OE, smoke my bud, sluts know I'm just tryin' to fuck
So let's get drunk until we gone
Everybody chug your beer when the hook come on

[Post-Chorus]
I love high school (Ayy)
Ditchin' class (Ayy)
Gettin' fucked up, nuttin' in the bitch with the thickest ass

[Verse 1]
I wanna go to Dice for the rest of my life
No, not really, but it might be nice
Early wakin' up, never could I sleep in
Can't remember what I did last weekend (Haha)
A whole lot of drinkin', a whole lot of chiefin'
A whole lot of parties, and some is only decent
So we gettin' drunk, we don't give a fuck (Nope)
Told the topless sluts, "Keep on fillin' up my cups" (Haha)
The cups was red, posted up on the bed
You might get fucked, or you might just get some head
It's whatever with me, get some head, light the weed
That's just the motherfuckin' kind of night that I need (Uh-huh)

[Chorus]
That party last night, I don't remember, I'm so hungover
We stayed up drinkin', twist an ounce as the girls come over
Drink my OE, smoke my bud, sluts know I'm just tryin' to fuck
So let's get drunk until we gone
Everybody chug your beer when the hook come on

[Post-Chorus]
I love high school
Ditchin' class
Gettin' fucked up, nuttin' in the bitch with the thickest ass (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Uh, I can't tell you 'bout goin' to class
But I can tell you 'bout rollin' this hash, uh
So chiefed that you can't even see straight
Blowin' out birthday candles on the weed cake
Somethin' to smoke in, somethin' to sell
Been gettin' fucked up before I was even twelve, uh
Ten blunts, get the keg pump
Fillin' up a red cup 'til I'm so drunk I can't stand up
We party hard 'til the cops get us surrounded
The dude throwin' the party, he probably got grounded (Uh-huh)
See, in high school everybody wanna grow up
You know what? Bein' old seem so butt that I don't think I need that
I'ma be a kid like Will Ferrell in Step Brothers, but with a crib
My brother gettin' older, out of college is the shit
But for right now, I'ma just visit, haha

[Interlude]
That's how the fuck it go down, man
If you in high school, you remember when you was in high school, man
You gotta fuck with this one

[Chorus]
That party last night, I don't remember, I'm so hungover
We stayed up drinkin', twist an ounce as the girls come over
Drink my OE, smoke my bud, sluts know I'm just tryin' to fuck
So let's get drunk until we gone
Everybody chug your beer when the hook come on

[Post-Chorus]
I love high school (Ayy)
Ditchin' class (Ayy)
Gettin' fucked up, nuttin' in the bitch with the thickest ass

[Outro]
East End Empire
This has been your host of the party, Mac Miller
Haha

[Intro]
Well, well, well, well
Hello, baby
Well, well, well, well
Hello, baby

[Chorus]
I try to stay humble but it's hard when you this fly
Women want a picture witcha, hand the camera to their guy
And I know that they just wanna pose with the kid
So my clothes stayin' fresh and my dome gettin' big (Gettin' big)
So many stars above me, they don't mention me (Mention me)
But it's hard when you feel like a celebrity (Celebrity)
When you feel like a celebrity, oh, woah (Woah)
When you feel like a celebrity (Uh, look)

[Verse 1]
My homie try and tell me that my mac ain't well
Lean back with a laugh and half a smile
Wanna have a good time but I gotta hard grind
And I gotta go back right now
The way these people be lovin', it's hard to comprehend
Every time I go out, out into public
Feel like the boy got a lot of friends
Shit, I don't want it to end, bro
Be back up in the crib smokin', playin' Nintendo
‘Cause, me, I’m tryin' be up at the Grammys
Throwin' parties in Miami
Round the bend of Venice Beach, recognize me in the streets
With a hundred thousand women rockin' all expensive linen
Livin' life like it's a dream, I can't wait to be the king
Shit, I don't want it to ever end
But for you bitches, it's somethin' I wouldn't recommend

[Chorus]
I try to stay humble but it's hard when you this fly
Women want a picture witcha, hand the camera to their guy
And I know that they just wanna pose with the kid
So my clothes stayin' fresh and my dome gettin' big (Gettin' big)
So many stars above me, they don't mention me (Mention me)
But it's hard when you feel like a celebrity (Celebrity)
When you feel like a celebrity, oh, woah (Woah)
When you feel like a celebrity (Uh, look, uh)

[Verse 2]
Comin' back with a vengeance
Take a breath in the pause right after the sentence
Uh, go and hit your L, uh
Now back to the business, uh, with a round of applause
Got shorty right down to her draws
Don't mess around with the best around
When it's gonna come down to the bars
They gotta know I'm, I'm so high
Ask me, boy, I won't lie
My body’s stuck on ghost ride
Throw a toast to the most high
I don't need your co-sign
If you don't like me, then fuck you
But don't try and say, "What's up?" when you come through (Come through)
'Cause I don't need you, man
The boy done gained a heap of fans
A hundred-fifty downloads in a minute when I leak a jam
The future of this music shit, well, homie, I believe I am
'Cause every time I rock a mic, they get up out their seats like, "Damn"

[Chorus]
I try to stay humble but it's hard when you this fly
Women want a picture witcha, hand the camera to their guy
And I know that they just wanna pose with the kid
So my clothes stayin' fresh and my dome gettin' big (Gettin' big)
So many stars above me, they don't mention me (Mention me)
But it's hard when you feel like a celebrity (Celebrity)
When you feel like a celebrity, oh, woah (Woah)
When you feel like a celebrity (Celebrity)

[Outro]
When you feel like a celebrity (Celebrity)
When you feel like a celebrity (Celebrity)
When you feel like a celebrity

[Intro]
Ah, look, we gotta talk
Dang, I know, I know but it's, it's just, it's just
Some things I gotta get off my chest, aight
Yeah, woah, woah-woah
Listen

[Verse 1]
Baby, come here and sit down, let's talk
I got a lot to say so I guess I'll start by
Saying that I love you
But you know, this thing ain't been no walk in the park for us
I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I finish, yeah
And I don't wanna see you cry
But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so

[Pre-Chorus]
How do you let it go when you, you just don't know
What's on the other side of the door when you're walking out? Talk about it
And everything I tried to remember to say just went out my head
So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand 'cause I know

[Chorus]
There's never a right time to say goodbye (Yeah)
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me, I
Kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Girl, I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I found myself asking, "Why? Why?"
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl, I never
Meant to crush your world and I never
Thought I would see the day we grew apart
And I wanna know

[Pre-Chorus]
How do you let it go when you, you just don't know
What's on the other side of the door when you're walking out? Talk about it
Girl, I hope you understand what I'm tryna say, we just can't go on
Pretending that we get along, girl, how you not gon' see it? (Oh, oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me, I
Kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye

[Bridge]
Listen to your heart, girl, you know
We should be apart, baby, I
I just can't do it, I, I just can't do it
Listen to your heart, girl, you know
We should be apart, baby, I
I just can't do it and sometimes it makes me wanna cry
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Do you hear me crying?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh, oh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There's never a right

[Chorus]
There's never a right time to say goodbye (Oh yeah)
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me (You gonna start hating me, baby)
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you (No more)
Girl, it's not you, it's me, I (It's me, yeah)
Kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh (About you and me)
There's never a right time to say goodbye (Oh, no it ain't)
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye (Right time)
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me, I
Kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time, right time to say...

Give it to me dame mama, I like that dale mama
Give it to me dame mama

[Verse]
Uh, uh
It's 10 o'clock on a Wednesday and I know you're home
Drivin' up and down your street
Hopin' that you'll come outside
'Cause I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted
And I just need you to see me
Childish as it seems, it'll make it all better, better
Selfish as it is, this just ain't about you no
Did me wrong every time we were together, -gether
And that's why
I'm gonna stunt on you
I'm gonna stunt on you
You let me go, little did you know
I could've made it all on my own

[Hook]
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus lane
All his reindeer, all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing
Children singing
Bells are ringing
Children sing - b-bells are, bells are ringing
Children singing
Santa Claus comes to town

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I tell em all I want for Christmas is two gold front teeth
And ten carat diamonds on a fat gold wreath
That I could wear around my neck
Get money and respect
Tell Santa Claus to bring a ten million dollar check
So I could spread a little cheer
Fly a couple leers
Eat a little chicken, drink a couple beers
Kick back and just chill like a player would do
Remix all the Christmas carols then I play 'em for you
Luda! Turn it up until I wake up all the neighbours
They say that I’m a nuissance but I say they all some haters
Just because I’m poor they always calling me a faker
And cause my Christmas tree's decorated in toilet paper
But little do they know
They 'bout to see a show
Cause when they come up out the house I’m gonna blast 'em with some snow
Frosty’s never seen nothing quite like this
And St. Nick’s never seen nothing quite like Cris
So um…

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, chestnuts roasting on the fire in the hills
But down below we firing up the barbeque grills
Ice skating in the driveway
I'mma do it my way
Eggnogs got daddy swerving on the highway
Stains on the tires, ice up on the window
10 degress Fahrenheit freezing as the wind blow
Help me take my boots off
And my snow suit off
Get up in the house and my nose is redder than Rudolph's
I think I need some help
With the buckle on my belt
And if Santa doesn’t show I want his cookies and his milk
Tell him i need a jacket, new Jordans and a XBox
New suits for church and a couple pairs of dress socks
Stuff my stocking with Jolly Ranchers and candy canes
Invite my aunties and uncles, let's do the family thing
Meanwhile I'm hoping Santa got my wishlist
So I could wake up to a very merry Cris'mas

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah, I hear the sleigh bells ringing and the jingle bells rock
Santa never seen the jingle bells on my block
I hear he’s making that list, checking the thing twice
I guess it’s probably cause I been naughty not nice
But I'mma straighten up my act
Get up on track
Make a couple bucks and buy Mama a Cadillac
And then maybe Santa Claus will come around my way
So all the kids on my block can look up and say "hey!"

[Hook]

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all livin’ the good life
Yeah, though it’s forty below the wind chill
And we wipin’ snow up off the windshield
It’s still wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I’m so happy I’m with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin’ for the mall, don’t trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that “You the star at the top of my Christmas tree”
My only question is, “Where my presents?”
She said, “Shhh,” she got a gift for me that ain’t for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in your drink, mami
You've been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said, “It’s Dee-ricious”
Hahahaha, yeah

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Kanye West]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls (Uh, uh)
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall (I'm like Bad Santa though)
Even though we ain’t ballin’ (Somebody sit on my lap)
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 2: Cyhi the Prynce]
Yeah, Mom and Dad, I won't be home for the holidays
Ha, I’m over 800 miles away
In the city that's so pretty
Where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
Tell my family that I’m sorry that I gotta stay
I’m with Ye at the Macy Day Parade
Lettin' the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I’m in New York, I’m still reppin' for the A
Cyhi!

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 3: Teyana Taylor & Musiq Soulchild]
All the flashin' lights up on a tree
The house lit up nice
With your family is where you wanna be
Here on Christmas night
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don’t that make you feel good?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
Let’s have Christmas in the hood

[Verse 4: Teyana Taylor]
All of the flashin' lights
Yeah, them things shine so bright
Always for you and me
Baby, you’re Christmas Eve
If you like what you see
Won’t you come sit on my knee?
And tell me everything that you want
‘Cause, baby, I’m your Santa Claus, yeah

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

But we got mice in the kitchens
But we don’t care 'cause we’re in love
Get in the shower
I’ll meet you there
I bought you some hippie shit from the Deli down the stairs, oh yeah
Love it when my man smells so good

[Verse 5]
Don’t forget me baby

'Cause I know your life would be a snore
You’d be all stuck fucking this hooker-whore
This hooker, whore

[Verse 6]
Got no nothing
You’re in the next room
You fell asleep on my tour bus while me and Fernando and Paul and Justin and Dave are making music
But I miss you

[Verse 7]
The fridge is broke
And we're drinking warm champagne
But we don’t care cause we’re in Minnesota
And we’re sold out show again
And it's a sold show again

[Outro]
Okay, just stop here, I could go on forever

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Joy Williams of the Civil Wars backup]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift with John Paul White of the Civil Wars backup]
Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when (the) music's gone
Gone

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Bridge: Taylor Swift with the Civil Wars backup]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Outro: Taylor Swift with the Civil Wars backup]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh oh oh
Here we go
9-5 is the blood for your sweat
Pay the landlord, he's taking your blood for the rent
Yo
The balance dead so a bullet's what I get
When my Mao-Say-Tung gets offensive like Tet
The whip snapped my back
My spine cracked
For tobacco
I'm the Marlboro man
Can I make London bridges fall
If they do me like Mumia Abu-Jamal
Nobody move
Nobody move
86 Philly pigs drive a whole city block
And I'm campin' like Hampton
Read the word of the innocent
Yet death row is locked
Capitol-i-ism
Check the wrong rhythm
And so they say let Saigons be Saigons
But wait a Ho-Chi-minute
Waste the day cause the night brings a hearse
Make a move and plead the fifth
Ya can't plead the first

Are you ready to testify?
Get ready to testify
Are you ready to testify?
Get ready to testify

The revolutionary aesthetic
Black leather, beret and powder blue
However meanacing this human form on the outside looks
Without revolutionary action
It's ever so translucent

I stand admist grandeous gestures
Postures and platforms of romanticism
Creating more noise than answers
Creating more noise than the sirens
That keep our children crouched in corners

I sit and watch us do the blind man's dance
And I can't stand the smell of false composure
So I take a Ho-Chi minute to meditate
And think
And then tune to the word of Jose Matin
Doing is the best way of saying
Doing is the best way of saying
Doing is the best way of saying
Doing is the best way of saying

9-5 is the blood for your sweat
Pay the landlord, he's taking your blood for the rent Yo
The balance dead so a bullet's what I get
When my Mao-Say-Tung gets effective like tet
The whip snap my back
My spine crack
Front to back
Ohhh what a Marlboro man
Can I make London bridges fall
If they do me like Mumia Abu-Jamal
Nobody move
Nobody move
86 Philly pigs drive a whole city block
And I'm campin' like Hampton
Read the word of the innocent
Yet death row is locked
Capitol-i-ism
Check the wrong rhythm
And so they say let Saigons be Saigons
But wait a Ho-Chi-minute
Waste the day cause the night brings a hearse
Make a move and plead the fifth
Ya can't plead the first
Are you ready to testify?
Get ready to testify
Are you ready to testify?
Get ready to testify
C'mon

Doing is the best way of saying
Doing is the best way of saying
Swag, swag times two

I don't cry cause I'm strong
I don't cry cause nothing lasts forever
I don't cry cause the kids are grown
I don't cry at all
I don't cry cause them days are gone
Ooh child, ooh child

But when the sun sets, just right, ooh I might
Shed a tear
And when the good word hits home
I'll shed a tear
I'll shed two tears

I won't cry in the car
I won't cry in the bathroom stall
I won't cry when I'm home alone
I won't cry at all
I won't cry cause them days are gone
Ooh child, ooh baby doll
But if the sun shines too beautiful, I might
I'll shed two tears
And when the good word hits home
I'll shed two more tears

Now that's four tears - you got enough?
No more tears, you've had enough
That's four tears

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Soon as I walk in
Nothing but talkin'
I beg my pardon for not begging pardon
Walk in the store, close all the doors
They know I am a very big copper like the warden
Matter fact you should award him
You should support him for being so important
Shh! Do you hear the applaudin'?
Camera recording? Roll out the carpet
Back in the spotlight, parallel parkin'
And I do not have time for the jargon
I hop on records, tend to break records
G.O.O.D. Music what you think I'm signed to the best for?
I mean I ain't really trying to trip
But what you mean "show'em Jay" you can't tell me shit

[Hook]
So umm, Let my money stack
To a hundred stacks
Times a hundred stacks
Times a hundred that
Yeah, times a hundred that
Yeah, times a hundred that
Keep it coming, coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, coming, keep it coming
Yeah, and times a hundred that
See I'm just trying to let me money stack
To hundred stacks, times a hundred stacks
Times a hundred that

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Beast
Got his bread up without yeast
Man the least I could do is not lease
So I paid of a bill
Imagine how I feel
Say my graces to the bank because I'm working on the mill
The hotels I check in with hoes I will check out
And I'mma get to sexing until a nigga sexed out

[Hook]
So let my money stack
To a hundred stacks
Times a hundred stacks
Times a hundred that

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Bape shit? Got it
BBC? Got it
Pastel? Got it
Before he even dropped it
Four chains on
Yeah I be on that Paul shit
Jesus piece too; add twenty thousand
You do not got this
You cannot afford it
You cannot stop it
Might as well support it

[Hook]
Let my money stack
To a hundred stacks
Times a hundred stacks
Times a hundred that
Yeah, times a hundred that
Yeah, times a hundred that
Keep it coming, coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, coming, keep it coming
Yeah, and times a hundred that
See I'm just trying to let me money stack
To a hundred stacks
Times a hundred stacks
Times a hundred that
Yeah, times a hundred that
Yeah, times a hundred that
Keep it coming, coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, coming, keep it coming
Just trying to let me money stack
To a hundred stacks
Cause I'm FF

[Intro: T.I.]
B.o.B. play the guitar
(B.o.B., B.o.B., B.o.B., B.o.B.) play the guitar
B.o.B. play the guitar
(B.o.B., B.o.B., B.o.B., B.o.B.) play the guitar

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Well it's B.o.B, flyer than a stewardess
Fresh to death like I'm dressed for a eulogy
My outfit's retarded, my flow is the stupidest, dumb
I'll probably need to after school tutor it
Balling on beats, got hops like breweries
Sideline haters need to chill where the cooler is
Dr. J flow, you can call me Julius
Y'all take shots; I direct: movie shit
Grand Hustle champion, all I do is ball 'em up
Niggas starting conversations just so they can talk us up
If you ain't running shit you can't even walk with us
Still I'm chill; blunt wider than a coffee cup
You know it's B.o, I do this for the people
Stacking c-notes, pockets on Cee-Lo
Uhm, I'm killing 'em Mama - I'm talking hockey mask
I do it to death, swag on body bag
This beat is out of here, it's gone
Farewell, so long, so long (sayonara)
I'm sayonara, the way I'm gone
So far away there ain't no signal on my phone
Cuz I'm a star, so when I hit the bar it's like Cheers
Everybody knows who you are
Who would've thought I would've took it this far?
Play the guitar

[Hook: T.I.]
Play the guitar, play the guitar, play the guitar
(B.o.B., B.o.B., B.o.B., B.o.B.) play the guitar
(3000) Play the guitar (3000) play the guitar
(3000) Play the guitar

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Man, I keep having this re-occurring image where I'm
Standing on top of Church's Chicken playing guitar
Looked over and I see B.o.B. with this strange cigar
He's standing on top of Dunkin Donuts; it's like he own it
We at the corner of "Give It To 'Em" and "They Don't Want It"
We out here somewhere in mid-Europe, they out here joning
My niggas threw out way too much jewelry, my chain lonely
But they don't know about black pearls, but I will show them
"Why the world sleeping on black girls?" Hey I don't know, man
Silverback Stacks, jumping out the jungle
Blowing tiger stripe bubbles with "Go To Hell" bubblegum
When I was young, a space shuttle got hung in front of everyone
And grandmum tells me to stay humble but do not un-der-stand
One of these mumbles will make 'em throw up they arms and hands
Now stumble and they will know I put on my pants
One leg at a time, like they do, pay us no mind
But everybody look at why we do it, it take us more time
Excuse me if I'm no exhibitionist
According to the internet
3000 got a big old dic-tionary full of words
He must know how to use 'em
It also says I play the violin and that ain't true but
You give me six strings and a pick
And I will make a guitar talk, why, I ain't gotta say shit
And I encourage any child to pick up some instrument
Cuz if you're mad at your dad or mum, you can grab it and strum
Eat your cabbage and corn, by the time you're done
You will finally realize that they meant you no harm
They was trying to save your crazy ass from what's to come
3000 muthafucka "Mr. Tell-Me-Somethin'"

[Outro: André 3000]
My partners say I should practice more, I know
They be saying I sound like I'm out of tune
I ask them: "Do you cry in tune nigga? Do you laugh in tune?"

[Hook: T.I.]
See I be riding through my old hood, same old attitude
Chillin with your girlfriend, why she always mad at you
She be like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Only time that she quiet, when my thing is inside her
Don't you know I'm a writer
Yeah, I sleep in her stomach
And I slip her a 50, just to keep her 100
Yeah, my swaggers so dummy
We so stupid, so silly
I watch them girls getting lower than the kick in "A Milli"
Gambino, why you got a gold chain?
Cause girls only gonna see you when you stuntin, man
I'm coming back, swag on Rogaine
Girl lemme see you 2 Chainz old name
So hood, what y'all talking bout
Man, I'm watching Law and Order on my grandma's couch
Eating Lucky Charms for dinner, loser to a winner
Swag so Clippers, me and Blake Griffin
Me and Blake Griffin, why your goals dripping
You ever seen ballas like us po' pimping?
Ha, we getting drunk like a Kennedy
Ha, we stay fly like the end of Grease
Yeah, I got Os like CP3
Don't worry, don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me

When that period's on CPT

[Hook]
I was rollin' through the ghetto
In my Lincoln Continental
Blowin' kush smoke out the window
What you think my windows tint for?

[Mike G]
It go drastic
Measures in a tale so tragic
Follow formula 64 as you trail my tracks
Bitch, there's nothin' more pleasant than gettin' paid on point
Pretty bitches with gold grills just to roll my joints
I make 'em plead
As the director says scene
New ones, don't say my name
I just make 'em say king
Four rings on that motherfuckin' wood grain wheel
Raw, I'm Johnny Law, the tricks should check my appeal
Once upon a time not too far back
There was a young wolf pack
That grew up in a lack
Syd, Left, King
And Ace make Black Jack
Bitches be talkin' shit
That's how you end up smacked
I'm after chips
And if we eating then I'm after your bitch
Ain't cautious pimpin' player
You should be after the risk
We winnin' like there ain't no other way to play the game
All I hang around is zeros
Figure my checks should look the same

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Ever since you came into my life I been moving closer to
Tryna' build a vault around the both of us
When you're gone baby I ain't cool
No I ain't cool no, I can't move
And I don't know what the hell is happening to us
But I don't wanna know because it feels like something that I want
And baby I ain't never fell in love but if this is what they talk about then I don't ever wanna get up
They say it's infatuation
I say I don't care what you name it

[Chorus]
Baby I'm losing my air, I can't breathe love
And I feel like I'm blind, I can't see it love
And as sweet as it is, I can't taste it
But I know its real love, real love
As the sky is blue, as the moon and the air change colors
Real, I'm in love with you for real, for real

[Verse 2]
No I don't care who wants to question us or break us up
Cos' I'd lose a thousand friends for what I got wit you
Right here baby I'm all good, yup, I'm all good, ah
I'm all good, oh
And I don't want nothing but your heart and trust
Every little tender touch
And I know love ain't only made for us but I feel like we own it
Feel like we own it
And I already know what they say, they swear that we will never make it
But if I lost you today it'd be real just the same

[Chorus]
Baby I'm losing my air, I can't breathe love
And I feel like I'm blind, I can't see it love
And as sweet as it is, I can't taste it
But I know its real love, real love
As the sky is blue, as the moon and the air change colors
Real, I'm in love with you for real, for real

[Bridge]
Oh I know it all can't be just a figment of imagination
A dream that won't come true
I know it all can't be just and illusion
I know what you're doing to me

[Chorus]
Baby I'm losing my air, I can't breathe love
And I feel like I'm blind, I can't see it love
And as sweet as it is, I can't taste it
But I know its real love, real love
As the sky is blue, as the moon and the air change colors
Real, I'm in love with you for real, for real

Little bit of Coke mixed with a lot of bourbon (Okay)

Get-Get up off my johnson (Okay, okay)

Only took a year and a half and now I'm shittin' on 'em

[Chorus: Kevin McCall, Kid Ink & Both]
G-G-Get it how I live it, come faster than I could spend it (Spend it)
Money to the ceilin' (Ceilin'), bitch, I'm in the buildin' (Yeah)

Save that for my baby momma
And all you bums can keep the change

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Yeah, I got them bulletproof Ray-Bans so haters never in my head
Money hungry good for me, yeah, I call it wheat bread
Ladies say I'm long strokin', yeah, that’s what she said
Crib like a castle so I'm fuckin' on that king spread
Haha, big ballin', fuck a loft
And money turn me on so I had to fuck it off
Skinny ass nigga's pockets lookin' so bulimic
And I never spill my drink, you can call me Tempur-Pedic
Allergic to the haters, addicted to the money
You askin' why I'm laughin' 'cause all of you niggas funny
And they call me Action Jackson 'cause every d-day I'm stuntin'
And I'm writin' hit songs like it's nothin'
So nigga, you buggin', frontin', what you think this is, ho?
Paparazzi tryna pop me everywhere that Chris go
Never been no sucker, no lame, mad nigga
And your flow is watered down than a drain, ass nigga

[Chorus: Kevin McCall, Kid Ink & Both]
G-G-Get it how I live it, come faster than I could spend it (Spend it)
Money to the ceilin' (Ceilin'), bitch, I'm in the buildin' (Yeah)

[Hook]
Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard

Sippin' sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6

Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I'm high as a bird
If you say you saw me and I wasn't fly that's absurd
A thousand on the jeans and a solid five on the shirt
You see me, you need me in the game
I already know they gon' hate
But that's when I drop that (808)
Come on I ain't playin' with them
I make hits, I'm gone, I ain't stayin' with 'em
A G6 I'm on when I land in it
Ya get shit, ya don't understand nigga
Somebody come give me a high five
Something to keep my eyes wide
No it ain't no stoppin' we get pop pop poppin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: The Cataracs]
Sippin' on, sippin' on sizz, I'ma ma-make it fizz
Girl I keep it gangsta, poppin' bottles at the crib
This is how we live, every single night
Take that bottle to the head, and let me see you fly

(808) Hell Yeaa
Drink it up, drink-drink it up
When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk
They be actin' like they drunk, actin'-actin' like they drunk
When sober girls around me actin'-actin' like they drunk

[Hook]

[Bridge: The Cataracs]

I don't know what to do sitting here alone
Just waiting on a cue
Cause I don't wanna fuck with you No more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
I don't wanna fuck with you I don't know what to do
Sitting here alone, just waiting on a cue
Cause I don't wanna fuck with you no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
I don't wanna fuck with you

[Verse 1]
Man fallin' into love to deep too much pressure
I don't wanna feel too weak
You be hearing all these bitches just talking about me
And if it's bout beef you'll take it to the street
I know I see you don't wanna be seen
But baby I'm a star and this is my team
I work too hard, to be arguing picking up my phone
And it ain't even ring
Even got some issues, some problems of your own
But I ain't gonna put you out there on the song
I'd be wrong if I did even talking about a kid
Put my past relationship that false information bitch
I thought you knew me better than that never did, not a fact
I don't even go time to be explaining that
I know shit ain't the same but some times niggas gone change, change now

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of that, ain't calling back
Ain't fucking with you, like the virgins back
Man, shit was all good just a week ago now im blowing up
Turn me up in your speaker ho
Speaking on the wrong shit now you gotta go sick of your
Face and your friend is the antidote
And ain't tryin' to go and fuck with anybody
But I'm a fuck around and fuck somebody
Like bullies on playgrounds, new pussy I just found knock down
Laid down throwin' the towel out
When I'm at this rate I probably never press redial, callin all yo loud ass friends in the background
I'm better now,I'm better now got a new bitch
I ain't gonna put her out like I put you out. This time I ain't playin' around

[Hook]

And I don't save money so I don't need a whore to be saved

Never fucked a hundred miles up
Never been in love

[Bridge]
But if I'd never met yo ass

[Verse 2]
Just stay alone
This heart lonely
Waiting at the terminal, waiting oh oh oh
I watched everybody else get on
But deep down I'm scared to fly back home
Cause last time it went up and went down, down, down
In flames

[Bridge]
But if I'd never met yo ass
I would never known how it feels to crash

[Hook]
We didn't land smooth, damn
It's heartbreak plus the jetlag
Ohh ohh oh
Heartbreak plus jetlag
Ohh ohh oh
Heartbreak plus jetlag

[Produced by Fraser T Smith]

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name

[Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you

[Chorus]
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Outro]
Oh
Oh, no
Let it burn
Oh
Let it burn
Let it burn

[Intro - Lil Wayne]
Hahaa, yeah
Young Weezy Baby
Come to tell you all today about a lil’ problem I be having, oh man see its like…

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
When I’m down in the studio tryna make a track
My girl be at home all over my back
And every time I say that’s what I’m doing
She don’t think it’s what I’m doing
When its her that I’d rather be doing
But right now I’m in the studio making this track
My girl at home all over my back
She blowin’ up my phone
She tells me she’s alone
I say I won’t be long, let me finish this song
But right now I’m in the studio eating this track
My girl at home begging me to come back
Okay I’m coming home, and when I get home
Girl I’m gonna kill it like I’m killing this song
But right now I’m in the studio

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
Man just record me
And even with a equals sign you couldn’t pause me
Haha
Yeah, this is the office
Come be my secretary baby this is the office
And my office hours are 9 to 5
But you can be my 6 to 10
I’mma say it again
My office hours are 9 to 5
But you can be my 6 to 10

[Hook - Lil Wayne]

[Verse 2 - T-Streets]
Man just record me
My girl at home all discombodied
Lady, but baby I’m just recording
And you gotta know I’d rather do this than party
Man, don’t get me started
You think I’m crazy, my bitch retarded
But that’s my bitch regardless
Yeah

[Hook - Lil Wayne]

[Verse 3 - Mack Maine]
Man, just record your boy
If I sound a lil’ pissed, disregard ya boy
My baby girl really acting like a baby sending text
Stressed, tryna make it hard for ya boy
I’m like shawty better use your toy
See a nigga never absent but I might be taughty
Lordy, Lordy, I likes to party
See I could be with two freaks about to have an orgy
Or I could be with Pamela, could be with Audrey
Instead I’m telling the engineer: “dude just record me”
And as soon as Angel records me
That’s more Gucci, more Prada, more Louie V
See every verse bring us closer to our dream house
Now we closer to the things that we dream ’bout
And when I get home I ain’t tryna go to sleep
You know I’mma dig deep but right now I’m OT in the studio

[Hook - Lil Wayne]

[Hook - Tyga]
Welcome to a sound to a sound I am loud
I am loud to a crowd and a crowd goes for miles
I am what I am to a fan I am him to him his profession
A legend I am
Welcome to a sound to a sound I am loud
I am loud to a crowd and a crowd goes for miles
I am what I am to a fan I am him to him his profession
A legend I am

[Verse 1 - Tyga]
I am what a faucet is to some water
Water and a chain when a chain
I’m a target, target to a stalker
Stalking not an option
Options got plenty of those many female partners
Pardon my nonsense
Time erased don’t take much often
Often are parties, party get nauseous
You nauseous be cautious, cause cautious can get you farther
My father was uh never around so some hard times tarnished
But I’m sorry

[Hook - Tyga]
Welcome to a sound to a sound I am loud

I am loud to a crowd and a crowd goes for miles
I am what I am to a fan I am him to him his profession
A legend I am

[Verse 2 - Tyga]
Mostly my writting is cake to the icing
Icing on a track, on a track I am lightning
Fast when I’m striking
Thunder when I’m fighting, fighting for this title
And the title reads idol
Idol from the biters, they bite it, plagiarize it
They playing when I’m grinding, grinding through a fire
To a fire I’m a lighter, to a picture I’m a striker
A Tyson when its violence, I’m solid
I am

[Hook - Tyga]
Welcome to a sound to a sound I am loud
I am loud to a crowd and a crowd goes for miles
I am what I am to a fan I am him to him his profession
A legend I am
Welcome to a sound to a sound I am loud
I am loud to a crowd and a crowd goes for miles
I am what I am to a fan I am him to him his profession
A legend I am

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I am junior, Young Mula, I am the boo to ya, boo ya spook ya
Kruger who I you are scary
You are very average like fucking missionary
And I am not, I very no comparey son daughter, I am Carter
I’m eating, I own my own restaurant
Dude go to the studio and hustle my food sure I am rude
But I am what I am, a black male that they can never blackmale crack sale hine hell triple beam scale
I am the best rapper alive and I hope the next rapper better than I, now what are you?

[Hook - Tyga]
Welcome to a sound to a sound I am loud
I am loud to a crowd and a crowd goes for miles
I am what I am to a fan I am him to him his profession
A legend I am

[Intro/Hook: *Frijid Pink sample* & Action Bronson]
{Know you broke my heart woman
When you said goodbye to me}
You say goodbye to me bitch, you better break north
Before you six south and I'll be sitting in that big house

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Just let me sharpen my knives, thrown on the apron
X's mark the steak and the salad crumbled with bacon
And bleu cheese, caramel complexion's on two knees
Or two skis, carving up the Alps is what this dude needs
I'm Rick the Model, Martel to cartel
Live fast and eat the big tuna like Billy Parcells
No more child's play kid you with the big boys
Fuck an economy size, we want that big Royce
My family's sayin' that I rhyme with fury
Only focus on them hundred bill faces and suitcases that'll bribe a jury
Grind the curry never shine the jewelry
Pussy like it 86 style, you know it's fine and furry
Spark the bark in the park, you know, lumberyard
You ain't never in the limelight, undercard
Bronsolini in the sky, thunder rod
Commandante of this rap shit, young Mossad, killer

[Intro/Hook: *Frijid Pink sample* & Action Bronson]
{Know you broke my heart woman
When you said goodbye to me}
You say goodbye to me bitch, you better break north
Before you six south and I'll be sitting in that big house

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
The second stanza even deadly than the first
From the birth, I've been enlisted to plant seeds in the earth
That's soon, road to a valley that feeds, civilization
I'm walking the torrid land though I'm seeking my vindication from
My bad, I'll keep it fifth grade, keep the switchblade
Hilfiger sailin' apparel and plus a crisp fade
First day class, the Agassis are black and white
My older cousin puffing pot bitch, pass the pipe
Now I'm a certified user, more like abuser
Slice and dice the music I'm fluid like the yakuza
Or Sanders whether Deion or Barry, find candy
Though I smoke until my eyes are the shape of Tia Carrere
My team we work as a unit, nobody hog the ball up
Great intuition and vision, no time to hit the mall up
Just a taste of the life like a September call up
Johnnie Walker in our tall cup, getting torn up
Listen, I'm steel fisted with the iron lung
Heavy metal ballads out the guitar where lions run
Praise the son that can stand on his own two
Smoke on the big blunt, take a sip of this home-brew

[Hook: *Frijid Pink sample*]
{Know you broke my heart woman
When you said goodbye to me}
Rip the earth in two with your mind
Seal the urge which ensues with brass wires
I never meant you any harm
But your tears feel warm as they fall on my forearm

But close my eyes for a while
Force from the world a patient smile

How can you say that your truth is better than ours?
Shoulder to shoulder, now brother, we carry no arms
The blind man sleeps in the doorway, his home
If only I had an enemy bigger than my apathy I could have won

But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all

Close my eyes for a while
Force from the world a patient smile

But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all
And you rip it from my hands
And you swear it's all gone
And you rip out all I have
Just to say that you've won

And you rip it from my hands
And you swear it's all gone
And you rip out all I have
Just to say that you've won
You've won

Well now you've won

But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all

Well now you've won

But I gave you all

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Fuck (fuck, fuck)
You know a nigga really don't wanna go to school today
Lemme call this bitch
Get my shit together

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
When I pull up we look so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
This one's for the g's all black Chucks on the cuffs of my jeans
King size papes stuffed full of trees, I be with the boss dogg ya'll fuck niggas fleas
Now they say I'm hot, hundred somethin' degrees
Taking pictures with a young nigga cheese
Remember days homey, I ain't had a thing
Now I'm hoping off the plane putting roaches on the wing
And my hoes like queens, but we smoke like kings
Jewelry froze like bling
Money come fast, yours slow like (lean)
Rolling up grass, sold weed to half the staff, so I know I'm gonna pass
Third period, showing up last
With a late note blowin' great smoke (laughs)

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
When I pull up we look so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
We blow to the middle of the day
Wiz say dawg put a little in a J
Hey, why not? Not why?
We fly, we ride, she high, he high, we high
Fuck it, everybody to the libary
Got a new batch, some blue - booberry
Stuck in the hallway, with a pass say dawg he just smoke all day
It's a mind game like Kareem I seem to keep migraines
Reaching balance and bitch I brang you limeaid
I'm so lifted, like a parachuter
My grass stay off day off Ferris Bueller
Slip away, dip away, almost had to throw a whole zip away
But fuck that, this Taylor Gang, what you want dog
Shit I'm on everythang

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
When I pull up we look so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
You niggas never had and you never will
You niggas never had and you never will
I said you niggas never had and you never will
Big Snoop and Wiz smoke with the kill (kill kill)
You niggas never had and you never will
You niggas never had and you never will
I said you niggas never had and you never will
Big Snoop and Wiz smoke with the kill (kill kill)

[Interlude: Snoop Dogg]
You niggers still in high-school, elementary ass niggas
Holla at me when you graduate
We be posted right by the 400 building
Room 420
Follow your nose, your nose knows (Haha)

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
When I pull up we look so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Niggas ain't hard like us
Niggas soft as doctors cotton swabs
You bitchin'?
Smoke somethin'
Come gather 'round people, wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times, they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times, they are a-changin'

Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times, they are a-changin'

The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now will later be last
For the times, they are a-changin'

Bad bitch, a flat stomach, fat booty, deep throat
Twenty grand in my pants, fifty in my peacoat

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I seen Jizzle in traffic with his top off

We throw them birdies in the pool make 'em swim a lap
Whip it counterclockwise, that's the backstroke
Bitch my chain so big look like my back broke
Yeah we 'bout to fuck the city up, go broke
Bitch I'm balling so hard I need the whole court
Six spots in one night they call it club hopping

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I. & Young Jeezy]

[T.I.]

Got a O of presidential, bitch I'm blowin' that Obama

[Young Jeezy]
Yeah I'm talkin' plenty choppers, scopes on the A-R

When I came up out the womb all I wanna be a star
Hope the feds don't stop me, life sentence in the car

[T.I.]
Hey boy we spittin, reminiscin' bout when we was in the kitchen

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Come, you masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks

[Verse 2]
You that never done nothing
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

[Verse 3]
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

[Verse 4]
You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
While the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
While the young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

[Verse 5]
You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

[Verse 6]
How much do I know
To talk out of turn?
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

[Verse 7]
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness?
Do you think that it could?
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

[Verse 8]
And I hope that you die
And your death will come soon
I will follow your casket
By the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead

[Part I: House of Balloons]

[Intro]
Uh, oh, ayy, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Been on another level since you came, no more pain
You look into my eyes, you can't recognize my face
You're in my world now, you can stay, you can stay
But you belong to me, ooh, you belong to me

[Chorus]
If it hurts to breathe, open a window (Woo-ooh)
Oh, your mind wants to leave (Leave), but you can't go
Oh, this is a happy house (A happy house)
We're happy here (We're happy here)
In a happy house
Oh this is fun, fun, fun, fun
Fun, fun, fun, fun
Fun, fun, fun, fun

[Verse 2]
Music got you lost
Nights pass so much quicker than the days did
Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
This place will burn you up
But, baby, it's okay, them my niggas next door
And they working in the trap, so get naughty if you want
So don't blame it on me that you didn't call your home
So don't blame it on me, girl, 'cause you wanted to have fun

[Chorus]
If it hurts (Woo) to breathe
Open a window (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, your mind wants to leave but you can't go (Ooh)
This is a happy house
We're happy here in a happy house
Oh this is fun, fun, fun, fun (This is fun)
Fun, fun, fun, fun (This is fun to me)
Fun, fun, fun, fun (Ooh)

[Part II: Glass Table Girls]

[Segue]
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 7

[Verse 3]
Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies 'cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah, I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
"Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, man, get to know me
Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables (Ooh, ooh)
Bring the 707 out
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables (Ooh, ooh)
Bring the 707 out
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la) (Ooh, ooh)
Bring the 707 out
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Bring the 707 out (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Bring the 707 out (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Bring the 707 out (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Ooh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Intro: DJ Drama]
We back at it, the wait is over
Dr. Dre, T.I.P.,
This shit is special

[Verse 1: T.I.]
See a party ain't a party 'til the Doc walk in it
It's hard to get it started 'til I hopped off in it
Then it got so crunk one minute
Since you didn't get to witness, just listen
I came in hot, and then I saw
As soon as I arrived then the shit popped off
The shit popped off
It's officially a gangsta party
You can leave, if she came to party
Then the shit popped off (popped off)
Shit popped off (popped off)
Niggas hands in the air, bitches takin' tops off
Put the chronic in the air, and the shit popped off

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
It's been awhile since you've heard these beats
You're malnourished
But he's back now, to flood these streets
They shall flourish
Others try but they lack courage
In fact, this track was on the back burner, it leaked
So back to the lab I had to go
But it was too magical, so
Here, doctor smack a ho's back, ask if it's tactical, (sure is)
Girl, I hope your vaginal has endurance
Cause I'm about to do somethin' tragical
Rest assure this
Cause homie hit the OE flow, you know me from before
But you don't know me like this, so do see do
Get on top of me and ride it like a rodeo, ho
I'll have you OD'ing on dick, this belong to your soul
Felonious, I'll kill your loneliness
But only just for, one night
Yeah that was fun, right? But I gotta go
I got a bottle of Mo and fo' mo' lil' mommy's
Lookin' like models, waitin' at the do' inside of my ho-tel
All ready to swallow and yo, follow the flow and traffic to the top flo'
And you gonna smell a lot of Merlot, a lot of chronic for sho'
Gin and tonic sold from the top to the bottom, let's go

[Hook: Unknown and (Dr. Dre)]
Order some more bottles, come on momma
Would you like a drink on me?
To me it's no problem if you wanna, baby come and drink with me
(She take it off at the do', she take it off for the do'
Get that ass on the flo', go, go)
To me, there's no problem if you wanna, baby come drink with me

[Verse 3: T.I]
Bright lights, late nights
Drop auto-mobiles outside hotels with a lot of hoes
Bottles poured, blow a lot of dro, no powder though
Everywhere you tryin' to go, I been a long time ago
Swag done surpassed, my style is so spazz, I pop tags daily
Drop Phantom, four eighty
Walk up in the place, and all the ladies go crazy
Want to get impregnated but all they need is throat babies
They runnin' up and askin'
"Is it true you know Shady
Dr. Dre be hangin' out with you, for real?" Ho chill
Like a magnet attracted to a nigga gettin' money
I tell 'em, "Kneel down, suck a nigga dick or somethin'"
Rubberband poppin' off the bank roll
Hoppin' out the champagne Rolls, with the automatic do's
Pockets on swoll, both wrists so froze
King of the South, balls out on the West Coast
Let's toast

[Hook: Unknown Dr. Dre]
Order some more bottles, come on momma
Would you like a drink on me? (drinks on me)
To me it's no problem if you wanna (baby come and drink with me)
She take it off at the do', she take it off for the do'
Get that ass on the flo', go, go
To me, there's no problem if you wanna, baby come drink with me
You can have the time of your life, it's alright
Make it a night to remember (remember), how couldn't you remember? (remember)
You can have the time of your life, it's alright
Make it a night to remember (remember), how couldn't you remember? (remember)

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Yes, yes
Think about it
Who brought the gangsta shit to the party
Aftermath, better than ever

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey, big bank, a lotta gwalla (yeah)
They ain't bout a dolla? I ain't tryin' to holla
'96 Impala buckets under that
On automatic status, we ain't havin' none of that
Hey watch it partna, stay out my lane
Everybody fuckin' with my campaign
Get dough or get lost, shawty always
Like Dro say, ho fuck with me the long way
And I deliver long john son, I don't play
Poppin' out before the sun come, I don't stay
They say bullshit walk, and cash talk
That's why I'm ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth (yeah)
I'm goin' in, finna spazz out
A nigga got a problem, we can air it out
They say bullshit walk, and cash talk
That's why I'm ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth

[Hook x2]
Goin' in, ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth
Goin' in, ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth
Pockets on loud mouth, pockets on loud mouth
Pockets on loud mouth, pockets on loud mouth (yeah)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Woke up this morning with a bank roll
I be gettin' head like a Kangoo
Got your girl sellin' pussy to my tango
What, she so wet, think I'm gonna need a rain coat
On 285 doing 85!
Couple hoes in my stable, time to stabilize
Check the time, I better say mine bitches
Need a sign on my dick that say "Fine Bitches"
And you know I'm throwed like five pitchers
And you know I'm high like five Swishas
Jay's used to say "what up Slim?"
Cause they know I'm known to make that work cartwheel
Hot wheel, hot steel, ride around my block still
Even if it's winter time, I'm ridin' in a drop still
You don't have an idea of the life that I live
Pockets so loud, got them bitches doin' adlibs
I'm goin' in, finna spazz out
Nigga got a problem, we can air it out
They say bullshit walk, and cash talk

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: T.I.]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
What's that, excuse me, look, shawty, who are y'all

In the penthouse, getting turnt out
Curtain closed, candles burning 'til they burnt out

[Hook]

Gotta pill in a bottle for the rod for a ho
Sweet heart to a lady, still hard on a ho
Thank god for my lady I know they be on that radio wiling
While we chilling somewhere on an island, smiling
On a big yacht is he really that hot

Bitches hoppin on my dick, 'fore I hop up out the car
Walk away with 5 or 6 as im passing by the bars
See im tuggin on my zipper as I fire up my cigar
Lets get this straight, you go get naked get it crackin till tomorrow

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Yeah we in the same book, but I'm on another page (capeesh)
King off the leash out the cage on the streets
Kill niggas like AIDS, cut bitches like blades
Shine always, fuck you when whatever y'all say
Bitch nigga I'm paid even when I'm locked up
Heard nigga went broke, well shawty not us
Caught a case, did a bid, they say shawty washed up
To a bitch, bullshit then shawty popped off in yo motherfucking town
Just to show it's going down
My brother and my lil cousin got you lady goin round
Nigga I dont want her, I'm so superior by far
She'll never see the inside of my car

[Hook]

[Chorus: Future]
Hey I think I seen a ghost
Half a million dollar car, ain't even got no note
Bitches layin' on the bed, bitches on the flo'
Money to the ceiling, money come and money go
I think I seen a ghost, I think I seen a ghost
Hamiltons and Franklins, they come in every show
Money to the ceiling, how you love you can go
Graveyard in my pockets, dead presidents to blow
I think I'm seeing ghosts

[Verse 1: Future]
Money burning in my hand while I'm still counting
We put drivers in the seats, I'm in the back lounging
My bitch she don't even speak no English when she come in town and
I'm seeing dead people, man I got like four accountants
It's all my yayo in that pot we need a water fountain
We put that yayo in the East and in Fulton County' (?)
I'm counting dirty money, I don't need no help to count it
It had blood, it had sweat on it when I found it
I'm going higher than a elevator out the country
I do whatever for that paper, it ain't on my country
I went to sleep inside a ghost, I think it was a phantom
Man I get rock and roll high, dog I'm off the channel
I got sixty racks on me just in case she want to gamble
And I go crazy with that back, it ain't nothing I can't handle
I'm in my room with the light off, burning candles
Youngest nigga with the set, repping Atlanta

[Chorus: Future]
Hey I think I seen a ghost
Half a million dollar car, ain't even got no note
Bitches layin' on the bed, bitches on the flo'
Money to the ceiling, money come and money go
I think I seen a ghost, I think I seen a ghost
Hamiltons and Franklins, they come in every show
Money to the ceiling, how you love you can go
Graveyard in my pockets, dead presidents to blow
I think I'm seeing ghosts

[Verse 2: T.I.]
His money timid, hear motherfuckers talk money
I inhale bills, breathe Gs, cough money
I'm still making cake even when I lost money
A multimillionaire, stil lspending soft money
I'm balling way above par, got golf money
The bus full of duffel bags and that's all money
You wonder what my motivation? Bro, it been money
Make extra jet cause my little mama love to spend money
We Texas Hold 'Em, rolling dice with your rent money
Get out my face and fuck your life if you ain't getting money
Say boy, I spend the money you're trying to make
Sell 100 Gs and it's sad to say
Big dough, I get that
In a fear? Push your shit back
I'm arrogant and I'm cocky cause I got a graveyard in my pocket
Spent 100K on my chain and a couple mill on my watch here
My chick ride in that car you in
This city, I argue in
Get big money, no little dough
See dead presidents, real ghosts

[Chorus: Future]
Hey I think I seen a ghost
Half a million dollar car, ain't even got no note
Bitches layin' on the bed, bitches on the flo'
Money to the ceiling, money come and money go
I think I seen a ghost, I think I seen a ghost
Hamiltons and Franklins, they come in every show
Money to the ceiling, how you love you can go
Graveyard in my pockets, dead presidents to blow
I think I'm seeing ghosts

[Verse 3: Rocko]
Boo! That's the look on the haters face when I pull up in the ghost like Casper
Ooh! That's what your boo said when she snuck a peek at me right before we got ghost
On my chopper with a chopper, they call me Ghost Rider
I swear my pen dripping, I should be a ghostwriter
I see them suckers, I get ghost
I don't fuck with busters
Too busy sitting ghost, you know how that goes
Give me more, Demi Moore
Yeah I ghost that work
Whip it like Goldberg
Yeah I ghost that word
Heavyweight, Goldberg, I'm a wrestler, ho
Clothesline that bankroll, I be wrestling ghosts
Chauffeur find our way back, trunk passengers ghost
Got his cash from Green Bay, ghost ride the whip
Hey man, Hallelujah in my True Religion denims
Yeah, Rocko do the most, pocket hundred full of ghosts

[Chorus: Future]
Hey I think I seen a ghost
Half a million dollar car, ain't even got no note
Bitches layin' on the bed, bitches on the flo'
Money to the ceiling, money come and money go
I think I seen a ghost, I think I seen a ghost
Hamiltons and Franklins, they come in every show
Money to the ceiling, how you love you can go
Graveyard in my pockets, dead presidents to blow
I think I'm seeing ghosts

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Automatic bullet flow
Uzi, Calico
Ladies man, Yeah, but to that pussy I'm a bully tho
Beat it, eat it, let it go
Retarded, stupid, silly tho
This city been on life support
I'm gonna get out and kill it tho
Really tho, off the chain
Getting it, doing heavy things
Stuntin out the frame
Still to bust a nigga cabin mayne
God like Charlamagne
In the A the hottest thing
Ever hit it, ever did it, most these niggas garbage mayne
I ain't finna front, nigga lame if you ask me
I'm way in the front, run shit, no athlete
Passionly, nigga watch my smoke as I go and get money to the top I go
Tell you get dough, nigga stop I know the housekeeper get more
Now come and mop my floor

[Hook]
Sittin' up high, small money we don't see no
Stupid, dumb fly ask yo bitch, nigga she know
Nigga know my stylo, swagg on G O
Shittin on yo pride nigga pissin'on yo ego
We be pissin' on yo ego, pissin' on yo ego
We shittin' on yo pride nigga pissin'on yo ego
We be pissin'on yo ego, pissin'on yo ego
Sucka hate it, we know but we pissin'on yo ego

[Verse 2: B.o.B.]
I'm back up on my rap shit, you bastards got it backwards
Got it twisted and exaggerated
Stretched out: elastics
You niggas ain't on my radar!
I bypass niggas, no gastric
I pull up front in that monster truck
And I park that shit Jurrassic
Got a drunk bitch on my mattress
Doing backflips, gymnastics
She holding on to that monkey bar
Yelling out my name: no ad-libs
Niggas get mad at us for what?
We live out life at the after-party
Don't come at me with that ego shit
I piss on that like a port-o-potty
This beat is retarded so therefore my flow is autistic
Come on down to Bobby's World
You and your friend oughta visit
Flow like I'm on a mission
So there is no competition
It's looking like hunting season
And we in the slaughter business

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Ball hard: pavement
Broads in amazement
Large money talking, I ain't gotta make a statement
My impatient grind, I'm taking mine
I ain't finna wait for mine
Anybody wanna shine, I suggest you wait in line
I'm chasing dime paper
But for these haters I don't break a stride
Defecating on your pride, make you commit suicide
Do or die, who am I?
Bullet hit the Bulls-eye
I'm doin' my thing, Say I ain't my nigga you a lie
Do it by the hood, I grew up to say what's up
And all the real niggas know me, I don't need no introduction
Bulletproof truck with a couple cute sluts in the back
Doin everything I ask for a wrap whats that
They handle that and I stroke that cat so good I get my money back

[Hook]

[Verse 1: T.I.]
K-I-N-G
Solomon, Henry
Ridin' in the Bentley
They wanna send me, back to the pen
Hope they give me a ten P
Doin' it for my dog, with some case are pending
And my folk behind the waterboard city, keep it pimpin'
Tell them hatin'-ass law, bitch I'm ballin come and get me
See Tip go by, in the whip, no lie
Didn't need no wheel cause that shit so fly
Up, up and away, so far up at the top I sit
My air so thin, need oxygen
I'm so fucked up, intoxicants
My flow still so stupid, incompetent
Competition evidently don't know what they up against
Obviously oblivious, in the city I'm serious
I'm seriously poppin', I will be the reason why it's hot in here
Material you droppin' better push that back, that can't come out this year
I got this here, can't stop this, got this like I got blocks in here
Hit the VIP, all eyes on me like they think Pac in here
I'm ignorant, belligerent, a gangsta and a gentleman
Pay niggas no concern, ain't no DiGornio, I'm deliverin'
Center of attention, my P.O. just threw a wrench in my
Plan of execution, I'm demandin' retribution
First trip to prison, a lesson, second was just a nuisance
Peckerwood beefin' with me, they want my neck in a noose
'Cause they see a nigga's influence, luxurious and affluent
They want the king destroyed, see your majesty ruined
Nah, nothin' doin' brah, congratulations you have a
Really great advantage point, so take your vantage point
Watch, with the flip of a coin
The one they counted out soon become the nigga to join
Don't listen to the gossipers 'cause them niggas annoyin'
They speak what I know and think it's over for them (Boing!)
I bounce back, in a Boeing I fly high
With ten chicks, got high in sha la
Niggas stay talkin' all that caca
No mucho dinero? No hablar
About my dollar Givenchy, Balenciaga
How automatic my chopper, they want some problems, I got 'em BYE!

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
I'll show niggas better than tell niggas
Panel discussions 'bout Push, I never fail niggas
Combat Jack, Lindstrom, what the hell niggas?
This the new God flow, the Holy Grail niggas
Can't see me, Book of Eli, it's in Braille niggas
I'm on track to be the best, I won't derail niggas
I bend bars on bitches, I unveil nigga
OfficiallyIce, don’t at ‘em, show and tell nigga
Say my brother better? Big deal
Big brother, so fuck you, he hammer, can't touch him
Ride around, nigga, AMG mufflers, second fiddle to my own gene pool
We laugh about it, that's cool
I'm at the top and he better?
If you think about it, we rule
My life is an open book
My stuntin' is an open look
These gold chains, these stone rings
This cocaine that I overcooked
I overcame on Novacane, I Frank Ocean'd that fishscale
I tip scales, I tip hoes, I skip jail on my tip toes
I beat the odds, bet Tip knows, my top back and my wrist froze
And these ice cubes on my ear lobes
Like strobe lights on a fish bowl
Supreme ballers, dope dealers, shot callers
G.O.O.D. Music, Grand Hustle, what the block taught us

[Intro]
Some people call it being soft
Some people call it bitching out
I call it me being the bigger man then you think I am

[Chorus]
I got the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
And unless I want to let it all go
I just gotta be more careful x3

[Verse 1]
Yeah, and you already know I feel
Shit, I almost forgot how good the lies feel
'Cause when you think you're on top if the world
You come to realize your standing in some high heels
So that Nuvo got me popping shit
And even worse nobody around me is knocking it
'Cause they don’t say what's on their mind
Until I say what's on mine, and now they trying just to stop the shit
Cause to them it's just the ego
But I'm a straight shooter so they call me for the free throws
Now most days rocking hard with the chicos
But I still got a nine and some green like Geno
And in order for me to live right, I gotta change
But after five years of being hated on I got deranged
I live good, but homie I ain’t got the range
I make the 6-4 go up and down like the stock exchange

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Okay, they say my girl look regular
But having a bad bitch don’t make you better bruh
And she don’t diss me like your bitch ass
She’ll let me fuck your girl and even help me spread that bitch ass
And you want me to fuck the best girl
But the model hoes get sideways like a s curl
And I don’t get attitude I get respect
'Cause she was with me three years before I got a check
So I can keep my girl and live happy on the boat
Or a freaky fine bitch that’ll have me going broke
But I'll never leaver her, 'cause she a go-getter
Even if she go to Hell, I'mma go with her
And you bitches hating on her because she light skinned
But look at the fucking industry that I'm in
I'm the only artist with dark girls in my videos
So a bad attitude and a dick is what I give you hoes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Alright, so lets talk about the Jay shit
Some days I wish that I ain't never say shit
And Diddy said there ain't no excuse for what I did
But I felt like he was knocking the same shit that feed my kids
I do music 'cause I need it to make my world spin
So when you down it, it's like you dissing my girlfriend
And Jay one of the only niggas I hear bringing it
So I didn’t think that he would even entertain the shit
Because entertainment is see through
But if you really feel like I'm dead, then nigga me too
I ain't trying to write your rhyme
But you could’ve skip one DJ
And all you had to say was "T-pain, we cool."
But by all mean don’t take it as a diss or hating
I just want to explain my side of the situation
So if you knew just how much respect I had
You know I'm a real nigga when I say...my bad

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah
I'm just a real nigga man
I don’t sugar coat nothing
Anything I say I stand by it so
You can hear my reasons and you can think what you think but
I'm gonna be a real nigga regardless of what's going on
You know what I'm saying?
Revolver, coming at you man
Yeah, Nappy Boy

[Intro: Young Dro & Travis Porter]
TP: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
YD: Okay. Aye they ain't gon like this shit right here
TP: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
YD: Aye Tip, check this out, aye, push it. Travis Porter what's hannin', push it!

[Hook: Travis Porter]
I'm in at Hot Wheel and I'm driving real fast
And I'm smashing on the gas, I'm tryna do the dash
Hot Wheel: got 200 on the dash
Man I'm driving real fast, I'm tryna do the dash
Push it! (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Push it! (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)

[Verse 1: Strap (of Travis Porter)]
I'm in a hot wheel til I light this here
Tap my bitch she switch my gear
Diamond shining they all clear
PHMG they all here
Tattoos they all over me
She see me kissin all on my tip
He say I'm a rookie nigga, I been doing it for years
He say I'm a rookie nigga, I been doing it for years
Better take a look at me, better check my booking fee
I been cooking shit off in the kitchen but I ain't Lil' B
Pull up in a Hot Wheel, bitch need a green card
All-red candy paint, nigga this your dream car
I'm that muthafuckin nigga all the bitches scheme for
When she with me, she be hoping all her girlfriends seen her
She suck a dick so good, but why you think she on my team for
I got her dancing slow, in slow mo like she on lean or something
Smoking on that dro, got that ho drinking semen
Hear me coming down the street: 'Rari, screaming
Pinky ring doing numbers, shining, blinging
Ink all on my body and I'm hotter than a demon

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Hold on let me rip this ho
Car so fast I flipped that ho
Tell them boys don't play with Dro
Pause that bitch, skip that ho
Black coat let my coupe in here
Decapitate my roof in here
The reason why they ask for Dro cuz they wanted the truth in here
Just like Star, I'm rockin ya
Roll up wrong I'm poppin ya
I knew something was fishy going on like tilapia
You ain't fuckin with pimpin though
My wrist blow up like indigo
I like a model bitch but I would rather Oprah Winfrey though
The richest bitch up in this bitch
My paint flop and then flip in this
My Glock it got a clip in it
My car so wet it's drippin shit
They copy me like Kinko do
Diamond chain, one pink one blue
Car so fast, my speakers on blast
Don't race me boy, I'm shittin on you
Hold up they can't take this shit
I spaz out with no brakes and shit
I'm Bosco with this cake and shit
Congo dro, ape and shit
I saw yo broad and took that bitch
Wassup with all that liquor shit?
You see these horses on my car
'Rari bitch I'm pushin it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I'm mindin mine, in 599s
New Ferraris, know that I'm ballin ho
400,000 in public housing, This is all louder than a blunt of dro
Through Atlantic station I'm pushin
Every corner I'm hookin
Bad bitches just lookin
Tryna throw me that pussy
Say what happened baby I can't
Cause them niggas cool, but they ain't shawty
Wrist froze and I can't thaw it
Hundred mil well that ain't hard, I'm hard
As a muthafucka, swear to God, I'm God
To the trap niggas and dope boys...pause
Blow a half a mil just cause, ball
Money ain't a thang, not at all
Drink the lean and get kool-aid
Get high on pills for like 2 days
Fresh to death in that Louis
Diamonds clearer than Blu-ray
Aye! Ain't no fugazi, I'm too major, I'm super paid
Say 30 mil, you better double that
That money short then we double back
Got rubber bands around 30 racks
I'm trouble man so where the trouble at?
I got a truck load of them hood rats
I'm pushin' through, where your hood at?

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
You gonna do something to who (who) what (what) when (when) never that
If they got a problem, tell em call me, we can settle that
Matter fact, you ain't gotta tell em, I'll tell em that (I'll tell em)
And if these niggas' hiding, we gon' slide up where they motha' at
Ak-47 with the double strap
Have your sister at the funeral, bring my brother back
Just for fucking with the wrong one
Ya, I got a short temper, but I got a long gun
Call the mac the chicken wing cause it got its own drum
I know these niggas' sick of me cause I done had a long run
Countin' all this money (money) fucking all these hoes (hoes)
They was looking at me funny cause I pulled up in the rose (rose)
Y'all good for talkin' on Twitter (Twitter)
We good for sparkin' on niggas' (sparkin')
Broad day walk up on a niggas'
Had a homicide unit put the chalk up on niggas'

[Hook: T.I.]
Hey you gon' do somethin' to who, what, when
You say you want it with who, what, when
Them shots is comin' at who, what, when
You was sayin' that to who, what, when fuck nigga
You better get that fuck shit off ya mind
Cause Imma up that strap, you crossed the line
Make examples out you niggas' start spreadin' the news
When I shoot you gon' enjoy upside your head with them twos

[Verse 2: T.I.]
You want to find me, you can find me at the top of the list
Said if they ever let me in, I wouldn't stop it for shit
You see that motivation, make you say I'm cocky as shit
Whatever, fuck it, tell em suck a hippopotamus dick
Nowadays, play how could I possibly get I'm getting paid
Get out the Maybach and go hop in the jet
Know they hat in on the rise and the cheddar I spend
And the fact that I'm looking' fly in whatever I'm in
Most of you big niggas' soft like the Michelin man
When you see a lil nigga standing with a pistol in hand
Kept me off stage rappin with my dick in my hand
Tryna distinguish the difference between a bitch and a fan
I done been broke once homie, never again
Cause I sold dope once and I'll sell it again
First week 500, I'll sell it again
Tell the mice make way and let Elvis in

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Booke]
I'm ballin' half around, half a jet, nigga pound for pound
Only time we showin' up, the shut this mothafucka down
Ridin' round in the Kia, no spare tires
Chopper round shots fired, nigga, flat lines
Zip came to it and keep the powder savoral
Drive by's on dirt bike with Meek Milli O
Crow rock shells, I bleach em and watch em fade away
And leave a nigga block wetter than a rainy day
What's beef? Beef is when you scared to leave the crib
Guzzi and he inspired for some of the dolla mill
I'm worth mills and I beat a nigga ass still
Ya'll niggas get wasted I ain't talkin' spilled beers
School of hard knocks, I'm a hate a cheetah
One ya a dick sucka get your head up with the nina
And YM still strapped snookin with the cleava
Ya best bet to run the other way when I see ya

[Hook]

[Hook: T.I.]

Break a bitch heart, no future; Miss Cleo
Snapback, au-au-automatic reload

And I put it in her hole, hole-in-one, putt putt
Aughh! Su-Super McNasty
Why you McLovin when the bitch call me daddy?
Pimp, no caddy, she wish she never had me
Treat her like a dog (dog) called the bitch Lassie (hah!)
Young savvy, bang her like Cincinnati
Above average, f-fly like I’m Aladdin
They bend backwards, thr-throw the pussy at them
I’m Ben Wallace, dunk up in your basket (haha)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Mama, there go that monster
Abracadabra, Magic Johnson
My motherfucking doctor said I need a doctor
So I called House, now I am a pill popper
Faded like skinnys, Young Money we winning
I told her if I change, she won’t get a penny
Milking this shit, pregnant bitch titties
Bringing home the bacon, I’m fucking Miss Piggy
Loaded like a semi, send me naked pictures
She knows my dick, she call that nigga Richard
Prior to me cumming, I had to stick my thumb in
Her ass one time, smell my finger, make you vomit
Flyer than a hornet, the shoe fit; I worn it
She tried to jack me off, can’t beat it, join it
Tunechi, coochie, that what she call it
Flag, scarlet, I killed it, mourning

[Chorus: Tyga & Lil Wayne]
I’m faded, faded, faded ,faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded (yeah)

Thirty-five, forty-four, niggas know we get the show
Pusherman with the kilos, iPhone full of freak hoes
Fuck you mean we ain't wild? We crowd surf at the pre-shows
She fuckin' Pretty Flacko, she want that Pretty Flacko
It's beef, I'm splittin' your taco, you niggas out of your nachos
Cause bad bitches, man, I got those

And I pop hoes, got a drop Rolls
With a snot nose, in my condo

She'll do anything for daddy man the bitch go

Uh, Pyrex and a digi-scale
Fuck gloves I got yayo all in my fingernails
And I can leave a set of white fingerprints
Chris Tucker, Larenz Tate, Dead Presidents
Dead white boys spread across the coffee table
I don't know maybe I'll start me up a record label
Fuck it get high and call what's her name
She like to play this little game called fuck a brain
Lord when you talk them numbers sound sophisticated
It ain't nothing even the pit-bull's affiliated
Yeah, the trespasser's getting bust on
G shit even the coupe's got Chucks on

[Snoop Dogg + Chorus]
Yeah
This is my mother fuckin' house nigga
This is where I do it at
You got a problem with that?
Yeah big dog nigga
If you ain't a big dog stay on the porch nigga
Dog house or nothing
Dog house everything nigga

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I got a whole house trap house and a flat
I'm on parole bitch so I need my pistol back
These rap niggas is too soft
I built this from the ground, pound up
Until I knock your roof off
New boss Snoop off and on and
Heed him in the morning catch him while he yawning
My bitch is on the phone and my homies 'bout to zone in
Cracky smacky dippy whippy habitual potential
Strip for your credentials
Mental unessential, shit's official like a referee with a whistle
Nah my nigga shit's official, like a Jihad, Muslim with a missile
Catch me in the air we close to the nickel block
Nigga went platinum but I still serve that nickel rock
Hard times, bad times, fuck doing jail time
Cook it up rock it up bag it up and sell mine

[E-40: + Chorus]
This my mother fuckin' house
Take your mother fuckin' shoes off when you step in my house partner
Matter of fact take your hat off too
Nigga this the round table nigga
If you can't stand the heat get your punk ass up out the kitchen
I'm in the mother fucking room

[Verse 3: E-40]
This is my house in the middle of the trap
Open this door I'm sweating like I ran a fucking lap
Customers on hold stressing they keep coming back
3 6 5 2 4 7 I got Jumbo Jacks
Would you like your cheese with that
Yeah I like my cheese with that
Crack in the pot, round the clock
Open all night hitching blocks
Serving that doop stuck in my loop
Pitching that tragic all in the traffic
Me and my group, me and my cabinet
Fillin' the coop, pick it and bag it
I got the key to this spot break in, you gonna get popped
Fuck around and get molly-whopped in here
Better not attract no cops
I got another round chopped up in here
Who want what I got in stock?
Not from Atlanta but I got hawks
Chickens, birdies, quails, baking soda scales
Heavy weights exhale, 5 star hotels
I'm a grinder about my grit
Trying to increase my profit quick
50 thou under the couch
This is my mother fucking house

[Chorus]
This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking
This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house
This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking
This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house
This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking
This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house
This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking
This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house
This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking
This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house
This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking
This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house
This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking
This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house
This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking
This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house

[Hook: Lady G]
In a nutshell, I'm the shit off in this bitch
The reason all the bad bitches switch off in this bitch
I'm flyer than a rocket, lift off up in this bitch
Everybody on their toes, I'm on my tip off in this bitch
In a nutshell, we getting money, cracking bitches
Paparazzi has their cameras snapping, taking pictures
Maserati snatchin 60 down the residential
I can tell from your reaction you don't know nobody realer
In a nutshell

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Shawty I'm so far gone
Redhead and a blonde on each arm
Lanvin, Louboutin, Maison Margiela
They be blogging about what I got on, debating where they sell 'em
I tell 'em, even if you find 'em, you ain't finna get 'em
My swagger on Beretta: (click click) Pow! Get 'em
Boy I'm all about that balling
I just flossed a stunt but I don't front
Damn this shit they talking about
Bitch, I ain't got it because I don't want it
Sex on the Beamer, arrogant demeanor
She say she ain't freaking, bet I turn her like Tina
Mills on deck, got that check, no FEMA
Looking at my net like overlooking the marina
Them machines out front in the valet, not the alley
In my Ballys cracking bitches from the valley out in Cali
With that bread, I'm a beast, you don't know about me?
National Geographic did a show about me

[Hook: Lady G]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Man, ain't nobody on my level
Just ask that new Bugatti or them diamonds in my bezel
I throw a ho a mazi I don't give a shit about it
Party with me, I collect the hottest bodies as a hobby
Fly as I can be, need no copilot
The bomb, kill shit dead, kamikaze
Better watch me though, I'm definitely popping, that I'm certain of
We grand hustle playboys, partner, ain't no work in us
All the money we throwing, they reimbursing us
Get 'em to the crib and fill their pussies, not their purses up
Need no dress rehearsal, bruh, I'm fresh as shit, it's effortless
Amazing hoes, impressing bitches: "Tip is just the best at this!"

[Hook: Lady G]

[Verse 3: Spodee]
I'm a stunner, kill 'em without a lama
They callin' me paris hunter whenever in Ferragamo
They love me in California, they feel him in Arizona
I got hoes so bad, I wanna drill 'em without a condom
I fill 'em up in the Hummer, I fill 'em up with the mali
Keep 'em off of the white and fill 'em up with the rati
I'm a Eastside Gotti with a beachside hottie (yeah)
It's always on me, I got a discreet sign, shottie
Since I've been getting bigger, I picked up a couple hobbies
Now I like to fly, now I like Ducatis
First I was just hot, now I'm like wasabi
In a nutshell, nigga, I'm the shit to everybody

[Hook: Lady G]

[Intro]
Harry Fraud

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Every day a different car ride, a ticket on the plane
All the sudden all these people don't be treatin' me the same
Treatin' hoes like a bon voyage, see 'em tomorrow
The second that you wake up, baby, I'ma be gone
I got all the time, I got so much to do
I'm not losin' my mind out here fuckin' with you
Tryin' to travel overseas, blowin' smoke in Costa Rica
Beat gettin' walked on, the sole that's on my sneaker
Keep up, we after the tippy, no ballerina
Rock a show, they say "Eureka," start to do the Macarena
Chiddy, I see ya, we turn 'em to believers
Smoke and get high, it'll open your eyes
I'm tryna do my thing
Figure out who the jokers around and who the kings
Maybe one day, fuck it, never say never (Hey)
For the bars, it's my pleasure, this the best day ever, motherfucker

[Chorus: Asia & Chiddy]
What on earth are you doing here, in the western world?
(Yeah, mic check, one-two)
Another situation, yeah, you're a different girl (Hey, okay)
What on earth are you doing here, in the western world?
(I got you, Mac)
Another situation, yeah, you're a different girl (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Chiddy]
We live a fast life, no one told us 'bout the speed limit
We in the UK steady smokin' weed in it
This my Ducati flow, kill tracks, I body those
We player, stay in Vegas at the Bellagio
I'm gone, adios
See what you made me do?
Just go and kill some shit, crazy too
The flow is evil, nigga, Chucky's bride
Pride never tucked aside
When I was just a superstar in my mother's eyes
What changed the brother skies
A slight forecast
If I kill these verses I can get some more cash
The expensive shit, we someday could afford that
I'm on the plane and they probably couldn't board that
I like the way you brought me down and it brought me up
It's early mornin', but I'm steamin', nigga, coffee cup
Yeah, just know I'm holdin' a prize
Before you know it, I'm fire, why won't you open your eyes?

[Chorus: Asia]
What on earth are you doing here, in the western world?
Another situation, yeah, you're a different girl
What on earth are you doing here, in the western world?
Another situation, yeah, you're a different girl

[Chorus]
What if I never make it?
What if I'm never famous?
What if, I'm broke
And my whole life been a joke?
What if nothin' ever happen?
What if I gotta stop rappin'?
What if, what if, what if this is it?

[Verse 1]
What if I never get the chance tell the world what I gotta say?
And when I die, all I do is just ride away
I try and talk about my life in every song
So you have a little somethin' to remember when I'm gone
I tell it like it is, I ain't pretendin' that I'm on
But I tell you that I'm workin' and I'm gettin' very strong
It won't be long 'til you hear me on the radio
But in my head, I got ways to go
But I'ma take it slow, businesses is the way to blow
So any place I go, I know my bank can roll
The old heads are schoolin' me, I'm takin' notes
I am hip-hop, it replaced my soul
If I sink to the bottom, then I'ma make a float
I heard the real world's cold, I'ma take a coat
Be prepared, and be aware 'cause failure ain't really even there

[Chorus]
What if I never make it?
What if I'm never famous?
What if, I'm broke
And my whole life been a joke?
What if nothin' ever happen?
What if I gotta stop rappin'?
What if, what if, what if this is it?

[Verse 2]
Expectations peakin', they wonder what I'm 'bout to do
Spark interest, music, I can count on you, right?
But do I have it all twisted? I went from popular to misfit in an instant
My friends forgot me 'cause they probably seen me hardly
In the lab when I should be out at a party
It drive me crazy, and money is the fuel
Insomniac, awake, findin' somethin' I can do to put the work in
And I'm certain that I'm flirtin' with the fame
Failure gettin' jealous, throwin' dirt upon my name
Burnin' up my brain, but I'm workin' through my pain
'Cause life's hard 'til you learn it's just a game
Play your cards, use your letters on your Scrabble board
If you small, put your heart into your rappin' more
No money? Why the fuck you countin' for?
A thousand truants tryin' to get up my allowance more

[Chorus]
What if I never make it?
What if I'm never famous?
What if, I'm broke
And my whole life been a joke?
What if nothin' ever happen?
What if I gotta stop rappin'?
What if, what if, what if this is it?

[Intro]
Soundwave, I feel we, put together
Some of the most beautiful music my nigga
Real talk, feels so good
Let's get this money
I feel like rapping tonight people
Can I rap a little?
Don't be mad..

[Chorus]
Cuz I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward

[Verse 1]
Look, why I always feel that I'm hot?
Why I always feel I should drop another jewel
Like Martin on Blue Streak while you dudes get tattooed
With permanent scars, I'm always bullying y'all
I'm always righteous to think that life is what you make it
I'm always thinking of R&B bitches butt-naked
I'm always on point, like a snitch on the go
But I never snitch my car's the only thing I towed on
I'm always keeping it moving, middle finger up
Like I practice celibacy, I don't give a fuck
Just wait, I'm at they heads like a toupee yeah
It's like that, your cranium never survive titanium bars
Harder than my dick when the tip gets licked, quick
Run for cover like winter's here then listen here
K. Dot you'll never shake me loose
Like a tied knot off the goose, you mad at me too?

[Hook: Jay-Z & Kendrick Lamar]
Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low (I can't front)
If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward
I can't front, I can't front sometimes I feel like..

[Verse 2]
Yo, why you always critiquing my shit
Why don't you hop on your own dick like Marilyn Manson
I'm dancing with 2 brains, so if I got shot in the head
I won't die I'll just lose more game, propane walking
You could sell my words at an auction for the right price
And be rich your whole life, straight up
I wanna see the world by 35 but for right now I'm Compton bound
Hit Rosecrans with a pocket full of dividends
Big truck speed through the light, run over civilians
Pimp cut bitch on my right, hat low like a stripper ass
When she hit the floor, doing my thing, why you complain?
Cause I'm young and I'm black and I rap like a nigga got a
Angel on his back, wait a minute I means business
You homosexual with it, I give you straight lyrics
Now that's an emcee, that's why you mad at me?

[Hook]
Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward (Fuck Ya!)
Check me out..

[Verse 3]
What I write is a like a bomb device, press play
And you can die tonight
Shook ones don't exist whenever that K. Dot spit
Off the chain like fast pedaling while riding a bike
I gets my ride on, you ride too
But like Scion, now that's a damn shame
I'm hogging up both lanes
Play your part, styles like Kevin Hart
They're so plain
I'm choking while I'm smoking on this strongest hocus pocus
Chocking with Punch
He sarcastic laughing cause I said that I can freestyle better than Kurupt
Now that's a statement that hopefully I can back up
See Kurupt is a legend, that's where I get my shit from
Straight lab rat, spit it once run it back
Like a punt return, they tell me wait my turn
So that's what I'mma do, lay in the cut like a 2 shot Dillinger
Killing these niggas in high pursuit waddup

[Hook]

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, yeah
Uh-uh
Uh, uh
Uh-uh

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm so uptown
And mothafucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
A$AP, where my crew at
Swag so sick where the birds caught the flu at
All the hoes know me, don't need to ask, "Who that?"
Or where the heat at, my nigga, 'cause we do that
And pistol popping get it popping, niggas better move that
Cause we get a Glock and with the stock and he ain't scared to shoot it like
4 G's: blew that, G4: flew that
I'm the shit, you must admit, true that
Yeah I'm so uptown
Niggas know we get it for the low uptown
Uh gold, got 'dro, got snow uptown
Bitch-shit niggas scared to go uptown
Money making Manhattan, whip game proper
Them might be the product of the locker
A$AP, know I'm gonna prosper
Don’t care, cause I'm only straight as my posture

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm so uptown
And mothafucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah

[Verse 2: A$AP Nast]
Boom, nigga, Nast in the house
Flow like a drug, pass it around
Fag, you're a doubt, what you rapping about?
A$AP nigga, trash on the couch
Glass to the mouth, Patrón in the system
Tool on the waist just in case I gotta fix 'em
Bullets like fiends just dying to hit them
Nigga did I mention, swag house nigga
Get slapped in your shit if you badmouth nigga
Left the Range in the garage and brought the Jag out, nigga
Nast be the shit that you brag about, nigga
I ain't even tryna hear about your hereabouts, nigga
Weird-ass nigga, scared-ass nigga
I'm done with this track, did you hear that, nigga? (What?)
(?) and I did wrap niggas
Try to step on my throne?
Bitch, this is my home

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm so uptown
And mothafucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah

[Verse 3: A$AP Twelvyy]
I'm a uptown blood slime, balling's in my blood line
Pants sagging real low, I'm running from the one time
Free Church boy, yeah, my nigga caught a gun crime
Mobbing on Lenox and I'm grinding 'til the sunrise
I'm really getting dope, boy, free my nigga Dough boy
Catch me on Broadway, we got it for the low, boy
And I got flow, boy, in other words, hoes, boy
Body after body, yeah, you already know boy
I'm bumping "Oh Boy", classic Harlem shit
True Religion, who you kidding? Nigga started this
Young Twelv' get it gang, got the hardest shit
Polo down to the socks, looking marvelous
I'm from the home of the free S
I'm Grade on the West like I'm Gucci on the ES
Aura like GS, stepping out the GX
A$AP up, y'all niggas kill me with the BS... P.S.:

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm so uptown
And mothafucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah

[Intro]
Uh alright, (Alright)
(Maybach music)
Uh, uh, uh
A$AP

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, bachelor with no tux, still got my shirt cuffed
Still got my sleeves rolled up and my shirt tucked
Grown up? Sure enough, sipping on that syrup
Purple Label shit, yeah, I wear what I sip
Scarface vision, see my visions on a blimp
And a quarter key will turn a G into a gent
All-purpose flow, we are the great
I'm so Kurtis Blow, and these are the breaks
My Christian Louboutins got nails, give me hammer toes
Niggas get shy when that camera rolls
Drop crotch pants will remind you of them Hammer clothes
All-yellow Phantom, I'm like Yeezy in that amber Rolls
"Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha," but who am I kidding?
No way I could afford it so for now I'm just pretending
How these gold diggers digging without a single pot to piss in?
Cause my pockets full of lint and my heart is full of vision, I'm grown

[Chorus]
I don't do kid stuff much
Niggas say, "Now, nigga all grown up"
I don't hear y'all much
I'm all grown up, tough luck

[Verse 2: Seth Narley]
Curtains drawn and six dudes back
The chauffeur ride in the front as we speed to the dot
Deanna waits along with the classy mist
My waist my shoulder blades the type you can't resist
Picture this: being 21 with a gift
Bamas don't understand how I'm swift
Or I'm MJ-nice, like Jordan up on the mic
Amen for the new saviors of rap
My birth's 3/89 but I'm 30 up on the track
That's grown man, little homie, that's real rap
Y'all trying to switch up the style, I'm bringing Versace back
Giovanni, Medusa, and all black
Hot boy, I done ran through hell and walked back
Passport is stamped from sightseeing the map
And to think, I'm asleep but won't blink
I'm dreamin all this within, Young Leo, Inception
Come again? No offense
But fuck whoever said wearing slims was a trend
More like a lifestyle in the rawest form
All grown up, nothing like before

[Intro]
Ayo
You see that girl walk by, man?
Oof, she's somethin' else
I gotta say somethin', you know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
Uh, glance at her when she walkin' by
The type that never stop to talk to guys
She alone and you not surprised
'Cause she ain't fit for no other man
So you approach as a gentleman
"Hello, ma'am, today you lookin' pretty damn elegant"
I think she get the message like a telegram
I'ma be your cab or your yellow van
Tell me where, I'll take you where you wanna go
To the top, she perfect and she oughta know
When she walkin' by the studio
You can see my heart beatin' through my clothes
She ain't around, time movin' slow
I wanna be wherever you gon' go
And I wonder if she know my name
She shine like she ain't know what rain is
The game is the same as it was as some lame kids
You wanna hang with her every single day, it's funny
'Cause your friends say you whipped
Every late night, you gotta go and dip
To pick her up, and I've been sick of sluts
And this girl? She ain't gon' give it up
She want me puttin' in work like school
And I be smitten when she here, like a fool
But keep my cool, gotta be smooth
Eyes like Elmer, got me glued
These other dudes is not for you
I think Cupid musta shot you, too

[Chorus]
Girl, I just wanna talk to you
And I don't think you got a clue
When you around, it's so hard to move
So I wrote a couple bars for you
Girl, I just wanna talk to you
And I don't think you got a clue
When you around, it's so hard to move
So I had to write a couple bars for you

[Verse 2]
I seen her at the dry cleaner, locked eyes
It was rainin', she lookin' like sunshine
I told her we could have a fun time
Let me just take you out to lunch
I'm a really nice guy, I ain't gon' hurt you
I ain't even 'bout to flirt, too
'Cause I'ma be straight up with you
And don't bring no make-up with you
I just wanna chill, kick it at the crib
Every time we kiss, it tickle on my lips
I love the way that you lookin' at me
I just wanna see you lookin' happy
You grab me, pull me, tease me, fool me
Ain't gon' let me get it at the movies
Why you sittin' over a few seats?
Come and move closer to me
Uh, I hope you know that you got me
Here's my number, girl, you can call me
And if you guessin', don't stress
'Cause I ain't havin' no mess

[Bridge]
She the only thing on my mind
I think about her all the time
And it's hard 'cause I'm on my grind
But I think I'ma call her mine

[Chorus]
Girl, I just wanna talk to you
And I don't think you got a clue
When you around, it's so hard to move
So I wrote a couple bars for you
Girl, I just wanna talk to you
And I don't think you got a clue
When you around, it's so hard to move
So I had to write a couple bars for you

[Intro: Cavi]
Cavi on the track!

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Hol' up, smoke something bitch
Hol' up, Sweet Jones
Goin' down
She suck on my dick, lickin' her butt
Wife that bitch, she the neighborhood slut
You really shouldn't trust me so much
That girl love these nuts
She told me don't tell, keep it on the low (low)
I make her get down on the flo'
Show me what you workin' with, gon head twerk it bitch
Pussyhole fatter than a Benz with a body kit
I do what I please, you do what you can
She get on her knees, I won't tell her man
It's very thin line between a fuck and a date
And if ya playin' with some paper, she might scream rape
Statutory is a whole different category
We don't do babies, only grown ladies
So if you wanna get ya back knocked out
Let me hit ya in the butt and then put it in ya mouth

[Verse 2: T.I.]
It's big pimpin', five or six women
Had bitches eatin' pussy wit' my dick still in it
Groupie hoes eatin' booty holes, thirty five minutes
Finished jackin' in they face, while they kiss it, (muah)
Imagine, bad bitches all over the mattress with asses like Serena, Trina, face is like Cassie
Cum so I can nut and drop and say it taste like candy, so nasty, head game way above average
On patron, dro, cocaine and a tablet, let her have it front to back
While she tossin' her salad, they call me big dick daddy
They love this wood, they say "we fucked a lot of rappers, none this good"
Ask my pussy, all I gotta say is get to it
And they don't care who there, they just do it
Like Pimp C say "give a ho no leeway, bitches do whatever we say, okay"

[Hook]
Pimp (16x)

[Verse 3: Too Short]
She got a big mouth, and she talks too much
I got a big dick, that loves to get sucked
Now what you think she gon get?
If I introduce her mouth to my dick
It's gonna be a match made in heaven, something like soul mates
We have a lot of sex, but we don't go on dates
And I can't tell the homies, I wish I could
But I can't cause the bitch is too good
I'm a firm believer, she's an overachiever
And I know when I see her
She don't stop till I skeet her
I used to like sex in the bed
Then I met them freaky girls that give me super head
Now I got everybody jammin' this song, she can get some dick even with her panties on
I'm lookin' at her pussy, she can keep it
I just want a blow job, can you keep a secret? (biiiitch!)

[Hook]

[Outro: Cavi]
Cavi on the track!

[Kurupt]
There's a lot of people out there that be talking all that
But I could kick a fat fat type of known rap
See, when you talk all that, you know I like to show up
Niggas think they cocaine, knowing that they blow up
Peep where I come from, so you know it's on
Because I brought these nuts, cause I'm all above the law
So when you see me stepping, understand I like to flow
The Pound, Dr. Dre, we equal Death Row

[Daz]
Now you know about me
The D to the A to the Z
S-N-double O-P, D-R-E
That nigga, um, Doctor Dre
So we say like every day
Now it's that P-O-U-N-D, uh

[Kurupt]
Kurupt is the name that they call me
I flow and I flow with the Snoop Doggy Dogg
As a nigga make bigger waves, I start flexing
When niggas start stepping
Grip with my Tec and Snoop, kick it

[Daz]
If you're wicked, wicked I kick it
Slick and not with them condo hoes coochie, won't you lick it

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
It's like this
I don't eat them hoes cause I'm just so smooth..
Break the beat up for me..

Motherfucking Dr. Dre's on the piano
Snoop Doggy Dogg is on the vocals and I swing like soprano, ano
And gano -- oh my god like Obano
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg, he's on the mic, you understand it, yo
When I be growing, I be flowing with the gangsta shit
I don't be flowing with that punk-ass punk shit
I go for riz-eals, the reals is what I kick
And when I step into the house, I'm gonna hit you with the gangsta..fat hit
It just don't quit, like I told you
So let me have the microphone so I can slowly fold you
I told you, mold you, scold you like some water that's hot
Heat it, beat it, Snoop Dogg, you can't defeat it, delete it
I'm so smooth I don't have to dis you on the camera or the TV screen
I'm funky like some collard greens
I told you peoples, my sequels, they don't be bumping
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg, I'm down with D-R-E, see he's from Compton
And I'm from the L the O the N the G
The B the E the A the C the H an'
And Cali is the state an'
Don't be waitin'
Cause I'm not hatin'
I'm just on the microphone and I ain't perpetratin'

[Verse 1]
Te amo, te amo
She says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over

[Chorus]
Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

[Verse 2]
Te amo, te amo
She's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over

[Chorus]
Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

[Bridge]
Listen, we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night
I’m moving through the light
Because I understand
That we all need love
And I'm not afraid
To feel the love, but I don't feel that way

[Chorus]
Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you

[Outro]
Te amo, te amo
Don't it mean I love you?

[Intro]
Hey soldier
Do you know who’s in command here?

TYGA
GED Army
Young Money navy
Fuck you, pay me
It’s simple

What happens when ya enemies, once friends and everything ends
My glory begins

[Verse 1]
Two miles from his house
A spot that they slung out
Lil kids play out
Shit foul in my town
They talk but won't shout cause snitches never be found
Just look straight
No squares around just quilts and cake
Half-way growing age
Started seeing different ways
Illegally paid, get lawyers legally paid
I'm saying, Polaroid boy just want the fame
Never my image to betray but never soft like soufflee, nigga
Nigga

[Hook]
I started from the very end
Look around look where I begin
Women sittin', sippin' with him
But what happens when the glory ends

What happens when the glory ends
What happens, what happens then
What happens when the glory ends
Enemies once friends
Guess my glory end

[Verse 2]
Look at ’em, Tyga slim skinny no pig
I don’t fuck with them
Denver dens bitch no ticket shit
Here’s a tip, write it off my taxes
Get paid more than you faggots
My shine, shine like I waxed it
Get backwards move forward get blasted
I’m Dave Matthews
Great figure this nigga asked it
Actually my swag mastered
Show the masters my taxes
Performing off like Julio bastards
Young graduate no degree but a bachelor
Pack full off cash
Look at the way I sag
Look at the balance on that natty hat
Match the Gucci bag
Wearing shit the store never had
Even dads is cool, mothers love my ass
Them ghetto jags is through, I'm in the newest class
Limit edition no tints bitch see who in it
Now back the fuck up like strippers
Nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
A hater's only motive
Scope my every slogan
Blog my every word
Rephrase shit I’ve spoken
Whole nine the truth is really unfolding
Couple Folgers if ya sleeping we gone wake ya owner
Hold ya like groceries no Kenneth Copeland
But I'm on some pope shit
Drug flow I'm close to dopest
Really sayin' this sick shit no nursery but row ya boat bitch
White phantom call it big toll whip
In motion an eagle colder than zero below
Don’t pour motive hoes know what I D.O
Already put on a show from the day he was born
Through the form deform
I'm a monster y'all
Jewelry look armor raw
The money monopoly born
The shit is fraud
And I don’t play games, you see what happen in that movie Saw
But this is real life shootin' no director

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Boy, you'll be the death of me
You're my James Dean
You make me feel like I'm seventeen
You drive too fast
You smoke too much
But that don't mean a thing, 'cause I'm addicted to the rush

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you

[Verse 2]
You know I've been in love before
You're the first one I ever seen that burns like gasoline
So light a match, turn off the lights
I'm holdin' on to you 'cause this might be our last night, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you

[Bridge]
What I'm telling you
I'm giving you my life, it's in your hands
And what I'm gonna do
Is be a woman and you can be a man
And I wanna say
Nobody understands what we've been through
I'd rather give up everything
Than to live my, live my life without you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you

[Verse 1]
Summer don't know me no more
He got mad, tiresome
Summer don't know me
He'd just let me low in myself
'Cause I do know love
From you then
Just dying

[Chorus]
I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

[Verse 2]
Don't stop the bud when it comes
It's the dawn, you'll see
Money won't get there
Ten years passed tonight, you'll flee
If you do that
I'll be sworn
To find you

[Chorus]
I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

[Outro]
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

[Intro]
Oh, yo
(Thank y'all for tunin' in) One of the greatest of all time
(Uh; The Jukebox) J Dilla (Change my life)
(Uh; Mac Miller) We miss you
(What up, Dilla?) What up, Haze? What up, Capcom?
(We miss you right here, you know what I'm sayin'?)
East End Empire, TreeJTV (Hip-hop, hip-hop)
So I felt that it would be necessary (I got love for my peoples)
Mac Miller to talk to the people (And that ain't gon' stop)
J Dilla, what up? (

[?])
Uh

[Chorus]
I got my mind in the clouds, in paradise livin' with style
My mom should be proud, I've been dedicated now for a while
I'm in love with hip-hop, I'm in love with life
I'm in love with the days, late nights, kush, money
I'm in love with this mic
And now time on my side 'cause I'm young and I'm grindin' so hard
Plus I'm sayin' somethin' every single time that I'm rhymin' my bars
I'm just a child, y'all gon' see me grow
But now I know, I've got so far to go

[Verse]
Uh
Sometimes I think about this time next year
Grindin' to the fullest, kickin' rhymes for your ears
I wonder if they hear me now, comin' fresh with a style
The illest child, always chillin' with a smile
'Cause hip-hop waitin' for me back at home
We just need to have a little time alone
'Cause lately I've been livin' life by my phone
Tryna do business, mind on my dough
Woah, hold up, let me take a rest
Bring it back with my dogs like I'm playin' fetch
I'm tryna be the future, moldin' the CD
Somethin' bumpin' out the system on repeat
My mind's elevated like E.T
Work hard in quick sand, knee deep
You know I'm always doin' double like a re-read
It's like I play the whole game with a cheat sheet
Dollar signs to my name like Too Short
Gonna go broke with this taxin' on Newports
I'm unhealthy, workin' to succeed
Tryna spit out more words than I can read
Stayin' up late, keep burnin' through this weed
My grandma probably turnin' in her G-R-A-V-E, grave, that's right
Spellin' bee champ, fifth grade
This my job, I'm about my guap
Keep it fresh like shoes right out the box
I'm just tryna give you somethin' loud that knocks
So far to go, but I'm never gon' stop

[Chorus]
I got my mind in the clouds, in paradise livin' with style
My mom should be proud, I've been dedicated now for a while
I'm in love with hip-hop, I'm in love with life
I'm in love with the days, late nights, kush, money
I'm in love with this mic
And now time on my side 'cause I'm young and I'm grindin' so hard
Plus I'm sayin' somethin' every single time that I'm rhymin' my bars
I'm just a child, y'all gon' see me grow
But now I know, I've got so far to go

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Hot damn, I am the man, I don't even need a scheme
I don't need a planI just say "Hi" then grab her hand
Told her I'm a dog with a birch to relax him
Say she want to window shop, I just laugh
Girl thought I was trickin', baby that's just sad
I pop so many tags, like I give grab bags
So when they see me, bitches do the mad dash
He will motion approaching up in the slab
Drink and smoking when they come to the pad
She just looking at me cuz she know I wanna smash
Eyes on my pockets now she checking out for my stash
Now this is the part where personalities clash
I subtract her then a nigga must add
I just need another to be ahead of the class
Cudi McLovin bitch I'm Superbad

[Hook: ?]
When they street or see me in the club (in the club)
All the girls always wanna show me love
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
You don't got to know my name to know ?
But You know I'm gonna do my thing
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Just young nigga on my motherfuckin' grizzle
Other cats simple but your boy Cudi sizzle
Got your main line when I'm all up in the middle
All because of my songs, all because of riddles
That is amusing to me cuz I'm the niggy
All these women they all so pretty
Which one I need? Which one I want?
The one that like drinkin' and good rolling blunts
I had one chick she called herself Tila
She was so hood kept a chrome nina
When I first met her we was over on mulas
Said she was interested on getting on some new cock
She was so cool jumped right in my coupa
All of this ? Tila threw my a loopa
Gave me neck while I gripped up on the wheel
Eyes looking at me like :"Cudi how it feel?"
I'm probably the coolest motherfucker ever rappin'
Next to Snoop Dogg and Devin the Dude
When I touchdown I won't clown and do the Deion
I'mma keep winning because the rest of them are peons
Plus I'm a fool for gold, so I'm shinin'
Ferris in a bimmer, sittin' back reclinin'
Back in the day bitches told me "Dream on!"
Now at the shows in the front screaming "Lean on!"
Ain't that something? (Haha haha)
Ain't that something?

[Hook: ?]
When they street or see me in the club (in the club)
All the girls always wanna show me love
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
You don't got to know my name to know ?
But You know I'm gonna do my thing
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in

[Outro: Kid Cudi]

I appreciate everyone’s support for my clothing line but I wanted to clarify a few things… The name of the line is Kanye West not DW… The DW was a design element placed on the invite in homage to my mom :-). I really appreciate the fake DW twitter page but since it’s not official I can’t co-sign any information on it
“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” – Leonardo Da Vinci
More clarity… I have no agency representing me currently… William Morris was fired after Cara Lewis quit. I love Cara Lewis :-)
I love being back at my fashion office learning and creating. It’s so challenging and fun and I’m surrounded by amazing people. They say you only live once but every time I come to work I feel like I’m starting a second life. You guys might think I have some type of backing for my line but I don’t. I did the first fashion show out of my own pocket and used the money I made touring to follow my passion. I’ve been working at this for 8 years now. From the first offers to do urban clothing lines that I turned down…to begging Bape to do my line and never making any real headway…to having an office in LA that was shut down after the “MTV” moment along with my tour with (Lady) Gaga
I moved to Japan for one month after that and designed every night in my room. I had this opportunity to intern at Fendi and was also offered a position at Versace which I could not take due to my contract with LV which was for 2 years. I moved to Rome after I left Japan and worked at Fendi for 4 months undercover. I was there to give ideas for the men’s collection. I snuck to Giuseppe Zanotti’s factory still under contract and learned to design womens shoes for 2 years before my first show in Paris. After doing the first LV collection I was sure I would get a second shot to create but was never given the opportunity
I designed a sneaker called the (Air) Yeezy with Nike. I’m “allowed” to design 1 pair of sneakers every 2 years. I have more ideas…
Early 2011 I moved to Paris and opened a small design studio. The language barrier was quite difficult. I still don’t have a Paris VAT number to this day. I don’t know what a VAT is but every time I asked why we didn’t have fabrics they said it was because of the VAT. In Paris I met many great people in design including the master Azzedine Alaia. Azzedine even came by my studio one day :-). This was the greatest feeling to stand in his presence in my embarrassingly small Paris studio in a courtyard opposite Collate
I remember being 5 years old picking and my mother taking me with her shopping at the discount fur spots. She said I would always point to the most expensive furs, even as a child. LOL. There is something about making clothing that always brings me back to that point. For the first 16 or 17 years of my life the only thing I knew about women’s clothing was what my Mom would wear. I guess some critics would joke that I still don’t know anything. LOL. My Mom would wear blue jeans with a fur and an embellished “Cosby Show” sweater :-) to pick me up from school. The teachers said I couldn’t focus. I used to get kicked out of class for bringing dirty magazines and drawing Nike’s in 4th grade
Being a celebrity has afforded me many opportunities but has also boxed me in creatively. I was just discussing becoming the creative director for the Jetson movie and someone on the call yelled out, “you should do a Jetsons tour!”
This just happened a few hours ago. I was very insulted of course because for anyone that’s seen the Watch the Throne Tour, Coachella, Glow in the Dark or Runaway know that I have real ideas
I appreciate having the most nominations at the Grammy’s but I feel so conflicted by the fact that award shows sometimes are completely illogical. Good logic tells me “smile Kanye”, the world likes you again. “Red or blue pill?”…aaaaand Swallow. LOL. I wouldn’t have the prestige I have if it wasn’t partially for the Grammy's validation and I honor that
Hmmmmm, what to wear? Here I go again… Yeezy the trend setter or complete f*cking fashion victim…the verdict is still out. This is just a train of thought but I figure it’s better to read than trained thoughts
What good is fame and prestige if you can’t use it to help people? I want to help by doing what I know how to do best…create
I have started a new company and I’m so excited about the name…it’s got the best name ever…of all companies…of all time!!!
The name of the company is DONDA
DONDA is a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers and put them in a creative space to bounce there dreams and ideas. I used to blog all the time an fit was a way to get my opinion out. Dr Dre redesigned headphones and made more impact off of one product. I am assembling a team of architects, graphic designers, directors musicians, producers, A&Rs, writers, publicist, social media experts, app guys, managers, car designers, clothing designers, DJs, video game designers, publishers, tech guys, lawyers, bankers, nutritionists, doctors, scientists and teachers
DONDA will be comprised of over 22 divisions with a goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford. I want to put creatives in a room together with like minds that are all way doper than me. We want to help simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see hear, touch, taste and feel. To dream of, create, advertise and produce products driven equally by emotional want and utilitarian need.. To marry our wants and needs…DONDA
This will all take time but I wanted everyone’s to know what I really care about…I care about people…I care about my fans…I care about people who have never heard of me…There are over 7 billion people on the planet now…It’s something about coming from music that makes me so optimistic. Music travels and is not limited to only the wealthy. Sometimes my grammar is wrong but my thinking is right :-). My mom was an English teacher so I know she sends an SMDH from heaven :-). 5:18 am in London, my dreams keep me woke
The Watch the Throne tour was a small example of what a DONDA experience can be…
I’m currently working on a new 7 screen experience…
This is one of our projects to be released this year called 2016 Olympics…It’s semi sci-fi, since 2016 is only 4 years away, :-)
We would also like to design the MTV awards. We’re taking everything 10 steps at a time, LOL! I wanted to put this in the world, in hopes that the people who can actually make a difference will stand up and reach out. We need as many amazing powerful smart talented wealthy people to be involved. Come get on board…don’t just sit there…reach out
We can collectively effect the world through design. We need to pick up where Steve Jobs left off
When I said wealthy I wanted to point out there are so many billionaires in the world that can come together and help to redesign it and help education. School systems were designed to turn people into factory workers. Schools should be designed to prep human beings for real life
Spike Jonze and I want to do a Summer school that tries new forms of curriculum. Math classes should teach addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, accounting and money management aaaaaand cut!!!
UNLESS YOU’RE A MATH MAJOR!!! Kids you should be able to take majors starting in grammar school like how it is at performing art schools. Instead of kicking kids out of schools for using their iPhones…why not promote it?
Allow kids to use search engines to do test…like the real WORLD!!! Give kids the amount of test they would have in a year in one day but they have to get everything perfect…please excuse my grammar…I know it’s extremely ironic
Some kids have better memories than others…what about emotional IQ’s? What about kids who do bad in school because of how bad their surroundings are?
Excuse me…I just get excited at the possibilities…the more excited I get the more grammatical errors you’ll see…
We need to take what Michael Jackson felt and Mcqueen and Steve Jobs, and we need make things better
When me and Jay toured, every night I peered into the audience astonished by the different walks of life that came to support us
The adrenaline is running…I don’t know if I can even get to sleep now. From Wall Street to the London riots to Chicago murders…I sit everyday and ask what can I do to make a difference. I know this is not a very rapper thing to say but I haven’t bought a new car or piece of jewelry in about 2 years
I invest every dime back into creativity, hiring amazing creatives, paying for flights, offices…etc. My area of expertise is in music, my passion is in music, design, film and products…my strength is connectivity…
There are so many broken systems from the economy to school systems to jail systems…we need experts for this. We need scientist and top world designers to directly affect governments
I just wanted to share what’s been on my mind…
“If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple…but if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.” – George Bernard Shaw

[Intro: Meek Mill]
It's Team Pyrex over here
You know how we do it

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, in the kitchen going H.A.M again
Fucking with them birds like Cam and them
I'll tell you what's the word when the tan is in
We them niggas on the curb with them hammers in, ah!
Whole brick, throw it on the triple beam
If it get hectic, we gon' stretch it like a limousine
Ain't no crutchin', if I touch it then it's Mr. Clean
I be reppin' in your section, me and my nigga Dean
Ghost boy in the ghost, nigga
I burn bread, I ain't talking toast, nigga
Whole team of killers, I'm the coach Digger
Presidential on my wrist now take your votes, nigga
Rookie of the year, cookies in the rear
I got some bad bitches that will get it there
If you don't wanna get it we gon' send them there
If it's heavy then Omelly comin' in the lear
Brick Squad like Waka and them
If it's Gucci like D. Howard I get a block for them
I don't touch it I just leave it up to Tak and them
Niggas started, was a drought but we was poppin' then

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Lean wit' it, rock wit' it
Throw some bake up in the pot wit' it
Microwave or we gon' pot whip it
When it get right, we drop that ice and make it lock wit it
I tell them lean wit' it, rock wit' it
Throw some bake up in the pot wit' it
Microwave or we gon' pot whip it
When it get right, we drop that ice and make it lock wit it

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I made a million off a mixtape, nigga get your shit straight
I'm selling that raw shit, you sellin' that whip weight
Cookin' up a whole bird until I make my wrist ache
When I pulled up to the club you should've seen your bitch face
Ugh, fifty cash in my pocket
Nigga, I got your stash in my pocket
I'm blowin' money fast in my pocket
I said it's lookin' like I got Nicki ass in my pocket
Talkin' "ass, ass, ass, ass" all I get is cash, cash
Club LIV my last tag, I could've bought a fast Jag
The way these bitches waving at me you would think a cab past
No wonder why you hatin' on me nigga wit' your mad ass
Rollie on me cost a whole brick
Killers with me ain't got no pics
These groupie bitches ain't got no sense
So we make a movie on them bitches, no script

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Lean wit' it, rock wit' it
Throw some bake up in the pot wit' it
Microwave or we gon' pot whip it
When it get right, we drop that ice and make it lock wit it
I tell them lean wit' it, rock wit' it
Throw some bake up in the pot wit' it
Microwave or we gon' pot whip it
When it get right, we drop that ice and make it lock wit it

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
36 treat it like a dirty bitch
‘Cause I hit it then I send it to the other strip
Call me anything, don't call me by my government
‘Cause when I'm out here in the jungle we be selling bricks
Half these niggas in my hood be on some tellin' shit
We be on some "if-u-snitchin'-crack-your-melon" shit
If I ain't rockin' with the Smith it's Parabellum shit
Papi bring them on the boat, he know we selling shit
Lean wit' it, rock wit' it, posted Mac 11 in the lot wit' it
750 getting busy wit' a box in it
So when they pull us over they don't find them Glocks in it

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Lean wit' it, rock wit' it
Throw some bake up in the pot wit' it
Microwave or we gon' pot whip it
When it get right, we drop that ice and make it lock wit it
I tell them lean wit' it, rock wit' it
Throw some bake up in the pot wit' it
Microwave or we gon' pot whip it
When it get right, we drop that ice and make it lock wit it

[Intro]
It's like I don't think you fully understand who I am, ya know?
I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
I don't represent no colors, I represent my lil' sisters and brothers
I'm the oldest, nigga
And if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Check it out

[Verse 1]
I used to wanna rap like JAY-Z
Until I finally realized that Jay wasn't me
I took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
Critics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I do
Because I used to practice early morning and then after school
I'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle you
But even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow you
Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
I'mma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane
Now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
As an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
I wear a heart on my shoulder
'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?
Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
Then went to jail when we got older
That shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focused
In due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
That shit's embarrassing huh
Hope no one pay you no mind
But it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams
And admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?
My momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
Even though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it fo'
My pops got a different approach, yeah he believed
But he always questioned when I'mma drop my debut CD
How long this gon' take nigga? You still haven't ate nigga
At twenty-two I had two cars and my own place nigga
It's a sacrifice I try to tell him
That's when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealous
Of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit
I ain't tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
I just wanna hear you heard

[Chorus]
Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

[Verse 2]
What up DZYNE? I ain't forgot nigga
You developed me, telling me I was hot nigga
You believed in me first, that's what's for sure
At the church recording, at the garage, but it worked
But me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passion
A lot was going on in your life and you needed space
But still I should have came to you first to tell you what happened
But I was seventeen and figured it's best I stay away
And I was wrong, I was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what I'd done
But I'm telling you we ain't done
Matter of fact, how's your sons? What they up to?
Remember they used to run away while you had worked on ProTools?
People I used to be in the booth till four in the morning
With school in the morning, yawning, but I was on it
Me, you and Dave was on it
Buzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape dropped
Where them beats nigga? It's been five years since we had rocked
Time to be heard

[Chorus]
Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

[Verse 3]
So can you feel it?
When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit?
Do it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick?
The truth can set you free if you Do the Right Thing
Word to Spike Lee, don't he look like Sounwave?
That's kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays
Like a dog in the night
Twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes
To grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kite
I spread love like a Hippy, but I'm a Black one
With Jesus Christ passion, I swear on the bible
Tabernacle to all my rivals, I ain't mad
You hate a nigga for tryna help you, that's your bad
Because I figure I can make a way with these stanzas
I probably can't heal cancer, but I can heal the city
My niggas, tell me you with me
And if you is won't you pop my CD in
Open up your trunk, then let it bump, so I can be heard
Yeah, uh huh

[Chorus]
Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

[Outro]
D-Dave, what up nigga?
Matt Jeezy, hahaha...

[Intro:Santigold and (B.o.B.)]
Shoot up the station
T.V.'s dead where's there to run?

[Hook: Santigold and (B.o.B.)]
Shoot up-shoot up-shoot up the station
T.V. sta-T.V. sta- (T.V., radio)
Shoot up-shoot up-shoot up the station (yo, hey)
T.V. sta-T.V. sta- (sing, sing)
Shoot up-shoot up-shoot up the station (shoot, bah, bah, bah,)
T.V. sta-T.V. sta- (T.V., radio)

[Verse 1: B.o.B.]
Shoot up the television with Lugers and demolition
It's time we fucked the system in missionary position
Listen! It's my intention for giving this transition
This is for the citizens livin' in glass prisons
Coming up in my position
The product of my condition
With a business plan in my hand and a vision of a politician
It's funny how we mirror what we witness
Cause this is broadcast television from the villa to the village
So therefore we go bang-bang
On your corporate mainframe
We don't want that watered down
We don't want that plain jane
Take back that Diet Coke
We don't want the same thang
This is not a protest
Better yet a gang bang
Now everybody sang

[Hook:Santigold and B.o.B.]
Shoot up-shoot up-shoot up the station
T.V. sta-T.V. sta- (T.V., radio)
Shoot up-shoot up-shoot up the station (yo, hey)
T.V. sta-T.V. sta- (sing, sing)
Shoot up-shoot up-shoot up the station (shoot, bah, bah, bah,)
T.V. sta-T.V. sta- (T.V., radio)

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I'm in a different realm
I live in alpha mode
And I forgot already, what you about to know
You what know I'm ridin' fo'
And that bullshit I just ain't vouchin' fo'
I beat the game already
Now I'm just trying to coach
The truth is scary, it's very revolutionary
The signal is gone and faded
The televisions are buried
Have you heard of the beast?
Well we all live in the belly
Inhabitants of the concrete jungle to Silicon Valley
There is nothing to fear, not even Illuminati
As evil as things appear, perception is just reality
I ain't really here
A holographic anatomy
Really I'm on the ship with the Planetary Academy
Out

[Hook:Santigold and B.o.B.]
Shoot up-shoot up-shoot up the station
T.V. sta-T.V. sta- (T.V., radio)
Shoot up-shoot up-shoot up the station (yo, hey)
T.V. sta-T.V. sta- (sing, sing)
Shoot up-shoot up-shoot up the station (shoot, bah, bah, bah,)
T.V. sta-T.V. sta- (T.V., radio)

[Intro]
Reporting live, from Compton, California
North Cackalack

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
You're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting
My itinerary is very hectic
I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless
Kendrick Lamar, no Audemar on my wrist
Its arthritis from holding it down bitch
Me and my down bitch, get busy
I'm busy taking over, the world
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
My drive is not to be chauffeured
I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
Whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
To hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
With offers that got me up in these offices often
Boo-yaa, who ya? No one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying
Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Cadillac that I got from my pops
Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window, down
Like Stacie homie when airing out endo
I wish a nigga would

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, it's evident, I'm evidently your favorite
All I ask, open your ears and please savor it
The taste is un-acquired, quietly, been inspired
I'm at a point in my life when I was getting tired
Now I'm brushing off the dust
We don't need no water, fire burned it to the dust
Nigga grind hard, roaches turning into musk
People hear his pain, I consider that a plus
I'm a grown man, so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing
The Spike thing, consider me the in-between
The new regime taking over
Either we each other's opposition or you soldier
Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it
Off to the next, you unlucky bastard
I'm getting drunk same time every year
To celebrate the life, Rosie no longer here
I swear

[Hook]
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
Even Zeus can get beat up from punchlines
When I kick it and pump mine, I've got to be a prophet
I've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
I'm a Hub City representer, so I've got to represent the
City like a District Attorney beatin' the case for killers
Might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter
Since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers

[Verse 4: Rapper Big Pooh]
U-P-S, I deliver
Little brown boy get the pick of the litter
No glitter, all guts, no glory
Station on repeat, they retread the same story
New niggas bore me, tryna progress to that old shit
Have a plate, that food for your soul tip
Drill it in your head, youngun it's that real Hip-
Hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped

[Hook]
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
Yo
I play the block like a villain, not that im mad
I just know its niggas who hate to see me winnin'
Hold ya head niggas envy for your position
I leave em wishin' with the same mind state that I had from the beginning
I'mma kill em, and keep their blood off my raw denim
Free livin', just trynna keep the devil out my vision
An escape is what I needed, thats why I stay weeded
Saw a seat I was defendin' how you playin' compete it
Believe it, but not to many niggas can achieve it
And I ain't one for preachin' but my realness ain't a secret
I bleed it, but fame ain't even cuttin' for the deepness
Barley scratchin' the surface, still sleeping on the genius
But im cool, the top I'mma see you when I see it
Care full of where my feet is in a sea of non believers
Startin' lies and passin' rounds but when I see em daps and pounds
This how we actin now? I gotta be a basset hound
And all I smell is bullshit so I ain't comin' back around
Niggas is half the style got me thinkin' backwards now
And I can't tell if niggas is my friend or my foes
See now a days niggas more jealous than hoes
And hoes just want a nigga with a status and o's
But im to busy trynna make the story unfold
See here lives a bitch and bitches come and they go
But I be god dammed if she leavin' me yo
So I be on my grizzly, I work it like missy
You ain't talkin' bout money expansion and miss me
Im grindin' till the gears get clear and shine crispy
My eyes on the prize but the devil trynna tempt me
Simply, I won't let a soul play me, crazy
The root of all evil got me shady
Gone for so long god bless my old lady
I do it on my own but alone don't phase me
See a young black nigga with a lion heart
Trynna fight the illness of the dark, thats the hardest part
Thats why I come shinin' down hard but I keep it smart
Its like a jungle sometimes, the hood jurassic park
Ye and you can spark if you feel me
Throw the middle finger in the air if you real b
Everybody said I couldn't do it but im still me
Full, not the pocket but the mind and im filthy
I make it work my whole technique is crafty
I play my lane and trippin' who creepin' past me
Keep it pushin' for the evil or the money trap
So when you see me nigga, better holler at me
Ye bitch golf wang 2012 nigga
Get yo head right, get yo bread right
No idols for this song nigga no information on that
Stay tuned nigga cus I ain't gotta tell you shit
Just listen, pay attention. bitch

[Intro: Mac Miller]
TreeJay, this marijuana is so potent
Haha
We gon' start this one off a little... little differently, alright?
Slow it down, chill out

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
And when it's night time with the shine of the city lights
Same day, different mic, what you livin' like?
Travel around the country, always at the airport, different flights
It's anything but the simple life
I break the law, fuck a magistrate
And I laugh at hate
Revenge a dish served cold, y'all can grab a plate
Gravitate towards the money and the fame
But it ain't all what it seem, boy, it's just another game
No Wii, Xbox, or PS3
Just good weed and some Henny, you can leave me be
Maybe find me in the west coast like Eazy-E
They in a coma, been asleep for weeks, but now they wakin' up
They notice that the youngin got skill
Yeah, I'm white, but you can't put a color on ill
I got my own thing goin' for me
Sip lean, so they move in slow motion for me
Just a juvenile but these vets is movin' over for me
Cold glass of Henny, so they go and grab a coaster for me
Yeah, life a fuckin' roller coaster, homie
What's my name? Bitch, you was supposed to know me, haha

[Chorus: Young Scolla]
Spare me all that bullshit, mane, leave it to the lames
I'm just tryin' to make it in the game
I've been through it all (All), still gon' end up winnin' (Winnin')
That's just what I saw (Saw), right from the beginnin'
And it ain't gon' change
I was built to be a winner
I was built to be a winner

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Hey, hey
It's just me and my team, that's all that matters, yeah
Live my life right and just be happy here
Ain't no white light, bitch, I got my whole life ahead of me
Architect my life but you can't design my destiny
All the family that I lost, rest in peace
Wish you was here to see me catch my dream
I've chased my shadow, now I'm on another level
At the playground playin' freeze tag with the devil
I ain't gonna sell my soul though
This music worth more than hoes, boats, and polo, haha
No college, but bet I win the Rose Bowl
The way I smoke got my moms goin' loco
Live on my own now, payin' rent and shit
When life stress gets thick, you need some sedatives
A little weed and a little bit of liquor, uh
Make me forget about this bullshit I'm into

[Chorus: Young Scolla]
Spare me all that bullshit, mane, leave it to the lames
I'm just tryin' to make it in the game
I've been through it all (All), still gon' end up winnin' (Winnin')
That's just what I saw (Saw), right from the beginnin'
And it ain't gon' change
I was built to be a winner
I was built to be a winner

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Black jeans, white tee
Black rims, white B
8 figure nigga, small digits don't excite me
Iced out brightly, shine like lightning
Everything bad bout my bitches but they hygeine
Turned up hyphy, everytime you see me on
Matter fact, you can't see me
'Less you turn your TV on
Ay, we beyond that peon shit
That he be on
I stunt, ball daily
Fuck y'all, pay me
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
My life like a movie
Call me Martin Scorsese
On fire blazin', burnin' hot cajun
Ay dude, fuckin' A, I am fuckin A-mazin!

[Bridge: T.I.]
Everytime you see me out
Just take yo' ho' and
We be out
We throwin 'bands and goin' HAM, no doubt
You know what we be 'bout

[Hook: T.I.]
Ballin' out the frame
Stuntin' like a fool
X4
Ay you know how we do
Stuntin' like a fool

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Ankle sock, flip flop, maybach-clear top
Killin shit I oughta get a buncha tatted teardrops
Mil's all that we about
Fuck that shit you hear about
You don't wanna be the one them g's come and see about
Party in the penthouse
Live in the boondocks
Million dollar watch, diamond loud as a boombox
Bullshit I do not
On that dough I zoom in
Haters bet cool out, 'fore I call them goons in
Who you think you foolin'?
You bad nigga? Do it then
Show me, make me a believer
You don't know me, I'm low key
Hoes on a niggas strivers row
Cargo pants, Louis V
They doin bad, I'm doin me

[Bridge+Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Take a frame, gettin paid
Out the frame, Skip Bay'ed
All I blow is strong
Dont insult me with your mid-grade
Mid-day, late night
All I lay is straight pipe
Hit her from behind, nevermind what her face like
Then I take flight in a zone
Bitch I'm on one
Got so many enemies, cuz niggas bitches into me
It's finna be some mad mufuckas in a minute
When I send that pussy back to em and they fall in it
Don't care who Im offendin'
Been a G since the beginnin
They love you when you losin'
Guess they hate me cuz I'm winnin
I'm sinnin and repentin to God
And trying hard to stay humble and keep my cool
Cuz I'm stuntin' like a fool

[Chorus: John Legend]
Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boy, and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be comin home, oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be coming home

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
It's been a whole lot of hatin' again
And if they hatin' on me damn what up then
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me little homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat 'cos she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave
She said "It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me"
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said "'Ye, keep making that platinum and gold for me!"
But if you really cared for her
Then you woulda never hit the airport and followed ya dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seem like she talkin bout me
She said, "You left ya kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you, and I just got through
Talkin bout, what niggas tryin to do, just not new"
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
In the interviews I'm representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds, spark ya lighters and wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin about Chi-Town

[Chorus: John Legend]
Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boy, and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be comin home, oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be coming home

[Lil Wayne]

Some say the ex make the sex spec-tacular
Make me lick ya from ya neck and your back and ya
Shiverin tongue deliverin chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Uh oh, I think its pastor time
I hope he can last and past the test of time
Got the girls singin like Glo' Estefan
Shawty pop ya in the mouth like a pacifier
Shawty pop an ecstasy and exercise
She pop 1 and I pop a number next to 5 like
6, 4 out the Western's eye
He want to see you get low, I'm like lets get high
Like Whooo
Shawty come to my planent, I've got a spaceship for two
Cause I believe it's fuck the world but tonight I only want to fuck you
And you know that to me it feels like heaven when I made love to you

Some say the ex make the sex spec
I always protect dont want her to expect
Not a zero up out of my next check
Shawty you gonna end up being my Fed-Ex
That's my ex girlfriend im fed up with
That pill make her talk too much, shut up bitch
And my doors don't open, they let up bitch
I've been shining like Thomas Edison
Styrofoam cup filled up with medicine
I am higher than the highest bird's feathers in
I wish I could bird shit on every bitch
Like Biggie, so after I shitted on a bitch, Haha
Oh you know I shitted on a bitch, haha
Yeah, Who Me?, I'm so fly
And I came from Down

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that it's sorta unique
'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryin' to smoke crack
And go to sleep, I'm strapped
Just knowing any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
For you to play me, it's cockamamie
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeah, the whole kitten-kaboodle
I'm just brutal. It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There’s a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 3: T.I]
I'm the man in my city ain't nobody wit me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
I'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS'S on 26's watching some television
Shorty I'm never slipping got the berretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stolen the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now, shoulda seen me before I had children
Give dick to ya daddy's daughter and dare her to have children?
Hope he got some insurance 'cause death her is enduring?
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash on 'em, let him have it
Meanwhile, my attention is pullin' in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart
"Tell Me Lies" - Scene 1

[Verse 1: Melissa McIntyre as Ashley Kerwin]
You say it's simple, it's who you ought to be
Look in the mirror, you are not what you see
You say it's simple, but aren't your wings tired?
To tell the truth, why do you have to hide?

[Interlude: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my lady's track and I sprinkled some rap in it
They telling me lies

[Bridge: Melissa McIntyre as Ashley Kerwin]
What's wrong with being someone else?
No shame, and living life their way, tell me lies

[Interlude: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
They like, "Please, please tell us your reality, J!
We can't fathom how it feel to be forever confined."
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, I'm ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that I've accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
It's like

[Hook: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now

"Tell Me Lies" - Scene 2

[Verse: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my lady's track and I sprinkled some rap in it
And now they like, "Please, please tell us your reality, J!
We can't fathom how it feel to be forever confined."
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, I'm ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that I've accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
Cause the fabrication would help to settle that
And imagination would ease the pain
I came into this world as honest and pure
But can't guarantee to you that I'mma leave the same, so

[Hook: Drake as Jimmy Brooks, (Melissa McIntyre as Ashley Kerwin)]
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Can't figure out how I'm supposed to make it now
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Can't figure out how I'm supposed to make it now, tell me lies

[Outro: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
I said, tell me lies

Tried to say, tried to say

[Outro]
Everything
Everything
Everything
Everything
Born to do it
Even though all my friends lookin at me like who knew it
Run to it
The hoods just spit by new nigga
Feel cats talkin like who nigga
Is he
Where did he come from CL
My mom prayed for me on my journey
Treat me like an alien something like sigourney
Live through the game for the fame and the gurney
Tried to put me on the pedestal
Hoes treated me like who are you
Now I get to choose like you and her too
I just like girls not whores
But I have a chill time make s'mores
But if I wanna plow someone like a snow blower
I can work that ass like a workout plan
And then I holla at fam
Talkin bout Ye, Don C., Jigga man
Been representing since I met 'Quence and I get style tips from my homeboy Ibn
Common's the homie
Really Doe is the homie
GLC is the homie
And Big Sean what a gwan'
I go monkey paw on the record and they think I’m cookoo
Niggas is sign and dated like they recorded in fubu
Most niggas will quote you play scrabble with your words man
Till you see them at your shows is my dick that they blow man
I would sit up some nights and think about my own place
Probably cause I took so many blunts of Kush to the face
My bad thoughts I can’t erase
Or eat what’s on the devils plate
I just tell the devil wait
Cause murder will not be the case
In london with hudson
And them girls want some cuttin
I’m with him so I’m cool
Plus my face on the telly
But I’m pissed at the moment
I got charged for some roamin'
AT&T is some bullshit man I wish they’d stop frontin'
But when I roll back to brooklyn
Hit the store for a dutchie
I say homie keep rappin
I say homie its nothin
I’m
This is
Dream on
Now when I roll back to cleveland
Hit the store for a phillie
Niggas tell me keep rappin
Cause them young niggas feel me
Hear me
Hah hem
Hear me
Yep yep
Hear me
Yep yep yep
Hear me
Hear me
When I roll out to cali
Hit the store for a swisher
Niggas tell me keep rappin
I say homie I get'cha
Hear me
Hear me
Cudder
This is the Dopest shit
Hope Niggas like that shit
("Dream On", "Dream On")

[Wiz Khalifa Verse]
24, from the hood and I made 11 million this year so im throwin up paper
Got a bunch of niggas with me that done made it from the bottom, gettin' money, all throwin' up Taylor
You can roll em out, puff em, I don't save it, I stuff em I don't gotta chase money im good
Ill bake the whole onion and replace it like its nothing ya im talkin straight cookies no oven
And im smokin' in public, rich folks still love it
He talkin', he bluffin', that's my chick, she stuntin'
And my team is the wildest, try and get high enough to see Mr. Wallace
Thumbs green like the mile is, this for my youngins gettin steamed up in college
If you seen all my closets so much style its like my stylist had a stylist
And my crib like a palace Wizzle go hard like a callus

[Hook]

[Wiz Khalifa]
All we smoke is papers, blowin' hella flavors
Smokin till its gone, that's how we do it cause were taylor'd

[Juicy J]
Get high (get high), get fucked up (get fucked up)
Get high (get high), get fucked up (get fucked up)
Get high (get high), get fucked up (get fucked up)
Get high (get high), get fucked up (get fucked up)

[Juicy J Verse]
Cop a pound, come a pound, roll a pound, blow it down
Call a ho, its goin down, Juicy J from stoner town
Originality where Mary Jane control the sound
Blue Dream and Lean for all of those who knew the time
Hash, kef oils in the gas mask we be doin numbers like its math class
Match one, nigga don't you know im match back
Colors on the herb make the bud look abstract
Smoke good, cause I deserve it, sour diesel got me swerving
Im swerving, right up on the curbing
Big bong rips, got my chest hurting
Purp naps, in the Marriott sweet
I wanna taste the weed but the swisher too sweet
So make sure you know its only taylors if we meet
If you get trippy mane you can even choke a bean
Blood came through and just dropped off a load
And I ain't sellin shit everything gettin smoked
Smoke when I get up, smoke myself to sleep
Taylor Gang bitch 10 pounds every week

[Hook]

[Berner Verse]
Bern ima rep for my city, im on two blue pills and got the room smelling pissy
Ask, I tell her don't kiss me don't come up for air, lost your bitch to the game, fuck it life isn't fair
Im too chill, 2 mil re caught with my rap money
Two or three pads bad bitches roll the planes for me
Two strains that my new nickname, cherry pound cookie all you see is a big flame
Stunt, grown man with a coat on, trippy in a room full of girls with no clothes on
But ya I love how i'm living, I just left the night club im in bed with 3 women
Too high, too fly, big belly cause I eat good
Blew 30 grand on drinks, I better sleep good
Bag full of shit you probably seen in my twitpics
Hoodrich the only thing a stripper get is good dick
Ya im so slow motion in an s class floating hard to keep my eyes open
A king pin I keep weed by the elbow
Skin all itchy tonight, im sippin yellow

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Don't keep it all in your head
What we had was off
It's best that we forget
And overlook it all

[Refrain]
But even now when they fall into place
I think about you then

[Chorus]
I know I'd forget
If I was alone
Make sure I can miss
Love and hold on

[Verse 2]
Got left surrounded
By my old things
Thought I had moved on (thought I had moved on)
Tried to make ends meet
But picked up a new beat
And so I laid out (and so I laid out)

[Refrain]
But even now when they fall into place
I think about 'em then

[Chorus]
I know I'd forget
If I was alone
Make sure I can miss
Love and hold on
Make sure I can miss
Love and hold on
Make sure I can miss
Love and hold on

[Outro]
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget

[Intro: Priscilla Renea]
Dearly beloved, if this love only exists in my dreams
Don't wake me up

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Too much light in this window, don't wake me up
Only coffee, no sugar inside my cup
If I wake and you're here still, give me a kiss
I wasn't finished dreaming about your lips

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up

So much life in the city, you won't believe
Been awake for some days now, no time to sleep
If your heart is a pillow, this love's the bed
Tell me what is the music inside my head

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Girl, you wanna play with me, baby

You about to get exactly what you came for
Now I can throw it up, throw it up, break it down, down, down
Even if it ain't loud, she gets me aroused
Slow it up, slow it up, slow it down

'Cause I'ma keep my hands to myself and my back on the wall
Gon' play with it, baby

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
Uh, I fucked with my first bitch, I upgrade my second broad

Vintage out my fuckin' cars, no T-Bone just fuckin' yacht
Your new bitch, my old bitch, you can have the ho 'cause she talk a lot
Now get your ass up on this pole, you can get this money
Now I got them carats, I got all them Playboy bunnies
Come shake it for daddy, I'm throwin' them hunnids
Racks on top of racks and Maybachs look like hunnids

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
And they ass big as a mountain, put my drink on it, she cold
My zipper down but my money up, better get your ass up on that pole
Two more shots then I'm out, blacka, blacka then I reload
Got it, might earn 20 more, get yo' ass up on that pole
Damn, look at Lakeisha gettin' that money just like a zesta

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
I don't make it rain
Nigga, I make it monsoon like a tidal wave
Me taking 23 shots, that's a MJ
I mean a fadeaway, we 'bout to fade away
She said she like my pants, I think she like my pockets
Bitch, I'm in the buildin' countin' millions, you should try it
Yeah, what d'you mean? She tried to kiss me, I said, "Stop it"
Put that money in the face, then she get that pussy poppin'

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]

[Chorus: KRS-ONE]
The word I bring to you today
Is Knowledge Reigns Supreme
You got no time to joke and play
Cause Knowledge Reigns Supreme
While others play that game for fame
Their concepts bring you stress and strain
But blessed are those that know my name
Is Knowledge Reigns Supreme

[Verse 1: KRS-ONE]
Why do I call myself God when I'm speaking
People always ask me this question when I'm teaching
What you gotta understand is that Kris don't exist
The only existence is God consciousness
In God consciousness is what exists is Kris
Your ego tells you that you doing all this
You a Mister, a Mister professional lyricist
I get rid of this forever, It only gets better
Kris from the universe; you can never sever
Cause there is no Kris, only the universe remember
Go a little deeper you can check me
My whole campaign is about living life correctly
But don't respect me respect the universe
Tt's her verse that I disperse

[Chorus x1]

[Verse 2: KRS-ONE]
I'll bring you out the cave
And change how you behave
Everything is really particles and waves
Not to mention your visual extension is ruled by perception
Guiding your every direction
If you really want money your mentality much switch
If you really wanna be rich you gotta act like you're rich
You can't act like a bitch if you wanna be a lady
You can't get the gravy if you're sitting around lazy
You can't be in the hustle if you ain't looking for trouble
You can't be single if you know you're really double
You can do it, yeah
We can do it, yeah
You can do it, yeah
We can do it, yeah
We the best
Don't worry about the cards that they dealt ya'
It's real I percieved myself out the shelter
Every day and night seeing myself rock the mic'
Lyrics tight, getting paid right for my mental sight
Richer not poorer, expanding my aura
To attract more'a positive energy

[Chorus x1]

[Background talking: Unknown]
Uhh, one two my man Kris
Flip the style you do it like this

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
Hard to forget it
The culture thats inbedded check it
It's energetic
But people really want me deaded
But Kris won't let it
The same thing that you read I read it
My hair is dreaded
But hip-hop yes you must respect it
We must direct it and use it positively
So these skeptics can learn our mathetics
Like metric I said it
I'm about to shed it
Why don't you check me like your credit
You still don't get it
You twist it like ???? ????
Rappers nowadays sound so pathetic
Yo let me said it
Although my presentation is derided
And hypothetic
My genetics is highly poetic and athletic
But still some don't get it
The paparazzi life is all synthetic
The balancing of the mind is what's authentic
The total body is ultra-magnetic

[Outro talking: KRS-ONE]
There's no need to be afraid
Open your mind
Do your knowledge
Do your knowledge
Stop studying your knowledge
And do your knowledge

[Intro: Travie McCoy]
Ha, ha
Yeah, it's Travie
Bring the hook in

[Chorus: CeeLo Green & Travie McCoy]
Doctor
Won't you come and help me take this pain away? (Away, away)
Oh, oh, doctor
Give me what I need to get me through the day (The day, the day)
I want that feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That real good (Real good), yeah
I want that feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That real good (That real good)
Dr. Feel Good, help me

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Lately, I've been beside myself
And it's unlike me to hide myself
It's not like I like being by myself
I wanna see the world, but can't decide myself
Whether or not to get up off this couch
Whether or not to get up out this house
I wanna know what it's like to feel real good
Is there something you can prescribe, Dr. Feel Good?
I mean he's so happy, she's so free Doctor, what in the world is wrong with me?
I just need some reassurance, I know my carrier won't be insuring this
If you could just be earnest
Oops, I meant honest and make this promise
If any of this makes sense, let 'em know I wasn't crazy, just thoroughly convinced

[Chorus: CeeLo Green & Travie McCoy]
Doctor
Won't you come and help me take this pain away? (Away, away)
Take the pain away, take the pain away
Oh, oh, doctor (Doctor)
Give me what I need to get me through the day (The day, the day)
Get me through the day, through the day
I want that feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That real good (Real good), yeah
I want that feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That real good (That real good)
Dr. Feel Good, help me

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
She got the set of lips like a sedative
Every time I kiss, it's like medicine
Something said to me no, no, don't let her in
'Cause every time I do, I end up upset again
And then it's back to the waiting room
Waiting patiently for them to bring another patient to 'em
Anything is possible
Especially when you see it in the hospital
I hope Dr. Feel Good can fix me
And help me find peace of mind before 50
(Mr. McCoy, you're up next)
I made a detour quickly
Hightailed it towards the exit door before they could get me
It didn't take much to lose 'em
But before I got home, I came to a conclusion
That feeling good means another appointment
Take two of these and don't expect a call in the morning

[Chorus: CeeLo Green & Travie McCoy]
Doctor
Won't you come and help me take this pain away? (Away, away)
Take the pain away, take the pain away
Oh, oh, doctor (Doctor)
Give me what I need to get me through the day (The day, the day)
Get me through the day, through the day
I want that feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That real good (Real good), yeah
I want that feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That real good (That real good)
Dr. Feel Good, help me

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
Ladies and gentlemen, hey, pardon me, patients
See what I'mma do right now is break it down
Put your hands together
Repeat after me, come on
I feel good (I feel good)
Real good (Real good)
I feel good (I feel good)
Real good (Real good)

[Chorus: CeeLo Green & Travie McCoy]
Doctor
Won't you come and help me take this pain away?
Take the pain away, take the pain away
Oh, oh, doctor (Doctor)
Give me what I need to get me through the day
Get me through the day, through the day
I want that feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That real good (Real good), yeah
I want that feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That feel good
That real good (That real good)
Dr. Feel Good, help me

[Outro: Travie McCoy]
Yeah
I'll let this one ride out
Yeah, brought to you by yours truly, Mr. CeeLo Green
The delectable Smeezingtons
Thank y'all for comin' out
God bless
Good night
Travie, by the way

[Hook]
See, we ain't worried 'bout a damn thing, damn thing

So what you doing about it? Not a damn thing, damn thing
Keep it moving, I'm on over doing my damn thing

[Verse 1]
You see I'm here now - that's right, you not the man
They say I spit coke, supply the block with grams
And I ain't liftwaiting, I'm taking lots of grands
Cuz I ain't got patience, I'm not a doctor, fam
My niggas get it crunk, chump rep the side you from
Smokin' somethin nigga, light ya blunt
Ain't got ya gun, you better find you one (why?)
Cuz this is Pistolvania - where them apes crawl
Bunch of shorties on the the corner, pocket full of 8balls
And you never gonna see one of my niggas sleep
Until they cake long
Aye what you mean, man? Something like the Great Wall
As far as rap go, yeah, its in the bag
Of course the haters wanna do me bad
Prolly mad because of the shit that I have
I never let them slow me down, dawg, I'm living fast
So as long as the chick want to get with the young'n
That's all about making this cash
I'm still a young'n, but niggas respect the flow
And don't check me, ya better check ya ho

[Verse 2]
I'm in the studio, making classic heat
You niggas mad at me, this cash I have to see
And you chumps can amount out for the ones
And I'm bout done with you punks
And you clowns wanting to come for the crown
I hear alot of talk, I gotta let them know
I put the bussiness on a nigga, really think he feeling nutty
When he come and try to test the flow (woah)
Cause I'm not for the games, opt you will not do a thing
See I was taught you gotta walk if you're talkin the same
And its 4-1-2 til I fall to the grave
They'on know what to do with the boy to this day
Cause I'm always pimpin'
If I put my voice on track, the whole world gon' listen
Some niggas might can hate, but you can say
I get away with murder like O.J. Simpson
I'm into all day grinding
Don't nothing come easy, I'm putting the time in
The young'n keep rhyming
So that one day I can sit back and reclining
I see you stressed out, man we do this shit for fun
Call me the best out (why)
Khalifa get it done (yes)

[Hook]
See, we ain't worried 'bout a damn thing, damn thing

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
It’s a new year, new day
The hardest regardless of what you dudes say, truthfully
Who are you to me? money talks was taught to speak fluently
It's nothing new to me, sometimes it takes three blunts to get through to me
It only took me months to get through the streets
But when you got beats and your lyrics are dumb hard
Nobody gotta let you in the game you just bombard
Yeah but niggas are gon hate though
No matter who you are there's another wanting your place bro
Mind on cash roll the grass and fade slow
Learn fast to mow the grass, the snakes low
A look past the love some niggas ain't sure
Made me my own man now I do my grown man
More advanced a young’n nearly in the game
Shit looking better now, but I remember the rain

[Hook: Sample]
Rain
I still remember the rain
I still remember

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Feeling slept on knowing I'm the best songwriter or freestyler
I'll bite a nigga's head off
The flow was ill before I inked the deal
I signed cause a flow like mine needs a mill
I grind for real, and that’s no days off
You work hard for it and it's gon pay off
You can rap, even work a j-o-b
Or duckin' the policeman, when cars tryin' to pump weight off
See I was taught to get it how you live
Niggas know Wiz has been about his bread
In the stu I'm a beast, I can speak to 'em all day
In high school, have what you need in the hallway
Stuff long dutches with raw haze
Attention is nothing new, it's true I've been that nigga always
"So what you saying?"
Remain the same with fame I gained, it's good now but I remember the rain
Yeah I remember the rain!

[Hook]
4334
Ignorant, Atheist, sound like a fucking monster
Tall, skinny, lanky, bucket, fuck it badass posture
Cops are angering the hell
Where they discounted mounted
With the devil, he was formal and some Polo and some Dockers
Dancing with him playing vengeance Cindi Lauper with some Crips
In all red like they playin' Red Lobster
My bitch is white Italian to be exact
Mobster is her father and he'll kill me
When he finds out im reading her Harry Potter
Fuck him!, Im a Demon fill your daughter up with semen
With Supreme emboirderd logos, making fun of homos cause its funny
Tommy rugby hilfiger screaming nigga with a cluck
I'm a fuckin' Nazi with a condom, barley give a fuck
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Fuck Lame, 91'
We hockey fuckin' Marksmen, hit you with the Wolf Gang
Puck, trucks thunder now shes in the trunk wondering why shes about to get raped and chopped up, lumber
He said, write a sixteen, well she was seventeen
And I'm only eighteen and that's statutory rape
And if you fuckin' snitch on me I guess I'll make the great escape
To have a date with your dead body and I cannot be late
Might do a Ted Bundy, I can consider ya'll some haughtys
If they find me at my home, guess I gotta fuckin roam
All alone ,in the streets, gotta hustle drugs for food
Gotta sell beats for clothes if I really wanna eat
Fuck you, O.F.M. Bangin' on your mothafuckin' FM
Fuck Tammy
Fuck Tammy

[Intro]
Hahaha, in your old man voice, haha
Yeah, a one-two, a one-two
412, 412
412, 412
412, 412
Uh, uh, nothin' but rhymes, it's quite simple

[Verse]
Hey, it's what I create to eliminate the hate
Illuminate the night in the lightnin'
UFO sightings, leave 'em unidentified
Steady, I be gettin' high
You ain't got no herbal, I'ma lend you mine
It's Dr. Octagon, call him Young Phenomenon
I leave these rappers starvin' like it's Ramadan
You all the wackest, my style holographic
Had to put my city on the map, shit, haha
If you a fat kid, go get active
If you a bad bitch, then be a actress
Rap ease carnage, my family ain't the Partridge
Hard trick, flawless, trapeze artists
Take my life and put it in a photo album
How much money do I got? I don't know, who's countin'?
Fake muhfuckas round me, I could do without 'em
You keepin' it a hundred, I could use a thousand
I'm comin' now, call a truce
I got a lot, but not to lose
I'm the shit, makin' hits, call me Dr. Luke
And prescribin' you a vibe for that awful mood
Why you sad all the time? Jump off a roof
While I'm kickin' it with Q-Tip and Posdnuos
Tryna put me down, well, that's futile, woo shell
Supernatural message got you spooked out
Believe in God but don't believe religion
Sayin' it's the truth but never really listened
That's another conversation though
Walkin' on the pavement home, find a way to go
Maybe one not taken, word to Robert Frost
Blowin' out steam but it's all exhaust
We comin' for your dollars, better call the cops
You want a war? We got a nuclear holocaust
Yo, E, how many bars is that?
Is it enough to give these haters all heart attacks?
I been writin' on the paper, gave me carpal tunnel
Couple billion people, are they all gon' love you?
Hell no, hell no
I be grindin' though the rain, sleet, hail, snow
Stickin' to my word like it's Velcro
On some shell toes, and what else, yo?
Dope shit, go crazy
Kinda like the Internet over Hov's baby
My girl tell me, "Mac, you a weirdo"
I guarantee that baby be a superhero
This ain't nothin' but some rhymes from my mind
That been stuck inside since the beginning of time
Chemical romance, slow dance with no pants
If I got my eyes on her, playa, you got no chance
This some simple shit I'm sure they feel
I'm just tryin' to explore what's real
Child of the blues, never liked school
Been miseducated, so word to Lauryn Hill
Music is my outlet, walkin' through the Polo store
In the studio, wonder what I go home for
In my own world when I close the door to the booth
We young and searchin' for the truth

[Outro]
Like that, like that, like that, like, like that, that, that, that
And a little bit of this and a little bit of that
I just spit a rhyme, tell me that I kick a rap
And if you got some time, you can sit down
Listen to me now, pass the flow around
Hey, this some cypher shit
I know you like that shit
Freestylin' in the air, go and write that shit
I don't write that bitch, I got ill flows
Yeah, I'm ill, uh, uh
And this is real, yo
Mac Miller gon' kill those
Flows
Bouncin' up and down, yo-yos
Head to your toes
In the—, in the paint throwin' 'bows
Yeah, throwin' 'bows in the paint
That's what basketball players do
I don't think anyone's gonna listen this far
But we should keep it in
Bee-yatch!
Blue Slide Park, the album available right now on iTunes
Uh, you get on there, and you just, hit "Buy now"
It's only, uh, $9.99
All original music

[Intro] Whoa, oho, oho, whoa

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I got a feeling in my bones that I can't get rid off
But that's probably the base
Can't get this picture out my mind, that I've seen on Twitter
The one of your face
Girl I'm just trying to see, if you feel just a little like me
So DM me back, don't do me like that
I wanna see your pretty ass in person, girl
But that's just not the case
Plus I'm way on the other side of the earth
And girl plane tickets too hard for me to pay
I'm just trying to see, if you feel just a little like me
So you can give me a call
I ain't doing nothing at all

[Hook]
Girl you can tweet what you do
And posting pictures
And I feel like I need to be posted with you
Laid up in the bed somewhere, spilling make up, messing up your hair
Girl you keep making me spend my time
Checking on your timeline
You make me say whoa oho Yeah Yeah
I'm falling in love with your default picture

[Verse 2]
You don't ever show up in my mentions girl
Just say my name
Must be some wrong with my eyes of my iphone-drive
Or is this even your page?
I am just trying to see if you got any interests in me
Or am I bothering you?
Should I be unfollowing you?
And you be acting like that dude in your picture is your boyfriend...
But I know it's just a face
Let me show you that I am better than him
Just name a time and place
Girl you gotta see where he is, that is hould be
Girl you can give me a call
I just wanna have a talk that's all

[Hook]
Girl you can tweet what you do
And posting pictures
And I feel like I need to be posted with you
Laid up in the bed somewhere, spilling make up, messing up your hair
Girl you keep making me spend my time
Checking on your timeline
You make me say whoa oho Yeah Yeah
(2x)'
I'm falling in love with your default picture

[Spoken Intro]
My ex-girlfriend used to have a really weird fetish
Uh, she use to like to dress up as herself
And act like a fucking bitch all the time

[Intro]
My show is a little bit silly
And a little bit pretentious
Like Shakespeare's willy
Or Noam Chomsky wearing a strap-on
It's also a little bit gay
And a little bit offensive
Like Thanksgiving Day
Or Noam Chomsky wearing a strap-on
So, put your cell phones to vibrate
And put your vibrators to cell phone mode

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the show
It goes a little something like this
Joke, exactly
Welcome to my flow
It flows a little something like this
With a rap and a dis
And a swift wrap on the wrist
A wrap and a kiss
Like Hershey's wrapping a kiss
Shit, I got a show that'll test ya kids
Then, ask one question
And that question is

[Chorus]
What's funny?
What's funny, what's funny, what's funny?
What's funny, what's funny, what's funny?
Funny, f-funny
What's funny?
What's funny, what's funny, what's funny?
What's funny, what's funny, what's funny?
Funny, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Humor is often linked to shared experience
Like, a guy gets up and says
"Have you noticed that public restrooms
Have really inefficient hand-dryers?"
Oh my God, yes, I have
Ha-ha-ha
Really good point, they should fix that
It's good to know that somebody finally gets me
Because my wife divorced me
Which subconsciously forced me
To lose all sense of self
So, it's nice to think about hand-dryers
And not that cheating whore
Because stand-up comedy is actually pretty easy
If you're an Asian comic, just get up and say
"My mother's got the weirdest fucking accent"
Then, just do a Chinese accent
Because everybody laughs at the Chinese accent
Because they privately thought
That your people were laughable
And now you've given them the chance to express that in public
Ah, yeah
If you're a musical comic
Just give 'em a little weird voice inflection
Then take a Viagra and slap them
With a rock-hard misdirection

[Chorus]
What's funny?
What's funny, what's funny, what's funny?
What's funny, what's funny, what's funny?
Funny, f-funny
TOURETTES!
What's funny?
What's funny, what's funny, what's funny?
What's funny, what's funny, what's funny?
Funny

[Verse 3]
Oh, and the audience says
"When I was a baby
Maybe I laughed at people jiggling keys"
Now I'm older and bolder
And just get mad cause I notice
That the keys are to a Hummer
Fuck my life, I don't fuck my wife
So, fuck my wife and fuck my life
And my son is gay, but not "sitcom gay"
Daughter's a whore like another girl
That used to be her mother
But the marriage made her
"Miss Merry Americana"
I wanna teen without screaming prima-donna
But radical feminists made my wife a man
Oh, and if I die happy
The situation will be autoerotic asphyxiation
I hate my life and it hates me back
And my friend is black
But I don't know what to call him
So, I just call him
"What up, Jamal?"
Even though his name is Steve
I hate my job, I hate my life
Hate my kids, hate my wife
Jews would know I do it, Judas beat me to it
I'm slowly slipping into a solipsistic coma
And I masturbate because I'm the only one whose standards are low enough to fuck me

[Chorus]
What's funny?
What's funny, what's funny, what's funny?
What's funny, what's funny, what's funny?
Funny, f-funny
*pop* It's a boy
What's funny?
What's funny, what's funny, what's funny?
What's funny, what's funny, what's funny?
Funny, yeah
Hopefully this
*blows raspberry*

[Verse 1: Xperience]
If it ain't fresh, then you ain't gettin' play in my tape deck
Way back, I used to rock the hat with the suede strap at ABC's
Bought my food from the Arabs
Played craps on corners where the OG's slang at
Cross colors, I'm the boss of the playground
Iesha on the nuts, cos I knew how to play house
The 8 oz. baby from '84 to grow up
Cleaner than my Easter suit was with my shoes buffed
Don't step on my new ones
These Reeboks beat blocks, you give 'em a few pumps
Baby, why your attitude, "boo boo"?
She came from a new school, and all I wanna do is my zoom zoom
My uncle stayed faded like crew cuts
But I was just too young to know the what's-what and the who's-who
'Round here, they could give a fuck if you got props
You get clowned for rockin' British Knights to the sock hop
The BK stood for "black kids," the hood was crackin'
And "Poison" was on everybody's tracklist
Spandex was in fashion, back then
And bad chicks had tracks in that lasted

[Hook]
Before CDs and Internet the kings was in effect
You fiends wasn't gettin' respect
Before mp3s and CD-Js, we pop in a tape cassette
Chain on my chest, I'm fresh

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Let's take it back, b-b-b-back to the days of AC/DC, Back in Black
Gimme a mullet, a 1984 Chevrolet
Alright, I'm lying, I was listening to rap
OshKosh B'Gosh, stone wash, so hard
Overalls hung, one strap on, one off
Eatin' on my cold lunch, grabbin' on both nuts
Mom I want a jheri curl, fuck this bowl cut
Ice Cube's got one
Quik in my Walkman
Blowin' on the cartridge
Hypercolor, awesome
Kube's in my pocket and I'm outta here
I'm bouncing and Sam Goody's not getting shit from my allowance
Day dreaming in class, know I'm zoning out and
Rosie Perez's titties are right where my mouth is
Who says that white men can't jump? They were hella wrong!
A'ight, they were right, but I was really good at tetherball
Before the days of getting drunk at kegs
We were bumping some Jodeci and dry-humpin' legs
That's right, I was born in the '80s
Pimpin', adventurous, tryin to bone my babysitter
House party?
Crackin'
Humpty dance?
Crackin'
Never find the baby, David Bowie, Labyrinth
Why don't you reminisce and bring it back, rap shit
Dodge Caravan, humpin' in the back, classic

[Hook]
Before CDs and Internet the kings was in effect
You fiends wasn't gettin' respect
Before mp3s and CD-Js, we pop in a tape cassette
Chain on my chest, I'm fresh

[Intro - Cyhi Da Prince]
Damn baby you sexy
What you scared for?
You think somebody gon' find out?
Who gon' say somethin'?
I ain't gon' tell on myself
Oh man, baby we grown
(J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League)
You feel me?

[Verse 1 - Mike Posner]
I hit first night
Now she's worried I think that she's a groupie
But I know I'm still
Probably gonna take her to the movies
Now I find myself
In another delicate situation
Cause I can't date you
We can talk 'bout it I'm at the Holiday Inn

[Hook - Mike Posner]
If you don't tell your girlfriends, I won't tell the crew
No one has to know about the crazy shit we do
I can keep it on the low girl, I don't kiss and tell
No one has to know about what goes on in this hotel
I won't tell a soul

[Verse 2 - Mike Posner]
She's mad at me
Cause I forgot to call her on her birthday
But I've been runnin' around
Doin' what makes you wanna fuck me in the first place
I don't like you
Enough to think 'bout making you my lady
I only call you
When I'm in town I know that drive you crazy

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Cyhi Da Prince]
Yeah, nope, hah
Hah, what you mean tell?
I don't even watch television
And I don't own a telescope, you feel me?
Cyhi

I got this girl I met in Kennesaw
Originally from Wichita
She said she from the country
So I pulled her bumpin' Tim McGraw
I got a few dollars in my budget
So I scooped her in the rental car
I took her back to the W
Reached inside the minibar
And poured us both a cup of Goose
Then I rolled up like a rubber do
First I lay you on the bed
Then I cocoa butter you
Then we do what lovers do
On top of the covers, ooh
Damn girl you sexy
You gon' make me baby mother you
Then she said, "What am I gon' tell my friends?"
And this is what I told her before I put it in

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
"There must be some kind of way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody offered his word"
Hey!

[Verse 2]
"No reason to get excited"
The thief, he kindly spoke
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But, uh, but you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us stop talkin' falsely now
The hour's getting late
Hey!

[Guitar Solo]

Hey!

[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Well, uh, outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
Hey!

[Outro]
All along the watchtower
All along the watchtower

[Chorus: Milk Dee]
I-I get
I-I get
I-I get money!
I-I get money!

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Fuck I look, like coppin’ denim and tops?
Niggas wanna book me, but they ain’t spendin’ no guap
That’s why, I pull up to the curb, like fuck's the word?
You know, I keep the twenty-two tucked, in the girdle
Had to leak one of my bitches off, Throop and Myrtle
Put the shells to your back, now they callin' you turtle
See, if you wanna laugh, you can laugh
But nigga, get my money, get my cash, get my math
See everything’s funny 'til that ass gettin' trashed
I'm getting dirty money, like my stash need a bath, see boys?
If it don’t make cents, then it don’t make dollars
When broke niggas holler, I just pop my collars
The dope boys get it, yeah, the dope boys cool
But, the white boys say, they be like, "Nicki’s rules!"
Like, you got money, 'cause you’re sittin' on dubs
Where your company, nigga where your pay stubs?
Look I'm on the grind and I'm lookin' for the grub
Fifty in the club, and we lookin' for the bub
Talkin' 'bout you wanna enjoy me, first you gon’
Need to get a couple employees, get it?
Get your money right, get your money right, right?
Then you can bite, you know this something tight, tight
You know I smoke bitches, I'mma need a light, light
Coogi on my coochie, size three, white Nikes, kyuh

[Chorus: Milk Dee]
I get money, money I got
I get money, money I got
I get money, money I got
I get money, money I got
(I get it) I-I get money
I got m-money I got, m-money I got

[Verse 2: Amil]
While y'all motherfuckers was talking that K-Mart shit
Every two days my man was movin' four to six bricks
And cop me a five bedroom house, two car garbage, three full baths
I love it when you run your mouth
Jag' in the driveway, sittin' right next to the Rover
Bitch, I ain't never been over
Broke ass runnin' around talkin' about I'm popped
Bag and shoes, 'bout a G each, bitch, what you got?
I keep a fresh pair of 7's on
Bitch, you still got 54 11's on
Since when I gave a fuck about this rappin' shit?
While you waitin' 'round for record deals, I'm stackin', bitch
I blow your budget in a day, your advance the same night
Before you talk left, bitch, get your game tight
Bitch, I get money, money I got
Bitch, I don't come outta pocket, I let a nigga cop it

[Chorus: Milk Dee]
I get money, money I got
I get money, money I got
I get money, money I got
I get money, money I got
(I get it) I-I get money
I got m-money I got, m-money I got

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
The bank don't stop 'cause they put me in cuffs
Still made money up in the can, what the fuck?
I'll have a baby by you, baby, if you a billionaire
Write the check before I come, just sign right here
I'mma stay rich, I ain't gon' die tryna spend my shit
I'mma die tryna spend your shit
Nowadays these rap niggas on some feminine shit
So I guess Queen B gon' be the man of this shit
Laughin' at these rap bitches on some amateur shit
They better off makin' a livin' on some janitor shit
Who the hell is this chick?
She been out kinda long
Had one hot song, I'm sorry I missed it
Too busy being conceited, puttin' on my lipstick
Takin' trips out in Cali, chillin' with the Hiltons
Yeah, I'm chillin', Kim top billin'
With the top down, throwin' money through the ceiling, I get it
The lifestyle you only rap about, I live it
My man buy me cars that you hoes be rentin'
I'm classy like the Phantom, you a Honda Civic
Lil Kim got your whole bank stock, I get it!
Bustin' shots, b-bustin' shots, b-bustin' shots, yeah

[Verse 4: Remy Ma]
See, you can call this the Rem-mix, but it ain't Rem, though
It's Shesus Khryst, I switched up my M.O
The BX savior, gimme that paper
I'm passin' out the collection plates
'Cause I get gully, bust a shot right at your favorite rapper
Really kill hip-hop, see, I'm gettin that guap
Hater, you just a Rem fan
I put haters in trunks and I don't mean swim pants
I talk gun talk and people believe me
But that's how I do it when I do it for TV
Tryna stop my cash flow, I flips on you assholes
My itinerary full, I got mad shows
I'm goin overseas to see R to the Easy
At that currency exchange, I get that Euro easy
And my hair be fresh, my gear be fresh
I got last year, this year, and next, 'cause

[Chorus: Milk Dee]
I get money, money I got
I-I get money, money I got
I-I get money, money I got
M-money I got, M-money I got

Mr. Chad Hugo, you know and Lupe and Alicia

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I know you wanna leave like Lillian
So lets gon' get up out the city then
And leave it all behind like Gideon's
And when we get there, their like "it's them again?"
Well it's me there all the time stop visting
Like we committed a crime and now we in the pen
And there's no parole, it's life sentencing
I know its sounds like potential wife senitiments
But then again
We ain't got to go to prison just to get it in
I can get you out of your division ten
That bars for my windy city citizens
Even though the vision photo of the women in, dont let it get you down
Never givin in, in the end its temporary like henna and
Push the felling now, bring the feeling in

[Alicia Keys]
This is my love letter to you (paradise), you're the only way I can get away
You are (paradise)
My escape everyday
Here's my love letter to the beat
I leave my heart on the floor
Love letter to the beat
We have three minutes more
So move me my body's here for you to have
Thrill me cause this may be my only chance to be crazy
You dont need permission to free me
Cause that's what I need you to do

You're the only one who understands me
I can be myself
Do anything that I want to baby
In this moment nothing can stop me
Do you hear me

This is my love letter to you
(paradise)
Your the only way I can get away
You are (paradise)
My escape everyday
Here's my love letter to the beat
Leave my heart on the floor
Love letter to the beat we have two minutes more

Times like this call for desperate measures and everything else is out of control this is the only place I can go
You're my sweet paradise
My sweet escape and I wanna thank you
Cause as long as this song is on see

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, and we gon' get your bounce back
Run up in the bank make em give your house back
Take over the scene look at how we house that
Black card kisses can't leave your house without that
No, can't leave your mouth without them
Them right in front of them I doubt we about that
Balance I know they wonder how we found that
A challenge but look how we came about that
So tell them that you're on vacation
I read your letter and your playstation
Thats the p.s. that you use when you're reiterating
Its says you need ventilation
You're kind of blue and you need inspiration taken away from the place that you're placed in
A destination is waiting for you its a whole 'nother level we'll be taking it to, Lu

[Alicia Keys]
You're the only one who understands me I can be myself
Do anything that I want to baby
In this moment nothing can stop me you do you hear me
This is my love letter to you

Here's my love letter to the beat
I leave my heart on the floor
Love letter to the beat
Until the beat is no more
Love letter to the beat
Move my body 'round
Love letter to the beat until the music stops
Here's my love letter to the beat
I leave my heart on the floor
Love letter to the beat
Until the beat is no more
Love letter to the beat
Move my body round
Love letter to the beat until the music stops

Love letter to the beat
Love letter to the beat
Love letter to the beat

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I've been drinking so much my bitch said that "You're a alcoholic"
Every time I find something I'm good at you gotta spoil it
She said "Boy you need some help, damn right, you got it bad"
I say "Bitch we'll see next time that I buy your ass a bag"
Yeah Jizzle talk them birds, last time he seen a brick
What the fuck he rapping 'bout, last time he had a hit
In the back I got it loud like "Who the fuck you talking to?"
All that yelling, all that screaming, what the fuck you 'bout to do?
I don't do the lean but what's up with them double cups?
I say put vodka in both them muhfuckers, double up
I'm so high up in the clouds I hope I make it home
I'm so fucked up in the booth right now I hope I make the song

[Chorus: B.o.B]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up, all night

Okay, if I ball they dodgeballin', elementary

She pop, her knees drop, cuz these bottles are complementary
All night we making history, paparazzi be documenting my clique
You sideline, I'm headline at the top left
Take home the gold then hit the bowl, I'm Mike Phelps
Rings out with the prize belt, Olympic ganja, damn right
I'm 12:30, I'm groovy baby, all day, all night

[Chorus: B.o.B]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do)

And all we do is light it up, all night

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Every time you see him shorty going in
Go to jail, get back, here we go again
Back of that black Benz, get into that dough again
Million, Grand Hustle real nigga, no pretend
Bank roll can't fold, dough to the ceiling
A legend where he lived in, Bankhead brilliant
Ghetto bougie with bitches with ghetto booty, let's go cutie
Swagger so art deco I Ecko, Prada, Margiela, Louis
Blowing sticky-icky, get her gooey-ooey
He say she won't licky-licky, he don't know me, do he
Ayy truly Tip is just the coolest, thought you knew this
Guess the proof is in how long a nigga do it
BOW

[Chorus: B.o.B]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up, all night

And all we do is light it up, all night
All you see is strange clouds

And I can’t be simplistic

But I got you addicted

With big thick thighs
Big thick tits statistics

So we’ll stay up ‘till after three
And I’ll take care of you and Ashley
And Natalie and Kathelee
See all these girls be asking me
B.o.B, why you act so casually?
I just tell them actually
It happens only naturally
Cause see these dudes ain’t matching me
And no they ain’t out lasting me
So I give girls that vanity
I’m sick with it like a bad disease
So when I get down I take these girls to
Cyber Heaven

You ain't a mixtape chick baby
Had to sell a million for your time

[Bridge]
Say ayo
Can you hear me? Uh, can you hear me?
One more time, say ayo

You just give me a chance, make it feel alright

[Pre-Chorus]
That ass makes me want to oooh

Everybody here knows

[Chorus]
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Straight from the bottom of the cut
I give it to these bitch niggas like momma taught me
One man with no weapon at war, but I'm an army
My flow is captain: attention, lieutenant
Your penny pension and they demolished that invention
You better get your dollars up, and guess what, I was up
I get my cheese like Mickey Mouse, or else you better Donald Duck
Like a shootin' range target, I get all kinda bucks
Be my shootin' range target, nigga I got good luck
Nigga bye bye good luck, got your momma shook up
Lil bad ass nigga, who thought Popeye wasn't tough
I'm on that la la, twist it up, I'm on that syrup, slow it down
And I like four freaks too, and I ain't Yung Joc but its goin' down
I buy a marijuana field, then I just mow it down
Big bad wolf, yes, I just blow it down
No homo and to Hollygrove, I will hold it down
Like a circle of knives, I got the sharpest flow around

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Future (I know)
Future (I know)
Future (I know)
Future (I know)
Future
I know they can't fuck with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
Bitch I'm Mack Maine
I got the heart of a king, blood of a slave
Feel like I been there before, my second time to the grave
But it's one life to live, that's why I'm gettin' paid
Off a flow that's priceless, I just got it appraised
Spit like I need a raise, blaze as I gaze
At the stars and ask the Lord, why the culprit's at the pulpit
It make me sick to my stomach, that's why I rap
Like a pregnant woman, I don't spit I vomit
So pay homage, me and Wayne two G's
Like twenty hundreds and we keep the semis blunted
And we live like brothers from another
So fuck with him and Mack gonna react like you did me somethin'
That's a hint to you Davids, throwin' shots at Goliath
This the New Testament, where the victor is the giant
So you should get your weight and lose the hate
Remember males shouldn't be jealous, that's a female's trait

[Hook]
"His opponent from St. Petersburg, Florida"
"Two hundred thirty-one pounds, Barry Horowitz!!"

[Action Bronson]
Yeah, the Chocolatier
Bronsalinio... yeah

To the back with the hat, lean back in the 'llac
Crack the window, hear the soldier styles and that in back
Ain't no "Cat in the Hat," just a cat that can rap
This is Bronson - representing Flushing, Queens on the map
Yeah - heavyweight primate with a Harvard mind
Blunts filled with the citrus mixed with orange lime
Pussy drip when the thought of Action come to mind
Born to ride, winter spring summer shine
Bonafide, eyes wide, run and hide
You don't want the revolution to be televised
Terrorfied from the Arab mountain death camps
With the iron burning hot, give you chest stamps
Phone calls with the cloth over the mouthpiece
With or without leaf, burn about an ounce chief
To the neck like a razor for the stubble
Raised inside the struggle, blazin in the huddle yeah
Dig a hole, throw the lamb in it
Left the slippers in the sand motherfuckers couldn't stand in it
("Someone took the words to my song") {*ding ding ding*}

It's Barry Horowitz rap, I pat myself on the back
Don't fake the funk on a nasty dunk, Shaq I attack
Close the window to your soul, weed inside my lungs burn
These old suckers gettin placed into a young urn
Specialized like the little bus
Use my chubby little finger first to stimulate the clitoris
King Kong ain't got shit on us
I'm out here gettin it for real while you motherfuckers filibust'
Weed in my finger flicker, I'm on a solo mission
Started at pole position, eyes on the long division
As it burn my thumb, I roll another one
Quite persistant, that's why they call me my mother's son
Shoot the cold gift, leave your ho stiff
Make your ho sniff Hootie and the Blowfish
Obey the coke king
Cause every motherfucker in rockin loaded, I'm on that old shit!

("Someone took the words to my song" - 2X)

[Jim Ross]
"Barry Horowitz, always likes to pat himself on the back"

[Hook]
(I ohhhh, I choose you baby)
Thats what the game told me
Ain't nothin change, still the same man, the game chose me, sing
(Ohhhh, I choose you baby)
You know the game chose me
Ain't nothin change, this is what the game told me

[Verse 1]
Listen close here youngin'
See Ive been doing this here the most fed coming 'chea
And not a dude that a post here frontin
See niggas pay attention to mine
You listen and find, you gone hear something
I know niggas wanna know how I came up
He only 18, they see him stacking his change up
And alot of niggas chose to get in the game
Bat difference from you damn pricks
The prince was hand picked
The young guy is about as fly as it can get
They want I, cause I supply and demand quick
I'm C4 explosive is how your man spit
And I got a seat for anyone who can't stand it
I ain't chose the game, the game chose me
A little fame from the rap, but still the same OG
Cause when I came in it, cats said I stayed lowkey
But always making sure they know me
Thats when the game told me

[Hook]
(I ohhhh, I choose you baby)
Thats what the game told me
Ain't nothin change, still the same man, the game chose me, sing
(Ohhhh, I choose you baby)
You know the game chose me
Ain't nothin change, this is what the game told me

[Verse 2]
And you know I can't get enough, it's like I got a fetish for it
Too many wack MC's for me to just ignore it
I get on track simply to flood the state with heat
Stack my cake and eat, preaching more then they the streets
Seen them teens drop out the bumping the corner
Money and order, so they dont even want their diploma
Me, I'm trying to make a company owner
So while that may be tempting, this rap shit is bringing the ends in
And some say that (what?) there will be no one greater than him
One day that (what?) non believers, I'll convince em
I'm more of a leader and eating like im supposed to
Talk by the older dude, stand on my own two (yes)
And im deep in the game, not like I toasted be
I get somewhere if a lane, they took over me
Somewhere down the line, the grind molded me
It's so sick and this what the game told to me

[Hook]
(I ohhhh, I choose you baby)
Thats what the game told me
Ain't nothin change, still the same man, the game chose me, sing
(Ohhhh, I choose you baby)
You know the game chose me
Ain't nothin change, this is what the game told me

[Verse 3]
Now I'mma take you back to '97
I put in work to grind better
I was now with a rhyme fetish
Aged quicker, and seeing things in a different way
Was fourteen when I figured I had some shit to say
So I let it be known
That the tighter with top spitter
I'm coming for em, ready to own
And if somebody better let em be shown
I'm a comptetitive dude
Plus I'm ten steps ahead of you fools
They say

[Hook]
(I ohhhh, I choose you baby)
Thats what the game told me
Ain't nothin change, still the same man, the game chose me, sing
(Ohhhh, I choose you baby)
You know the game chose me
Ain't nothin change, this is what the game told me

[Hook: Daryl Hall]
I see a window and all I can think about is
So do you want to fly with me? Do you want to fly with me?
I know it sounds crazy but I can't find solid ground
So do you want to fly with me? Do you want to fly with me?

[Verse 1: Travis]
And I been staring out this window for the past eleven hours
Thinking of all the opportunities this window has to offer
From the twenty third floor and a filing cabinet east Manhattan
And FDR is beautiful as I'm watching all the cars passin'

Then a couple stars twinkle so I started laughin'
And a couple walk by and they look so happy
I booked this room at this place called The Last Resort
All my bags are packed, I got my jacket and my passport

And a first class ticket to the afterlife, you dig me?
Now is you is or is you ain't with me?
And I fully understand if you got other plans
But I can't see you hand in hand with another man
I been on auto-pilot since we last spoke
And I don't wanna board this flight on a bad note
I want you to think about it but either way I'm going
And if you really love me then here's your chance to show it

[Hook: Daryl Hall]
I see a window and all I can think about is
So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?
Oh, oh, I know it sounds crazy but I can't find solid ground
So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?

Oh, oh, we'll live forever and they will write a novel about our love
(Do you wanna fly with me?)
Oh, oh, we'll live forever and they will write a novel about our love
(Do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?)
So do you wanna?

[Verse 2: Travis]
She looked me dead in the eyes and took me by the hand
Kissed me on my cheek and said, "Baby, listen I understand"
You don't have to leave, plus I'm scared of heights
So just put down your luggage, forget about this flight

You and I, you know we been through a lot of things
But it's no reason to start trippin' and arguing
She said, "You are my king, and I place no one above you"
And I don't have to board a plane for me to show I love you
And all this talk about the afterlife is kinda creepy
So let's just go lay down and talk, I'm getting kinda sleepy
I kinda smiled and we both walked to the window
I pulled it shut and started staring at the sky

I wiped a couple tears away then we looked at each other
And I could see the stars twinkle in her eyes
I told her about the couple that I saw earlier
She said, "I'm sure they were cute, but they're no you and I"

[Hook: Daryl Hall]
I see a window and all I can think about is
So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?
Oh, oh, I know it sounds crazy but I can't find solid ground
So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?

Oh, oh, we'll live forever and they will write a novel about our love
(Do you wanna fly with me?)
Oh, oh, we'll live forever and they will write a novel about our love
(Do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?)

So do you wanna fly with me?
(So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?)
Do you wanna fly with me, with me, with me, with me?
(So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?)
Oh, oh, fly away, wanna fly away
(So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?)
Oh, don't think about it, just sit back and fly away
(Do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?)

Oh, what you think is wrong is right, you gotta stand by
(So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?)
Everything you know, got a reason you gotta fly, fly away
Oh, fly away

Don't worry about anything, don't worry about what the future brings, just fly
Just be here with me, just stay clear with me, oh, fly
Just stay close to me, you mean the most to me, oh, fly

Oh, don't worry, don't worry, just step back, just step away, oh
Oh, keep on doin' what you do, gonna fly, oh, oh, oh
Sing something to you, gonna change what you worry about
Don't think about it, oh, oh, just be here with me
I can share your misery, don't worry babe, oh
This is it y'all, some nasty shits for ya
Bring it

[MCA]
Jump out the window onto a parade balloon
My style is iller than the goblins in "Troll 2"
'Cause I'm the type of MC with the most pizzazz
You're stealing my book like I was Grandmaster Caz

Got rhymes about antihistamines and analgesics
Rhyme about expectorants, y'all don't see it
Soothsayer, not a player, rhymesayer extreme
Burn like fire when I step on the scene

I got shark's teeth so I can bite your head
I got tiger's claws that'll scratch you dead
I got wings like a dragon when I'm flying above
Shoot venom from my eyes when it's time to get rough

So step back and check yourself
This MC's got weapons that'll ruin your health
So if you're feeling strong, then reach for yours
My book is my shield and my mic is my sword, sword, sword...
Long burn the fire, the truth shall set you free
Long burn the fire, the truth shall set you free
Long burn the fire, the truth shall set you free
Long burn the fire, the truth shall set you free

[Ad-Rock]
Now it's Ad-Rock rappin', I'm back again
Like a Big Mac attack on your gut and that's wack, my friend
I'm a maxer relaxer and I'm chillin'
I take that shit serious like Jerome to grillin'

I burn you to a crisp, sucker, back up off the toaster
I make you sick like at Kenny Rogers Roaster
See this rap thing is all about the braggadocio
I check my rearview, MCs ain't gettin' closer

People think I'm slow cause I'm just I'm underchallenged
See me, you're like, "Man, that's remarkable talent"
Live 'round the clock like Disco Donut
I'm like a tailor 'cause I got the thing sewn up

Or a proctologist, I move asses
Got so much heat that I fog your mom's glasses
Proof is in the pudding and the pudding's in my pants
You heard me rappin' now watch me dance
Long burn the fire, the truth shall set you free
Long burn the fire, the truth shall set you free
Long burn, long burn
Long burn, long burn

[Mike D]
Save the date for when they hoist our number to the rafters
Above the haters, you can hear our laughter
Like Willis Reed or Elton John
We done been in the game and our game's still on

It's not Tic Tac Toe or Operation
Just holding it down like the Gravitation
To all the heads that said, "No can do"
Ad-Rock's in the bath filled with chocolate fondue

Straight up nuts like my name is Mike Bazzini
Bonafide household name like Sergio Tacchini
"Wasn't we here back on Raising Hell?"
Or running wild like rats in the Taco Bell

On the mic I spit, the match it's lit
Mike Dino, the Jewish Brad Pitt
Making music for librarians to burly jocks
The rapper Mike D, known for my curly locks

[Intro]
G.O.O.D Music in this bitch

[Verse 1]
Man I was up early in the A.M., legs will be achin'
Feet will be achin' from dreams I was chasin'
Was always told "you won't see nathan just waitin'"
Like them hatin' ass niggas that just sit around hatin'
Pussy ass niggas they shoud sit around thinkin'
Walk around in aprons bitchin' and bakin'
I'm sayin my city like "we need another hero"
I'm tired of playin' the background like Tito
Jackass niggas, remind me of Steve-o
I put em in their place so I remind them of debo
Ay did you see that award show where I got my close
Up? Its all good I got it on Tivo
'Ye called me and my mama said "I think its time to sign"
Got signed 'round the time Common said "its for the people"
I'm tryna make it better for mines without a kilo
Made it out the D, boy and he ain't a d-boy
No, and he ain't a d-boy
Man these other niggas decoys

[Verse 2]
Now mama I done grown up too much for you to try to have me babied
And lately, I realized that I was needin' a lady
We eatin' bout to have a perfect season I'll be damned
If I get Randy Moss and Tom Brady-ed
I made a little change I can't truly complain
Datin' with a chick that got beauty and brains
But when them bitches come around talkin' bout sex
She gone say that I'm a dog, well all dogs go to heaven
My grandma used to talk about how college was so needed
Signed for a half a mill, now she like "who need a degree?"
At our family gatherings like "who need a CD?"
Everybody hands out like I said "who need a freebie?"
Man what's up? label said "he next up"
People said "he next up" man let's get it pressed up
I'm glad I never listened to y'all and let up
Stuck to my roots, call me Questlove
Call the radio and they gonna request us
So I'm headed to the bank cause I'm finna check up
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha, (?) blase blah I'll prolly buy that tomorrow
For real, I'll prolly buy that tomorrow
Naw for real, I'll prolly buy that tomorrow
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Hey Hey Hey (x3)

[Verse 1]
There ain't never been a question on who runnin' the streets
On second guessin' my profession is like nothin' to me
Don't learn a lesson out here flexin' they get bust in the streets
I told 'em chrome, Smith and Wesson right up under the seats
Ay listen close gotta tote, give a fuck if you see
If you don't wanna die tonight stop fuckin' wit me
Ay I'm intelligent and hella rich and plus I'm a G
So I can sell a brick and sell a bitch to 

[rush you wit me]?
They call me T.I.P. way off in the chain
Spit a verse, throw you niggas way off of your game
In my opinion, bein' lame it should cost you your fame
In all the hatin' on my name burn it off wit' the flame
I'm grippin' new wood grain and the C-L-C's
If I ride through the city on some D-L shit
Niggas say they sell brick that's what we sell bitch
Think I'm lyin' ask anybody in A-T-L bitch

[Hook]
Ay in this shit I'm the one, competition is none
Start hatin' on my niggas, boy you niggas is done
Start sprayin' at you niggas, bet you niggas will run
Start callin' on the phone for some niggas to come
They be like I don't think he got none, I don't think he got none
When the nigga say he runnin, I don't think he got none
They be like I don't think he got none, I don't think he got none
When the nigga say he runnin, I don't think he got none

[Verse 2]
Know niggas hate to hear me say it, but they know I'm a king
I'm in the roads gettin' choked by the whore of your dreams
Ass swole, pretty toes keep a whore on the scene
And they be rollin' off the chain 

[whore by four of the things]?
I eat the pussy for an hour, waitin' on the cream
And stuff the pussy fill wit' pine to get that blow on the scene
She can damage your self-esteem till that whore on some 'premes
She gonna talk to you like you great till you show her some things
You see me ridin' with a lean, with Big Kuntry King
C-Rod, Mac and D.P. and all the rest of the kings
I was raised by the greatest gangstas the city has seen
When I talk to you and your partners, nothin' comes in between
Bring all the niggas you can bring, nigga do what you do
But I guarantee the P$C will be shootin' at you
And we got choppers and if you smart, you'd be shootin them too
No coppin' deuces callin' it off, I'm refusin' the truth

[Hook]

[Intro]
I wanna be on you
Wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Yeah (Ayo, Jerm)
(Ayy, put 

[?] in my headphones) It's your boy, Mac Miller
(We about to go in) Triple E's
Ayo, Jenesis Magazine, Fab Five, I see y'all, man
Most Dope, motherfuckers
Let's get it

[Verse 1]
Cruisin' through the city with the windows down
Blowin' through a pound, ready for another round
Some hoes in the back of the whip and they rollin' (Rollin')
Servin' pussy like the U.S. Open
Blowin' on this potent, different flavors, I done saw them all (Saw them all)
I be stayin' higher than the Taj Mahal, straight epic
So now you can't forget it
Kickin' girls out the crib like they got some bad credit (Peace)
When you blowed and you drunk (Drunk) and you ain't give a fuck
Take this soul and this funk, tell the DJ, "Turn it up" (Turn it up)
Purple stuff, got it stirrin' in my cup
With hoes, I get around like the wheels on the bus
I'm a true player, original Mac
And I keep the pussy poppin', here, listen to that
Hoes showin' me some love, so I'm givin' it back (Back, back)
She wanna be Mrs. Mac, how you figure that?

[Chorus]
Swang, and swang, and swang to the left
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
Swang, swang, and swang, and swang to the left
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
Swang, swang, and swang, and swang to the left
(Go 'head and ride me like a swing set)
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
(Go on and ride me like a swing set)
Swang, swang, and swang, and swang to the left
(Up and down)
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
(Up and down, ride me like a swing set)

[Verse 2]
Ride (Ride), swerve (Swerve)
That's how you do it in the 'Burgh ('Burgh)
When you high off the herb and you fly as a bird
With some horny hoes waitin' in the burbs (Haha)
You gotta go (Go), lookin' fresh like the cap on
And your girlie still wet from the last song
Ladies like, "Mac Miller? Ooh, I wanna marry him" (Haha)
If it's sex and drugs, then I'm heroin
I pick her up just to ride around
Twistin' somethin' purple, have us flyin' to a higher ground
(Higher ground) She love ridin' with the kid right here (Uh-huh)
She's still gon' be in love this time next year (Uh-huh)
'Cause I'm a heartbreaker, mover and shaker
She love watchin' what I do with my paper
Lovin' how I play her, loud like a banger
Lil' Mama lip gloss, mouthful of flavor

[Chorus]
Swang, swang, and swang, and swang to the left
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
Swang, swang, and swang, and swang to the left
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
Swang, swang, and swang, and swang to the left
(Go 'head and ride me like a swing set)
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
(Go on and ride me like a swing set)
Swang, swang, and swang, and swang to the left
(Up and down)
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
(Up and down, ride me like a swing set)

[Outro]
Go 'head and ride me like a swing set
Go on and ride me like a swing set

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
You know what this is
It's a celebration bitches
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab your ass

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Bitch I hustle every day, you could check my resumé
Bad Spanish bitch, one kiss'll take your breath away
I could bag your girl in a broken down Chevrolet
Swag do the talkin', I ain't even gotta decorate
I was 21 when I bought my mom a condo
A guitar and a gift card down at Costco's
It's a cold winter when it's blowing past my goggles
Penthouse, top floor, window with the gargoyle
Performance down at Santos, Phantom suicide doors
Paparazzi slide-shows, showers with the slide doors
One night, five shows, two-seater, five hoes
Eyes closed, I can see them hating through the blindfolds
Niggas better switch it if the business ain't the convo
I'm all about my chicken nigga you could call me Roscoe's
If I wasn't spitting I'd be probably flipping waffles
I suppose God knows I coulda been a snot-nose
DAMN

[Chorus]
Get money every day (Every night we celebrate)
Get money every day (Every night we celebrate)
Bitch I hustle every day (Every night we celebrate)
Every night we celebrate, Every night we celebrate
Get money every day (Every night we celebrate)
Get money every day (Every night we celebrate)
Bitch I hustle every day (Every night we celebrate)
Every night we celebrate, every night we celebrate

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck is all the talk about? Fuck these niggas talking 'bout?
Shit I know it's us cuz we the only thing to talk about
I been down to ATL, I seen how they walk it out
Cali Crip Walk it out, show 'em what New York about
What these niggas hating for? Fuck these niggas hating on?
I'm what they debating for, I'm what they been waiting on
Out there tryna take it slow but taking slow been taking long
Know I'm on the paper trail until I get my paper long
When I'm in the kitchen, catch me with my apron on
And it's back to business, A$AP is where they belong
And we on the grind, that's until I get my paper long
See your nigga's face every time you turn your cable on
Mami why your leggings on, face down ass out?
Tylenol and codeine got a nigga 'bout to pass out
Catch me on a grind and now a nigga 'bout to cash out
Get money, hella cake, every night we celebrate

[Chorus]
Get money every day (Every night we celebrate)
Get money every day (Every night we celebrate)
Bitch I hustle every day (Every night we celebrate)
Every night we celebrate, every night we celebrate

[Bridge]
When the boys roll, pull up on the block
Still we hustle, 'cause we run the spot
I'll be on my grind, every night dawg
'Til the coffin close, and my lights off
I hit 'em up, like my name's Shakur
Count my dividends, I'm allergic to poor
I hit 'em up, like my name's Shakur
Stack my paper up, I'm above the law
I hit 'em Up

[Chorus]
Get money every day (Every night we celebrate)
Get money every day (Every night we celebrate)
Bitch I hustle every day (Every night we celebrate)
Every night we celebrate, every night we celebrate

You wanna visit Gucci world, girl, here's a brochure

Golf balls in my ear like burrr burrr burrr
Got a 'rari with an engine in the rear, look and hear
Shining harder than your partner red amulets, match the carpets
You my son, I'm your father, this here trust all on the author
So what's popping? Orville Redenbacher. I'm so OJ, ok
I'm so Waka Flocka, fuck it, I might smoke in front the DA
I'm so Gotti, I might buck it, two tear drops so I feel like fuckin'
You a crystal in a bucket, got a 6K show in Kentucky
Run up on a kid and he won't be lucky, might be alright and he'll be unlucky

Cold hearted nigga and I run around with lunatics

[Verse 1]
Until the philosophy which hold one race
Superior and another Inferior
Is finally
And permanently
Discredited
And abandoned
Everywhere is war
Me say war

[Verse 2]
That until there are no longer
First-class and second-class citizens of any nation
Until the colour of a man's skin
Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes
Me say war

[Verse 3]
That until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
Dis a war

[Verse 4]
That until that day
The dream of lasting peace
World citizenship
Rule of international morality
Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued
But never attained
Now everywhere is war
War

[Verse 5]
And until the ignoble and unhappy regime
That hold our brothers in Angola
In Mozambique
South Africa
Sub-human bondage
Have been toppled
Utterly destroyed
Well, everywhere is war
Me say war

[Chorus]
War in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south

[Verse 6]
War, war
Rumors of war
And until that day
The African continent
Will not know peace
We Africans will fight, we find it necessary
And we know we shall win
As we are confident
In the victory
Of good over evil

[Outro]
Good over evil, yeah!
Good over evil
Good over evil, yeah!
Good over evil
Good over evil, yeah!

[Verse 1]
Looking through my window
Houston, we have a fucking problem nigga 10-4
Testing, testing, playing with my testes
Waiting for the day that Sarah Palin can molest me
She from Alaska, I roll down south
Pull my penguin out and put that global warming in her mouth
You should see her lips, Seen them, Saw them
Don’t call me a motherfucker, Id rather fuck her daughter
Nigga in the 70’s like he’s President Carter
His skin is fucking drying up, nigga give him some water
Old Fragile Nigga with a glass nose, tickets and a Mexican back
He gon' be mad when he sees that his grass grows
In his home, By the gnome, in his home, next to the water hoes
Around the corner from the enchiladas and the tacos
And Im not saying a niggas a racist, but he sucking hitler dick, nazi cum, facism
Run Shit
Face it
Nigga you can taste it
Nauze it, Faz it, Ash it
Face it, Face it

[Verse 2]
Obama this, here comes the rude ramping
The need to put his motherFucking face on a food stamp
Makin sims, now the government is wearing tim’s
Bidens in a fucking continental on rims and
This theory squad, they need to make it bigger cause
Cause everyone in the world is voting for the nigga
And im not crazy
Obama and I is for the ladies
Pro abortion death to all babies
Biden is the father
Obama did it big, cause if MCcain wins Im not claiming none of them fucking kids
Just saying
Abuse what I am saying
And im the only that noticed MCcain has aids
Draw em to the hospital, Gas for a gallon
Im mad, he’s fucking sarah pailin more than I do

[Verse 3]
The propped 8 couldn’t even miss
Shut the fuck up and just let them faggots kiss
White man, black man now its just a waste war
Cause when Obama dies Im heading straight to the bape store

They talk about him, ya’ll get an erection
He’s black so I gotta show him some type of affection?
White, hate and rap, you better use protection
And I quote this “MotherFuck this election”
And I don’t wanna seem wrong
But if he lose
They gonna break the window that Im looking through at the beginning of the song

[Hook]
Hey lady
Have you've been looking for love in all the wrong places
Me too
Hey lady
Have you've been telling yourself just to be patient
Me too

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Just because I stand on the stage now
Just because I'm ill in the booth
Doesn't mean I can't really love you
And if you listen then I'll tell you the truth
I'm getting kinda tired of the, well
I'll spare you the details
But I got a little crazy with the females
The last tour, okay, and the one before
But I'm tryin to tell you
I don't think I want that no more
I guess, at least you know that I got the experience
So when you cool with it
You know I know what to do with it
Everything that you expected and more
Sex in shower, on the bed
Then sex on the floor
Rug burns on my knees, scratches on my back
You put those on my body to remind me to come back
And for some reason I do
I even eat it, but that's a secret just between me and you

[Hook]
Hey lady
Have you've been looking for love in all the wrong places
Me too
Hey lady
Have you've been telling yourself just to be patient
Me too

[Verse 2: Twista]
Twista
Let's take it back to the basics
Looking for love in all the wrong places
All up in the party, sipping on Ciroc
I was coming at the women
When I was spending big faces
Every night I'm in the zone
Doing what the fuck I wanna do
In the hotel lobby like
You, and you, and you
Until I met you
Make Twist get the urge
Got it with you cause I was sick with the words
Looking at you cause the picture was perfect
Now all the other chicks kicked to the curb
Sick cause I got a trip off the way I was looking everywhere for love
And I found it right here
I'm Twista
Let me get to know ya
Here is Mike Posner
Let me make it quite clear
You the only one that I wanna be with
Tell everybody else that they can holla back
But all the other women I was with
I just splurged
But she the only one that bring the dollar back
Her sex so cold, got it froze
And that's on the real, she the one I chose
Loving her so all I wanna say is impose
Tell her how you feel

[Hook]
Hey lady
Have you've been looking for love in all the wrong places
Me too
Hey lady
Have you've been telling yourself just to be patient
Me too

[Outro: Mike Posner]
Hey lady
Have you been looking for love
Looking, looking for love

Hey lady
Have you been telling yourself just to be patient

[Intro]
Haha, we just can't help but make chill shit, man
But it's some great chill shit, haha
ID Labs, what's good?
Hey, hey

[Verse 1]
I got champagne dreams, Louis Vuitton hopes
Rolls-Royce fantasies, stayin' in condos
For now, livin' lavish is on hold
You wanna play the game, then go pick up a console
It's not slow cheddar, this nachos
I know my path while you turnin' in wrong roads
Hype like pom-poms, tighter than some long johns
Finally, some brand new gear that I got on
New shoes and some twenty-dollar socks on
Me and my people stay connected like a dot com
They say I blow a contact, I'm a car bomb
I'm just findin' me a target I can lock on
Nobody can do it exactly like I do
'Cause nobody I know got my life or got my crew
They try to, tellin' me I'm you
Probably don't understand but you will when it's time to

[Chorus]
Everybody mention me, lettin' me get away
From the people always tellin' me, "Nothin' is left to say"
But, they can't tell me shit, they can't tell me shit
They can't tell me shit, they can't tell me shit
Everybody mention me, lettin' me get away
From the people always tellin' me, "Nothin' is left to say"
But, they can't tell me shit, they can't tell me shit
They can't tell me shit, they can't tell me shit

[Verse 2]
Caviar appetizer, first-class flight
Makin' money kinda easy when you learn to do it right
Melody through this mic, they tellin' me what they like
But never get to the price, forgettin' to live they life
I'm one of a kind, see me breakin' it down
I heard the spotlight was yours but I'm takin' it now
You lookin' good there, lady, come and stay for a while
I love to hear my parents say I'm makin' 'em proud
I got a gift to show the world, I'ma take it around
Guarantee you every single hater hate when I smile
Once upon a time, there were people that didn't know
I had talent, I was cool but it seems that it'd never show
I'm finna blow, travel across the globe
And if they didn't before, now they know
Look at me now, I'm gettin' to Europe
And at first, they was tellin' me, "No," haha

[Chorus]
Everybody mention me, lettin' me get away
From the people always tellin' me, "Nothin' is left to say"
But, they can't tell me shit, they can't tell me shit
They can't tell me shit, they can't tell me shit
Everybody mention me, lettin' me get away
From the people always tellin' me, "Nothin' is left to say"
But, they can't tell me shit, they can't tell me shit
They can't tell me shit, they can't tell me shit

[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Ay, Shakira boo
Why don't you let them know what the deal is, baby?

[Verse 1: Shakira]
First floor (Ah)
Room sixteen (Ah)
Smells like danger (Let's go)
Even better (Let's go)
Set your goals (Ah)
Bless our souls (Ah)
I'm in trouble (Yes, I know)
But it feels like heaven, hey!

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira]
You were like one of those guys
The kind with the wandering eyes
But I said, "Hey what the hell?
Once in my life, I'll take a ride on the wild side"
You were so full of yourself
But damn, were you cute as well
You liked my legs, I liked your moves
Anyone could tell that it's hard to deny that

[Chorus: Shakira & Kid Cudi]
Did it again, love, I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete it
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah (Yeah! Yeah!)
Are you OK? Are you OK? Are you OK?
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah (Yeah! Yeah!)
Are you OK? Are you OK? Are you OK?

[Verse 2: Shakira]
Second night (ah)
In a row (ah)
Back in trouble (let's go)
I don't get it (let's go)
Gotta keep it down
'Cause the lobby called
We ignore it (yes, I know)
It's getting better
When it comes to men, it's known
That I end up choosing wrong
Cause I always trip and fall
On the same old rock and repeat and go back
How blind a girl can be
To miss you hide your ring
Thought about everything
I'm so naive imagining and all that

[Chorus: Shakira & Kid Cudi]
Did it again, love, I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete it
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah (Yeah! Yeah!)
Are you OK? Are you OK? Are you OK?
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah (Yeah! Yeah!)
Are you OK? Are you OK? Are you OK?

[Bridge: Shakira]
It may seem to you that I am in a place
Where I'm losing the direction of my life
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase
"Right back at ya," 'cause I'll survive...

[Interlude: Kid Cudi]
Now, see, I can put you where you want to be, believe that
See, now I can put you where you need to be
You can believe that

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Ah, whenever with everything
If you let me don't try to keep again
If you considerin' by stoppin' this flow
You need a friend
So break me off a piece of that
So sweet so wet, the kitty cat
And you cruising home, remember that
I need you soon, I'll be your groom
You feeling this vibe this night in June
I remember you said your hips don't lie
Love it when they move
All I wanna to bring is good vibes in your life
Your love consumes
All day, every day I dream I think of only you
And those hips... ohhh

[Chorus: Shakira & Kid Cudi]
Did it again, love, I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete it
Did it again, love, I got it all wrong
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Are you OK? Are you OK?
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah (Yeah! Yeah!)
Are you OK? Are you OK? Are you OK?

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Are you OK? Are you OK? Are you OK?
Are you OK? Are you OK? Are you OK?

[Chorus]
It's crazy, I never want this feeling to end
This is what it means to be friends
Only when I'm hanging with you
All my dreams come true because
It's crazy, I never want this feeling to end
This is what it means to be friends
Only when I'm hanging with you
(Check it, check it, check it out)
All my dreams come true because

[Verse 1]
Yo, it was all a dream, I used to play chess at the coffee bean
And as my coffee steamed I thought about my life and my lofty dreams
It's so sick and I'm startin' to mix thanks to AM; rest in piece banana split
Was the place we all went Sundays, to make people feel this way we would one day
And I remember when you gave me the secret, popped in the DVD and peeped it
And if you dreamin' you achivin', after that it was a wrap
And now I walk in the club like a million times
Spit on the mic like a million rhymes
We party rock to a billion drops and this shot makes one zillion shots
Yes I'm feelin' good, and we the best I'm feelin' good
And in your breast are feelin' good, ha-ha LMFAO
I'm a pro with this party thang
I love Cherry Tree Cola and Bacardi mayne
Hey, I've been the same before the start of fame
The only that has changed is we changed the game
You and I and the crew that I roll with
It's gonna be the the same crew I grow old with
Memories fade like old leather
But the music that we make gonna last forever... legacy

[Chorus]
It's crazy, I never want this feeling to end
This is what it means to be friends
Only when I'm hanging with you
All my dreams come true because
It's crazy, I never want this feeling to end
This is what it means to be friends
Only when I'm hanging with you
(Check it, check it, check it out)
All my dreams come true because

[Verse 2]
(Check it)
I feel like flyin', on top of my game and I ain't even tryin'
Nowadays I'm stylin' and when she naked it I feel like cryin'
It's better than I hoped it'd be
I walk down the street and people notice me
No body was as broke as me
They say you never get nowhere smokin' weed
So I roll one up I stepped on a landmine blowin' up
And I ain't never growin' up
And if the party rocks then you know it's us
Me and foo in the club straight posted-up
Back when I wasn't old enough
Now bottles on ice when we rollin' up
Cheers, a toast to us
Oh, we winnin' now
My whole life's changed since then and now
Fans show love and women shout
Make me feel like I'm the man
All of my friends n' my fans say don't let em change you
Been from London to Japan and I'm still the same dude
And he's still the same Foo
Struggles we came through
Stuck with our team and our dream and look how it came true

[Chorus]
It's crazy, I never want this feeling to end
This is what it means to be friends
Only when I'm hanging with you
All my dreams come true because
It's crazy, I never want this feeling to end
This is what it means to be friends
Only when I'm hanging with you
(Check it, check it, check it out)
All my dreams come true because

Future sex love sound

And that makes you just like me
See, everybody says you're hot, baby
But can you make it hot for me?

You can't stop, baby
You can't stop once you've turned me on
And your enemy are your thoughts, baby

To give you my tongue and put you out of control
And after you let it in, we'll be skin to skin
It's just so natural
Wait a second

[Chorus]
She's hopped up on me, I've got her in my zone
Her body's pressed up on me, I think she's ready to blow

[Kanye West]
Why are you so Paranoid?
Don't be so Paranoid

[Big Sean; Verse 1]
Aye, Aye
Now baby I can tell you want more cause you put less out
And every time you stepped in I could tell you stepped out
Your girlfriend said I remind her of the rest, yea
But tell yo girlfriend that she remind me of the Press
Just talkin' and talkin'
So maybe we can sneak to the back then
I know you heard about the freaks that was back then
So last week, we so right now
They so hyped up man tell 'em pipe down
And you can tell from the watch and chain
They been in and out my jeans like pocket change
Just be real, man I wouldn't be real
If I ain't have my fair share like the stock exchange
And if today tend from your past relations
Walk around witcho girl sayin that you hate men (What?)
Aye yo you either let go or you go lesbo turn around and date them
So maybe we should head to the exit
Just is from your friends not to mess with (Who me?)
Cause they caught a case with they ex-es
They mad you'd a leave while a nigga ex-stressed
But we know what it is right?
So we gone let 'em live right?
You know why they call me Big right?
Tell 'em look left while we get right
(right, right, right)

[Kid CuDi: Hook]
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you anyway
They don't know you like I do
They'll never know you

[Kanye West: Verse 2]
All of the time
You wanna complain about the nights that are long
So now you here with me stressing about it too
Leave that attitude way back at home
Yea you see 'em look dirty
Let 'em give you cold looks cause we look cold
Yea you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk and the world lost in the world
Can you finally let that thing go
You wanna check into the heartbreak hotel but sorry we're closed
Baby, Don't worry about it
Baby, we'll go out to the floor

[Hook]

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Baby don't worry about it
Lady don't even think about it
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong thing
You worry bout the wrong thing, the wrong thing
You worry bout the wrong thing, the wrong thing
You worry bout the wrong thing

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
No I'm not the man I used to be lately
See you met me at an interesting time
And if my past is any sign of your future
Then I should warn you before I let you inside

[Hook]
Hold on to whatever you find baby
Hold on to whatever helps you through
Hold on to whatever you find baby
I don't trust myself with loving you

[Verse 2]
I do my best to act like she doesn't phase me
As if I pull girls just like her all the time
I even waited seven days before I called her
But she can play this game much better than I

See I've got girls in every state, now they hate me
Cause I'm leavin just as fast as I came
And if my past is any sign of my future
I'll probably end up not remembering her name

[Hook]
Hold on to whatever you find baby
Hold on to whatever helps you through
Hold on to whatever you find baby
I don't trust myself with loving you

[Bridge]
She deserves better
Better better
Better than me
Better than me
That she deserves better
Better better
Better than me
Better than me
That she deserves better
Better than me
That she deserves better
Better than me

[Hook]
Hold on to whatever you find baby
Hold on to whatever helps you through
Hold on to whatever you find baby
I don't trust myself with loving you

[Verse 3]
Cause I'm not the man I used to be lately
Yeah you met me at an interesting time
And if my past is any sign of your future
Then I should warn you, warn you before I let you inside

[Hook]
Hold on to whatever you find baby
Hold on to whatever helps you through
Hold on to whatever you find baby
I don't trust myself with loving you
(Chorus)
We're done, but it's not over
We'll start it again, after the end of the day
It keeps getting better, don't be afraid
We'll do it together

(Lil Wayne)
To the left, to the left
If you wanna leave, be my guest you can step
Feeling irreplaceable listenin' to Beyonce
But okay, I'll put you out on your B-Day
Hey, now if you rockin' with Weezy
Bedroom in the bank, baby we safe
I got game like EA
But I wanna let you play

And don't I treat you like souffle
Don't I look at you like I see a new day
And Don't I do what I do say
I'm through talkin', so i'mma let you 'face
(Chorus)
We're done, but it's not over
We'll start it again, after the end of the day
It keeps getting better, don't be afraid
We'll do it together

We're done, but it's not over
We'll start it again, after the end of the day
It keeps getting better, don't be afraid
We'll do it together

(Lil Wayne)
It's no sweat, no sweat
I would never 1, 2, 3, 4-get about you
Your love, your sex
You know I work you out like Bowflex

Our jokes, no stress
Love, live life, proceed, progress
Make sure the neighbors get no rest
We can get together, never disconnect

Your back, your neck
Funny how that song hasn't got old yet... to us
So let's project, you stay in, never in-correct
Lemme catch my breath, talkin' 'bout leaving, you ain't gone yet
And if you leave, leave correct
Then I'mma send a jet to pick up the next
And if you leave, you leaving the best
So you might have to settle for less
I am no Elliott Ness
I don't handcuff, I don't arrest
I do confess to the murders, see
Cause under them sheets, I am a mess
Yes, baby you blessed
Now just don't jump your nest, come on

(Chorus)
We're done, but it's not over
We'll start it again, after the end of the day
It keeps getting better, don't be afraid
We'll do it together

[Verse 1:Meek Mill]
I said I'm cooler than a fan fresh like it's Easter
Pull up on that banshee be like Hasta la vister
Heser thought that's what they all say skeezers
I just fucked her yesterday homie you can keep her
Believe her, I don't do nothin I'm a ball
I'm a stand up nigga
I jump up everytime I fall
Everytime I lost I came back like cook crack
Got my hand up in the game and I ain't never look back
I said I'm good, I'm hood, I wish a nigga would
Try to take me for a sucker he get hit up just because
Can't shake em off for nothing, they be hating but for what
Cause I ain't even get a deal but
When I do they be like UHH!
Sick ya bitch all up on my dick
Cause you a bug, you a flee and I'm a G
I ain't no Crip I ain't no Blood
But I don't bend no I don't budge
I keep that semi by my gut
A nigga tempt me fire up
I let that sig blow light em up
I say I ain't got that hazy
You know I got that kush
Niggas rolling on that dirt be smokin that Reggie Bush
Said they always speak my name
But when they see me they never look
Cause they know I keep that flamer
But hold up that's another book
I said them shooters on deck
Goonies over there, and that ain't even counting for tooly that wear
I said they bitches, pussy, coochie over there
So many clips it look like we shootin for a movie over here

[Verse 2: Gillie]
E.A. they don't pop, lock, and drop it
Round here in North Philly
They stop, cock, and pop it
Put you on your dyin bed
Leave you on that lead dying
Bust ya head up out that bread
A nigga bet not dare try it
I'm a motherfuckin gangster
Spank you with that banger
Soak you with that toaster
You niggas straight cho-cha
Pussy ass niggas for tha hundred I'll soak ya
Leave ya wet and gushy
I'm messin with some rookies
My drop top ridin
And my Glock cock ridin
And I'm hangin out that window and I won't stop firen
Til a nigga on the ground and he twitchin
I walk down on em look em in his eyes stop bitchin
His mama fillin reports da boy he missin
These niggas tellin lies they ain't never sold a pigeon
Ain't got to go to BET to see how I'm livin
Just got to North Philly
And ask for that boy Gillie (They gonna tell you he's a gangster)

[Verse 3: Oschino]
I'm Oschino
You know I got dem kilos
You know I got that fish if you tryna find nemo
My Glocks straight from consemos
Six feet p low you get d pro
If you try to burn me like that bitch Yolanda do niggas pee holes

Niggas mad at me cause they pockets flat like plasma televisions
Elevate mind he probably fucked her

Go to war with the ATF

Girl, I know you want a drink, just dance for me

[Eminem]
Yo, yo, I'll start it off, yo, yo…
My name is Shady, his name is Proof
Yo, we used to have a roof up on my house
And now we had a mouse that ate the cheese out of the fridge
Didn't want to admit that I was on welfare when I was three
Plus, when I was four, my mother used to leave
She used to always slam the door and say
"Goodbye, goodbye, Marshall, I'm leaving, I'm single
And right now I'm going to mingle at bingo."
"Yeah, see you later, alligator," is what she said
And I would always stay at house, freezin' till I'm dead
'Cause it was cold inside that house, we never had no heat
Yo, Proof used to come walkin' up right up the street
And be like, "Yo, what up, Em? How you doin'?"
I used be like, "Yeah, man
It's good to see you, dawg, but my life's ruined
'Cause my mom just left," she left my brother Nate
And I hate the fact that we never had no food on our plate
So then Proof said: "What up, Em?"
Yo, so I said "Proof, won't you come in?"

[Proof]
Yeah, yeah, come in, what’s up with dat?
Tango and Cash, came to mingle and blast
Together tougher than Alcatraz prison bars
Drivin' foreign cars
Yes, it's me and my man compadre
Black and white, white and ivory and black ebony
They can't step to me, rubbery and heavenly
They can't see us in the 313 vicinity
Ayo, Em, ha ha ha ha

[Eminem]
What up? Ha, ha, I'm comin' like ha ha
I'm ill like nah nah, and y'all don't wanna see me
'Cause I'm ill with the skill
And I can grill and I always keep it real
When I built my garage back after it just got burnt down
Sorry that my parents weren't always around
But it was really hectic growin' up
But now I'm blowin' up
So it don't matter: every show I do, I'm always showin' up
To the club drunk as hell, drunk as fuck, drunk as what?
Can't say that on MTV
But remember it? Little old wimpy me
Who used to always dream to be on MTV
Now you can't see me
I know you remember that rhyme
Ayy, wait a minute, yo check it out, I'm 'bout to flatline
Pass the mic back to Proof
'Cause we get loose, we drink gin and juice
Sip it 'cause we always raise the roof

[Proof]
Ayo, ayo, we all up in your sight like cataracts
Me and Em tag-team
Beat any of y'all on some battle rap
See us next time we strippin' out your Cadillac's
How you like that? Soon you down like a battle axe

[Eminem]
I'm down like a battle axe
I got a phatter axe to smash
And I smash your cataracts
'Cause it's a Cadillac's that I be drivin'
When I be high off fuckin' vivarin
Now you can't see me 'cause I'm revivin' and survivin'
In the D, every single day in Detroit
If rappers wanna step to me, they better get to the point
'Cause they don't understand the way that I do it
The fluid that I be spittin' is never written
'Cause I'm always, always bitten, 'cause it—

[Proof]
Ayo, you make your neck crack like a snare pop
We're fresh and they're not
So give it up, don't even do this
You're wack, in fact you get flat-lined
You need practice
We stick you like a cactus
Nah, you're not a guy, you're an actress
The fact is—

[Eminem]
Here's my address, this is my old address
And called… a street called Dresden
Yo, dead presidents is what I'm resurrectin'
Gotta say what's up to Desmond and JLB
But yo, they don't help me
Do a thing, they never did
When I was a clever kid, rhymin'
I always used to go to school and climb in
The back baseball diamond

[Proof]
Hey yo, abort, hold up!
Hurt shoulder
Peace for Kurt Loder
Yeah, we're doin' an interview
In a minute or two
We're gonna enter in you

[Eminem]
In the nude, when we intrude
Don't mean to be rude
But yo, what's up, dude?
How you doin', MTV?
How you doin', Kurt?
How you doin' everybody else in the world?
You gettin' hurt
By this freestyle that I be comin' up with
Eruptin' and kick your mother in the tummy
And in the stomach

[Proof]
Ayo, ayo, and all of this we just done is freestyle
Ah, ah, ah, don't touch that dial, yeah

[Eminem]
Hold it right there, I'm your worst nightmare
Wipin' diapers on my high chair

[Proof]
What?! Yeah!

[Eminem]
When I was this big
Now I'm still bigger, but I'm skinny like a twig
Skinny little white boy
Growin' up I liked noise
I spike punch and light joints

[Proof]
Ayo, everybody looks for us to follow
We thrust the bottle, thrust the throttle
Bust a bottle over your head
Train your thoughts just like Cus d'Amato
Your guts is hollow
Back up, Proof and Em

[Eminem]
And all them wack MC's steppin' to me at Saint Andrews
Just remember that I hate you, and yo, I can't stand you

[Proof]
Yeah!

[Eminem]
Bye bye!
Goodbye, good night!
Bye bye, good night!
Bye bye, good night!

[Proof]
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye!

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don’t live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don’t live here anymore
You abandoned me
Love don’t live here anymore

[Verse 1]
Heart colder than Chicago
Middle of December because my life is like a slideshow
As fast as its coming, is as fast as its going
My friends and my woman like money
Just blowing in the wind
Damn, I thought they was rolling 'til the end
My mama told me them niggas wasn’t rolling to begin
So its blood over water, family over a friend
Too much of water will drown you that blood will run through your skin
That blood flow from your heart
Told me to go from the start
And if you turn off my lights I bet I will glow in the dark
I bet you I will shine bright
As bright as the Prime Night
Them youngins tryna murder and them niggas ain't tryna fight
'Cause Mama was never there, his father they never met
So love don’t live there so they shooting or better yet
They scheming instead of dreaming, murking instead of working
They locking them in them prisons
But really them youngins is hurting

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don’t live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don’t live here anymore
You abandoned me
Love don’t live here anymore

[Sample]
Guy 1: You want to take care of that business?
You want to smoke old Willie since your punk ass daddy here ain't got the heart to put in the work?
Guy 2: Spent ten years of my life in prison for putting in work!

[Verse 2]
Shawty 16, fucking everything moving
Got raped by her step-dad, he told her "Just do it!"
No job, selling the pussy to get to it
Drinking and smoking anything to get through it
And love don’t live there, struggling she been there
She ain't got no heart, shawty like the tin man
Tell her anything she won't feel it’s like thin air
She done heard everything, you can drop a pin there
And she probably hear it, looking in the mirror
Staring at her reflection and it scare her
Every time she cry she feel nobody hear her
Devil all in her ear and he whispering that he dare her
She hear him
Everybody fronted on her like she was Rosa Parks
Tried to push her in the back where it was dark
She like a gold fish, they got her swimming with the sharks
Year later found her murdered slayed in the park

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don’t live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don’t live here anymore
You abandoned me
Love don’t live here anymore

[News Reporter: Monica Malpass]
Philadelphia police are still trying to piece together the death of teenage girl found partially clothed in Fairmount park today
Action news reporter Vernon Odom following developments, he joins us live at police headquarters tonight with the very latest

[Hook]
I don't wanna have to push your cap back
Homie, he just say he want his girl back
In a drop top, I'mma push the top back
I was gone for a second, but the kid back
If you ever cross me I'mma get some payback
Close the curtain on them haters in my Maybach
Put a hole in your motherfuckin' snapback
It's Gucci Mane bitch, so you can say the trap back

[Verse 1]
I'm back at em, it's back on
I'm back strong, I'm back home
Me and Flockavelli, and Wooh da Kid
He got a nine, I got a Sig
I do it huge, we do it big
Got hundred bricks, stuffed 'em in the fridge (Burr!)
Two hundred piece, stuffed it in the attic
I'm a drug addict, bitch I gotta have it
I got a gift, I can water whip
I can flip a brick, I can triple up
Need a hundred mill', fuck a record deal
Because a couple millions just not enough
Sell your momma a zip of dust
Serve your daddy a ounce of hard
Got your little sister on the molly
She done went through the whole squad

[Hook]
I don't wanna have to push your cap back
Homie, he just say he want his girl back
In a drop top, I'mma push the top back
I was gone for a second, but the kid back
If you ever cross me I'mma get some payback
Close the curtain on them haters in my Maybach
Put a hole in your motherfuckin' snapback
It's Gucci Mane bitch, so you can say the trap back

[Verse 2]
Making money's my hobby, flipping bricks is my passion
Home girl in the lobby, "Is you suckin' dick?" I'm just asking
I ain't mean to be rude boo, but you know I'm that dude, true
More birds than Atlanta Zoo, going in like a curfew
I lost my mind, and my train of thought, and my top all at the same time
If you sendin' them birds across the country, then we probably got the same grind
I'm an OG like my daddy, I'm a hustler like my momma
I'mma stack my bread all winter so I can ball out all summer
Got foreign choppas, Osama, smoke presidential, Obama
Got that bald head, got that skinhead, that white girl Sinéad O'Connor
Make em drop dead, I'm in the drop head, On Candler I'm Santa
I need a crown cause I'm standing down, I'm the king of East Atlanta

[Hook]
I don't wanna have to push your cap back
Homie, he just say he want his girl back
In a drop top, I'mma push the top back
I was gone for a second, but the kid back
If you ever cross me I'mma get some payback
Close the curtain on them haters in my Maybach
Put a hole in your motherfuckin' snapback
It's Gucci Mane bitch, so you can say the trap back

[Verse 1]
Brian, top marks for not trying
So kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted
And I wonder, are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator

[Verse 2]
Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get, 'cause you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet, but she's yours
She'll be saying, "Use me, show me the jacuzzi"
I imagine that it's there on a plate, your whole rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened to make 'em wait for a while

[Bridge]
I doubt it's your style not to get what you set out to acquire
The eyes are on fire, you are the unforecasted storm

[Verse 3]
(Brian) Calm, collected and commanding
(Top marks for not trying) You leave the other story standing
With your renditions and jokes, bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cause you've stolen their thunder
Are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator

[Intro]
Yeah
Listen to this track, bitch

[Verse 1]
Like Tommy Lee and Pamela, I'm fucking on the camera
More stamina than animals, Gucci is no amateur
Jeru the Damaja, could damage you or handle you
Two girls on my bike, one on the back, one on the handle bars
Ferrari F-130, so I call that bitch Tarantula
Got Canada on calendar, so shout out to my manager
I walk through in South Africa

So suck me just like Dracula
Polo like a college boy
No I'm not a college boy
I am a So Icy boy, I'm tatted like a biker boy
We are the So Icy gang, tatted like a biker gang
Dreaded up, breaded up
Wet it up and bet it up, bitch, you don't want bet
Pull up in my Chevy 'Vette

Gucci Mane LaFlare walking 'round the city, say cheese (Listen to this track, bitch)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Photogenic chain, man, photographic memory

Gucci Mane LaFlare, So Icy, you remember me
Remember me from TV, turning on your TV
Hip-hop police say they looking after me
How you looking after me? You know I had a murder beef
Yeah, I got a murder beef, I'm just tryna get something to eat
Me and my lil' main squeeze, give a nigga break, please
Chain on Frigidaire, watches on refrigerate
'Frigerate, refrigerate, I'm freezing like a polar be
Red carpet shawty and the paparazzi chasing me
How they gon' catch me? I'm riding in a Lamborghin' (Listen to this track, bitch)

[Chorus]
Riding with my broad, it's a photo shoot
When I hit the mall, it's a photo shoot

[Chorus]
Riding with my broad, it's a photo shoot

[Verse 1:Space Jam JaYe]
Gold bottoms, everything trill
White cup, hand full of pills
Got the money so the bitches chill
They do what we want they love the trill
Caught the flu, yeah a nigga ill
Making deals, I’m talking stacks, I want a mill
Fuck a stack, nigga fuck a rack, how a hundred feel
But a nigga stuntin still
Boy this shit is so fucking real
Acting hard might get you killed,and we all about them dollar bills
That dirty money make my collar chill
Son you niggas, I’m your father still
Bad bitch in them prada heels
I’m royalty, so she better kneel
Fear God, not you, pistol whip and stomp you
Bitch nigga, you are not a factor
All black, like a black panther
Young king so lord with swaga rock star, Mick Jagger
No time for the cheap chatter
These niggas don’t even matter

[Hook]:
Is any of this real
Its like all a dream
Everything Trill
Baby girl take 2 of these
And tell me how you feel

[Verse 2]:
Baby welcome to my mind
It is truly yours!
Welcome to my palace
Look at this décor!
Cocaine, marble floor
Champagne connoisseur money carnivore
I’m a hustler to the core
Draped up, dripping like water, look at all this ice
Money taped up in the goyard duffel
Count it so precise, she wet, she lick her friend
But she ain’t no dyke
That money, make the bitches come
And that’s the shit I like
I play with that pussy while switching legs
I slap that ass while I’m getting brain
So insane, how it interplay
I keep your girls so entertain
Zanny bars with that fucking lean
Hyped up on caffeine
I'm popping beans she getting wasted
Fly as fuck and you niggas basic

[Hook]

Forever Fly

You're always talking bout your feelings and shit

You’re my babydoll
I’ll hold you closer
I’ll hold you closer
Just like I’m supposed to
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need
You’re my babydoll
I’ll hold you closer
I’ll hold you closer
Just like I’m supposed to
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need

[Verse 1]
I’m a weird dude, but you like me
Give other girls shocks like Nikes
I know I’m always on the road you can type me
And if you don’t do that you can Skype me
I’m a big kid, and you know that
But it don’t make me happy so we blow that
Can I make time? I don’t really know
Cause I see you’re pissed off when I go to shows
I never really had a girl like this
But I ain’t never had a girl who could keep interest
The things that I do, the things that I wanna be
I know I’m hardheaded, can’t see things in front of me
I’m gonna be the best, you can believe that
So try an understand when I have to leave that
When I’m done, I’ma give you the call
Don’t ya know sugar, you my sugar babydoll

[Hook]
You’re my babydoll
I’ll hold you closer
I’ll hold you closer
Just like I’m supposed to
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need
You’re my babydoll
I’ll hold you closer
I’ll hold you closer
Just like I’m supposed to
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need

[Verse 2]
I love you both, can’t you tell?
I love her lights, I love the smell
But I think you kinda know I got a girl on the side
She pay for my house and she pay for my ride
She give me nice things and she make me feel good
She give me a little cash and I spend on you
She my sugar mama only with her for the money
But you know it’s untrue cause I talk about her funny
Saturday night’s, I’m supposed to be with you
But instead, I’m in bed with the stage and the crew
She laughs at my jokes, she tells me I’m cute
She tells me if we together we make a little loot
But I know I couldn’t have her if I didn’t have you
And I know sometimes I don’t make curfew
Ya know I’d never, ever, ever try to hurt you
I’m a just try to do what I gotta do

[Hook]
You’re my babydoll
I’ll hold you closer
I’ll hold you closer
Just like I’m supposed to
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need
You’re my babydoll
I’ll hold you closer
I’ll hold you closer
Just like I’m supposed to
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need
Know I got what you need
Give me my doughs, with semi-autos
And many Glock fo's in they Fendi ponchos
Kissimmee saint cloud condos
You want it pronto
You hit it on the head like congos
My auto garage is
Like that of Malik el-Shabazz hodges
Those that choose not to dodge us
Bullet lodges
Like water buffalo better get
Hustler ettiquette
Move rocks like Frederick
And your dames I entertain
Like my first name Cederick
Like Max Julien how I Macks julie 'em
Or any other chicken that listens for more than 40 seconds
Me and shorty steppin, left in the dust is the previous player who
Game wasn't up to par with thus such as ours
See thats where the jealousy starts, the ice grills begin and the weaponry sparks
So I'm forced to keep a gun up in the drawers and a, vest tight like a woman wit some balls
Pause... never
Niggas stall like public bathrooms
I move fast, while they assume
Positions I be splittin and gettin gone
They wanna take me off the wicker throne that I sit upon
Like Huey Newton but Luey shootin in Louis vutton, movie viewin, hoochie doin'
Hit a chick, similar to Lucy Liu an' only Cuban
Transmittin, these ghetto laws like the transitions
See the heroin that my man siftin'
I move it to death
Like my hands spittin, from my lungs to my tounge to my gums to the guns that my hands liftin
Stay riffin Mercedez Benz sedan whippin
Extra heavy coppin, set up every block and buy out every bag of plastic wrap saran rippin
Nigga, nigga... yeeeah!

[Instrumental Intro 0:00-0:19]

[Verse 1]
Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan
Wherever you go
Wherever you land
I'll say what this means to me
I'll do what I can
Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan

[Verse 2]
The fundamental problem
We all need to face
This is important
But I know you're not listening
Oh, I know you're not listening

[Verse 3]
If this was still new to me
I wouldn't understand
Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan
But this is what love is for
To be out of place
Gorgeous and alone
Face to face

[Verse 4]
With no larger problems
That need to be erased
Nothing more important than to know
Someone's listening
Now I know
You'll be listening

[Guitar Solo Outro 2:45-5:57]
Bow bow man u know me bow bow 5.0 tryin 2 get me im tryin 2  get way yaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!! bow bochw bow bow yaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!  bow bow bow bwo chillin in my house the cops say come and put yo hands up

[Verse 1]
How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending, unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step, 'cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Verse 2]
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
She said, is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Bridge]
And does it kill? Does it burn? Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control?
Does it thrill? Does it sting when you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold?

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Hook: Josh Everette]
I heard that love was blind
But girl I've seen it (girl I've seen it)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
And no I'm not there
It's true them other dudes don't compare
See I got girls a few I don't care
When I see you, I stop and I stare
I'm not some player
Or just some guy
You like my swagger
Think that I'm fly
You caught my eye
Across this club
I'm way pass drunk
I think I'm in love
And you my drug
I need you most
I take you until I overdose
Come here get close
And hit this smoke
If you want 'scape

Before we slide
You need to know this

[Hook: Josh Everette]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And no where else
It ain't my fault can't help myself

When I see you
You just my style
So whatchu won' do
You private it can just be us two
If you got friends
Then bring your crew
You know how to keep a secret
Me too
I won't tell no one else what we do
Puttin your nails all in my tattoo
I want you bad as hell and that's true
You tell me what a playa gott' do
To make you understand a mad dude
I won't act new
When I'm around
If you end up lettin' me bust you down

That you know this
Before we slide you need to know this

[Hook: Josh Everette]
I heard that love, was blind

So don't go far

Make girls play the left

Just one thing to tell you tonight

[Hook: Josh Everette]

What you need is right here (ahhh oh)
What you need is right here (ahhh)
Everything you need is right here (Right here, here, here)(oooh)
What you need is right here (ahhh)
Everything you need is right here (here, here, here)

[Verse 1]
Look here
SB donks, five-seven-five jeans
Five thousand dollars on my fuckin wallet chain
I be wildin maine, I'mma island man
There ain't nothin' else by me mane
I tell em float on and go on to the ozone
Im so gone, my blunt like a pole long
I prolong, and hold on
To it like a trombone, I'm so blown
And um, I got that cock back, I don't need that thumb bone
So come on, you get the one with the drum on, it
That's that one that goes dit, dit dit dit dit dit dit dit
I'm so terrific when I spit, put my foot up in your ass
Now I'm kickin in your shit
Now I'm pitchin at your bitch
And she catch it with her lip, naw she catch it wit her mouth
And since im the president, she tried to catch it on her blouse
I tell her whoa, easy baby
I'm king cake, so she eat the baby
Wait, shit gets way more crazier
We flipped the bitch like she was in the gymnasium
I ain't fuckin with them bitches with that stadium
Thats no dome, bitch go home... b bi bitch, bitch go home

[Verse 2]
Bitch I spent a hundred winters on my snow cone
Lil nigga walking like he get his bowl on
Boss man, pimp stroll, pimp stroll
I can let my money go when the wind blow
Bet it come right back like a rental
And bet them bitches understand me like 10-4
Niggas is simple, like instrumentals
I bet you bitches understand me like info
Get your top chopped, and get trimmed low
Sumn like my Benzo
Riding with my friends hoes
No I mean my hoes friends
Fucking all my hoes friends
Takin all my hoes ends, that what make the globe spin
I tell these young niggas; pimp or die
Dont get that Benz, if they dont split them i's
Dig them thighs, thin them ties
And if you reach at I
I don't preach I speech and give you beef wit them fries
Come to the beach and find
I live where all the little seagulls fly
See, baby I'm so high
All I need you to do is just shut up and ride
Bitch bitch shut up and ride

[Verse 3]
Look, and me and Mac was just two niggas from the same hood
Fell from the same tree, cut from the same wool
I'm just the lion and he the young bull
Not Sammy the bull
That pistol on my hip then I got a hammy to pull
I had a Lammy in school, I think it was diablo red
I'm T.I. red, I'm t.i.red, you d.i.ed because of what you said
Chea, I'm as sharp as an image
And I keep it bumpin like a motherfuckin blemish
Two twins drink me up like Guinness
When I'm finished I say "Brilliant!"
When I'm finished they say "Weezy you killed it"
I hop on your shit and they say "Weezy you healed it"
So fly, got wings tattooed on me, the gun glued on me
But I pop you in your stomach, now I got ya yesterdays food on me
Now that was real rude, homie
And I smell like a weed plant
Young Money motherfucker, where cheese at

[Verse 1]
Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's complexity
When the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat?
I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome that someone so handsome should care"

[Chorus]
Ah, a jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

[Verse 2]
I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome that someone so handsome should care"
Naaa nana nana nana, this charming man
Naaa nana nana nana, this charming man

[Chorus]
Ah, a jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

[Verse]
You know its hard liquor
Rock steady from the start sister
Since I stepped on the set like Godzilla
Since I stepped on the scene
It's been nothing but him hustling
Old schooling, instruction was mean
As I lean back like limbo
In 6 4's like Nintendo's, clean
Don't intervene chumps
Y'all far from the hood like limousine trunks
Man, I'm up front with the pumps
And I squeeze in the cars like a mini full of clowns
Or a coupe full of Klumps
Many put it down but
Lu from the jump been producing that crunk
Fusion, the music amusing the youth where I'm from
I'm from where you shouldn't come
OG ball, see how law override like OG call
Comp can't hold it down, they ain't fatter then me
This is no seesaw, easy
They can't see me like I'm 4 feet tall
Standing behind a 4'3" wall
Believe me I'm on the low
I do a little balling like BB
I get big like toadstools
Then I might jump into a coupe and its back to being small
I get little
The one who can't be seen like flea circus
Flees the scene like perpetrators
If you can't purchase you can still juke like work it
I will foot work like percolate
Set tripping with my usual fox, the west suburbs makes the best hustlers: Was!

[Verse 1]
One winter morning I went for a drive, I stopped somewhere between June & July
I love these warmer days
But maybe I can't see that the snow's still falling
I only see the gift my heart just brought me
(Merry Christmas babe) That's what she said
She didn't have to do much, but she made me smile
December in Manhattan feels like South Beach now
I love my baby, ohh yes I do

[Hook]
It ain't about you givin' anything, as long as you're my everything
Cause lady what could you give to me better than what you've been givin me
Just keep talkin' in my ear, cause I need it
And tell me you'll be right here if I need ya
The greatest present you could give is the present (ohhh, I need it)

[Verse 2]
It's just a regular morning, I'm a regular guy
Takin' the train to my 9 to 9
(But something's different today)
I had an envelope sittin' right next to my breakfast
And it's from my baby, not the bill collectors
(Happy Birthday Baby)
Then it said... I know we don't got much but baby we got us
And after you get off, we gon' make sweet love
Now go and get that cake (ohhh yeah)

[Hook]
It ain't about you givin' anything, as long as you're my everything
Cause lady what could you give to me better than what you've been givin' me
Just keep talkin' in my ear, cause I need it
And tell me you'll be right here if I need ya
The greatest present you could give is the present (ohhh, I need it)

[Verse 3]
One day the whole world will hear me sing
Then I'mma run and buy you those things
But right now, three months pay barely gets me a diamond baby
But one day I'mma buy you that ring
Ohhhh

[Hook]
Just keep talkin' in my ear, cause I need it
And tell me you'll be right there if I need ya
The greatest present you could give is the present (ohhh, I need it)

(Nothing but everything)
(I don't need anything, long as you're my everything)

[Verse 1]
Can you feel the urgency?
Like a needle pulling out
Can you feel the urgency?
Doses of anxiety
We're just faces in the crowd
Doses of anxiety

[Bridge]
Are these the lies that we've been taught to believe?
Are these the lives that we have opted to lead?
Uh oh, uh oh

[Hook]
Staring at the clock
I hear each tick and tock
And they whisper that i've lost the race
But I won't fucking stop
I'll hold you by my side
I need you here tonight
Cause' if we're gonna' lose this thing
Then we're goin' out in style

[Verse 2]
Time replaced reality
Now we are peaking through the hours
Time replaced reality
So I grasp for sanity
I refuse to be devoured
So I grasp for sanity

[Bridge]
Are these the lies that we've been taught to believe?
Are these the lives that we have opted to lead?
Uh oh, uh oh

[Hook]
Staring at the clock
I hear each tick and tock
And they whisper that i've lost the race
But I won't fucking stop
I'll hold you by my side
I need you here tonight
Cause' if we're gonna' lose this thing
Then we're goin' out in style
Staring at the clock
I hear each tick and tock
And they whisper that i've lost the race
But I won't fucking stop
I'll hold you by my side
I need you here tonight
Cause' if we're gonna' lose this thing
Then we're goin' out in style
Staring at the clock
I hear each tick and tock
And they whisper that i've lost the race
But I won't fucking stop
I'll hold you by my side
I need you here tonight
Cause' if we're gonna' lose this thing
Then we're goin' out in style

[Intro: Pharrell]
She want to break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Woah, woah, woah
She want some Reggaeton, Reggaeton, Reggaeton, Reggaeton
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Hook: Pharrell]
Mamacita, oh my god I think you're on fire
Do you want me to get you water?
You make me want to be your baby father
Cause the dance you do is getting hotter
I better cuff you before the boys follow
Whatchu' think? I think you wanna'
I think you wanna'
She wanna' break it down, break it down, break it down, break it down
Woah, woah, woah
She Want Some Reggaeton, Reggaeton, Reggaeton, Reggaeton
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
(Skateboy!)
I've been long overdue
For something overdone
You've been undertouched, well I can make you overcome
I know he telling you what he can make you and
I know he telling you where he can take you
By the way ma', hey is that your hair?
If it ain't, it took two days in the hair-shop chair
Im just joking
I make you smile right?

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Look, come here, I mean excuse me baby
You dancing fast ma' this ain't Merengue
But your butt in search of your volantes
It's plump I'm being honest, cause it's just nice
You're looking different saying to yourself
(This no right)
Sure you cute, but you know you won't dismiss this plight
When my chain keep binking like Christmas lights
Get it right

(Yezzir)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Daddy Yankee (Spanish/English)]
Yo what's up ma'
You may not know Spanish , But you know Daddy Yankee
Sin uso de esteroides
Y tiendas aquí en Miami
Boxeador latín hustler!
Somos los dueños de los bizcochos y los suplimos a costo
You know mamacita tu si ere' dinamita
Y me la explota si te pones bien perrita
Ten cuidao ! el perro ta ajitao !
Que aquí estamos 

[?]
Sacude lo cause your body is on fuego
La vida real en mi corazon la llevo ma'
Keep it going son los matones
Con los pies en la tierra y la mente en millones
Yankee Y Pharrell dándote la rumba buena
Con mas sabor que la comida de abuela

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Pharrell]
(Hey girl!)

Let's go finish at mi casa
Trust me, it'd be proper
I got muchos negros on my lache with the choppers
If they suspect us, someone trespasa
All you hear is BRRRAT and then scream, Cucaracha!
Trust me, P is no pimp
See I got heavy pockets, so I walk with a limp
One night with he, and I'll make ya scream
You'll wake up, (wake up) like it's a dream
Call downstairs, tell em to make us P.J.s
Right after that, dry cycle our P.J.S
Right after that, book us a P.J
What you mean, how? When you got money, it's easy
This ain't dookie, ma, I'm not Green Day
Wake up, you're about to miss your damn dream day
Now everybody just sing what the screen say
It goes

[Hook/Outro]

[Intro]
Oh, woah, oh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I only miss you when I'm breathing (uh)
I only need you when my heart is beating
You are the color that I'm bleeding (uh)
I only miss you when I'm breathing
This ain't no ordinary feeling
You are the only thing that I believe in
I know you're coming back to me, and
I will be waiting here for you 'til the end

[Chorus]
I only miss you when I'm breathing (breathing)
I only miss you when I'm breathing (breathing)
Without your love, don't know how I survive
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive
I only miss you when I'm breathing
Woo
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-oh
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-oh
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-oh

[Verse 2]
I wanna see pictures of you leaning
On these four walls and on the ceiling
Gave you a kiss, but I'm dreaming
These crazy thoughts are so deceiving
You are the drug, I am feining
Paradise that I'm still seeking
I'm still alive, hope there's a reason
Can't move my lips, but my heart is screaming

[Chorus]
I only miss you when I'm breathing (breathing)
I only miss you when I'm breathing (breathing)
Without your love, don't know how I survive
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive
I only miss you when I'm breathing
Oh, oh, oh, breathing, woo
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-oh
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-oh (oh, baby, I only miss you when I)
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-oh

[Bridge]
I'm screaming out your name, but you don't answer me
I know I kissed your face, is this my fantasy?
So sound the alarm
Tell everyone that I only miss you

[Chorus]
I only miss you when I'm breathing (breathing) (yeah, babe, yeah, babe)
I only miss you when I'm breathing (breathing) (when I'm breathing, when I'm breathing)
Without your love, don't know how I survive
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive (aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-oh)
I only miss you when I'm breathing (aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-oh)
Hey, hey, woo, hey (aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-oh)
I only miss you when I'm breathing

[Verse 1 - Travis McCoy]
All press is good press kids
So if you wanna see us gone
Then I suggest you keep our name out of your headlines
Unless you wanna mess that is
Your best bet is to set your dirty laundry separate from the clean before your deadline
Admit it you wanted to be an artist
But your parents and that tiny voice inside you said it wasn't worth the hardships
What better way to compensate then to hate on everything you wish you were
But didn't have the balls to harness
Pop culture's my trip, somehow you think your gonna stop us
Cuz you flirted with a chick who's got my tongue in her esophagus
Bitches post anonymous
We shat on 07, 08 is gonna be great imagine 2011
Give me one good reason I shouldn't dead this debate
Don't worry I'll wait....
That's the fuck I thought
Cat got your tongue
Next time get your facts right
Google me and act right

[Hook - Dre]
How can I be with...
Be without your hate
It gives me peace of mind
So please don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
It's your hate that keeps me believing
That we're the greatest of all time
So please don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over

[Bridge - Dre]
Don't tell me it's over
Because I can't bare to see you go
See you go
Don't tell me it's over
Because I can't bare to see you go
See you go

[Verse 2 - Travis McCoy]
Hey Mr. Internet
To whom it may piss off, yea you and you
Here's a list of shit you didn't know but now you do
Exploit my bad habits
Tell them I do drugs
Tell them Travis smokes more crack than Tyrone Biggums does
Tell them I can't rap
Tell them I dumb it down
Tell them not to buy tickets whenever my band's in town
Tell them I sold out, say I did it for the fame
And how I buy magazines for the sake of seeing my name
Tell them I how frequent parties trying to get that page 6
Tell them so and so someone saw pictures of my dick
Make me out to be an asshole that don't deserve his fans
Make me more insecure than I already am
Kick dirt on my accomplishments if you're ever bored
Just document it well and don't forget to hit record
One hit wonder my ass, what are you talking about
Let them keep bogging trash im gonna take the garbage out

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Say the fucking baby
Never been fake and they are clayer than Aiken
And I don't play though, and they love to hate it
And I love it, and I would hate to not be hated
Hate cuz I'm ahead so much so my drop be hating
License plate reads hating
Eat my dust
Just hate us
Hater, hater, hater I love you so much

[Hook + Bridge]

[w/ Lil Wayne ad-libs]

[Hook:]
Girl after girl
Girl after girl
Girls going wild I got girls kissing girls
Girl after girl
Girl after girl
Girls going wild I got girls kissing girls

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Me her her and her, grab her by her hair
Naked girls in here, girls touchin on girls
Your lil precious daughter, got her high as hell
Make her pop a pill, still let her hit the blunt till
She feels like I feel, will not just cost a lil
Back round like a hill, these hoes are for real
Me her and her friends, they look like they twins
She so fuckin fine that I touched her up again
Told her next time she can bring her other friend
Then I lost her number never seen again
The best brain in the world, do her thing with a girl
But don't call her yo girl, yo listen I a'int with yo girl

[Hook: x2]

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Poppa, Poppa Bear, I'ma need some honey
Chew it like a gummy, stupid juicy oozy runny
Listen Gucci Mane I got what u need
Keisha and Alisha and Tamika got the weed
Girls everywhere Gucc go and get the camper
White girls too ohh Julie Annie Amber
Can I squeeze your boobs, let me see your boobs
Ain't none of these bitches on my cruising altitude (altitude)
Minaj is the name, it's me and Gucci tag team Wrestlemania brain
I'm stupid uh I'm stupid can u teach me how to read
Lil mami get to flashin get yo Mardi Gras beads

[Hook:]

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Today was gonna be the day they were gonna give it back to you
But by now you shoulda somehow realize what you gotta do
And I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how...

[Hook: Mike Posner]
I said maybe...
You gonna be the one that saves me
And after all...
You're my wonderwall

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Back beat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
And I'm sure you heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
And I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how...know how

[Hook: Mike Posner]
I said maybe...
You gonna be the one that saves me
And after all...
You're my wonderwall

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T.]
Big KRIT shorty!
They say you never let me free and I should tear you down
But you protect me from my failures when they come around
I build you up to be the best that you could be
But every now and then you block the sun and make it hard to see
Whatever's in front of me well surely I never climb
Hoping what I've created from fear would slip behind
But, you know the do's and dont's, been down this boulevard
A broken dream's amongst thing that would tear us both apart
Start over and over to make it through
Safe to say that nobody can see what I see in you
But when it all falls down you know and I know it too
As long as you never move of course we can never lose
Battles between nightmares and dreams and such
It was a time they used to say I often dreamed too much
About the maybes and the ifs too busy wishin' on a star
But with you here's not that hard, good Lord

[Hook: Mike Posner]
I said maybe...
You gonna be the one that saves me
And after all...
You're my wonderwall

[Intro]
(Top Dawg, Money GANG)
Owwww, Dave, I see you, now see me

[Verse 1]
Look, I say I'm a millionaire
I'm a Top Dawg millia- no let me just come in unorthodox
I order plenty ammunition for the enemies that I got
I'm the King, I'm just looking for my Coretta Scott
Bet I pop, like a boy band, I'm annoying to rappers
Guess I'm poison to rappers, front on me, get bent backwards
Stomping on em' like a Kappa
Cap and gown, graduated with my Masters
So where do I go now
Swear there is no-nothing after
I'm the bishop, I'm the pastor, I'm the god MC
And you don't want to get caught in the rapture
I would probably burn your whole colony
Chew you up then spit you out
You nothing but a Polla Seed
Follow hood policies
Compton, California where the motherfuckin' riders be
You never seen a killer til' you seen one on side of me
That green on the side of me
Fuckin' all about my fuckin' money like a sodomy
Fuck them bitches properly
I do it
I do it, done it, run it like I grown legs by the hundreds
My pocket full of hundreds, I'm always hungry
Been hungry, I think a nigga need three stomachs
Bummy, NEVER
Middle of a conversation, I cough up a feather
And get ready for the detonation
I bomb on whoever
Whatever you bout, I'm bout it twice like a woman who give twins life
I steered right through your fan base every time
Tapping your demographic like I was Gregory Hines
Every line be tailor made, hella paid, count that money, several ways
I'm a beast, fuck a mansion, I rather live in a cave
Sasquatch is back, but what y'all really didn’t know is sasquatch can rap

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm iller

[Verse 2]
Ok, I squeeze the juice out a rapper and just squash this track
The people like "What the fuck happened and where Wayne be at?"
There's some boy named K Dot and he's a maniac!
I think his vocal
