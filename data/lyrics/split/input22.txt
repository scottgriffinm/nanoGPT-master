[Verse 3: Peewee Longway]
Do you know what I do to you
Plet your bitch from you
Turn her shoes into Jimmy Choo
Early in the morning, sipping mud is what players do
Take her down, slass them
Let her know that my side blue
And let her shoot my busses
Baby tell em before noon
You making boss moves, damn girl
What you tryina do
Is how a boss move, the better ...for you
And now the ass, that fendi dress a little nice on you
With all this cash, I never want to not spend it on you
Take a flight just to fuck on you
San francisco, just smoke cookies
And if I always talk, I might bust on you
And you ain’t getting your money
And you might wanna watch your lady
I’m on molly tryina fuck me something
Got a whole lot of OG bags
And I ain’t worried bout nothing
Dre
S. Beezy

Grind more business
I'm the type to rock yellow diamonds that match my car
You the type to live under a rock, Patrick Star
And i might win some people over with that flow right here
Feeling serena any week and so that shows right there
I'm ahead of this music game by light years
Im the definition of swag bitch it's right here
I'm Gudda Gudda just like YM signed me
I'm the sun in the summer, you can't outshine me
They not in my task brackets so I cannot mention it
Bitch look at my dashboard, I bet that bitch digital
They saying damn
Song stucked in they head
Pussy nigga I got the game locked just like a dread
He say he was harder?
I say he was flexin
I pull a VIP with 30 freaks and drop top lexus
And name a rapper and I will kill em
I'm 19 now
With 19 million
Back then it was all a dream
These days I'm feeling like martin luther king
Digital digital everything digital
Shorty check the dashboard in my lambo and it's digital
Digital digital everything digital
Shorty look at my watch and I bet that thing digital
Digital digital everything digital
Digital digital everything digital
Shorty look at my dash and I bet that thing digital
Shorty look at my watch and I bet that thing digital

Shit on any rapper
I can bet a million
My chain turns colors
I call it chameleon
Hurtin niggas feelings
I'm in they mouth like fillings
I'm in the air chillin
Right about a ceiling
I keep making hits
While you rappers stealing
I hustle 20 million
And im still dealing
Leather wood grippin
On a money mission
Got my paper flipping
Shoutout to my coalition
Niggas hatin on me
But I gives a fuck
Snakes in the grass
So I keep it cut
20 ace on the vehicle is grown up
Engine in my trunk
When I showed up
They said they had a dungeon
Cuz I know they creepin
Money is my language
Now speak it or seek it
You fucking a white girl
You beat it a bit
Call her girlfriends over
We watching her eat it
At the top of my game
Till they come defeat me
I'm on my may-weather shit cuz im undefeated
It's me and my money
There's nothing in between it
And nigga im the best bitch and I fucking mean it
Digital digital everything digital
Shorty check the dashboard in my lambo and it's digital
Digital digital everything digital
Shorty look at my watch and I bet that thing digital
Digital digital everything digital
Digital digital everything digital
Shorty look at my dash and I bet that thing digital
Shorty look at my watch and I bet that thing digital
On a money mission

If you really goin low, you gotta go hard

[Intro: Ludacris]
I’m in my zone so leave me alone
I’m in my zone so leave me alone

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I represent like you
Never thought I could’ve, never could imagine
Sit back and relax in the back, gotta act
Remix this affirmative action
You gonna get this work
Yeah, we gonna smoke this purp
Come about them shoes
Come about them jeans
And come about that shirt
I only get better with time, girl
Play like I’m Psy, I’m a Virgo, that’s just my sign, girl
Your friends is jealous and them bitches be like "why girl?"
‘Cause if I hit it once that pussy it’ll always be mine, girl

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I made love to the original, but the remix
See, I just wanna fuck to the remix
Pop some bottles, take some shots to the remix
Up in the club screaming "DJ, play the remix"

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Now what I ever do was keep it true
You reppin' me, I’m reppin' you
We steppin’ through, we kept the flu
Sick Guiseppe shoes, cold pair of J's
Better not let us in unless y’all took your medicine
I father niggas' sneaker game, you my step child
Python on a snap back, R.I.P you reptiles
Cut you snake niggas off, and make my bitch a bag
They that slick hoes, too, now she’s switching bags
Shout out to us, we the representatives
Funny we was killing ‘em when we went to LIV
I’m the brand, she the logo
So when they talk about us, call that promo

[Hook: R. Kelly]

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Move over, Kellz in the building
Aka. Rover, dawg’s in the building
Keep them panties leaking from their legs to the floor
See, you are just a tenant, bitch, I’m the fucking landlord
After I’m done I ain’t got no love for her
But the sex so good she be screaming ‘encore!’
Luda, Kellz' remix going hardcore
Keep fucking around, we gonna do a world tour
My money don’t sleep, 24-8
Like I’m in a dream except I’m awake
Faubourg for breakfast, yeah my life is great
Y’all niggas be pausing, and I don’t hesitate
Yo man, he’s mocking, I’m original, he a copy
I’m Fonzie he’s Potsie, man Joe is sloppy
Mami called me Papi, better yet call me Rocky
‘Cause I beat that pussy up like we fighting, hockey

[Hook: R. Kelly]

[Verse 1]
This morning I woke up in a curfew
O God, I was a prisoner, too - yeah!
Could not recognize the faces standing over me
They were all dressed in uniforms of brutality. (Ay!)

How many rivers do we have to cross
Before we can talk to the boss? (Yeah!)
All that we got, it seems we have lost
We must have really paid the cost

(That's why we going to be)
Burning and a-looting tonight
(Say we going to burn and loot)
Burning and a-looting tonight
(One more thing)
Burning all pollution tonight
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
Burning all illusion tonight

Oh, stop them!

[Chorus]
Give me the food and let me grow
Let the Roots Man take a blow
All them drugs going to make you slow now
It's not the music of the ghetto. (Ay!)

[Verse 2]
Weeping and a-wailing tonight
(Who can stop the tears?)
Weeping and a-wailing tonight
(We've been suffering these long, long-a years!)
Weeping and a-wailing tonight
(Will you say cheer?)
Weeping and a-wailing tonight
(But where?)

[Chorus]
Give me the food and let me grow
Let the Roots Man take a blow
All them drugs going to make you slow now
It's not the music of the ghetto. (Ay!)

[Verse 3]
We going to be burning and a-looting tonight
(To survive, yeah!)
Burning and a-looting tonight
(Save your baby lives)
Burning all pollution tonight
(Pollution, yeah, yeah!)
Burning all illusion tonight
(Lord-a, Lord-a, Lord-a, Lord!)

[Outro]
Burning and a-looting tonight
Burning and a-looting tonight

[Verse 1]
Broke down, I found
Even when you think you need a rest you will live to fight another round
I know it's too bad, so sad
All the things that we could've been and could've had

[Chorus 1]
Hey girl, what sound
A million miles of water that are flowing deep beneath this ground
Now, I found you right here
A million miles of water

[Verse 2]
You were my muse
Just because you happen to have a bomb doesn't mean you light the fuse
I know that, my girl, big lie
Four years and you never even said goodbye

[Chorus 1]
Hey girl, what sound
A million miles of water that are flowing deep beneath this ground
Now, I found you right here
A million miles of water

[Chorus 2]
Hey girl, what sound
I want you to remember that sometimes we have to go without
Now, I found it right here
I want you to remember, dear

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
We were two
Of a funny kind, so damn blind but now we got to never-mind
I know that this is the end, we tried
So hard, but now I got to lose a friend

[Chorus 1]
Hey girl, what sound
A million miles of water that are flowing deep beneath this ground
Now, I found you right here
A million miles of water

[Chorus 2]
Hey girl, what sound
I want you to remember that sometimes we have to go without
Now, I found you right here
I want you to remember that

[Outro]
Hey girl, what sound
A million miles of water that are flowing deep beneath this ground
Now, I found you right here
Slip my love 

[?]
Hey girl, what sound
I want you to remember that sometimes we have to go without
Now, I found out how to
I want you to remember that

[Verse 1]
I stole your haircut and your boring personality
The perfect pallette for a painting of morality
And now I come across without a loss of what to be
Add up the two of us and then subtract the one of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Come meet your maker
A different kind of strain

[Verse 2]
I turn you into one and then I turn you out for fun
Of earth and days and age, in fact you never were that dumb
Descended from a line of endless opportunities
I feel the mountain where you bring 

[?]

[Pre-Chorus]
Come meet your maker
A different kind of strain
A sweet super-tanker
Oh won't it be great, yeah

[Chorus]
We can all do whatever we want, whatever we want, whatever we want
We can all do whatever we want, whatever we want, whatever we want
We can all do whatever we want to
We can all do whatever we want to

[Verse 3]
I'm dreaming up the thing that no one ever knew was love
I get you higher than the hawks of Hollywood above
It's up for grabs, the ragged stream of possibilities
To walk away from this could leave me feeling ill at ease

[Pre-Chorus]
Come meet your maker
A different kind of strain
A sweet super-tanker
Oh won't it be great, yeah

[Chorus]
We can all do whatever we want, whatever we want, whatever we want
We can all do whatever we want, whatever we want, whatever we want
We can all do whatever we want to
We can all do whatever we want to

[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante]

[Pre-Chorus]
Come meet your maker
A different kind of strain
A sweet super-tanker
Oh won't it be great, yeah

[Chorus]
We can all do whatever we want, whatever we want, whatever we want
We can all do whatever we want, whatever we want, whatever we want
We can all do whatever we want to
We can all do whatever we want to

[Verse 1]
On the corner into my car
I drive forever, never get far
The .45 is slowly getting loaded
I send another song to my star

[Pre-Chorus]
California mountains in the morning
Stitch it up, and get it all
All along the woman's got a warning
Stitch it up, and get it all
We all walk your pavement, get it all
Take more than your

[Interlude]
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa

[Verse 2]
A pendulum inside of my head
Swinging low, I hope to get hit
The overflow is slow, but not enough, no
Another drop will never fix it

[Pre-Chorus]
California mountains in the morning
Get along, and get it all
All along the woman's got a warning
Stitch it up, and get it all
We all walk your pavement, get it all
Take more than your friends

[Chorus]
If I call you lately
I could be your man, I could be your greatness
If I call you lately
I could be your man

[Interlude]
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa

[Verse 3]
I shut it down, the look in my eyes
Knock 'em dead a-covered in flies
The big sleep without a bed of roses
The light of day will never tell lies

[Pre-Chorus]
All along the woman's got a warning
Stitch it up, and get it all
California mountains in the morning
Stitch it up, and get it all
We all walk your pavement
Take more than your friends

[Chorus]
If I call you lately
I could be your man, I could be your greatness
If I call you lately
I could be your man

[Outro]
On the river into my dock
I paddle through the shadow and fog
To ponder all of those who came before me
Another piece for building my arch

[Verse 1]
When will it come around
The wind that will inspire
When will it make a sound
The sound I desire

[Chorus]
'Cause we all need something to do
A certain something, that's true

[Verse 2]
Floating upstream I've seen
The spider and the snake
A trip without pause when
I saw my mistake

[Chorus]
'Cause we all need something to do
A certain something, that's true

[Bridge]
All my life, I have known who I am
A troubled man but I stand
All my life I have seen what it means
To be myself in this dream

[Outro]
'Cause we all need something to do
A certain someone, that's you

[Verse 1]
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy me
I look around, I need another remedy
The I don't know is philosophy
Better yet, I'll let you get ahead of me

[Verse 2]
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy me
Come around, I need another enemy
Anyone could clearly see
A summer breeze is part of my anatomy

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When it's written in Britain, we get a little smitten
Like a kitten, a cuddle is where I'm benefiting
Any higher the fire would have to petrify her
Upon the wire the flyer is gonna satisfy her

[Chorus]
My love is forever
My love it can feel this
My breathless defender
Step forward and steal this

[Verse 2]
Mercy, mercy, mercy me
Coming down, I gotta case of gravity
Even though we disagree
Give a kiss 'cause life could be the death of me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Acrobatic, the static is getting too dramatic
Comin' down with the system, we'll get it systematic
Facilitating the mating, my love is circulating
Rejuvenating the fading but never dialating

[Chorus]
My love is forever
My love it can feel this
My breathless defender
Step forward and steal this

[Verse 3]
Mercy, mercy, mercy me
Lovin' on the color of an Emily
Easy as a guarantee
Better yet, I'll show you what you wanna see

[Chorus]
My love is forever
My love, you to feel this
My breathless defender
Step forward and steal this

[Outro]
We aim to forever
I want you to feel this
My gentle defender
Step forward and steal this

[Intro]

[Hook]
Broke bitch grew up in the hood eating fish sticks
Hood bitch thinking she the shit but you ain't bitch
You's a thirsty ass, thirsty ass, thirsty ass ho
Thirsty ass, thirsty ass, thirsty ass ho

If you got more babies then the motherfuckin trap bitch
You's a thirsty ass, thirsty ass, thirsty ass ho
Thirsty ass, thirsty ass, thirsty ass ho

[Verse 1]

Cooking dope in Granny house in ma dear tea pot

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I had this fine bitch with me but she thirsty dawg
In the Maybach with me open up my curtains dawg
Baby you fine but riding with me is a no touch clause
And this yo second violation cause you wore yo draws
Third strike, coach bag, baby step yo game up
If your boyfriend broke, don't bring my name up
If you keep sucking dick like that, you gone get famous
Man these hoes so thirsty, gotta sign disclaimer
I had a girl go to Spelman was a good, good-brainer
At first she wasn't good so I had to train her
I had a Peruvian and she was personal trainer
I tried to marry in the family just to get the cocaina
I'm in a charger cost 100, that's a whole other lane
I'm in a jeep that cost 200 bitch, now step up ya game

In this big old empty room, staring at each other
Who's gonna make the first move?
Been doing our thing for a minute
And now both our hearts are in it
The only place to go is all the way
Ah-ooh

[Chorus]
Is that alright? Is that okay?
Girl, no need to be nervous

Clothes are not required
For what we got planned
Oh, girl, you're my desire
Your wish is my command
Treat you like a princess
Ooh, girl, you're so delicious

Gonna eat you before you melt away

[Chorus]
Is that alright? Is that okay?
Girl, no need to be nervous (No, no, no, no, oh)

[Verse 1]
Time is truly wastin’, there’s no guarantee, yeah
Smile is in the makin’, we've got to fight the powers that be
Got so many voices, saying all the same, yeah
Killing up all around me, faces full of pain

[Refrain]
I tried to play my music, they say my music’s too loud
I tried talking about it, I got the big runaround
And when I rolled with the punches I got knocked on the ground
By all this bullshit going down, hey

[Verse 2]
Time is truly wastin’, there’s no guarantee, yeah
Smile is in the makin’, we got to fight the powers that be
I don’t understand it, people wanna say yeah
Those that got the answers, red tape in the way
I could tend to it easy, let’s just have some fun now, now
Seekin’ my satisfaction, keeps me on the run

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Time is truly wastin’, there’s no guarantee, yeah
Smile is in the makin’, we got to fight the powers that be
Fight it baby, yeah, woo, hey, even you and I can fight the power

Check 1, 2 speak into the microphone
Tell that bitch to speak into the microphone
Now work it work it, cause practice make perfect, OK (x4)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I love it when she do it, she do it how I like it
See the party at the studio and you just got invited
She the truth up in the booth
I love it when she spits them verses
When she finish with that mic it make me want to buy some purses
Got so many instrumentals
I hope she never stop it
And this microphone's expensive so I hope she never drop it
I beat it like a drum, I tap it like some snares
And she almost blew her speakers but that bitch don't really care
She a top notch freak
I like the way she work it
She be choking on that chicken and she know just how to jerk it
Put some spice up in your life
So I whispered in her ear, and told her go and grab that mic
You'll be the artist of the year
And I'm like

[Hook]
Check 1, 2
Speak into the microphone
Tell that bitch to speak into the microphone
Check 1, 2
Speak into the microphone
Tell that bitch to speak into the microphone
Now work it, work it cause practice make perfect, OK (x4)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I need her in my life
She always come in handy
And she got that type of skills that make you think she won a Grammy
I was almost nominated
I always contemplate it
If she was on the billboard top 100, then that bitch will dominate it
Cause she grab that mic and go to work
Spit that verse I go berserk
Booth so hot take off your shirt
Grab that drink, roll up the purp
We wasted in the studio
Making a movie yo, with a boogie ho
Just a little gangster paradise we like Coolio
I'm faded cause I think I just discovered a star
And you my best kept secret they don't know who your are
I keep her close and tell her baby don't be going to far
Cause She know when to grab that microphone whether she be in the booth or the car

[Hook]

[Pre-Hook] (x2)
She goin' make me sign her to a record deal
Hit the store and buy her some giuseppe heels
She be on that mic so long she out of breath
Put her in the booth and work her half to death

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm stuck in this bed you made
Alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said
To the secrets you've been keeping
It's written upon your face
All the lies, how they cut so deeply
You can't get enough, you take
And take and take and never say

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You say that it's not your fault
And swear that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse for the trust you're breaking
You run but then back, you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're making
You can't get enough you take
And take and take and take and take
Fuck it, are you listening?

[Chorus: Chester] Bennington
No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!

[Post-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Blackout, blood in your eye!
You push it back down! Push it back down!
You push it back down, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Floating down, as colors fill the light
We look up from the ground in fields of paperwhite
And floating up, you pass us in the night
A future gazing out, a past to overwrite
So, come down, far below
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down, far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go

[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh

[Verse 1]
There is a game of love
There is a game of love
This is a game of love
This is a game of love
And it was you
And it was you
The one that would be breaking my heart
When you decided to walk away
When you decided to walk away

[Refrain]
The one that would be breaking my heart
When you decided to walk away
When you decided to walk away

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
There is a game of love
There is a game of love
This is a game of love
This is a game of love
And it was you
And it was you
The one that would be breaking my heart
When you decided to walk away
When I wanted you to stay

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
And it was you
I just wanted you to stay
Me, I just wanted you to stay
Me, I just wanted you to stay
Me, I just wanted you to stay

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]

[Spoken Word: Eugene Cernan]
Hey, Bob
I'm lookin' at what, uh, Jack was talkin' about
And, uh, it's definitely not a particle that's nearby
It is a, uh, bright object
And it's, uh, obviously rotating because it's flashing
It's, uh, way out in the distance
Currently rotating in a very rhythmic fashion
Because the, uh, flashes come around, uh, almost on time
As we look back at the earth, it's, uh, up at about 11 o'clock
About, uh, well, maybe ten or twelve dianrers—diameters, uh
I don't know whether that does you any good
But there's somethin' out there

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world

[Verse 1]
Bless my eyes this morning
Jah sun is on the rise once again
The way earthly thing's are going
Anything can happen

You see men sailing on their ego trip
Blast off on their spaceship
Million miles from reality
No care for you, no care for me

[Verse 2]
So much trouble in the world;
So much trouble in the world
All you got to do: give a little (give a little)
Give a little (give a little), give a little (give a little)!
One more time, ye-ah! (give a little) Ye-ah! (give a little)
Ye-ah! (give a little) Yeah!

[Verse 3]
So you think you've found the solution
But it's just another illusion!
(So before you check out this tide)
Don't leave another cornerstone
Standing there behind, eh-eh-eh-eh!
We've got to face the day
(Ooh) Ooh-wee, come what may
We the street people talking
Yeah, we the people struggling

[Verse 4]
Now they sitting on a time bomb; (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)
Now I know the time has come: (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)
What goes on up is coming on down, (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)
Goes around and comes around. (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)

[Outro]
So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world
There is so much trouble (so much trouble in the world)
There is so much trouble
There is so much trouble (so much in the world)
There is so much trouble
There is so much trouble in the world (so much trouble in the world)
There is (so much in the world)
(So much trouble in the world)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Mac Miller]
(Woo) Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac (Yeah), Mac, Mac

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Woah, what do we have here? (Woah)
People want to know how we could be that weird (That weird)
How many hoes want to clean Mac's beard? (My beard)
I kill flows, think I need that tear on a tattoo (Uh-huh)
My bitch suck, she a vacuum (Let's go)
Fuck her in the ass every time I'm in a bad mood (Uh)
Ain't got a choice, no, she do it 'cause she have to
I hit it raw while I'm listenin' to Papoose (Woo)
No respect (Oh), 'cause you wear a V-neck (Oh)
Got me stressed, pressure that could even make Keith sweat (Woo)
I wish Narnia was on a GPS (I wish)
I wish Rihanna was DTF (Bad bitch)
I got rich with these rap songs (Songs)
Bought a drug problem, now the cash gone (It's all gone)
Album filled with all sad songs
But this the one that I can laugh on (Haha)

[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em, ah
Girl, shake that body
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em, ah

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Girl, shake that body, them ass and totties
I wanna see them cankles at my hotel lobby (No, nigga, fuck you)
Bitch, why you so damn snobby? (Uh-uh)
Your ass flatter than the back of my head
I bought you dinner, now it's time to pay me back with some head
Or I'ma have my little sister beat the back of your head  (Uh-uh)
I'm a grade-A douchebag, I'm a dickhead
Asshole area where my gooch sag
Little momma got salty at me, she started talkin' tough
So I called the Wolf Gang up, they start to bark it up
Popped a hundred mollies, fifth of sherm, think I was sparkin' up
A bottle of Zima, the Bimmer, I started parkin' up
Seen my nigga, Mac, and he hopped in the back
And then we jet to Fatburger, ordered some Big Macs (Motherfucker)
And bitch came with a gauge, and she wanted my fade (Fuck you)
But I'm a bitch-ass nigga (Yeah), so I say

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em, ah
Girl, shake that body
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em, ah
Girl, shake that body

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
T-Dollaz and Mac Meezy
Makin' sure you niggas don't win like referees
Lookin' for the bitches that love to suck peewee, Herman, I'm a vermin
And you could tell I golf with my hat, bitch, fuck Thurnis

[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
Um, I'm at IHOP to eat with Tyler (Yum)
Drink cocoa, then double-team Mariah (Let's do that)
But please, don't tell Nick
We were all watchin' movies at a Motel 6 (Okay)
Like ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha-ha (Uh-huh)
I hope Kendrick fucked Gaga (For real)
If Madonna on the Kabbalah
Then me and Snoop could chill and be Rastas
I don't need Prada to show you I'm rich
Pullin' out the llama like, "Show me your tits"
Keep cryin' 'cause I still ain't over my bitch, oh well

[Outro: Mac Miller]
It'll be okay

[Part I]

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah
Haha

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Uh, think I can see a fuckin' halo (Halo), about to meet my maker
Brought a double cup of Drano (Drano), some soda for the flavor
Uncontrollable behavior with some psychopathic tendencies
Lonely as your neighbor with the bitches, he got special needs (Sheesh)
Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy
My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe (Please)
They got my soul, but I don't let 'em take the rest of me
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly
And my denim tailored (Tailored), me and Action rappin'
Al be fuckin' with the fader (Fader), sippin' mind eraser
Actually, we rappin' for the fuck of it
Takin' money from you, gonna smack you out in public
You the Republican government
Abundance of substance, have a consumption to fuck a bitch (*Woman moans*)
With your Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick
And your bitch lookin' like Cousin Itt, the ugliest

[Chorus: Action Bronson & Mac Miller]
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit (Woo)
(I said it must be the drugs)
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
(I said it must be the drugs)
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty-fifth
(I said it must be the drugs)
Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle
(I said it must be the drugs)
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit
(I said it must be the drugs)
Lookin' up into the clouds where the angels sit
(I said it must be the drugs)
They lookin' down, keepin' watch 'til I'm dead
(I said it must be the drugs)
So how'd I get this red dot on my head? (My head)
(I said it must be the drugs)

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first (Never)
After rappin', take my people out for octopus (Spanish)
We all deserve it; dedication to the fam (Uh, uh)
Don't hold your hand out for nothin' if you claim to be my man, damn
You see me peelin' off a whip like when your mother strip (Strip)
Blow the dice, roll them shits, hit another trip (King Crack)
Shit, I'm on some shit
Hands are fuckin' hotter than the leather in the six in the summertime (Uh)
Understand I'm only rhymin' for this son of mine
And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
We ate the tuna, it's suede Puma
My look is Jay Buhner, doggy, ‘cause some of us just age sooner (I'm goin', man)
I'm still twisted, rockin' lizards from a strange river (River)
Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver
Check the bio (Bio)
I fixed the game between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio, I been wild

[Chorus: Action Bronson & Mac Miller]
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit (Woo)
(I said it must be the drugs)
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
(I said it must be the drugs)
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty fifth
(I said it must be the drugs)
Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle
(I said it must be the drugs)
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit
(I said it must be the drugs)
Lookin' up into the clouds where the angels sit
(I said it must be the drugs)
They lookin' down, keepin' watch 'til I'm dead
(I said it must be the drugs)
So how'd I get this red dot on my head? (My head)
(I said it must be the drugs)

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Uh, uh
Bitch, I'm noddin' off, I'm hot as wasabi sauce
And constantly givin' y'all a bit of this ambiance
I was a minor chasin' after vagina
None of my friends were fake, but none of my clothes designer
Went from posted on stoops (Stoops) to smokin' on roofs (Roofs)
I came from that basement, now look at this view (View)
Makin' this money (Money), blowin' it all (All)
Fuck what you did (Did), just show me results (Results)

[Verse 4: Action Bronson]
Yo, I'm a 635 dipper, fly motherfucker
Leather to the foot, horses, I led 'em to the brook
If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book
I see a lion in the mirror when I look
Look, I lose money, but I make it back
I keep it true and ain't no motherfuckin' fakin' that
I get a fade and then I fade to black
Bet on the Razorbacks, I hold the multi-colored flavored gat
Blat!

[Outro: Mac Miller]
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs

[Part II]

[Verse: Loaded Lux]
You was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
This name says "Crack dealin' trap nigga slash cap peeler
Back with a black stripper
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker, too fat to snap zippers"
In half is what I'll do to Mac Miller
Now my mind's first track figured
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixir, taps liquor
Then pass 'til it goes around the room, like his casket finna
Oh, you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
You-hoo! I'm finna murder this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure that look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you "beastie," boy
You can't match a killer with that, wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Thriller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from, Malcolm
I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King
You're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were struckin' blows, bloody nose for your honey roll
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You a bully's best day ever, with them Nike's on your feet
Comin' through Blue Slide Park
I'm gon' rob this chump
On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump
Nigga, give me that shit!
I liked you better when you was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know I'll be strong

For once, I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Oh, someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore

For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me
Someone who needs me

Hey, hey, hey, hey yeah
Oh, I'm in love, baby

[Harmonica solo: Stevie Wonder]

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore
For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me

Someone who needs me
For once in my life
Somebody that needs me
For once in my life

[Verse 1]
I got more love than anything else
But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my health
Struck by the notion that there just might be
A method to the madness that I cannot see
Suffering for the freedom of a roughed up soul
Forty-two years young is a little bit old
Boy named Sue sing a Tennessee tune
Got buffalo love living on the moon

[Chorus]
Save this lady for me (Save this lady for me)
Save this lady for me (Save this lady for me)
Save this lady for me (Save this lady)
Save this lady for me

[Verse 2]
Call me Alabama, I'm a Seminole prize
Got Time Square hair and a bedroom eyes
Keystone cops and the Billy Bob chops
Gonna scare my kids, gonna share my crops
Vampire blood and a baseball glove
Is just a little bit of what the girl is made of
National crash into the big lampoon
With a creature coming up from the black lagoon

[Chorus]
Save this lady for me (Save this lady for me)
Save this lady for me (Save this lady for me)
Save this lady for me (Save this lady)
Save this lady for me

[Bridge]
Losing ground, true sounds of levity
The forest of the north might hold the key

[Verse 3]
Rocking to the rhythm of a ragtime band
Black flag wave on on my truck my man
Blasting for Jones and the great unknowns
Got cheap cologne, seventy-six trombones
Looking for the lady that won't be afraid
When heaven needs a hammer, gotta get things made
I got more love than anything else
But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my health

[Chorus]
Save this lady for me (Save this lady for me)
Save this lady for me (Save this lady for me)
Save this lady for me (Save this lady)
Save this lady for me
Save this lady for me (Save this lady for me)
Save this lady for me (Save this lady for me)
Save this lady for me (Save this lady)
Save this lady for me

[Verse 1]
Bang on my window if you want to get your look out
I felt the wind blow when she took her little book out
I'm steady loving on the lady of these pages
Another chapter if you will, so advantageous

[Pre-Chorus]
Down on the river tonight
Take off your glasses and fight

[Verse 2]
Under the heliomoon I'm going to pop the culture
Blue cherry dress on you is looking like a sculpture
This recreation is amusing and confusing
You never knew that it could feel so good while losing

[Interlude]
(What you lose, your virginity?)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Down on the river tonight
Take off your glasses and fight

[Chorus]
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliament
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow

[Verse 3]
My intuition was a popping and a shaking
The very thought of it was all too much to take in
Corrupted lover we could lie out on the blanket
This canopy above I'll take the time to thank it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Down on the river tonight
Take off your panties and fight

[Chorus]
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliament
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
I want to bury my face deep in your aroma
Her name is Lisa but they call her Desdemona
Come out and see me for some street communication
I think it's sweet of you to be my motivation

[Chorus]
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliament
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow

[Verse 1]
It must have been your funny face
It must have been your love
It must have been your paper chase that
Wasn't quite enough
It must have been your tiny dance that
Made me laugh out loud
Must have been your angel dust that
Put me on your cloud

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the reason why, yeah
You're the reason I

[Chorus]
It must have been your love, oh
It must have been your love, I said
It must have been your love, in a little bit
It must have been your love

[Verse 2]
It must have been your poppy eyes
That made me step outside
It must have been the sight of tears that
Let me know I cried
It must have been your bunny shake
It must have been your love
A lot of girls won't come around, they
Treat me like a wolf

[Chorus]
It must have been your love
It must have been your love, I said
It must have been your love, I gotta get that
It must have been your love

[Bridge]
You're my angel baby
You're my darling, you're my star
Lo, lo, lo, lolita
Let her see me deep in love

[Trumpet Solo with Vocalizations]

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the reason why, yeah
You're the reason I

[Chorus]
It must have been your love
It must have been your love, now-ha
It must have been your love, hononona
It must have been your love

[Bridge]
You're my angel baby
You're my darling, you're my star
Lo, lo, lo, lolita
Let her see me deep in love

[Outro 1]
I've sighted eyes in a crooked frown
Make more of life, just settle down
Every single little princess needs a crown
Make more of life, just settle down

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro 2]
(It must have been your love)
(It must have been your love)
(It must have been your love)
(It must have been your love)
"I want you to, if you don't mind, Carl, I'd like you to stay out and help us on some songs, play the guitar."

"I'd love to!"

"One of the greatest guitar players as well as songwriters and singers in the business. Appreciate a little help on the guitar, all right?"

[Verse 1]
Well, my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me "Sue."

[Verse 2]
Well, he must've thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folks
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named "Sue."

[Verse 3]
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

[Verse 4]
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me "Sue."

[Verse 5]
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: "My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now you're going to die!!"

[Verse 6]
Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

[Verse 7]
I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

[Verse 8]
And he said: "Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong

[Verse 9]
He said: "Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue

[Verse 10]
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!

[Intro]
It started when we were little kids
Free spirits, but already tormented by our own hands
Given to us by our parents
We got together and wrote on desks
And slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains
And slipped through whatever cracks we could find
Minds altered, we didn't falter
In portraying hysterical and tragic characters in a smog filled universe
We loved the dirty city
And the journeys away from it
We had not yet been or seen our friends, selves
Chase tails round and round in downward spirals
Leaving trail of irretrievable, vital life juice behind
Still, the brothers, blood comrades, partner, family, cousin was impenetrable
And we lived inside it, laughing with no clothes
And everything experimental until death was upon us
In our face, mortality
And lots of things seemed futile then, but love and music can save us
And did, while the giant grey monster grew
More poisoned and volatile around us
Jaws clamping down and spewing ugly shit around
Nothing is the same
So we keep moving
We keep moving

[Interlude]
(Ooh shit! Ooh shit!)

[Verse 1]
Went off and got some hair cuts
Looking wild and got all drugged up
Hopped a train into the night
Got a ride with a transvestite
Two boys in San Francisco
Two boys in San Francisco
Blasted off in a BART bathroom
Those coppers woke us up
Motherfuckers woke us up

[Chorus]
Two young brothers on a hovercraft
Telepathic love and belly laughs

[Verse 2]
Storm the stage of Universal
Slim shine talk boy go subversal
Papa's proud and so he sent us
Pounding hearts full and relentless
Two boys in London, England
Two boys in London, England
Climbing out of hostel windows
Wearing gear so out but in though
Come on kid and do the no, no

[Chorus]
Two young brothers on a hovercraft (yeah)
Telepathic love and belly laughs (oh yeah)

[Interlude]
(Ooh shit! Ooh shit!)

[Verse 3]
We went to Fairfax High School
Jumped off buildings into their pools
We'd sit down, grease at Canters
Run like hell 'cause they can't catch us
Two boys in L.A. proper
Two boys in L.A. proper
Stealing anything that we could
Got to sneak into the Starwood
Got to peak into the deep good

[Outro]
I remember
10 years ago in Hollywood
We did some good
And we did some real bad stuff
But the Butthole Surfers said
It's better to regret something you did
Than something you didn't do
Yea, we were young
And we were looking, looking
Looking for that deep kick
Yeah, seen 'em come, seen 'em go
(And I feel I'm getting close to you)
Broken heads in hospital beds
Saving ends and pulling your friends
While you're chasing the first line
We made it through
He's black and blue
And facedown
She's rushing in your bed
You take draws to sort your head
And facedown
Then he said, "I lost my head, can you see it?"

[Skit]
Yo, who is it?
It's Mickey
(Who the fuck is Mickey?)
Who sent you?
It's Mickey!
Yo nigga, who sent you?
It's me, Mickey!
Aight
*gunshots and laughing*

[Spoken Word: Giorgio Moroder]
When I was fifteen, sixteen, when I really started to play guitar
I definitely wanted to become a musician
It was almost impossible because—it was—the dream was so big
That I didn't see any chance because
I was living in a little town; was studying
And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician
I thought, "Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance"
Because all I really wanted to do is music
And not only play music, but compose music
At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already discotheques
So, I would take my car, would go to a discotheque
Sing maybe thirty minutes
I think I had about seven, eight songs
I would partially sleep in the car
Because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about
Almost two years to survive in the beginning
I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s
The sounds of the '60s, of the '70s
And then have a sound of the future
And I said, "Wait a second, I know the synthesizer
Why don't I use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future?"
And I didn't have any idea what to do
But I knew I needed a click, so we put a click on the 24-track
Which then was synced to the Moog Modular
I knew that could be a sound of the future
But I didn't realize how much the impact would be
My name is Giovanni Giorgio
But everybody calls me Giorgio

[Interlude]

[Spoken Word: Giorgio Moroder]
Once you free your mind about a concept of
Harmony and of music being "correct"
You can do whatever you want
So, nobody told me what to do
And there was no preconception of what to do

[Verse 1]
There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
I am lost, I can't even remember my name

[Chorus]
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am

[Verse 2]
There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
(Where are the locks to try the key?)
I am lost, I can't even remember my name
(And I wonder why)

[Chorus]
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am

[Verse 1]
I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take
One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I don’t believe in him, his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the Roche
But no one gives us any time anymore
He asks me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said

[Pre-Chorus]
"I listened to your problems, now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again

[Verse 2]
It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissors at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
Take it, oh, I don't wanna sing anymore

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
"I listened to your problems, now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a–

[Bridge]
I don't understand, don't get upset
I'm not with you
We're swimming around, it's all I do
When I'm with you

[Chorus]
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

[Intro: Paul Williams]
Touch, touch
I remember touch
Touch, touch
I remember touch
Where do I belong?
Touch, I need something more
I remember touch
I need something more in my mind

[Verse 1: Paul Williams]
Touch, I remember touch
Pictures came with touch
A painter in my mind
Tell me what you see
A tourist in a dream
A visitor, it seems
A half-forgotten song
Where do I belong?
Tell me what you see
I need something more

[Verse 2: Paul Williams]
Kiss, suddenly alive
Happiness arrive
Hunger like a storm
How do I begin?
A room within a room
A door behind a door
Touch, where do you lead?
I need something more
Tell me what you see
I need something more

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Daft Punk, Daft Punk & Choir]

Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home

Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're–

[Outro: Paul Williams]
Touch, sweet touch
You've given me too much to feel
Sweet touch
You've almost convinced me I'm real
I need something more
I need something more

[Verse 1]
I got a plane in the middle of the night, don't you mind?
I nearly killed somebody, don't you mind, don't you mind?
I gave you something you can never give back, don't you mind?
You've seen my face like a heart attack, don't you mind, don't you mind?

[Verse 2]
I was late, but I arrived
I'm sorry, but I'd rather be getting high than watching my family die
Exaggerate and you and I
Oh, I think I did something terrible to your body, don't you mind?

[Hook]
I put your mother through hell, don't you mind?
I hurt your brother as well, don't you mind, don't you mind?
Oh, I was thinking about killing myself, don't you mind?
I love you, don't you mind, don't you mind?

I put your mother through hell, don't you mind?
I hurt your brother as well, don't you mind, don't you mind?
Oh, I was thinking about killing myself, don't you mind?
I love you, don't you mind, don't you mind?

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Dream beyond dreams
Beyond life
You will find your song
Before sound
To be found
Close your eyes and rise
Higher still
Endless thrill
To the land of love
Beyond love
Come alive
Angel eye
Forever watching you and I

[Verse 2]
You are the night, you are the ocean
You are the light behind a cloud
You are the end and the beginning
A world where time is not allowed
There's no such thing as competition
To find our way, we lose control
Remember, love's our only mission
This is a journey of the soul
The perfect song is framed with silence
It speaks of places never seen
Your home's a promise long forgotten
It is the birthplace of your dreams

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Driving this road down to paradise
Letting the sunlight into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise
And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way, I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

[Chorus]
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine

[Verse 2]
Familiar faces I've never seen
Living the gold and the silver dream
Making me feel like I'm seventeen
And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way, I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

[Chorus]
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go

[Verse 1]
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue, but you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel shiny and new

[Chorus]
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

[Verse 2]
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you, 'cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold, oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out what was scared and cold

[Chorus]
Like a virgin (Hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa, ah
Whoa whoa whoa

[Verse 3]
You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'til the end of time 'cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel I've nothing to hide

[Chorus]
Like a virgin (Hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

[Outro]
Like a virgin
Ooh-ooh, like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me, and your heart beats, and you love me
Oh-ooh oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh baby, yeah
Can't you hear my heart beat for the very first time?

[Verse 1]
It's safe in the city
To love in a doorway
To wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isn't it me
Putting pain in a stranger?
Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the centre of things
Where the knowing one says:

[Chorus]
"Boys, Boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, Boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
For hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing"

[Verse 2]
I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment
If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads of Hamburgers, and

[Chorus]
"Boys, Boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, Boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
For hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing"

[Verse 1]
I started a joke
Which started the whole world crying
But I didn't see
That the joke was on me, oh no

[Verse 2]
I started to cry
Which started the whole world laughing
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me

[Chorus]
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said

[Verse 3]
'Til I finally died
Which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me

[Chorus]
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said

[Verse 4]
'Til I finally died
Which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen, oh yeah
That the joke was on me

[Outro]
Oh no, that the joke was on me, oh

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Who me? Ain't’ shit…
Sittin’ court-side at All-Star
And this? Givenchy
My shirt covered in all stars
And y’all wasn’t wearing gold watches
‘Til you seen us wearing gold watches
And you may have a hit bitch
But this one out the ball park
And oh! lawnmower, just for the snake boys
Shoot your ass into pieces, man
And deliver it to your front door
Oh! Encore, they want more, they’re fans now
Got your girl ass clapping, hands down
Don’t approach me with your hands out
Sittin’ down I still stand out
Tall nigga with jewelry on
Like Christmas lights on a damn house
It’s me, and I’m cool with it
You don’t know what to do with yourself
When I do it, I’m doing it fresh
Born to do it, so I do it to death
Calm in the steps, walking my dawgs
We don’t get along, I’m tellin’ ‘em fetch
Hit ‘em like “PA!” Hit ‘em like “PA!”
Shoot up the spot and I’m leavin’ like “Ah!”
Okay, you know I started from scratch
I got to the strip club just to relax
I get a flat tire, I buy a new car
You know what time it is, check the Rolex

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
If you keep whining, baby, you gon’ lose me
Better choose me, baby, come choose me
So fine that I let the girl use me
But I don’t ever get used up, usually (turn up, turn up)
Baby use, me – baby, use me
Baby use, me – baby, you can use me
Baby use, me – you can use me
But I don’t ever get used up, usually
…makin’ no noise
That nigga ain’t makin’ no noise (nah, nah)
…makin’ no noise
No niggas ain’t makin’ no noise (shut up)
…makin’ no noise
Them niggas ain’t makin’ no noise (nah, nah)
…makin’ no noise
That nigga ain’t makin’ no noise (shut up)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
If you’re an ugly ho, I can’t leave with ya
If you’re a broke nigga, can’t smoke weed with ya
If you ain’t a boss then I can’t sip lean with ya
I’m not a rapper, bitch, I’m a mob figure
4-58, it’s a centrepiece
These ho niggas ain’t seen half a million
Got a pimp cup, I’m in the strip club
And the difference is these hoes ask for me
LaFlare, nigga, I’m rare, nigga
Caveman Shit Drag Her By Her Hair Nigga
You a bear nigga? Well I’m a bear killer
You a fuck nigga, I don’t fuck with ya
2 Chainz, nigga, my cuh-cuh
All my cousins sell drugs
My brother sent a pack, I fell in love
And told everyone I know I sell bud

[Bridge: Gucci Mane]
All I rock is designer clothes
All I take is designer drugs
So geeked up couldn’t find the club
Woke up on the beach with a bag of bud (damn)
2 Chainz, two times, got major money
More money than a label tryna sign a thug
And ya CEO say he wanna sign with me
‘Cause the artists you’ve got ain’t hot enough…

[Hook]

[Verse]
There was a family of quicks on my block
A family we all knew
I'm talkin' bout John, Damian, and that boy Jrue
They had an unfair proof that lived in their shoe
Technological truth made'em quicker than you
Their quick was quick
I'm talkin bout the quickest quick ever seen
From outside the gym you could hear the crowd scream
Challengers and challenges brung'em to the floor
They cut and crossed over until there wasn't no more
Competition that is
People keep asking you what's up in that shoe
First draft pick, rookie of the year, all-star games too
Looking back on the sell homie, who would've even knew
That all of that quick could come from inside of a shoe?
Those kicks made these cats rare
And when you crazy quick, man quick ain't fair

[Chorus]
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine

[Verse 1]
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives, where are they now?
With-a loves and hates and passions just like mine
They were born, and then they lived, and then they died
Seems so unfair, I want to cry
You say: "'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn"
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well and I've heard them said
A hundred times, maybe less, maybe more

[Verse 2]
If you must write prose and poems the words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take "on loan"
'Cause there's always someone, somewhere with a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs when you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh when you fall
You say: "'Ere long done do does did"
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text from whence was ripped
Some dizzy whore, 1804

[Chorus]
A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're happy
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Oh, Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're wanted
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side, but you lose
'Cause whale blubber Wilde is on mine
Sugar!

[Verse 1]
Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds
No, it's NOT like any other love
This one is different because it's us!
Hand in glove
We can go wherever we please
And everything depends upon
How near you stand to me

[Refrain]
And if the people stare
Then the people stare
Oh, I really don't know
And I really don't care
Kiss my shades...

[Verse 2]
Hand in glove
The Good People laugh
Yes, we may be hidden by "rags"
But we've something they'll never have
Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds
Yes, we may be hidden by "rags"
But we've something they'll never have

[Refrain]
And if the people stare
Then the people stare
Oh, I really don't know
And I really don't care
Kiss my shades...

[Verse 3]
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
For the good life is out there somewhere
So stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
Yes, I know my luck too well
And I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
Oh

[Bridge]
I be on the hotline, like e'rryday
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play
You know I got my top back and my beat low
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio
Turn up my radio, radio, radio....

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound

[Verse 1]
You're the only one that Papa allowed to hang out in my room
With the door closed, we'd be alone
And mama never freaked out when she heard it go 'BOOM!'
'Cause she knew we were in the zone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hold him in my arms and look out of my window
(Under the moonlight)
And he be keepin' me calm so I'd never let him go
He's got a place in my heart

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound

[Verse 2]
When I get into my car, turn it uh-up, uh-up
Then I hear vibrations all up in my truh-unk, uh-unk
And the bassline be rattlin' through my see-eat, ee-eats
Then that crazy feeling starts happeni-ing, i-ing, oh!

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I get butterflies when I hear the DJ (Playing the stuff I like)
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays
He's got a place in my heart

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound

[Bridge]
I be on the hotline, like e'rryday
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play
You know I got my top back and my beat low-oh
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio-oh
Turn up my radio

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound

[Outro]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Oh, ooh, whoa, whoa
Oh, ooh, whoa, whoa
Oh, ooh, whoa, whoa, ooh
Mary’s wiping ashes from her clothes
Blackened matches strewn across the floor
The smoke rose slowly and was pushed out by the vent
The guiding light was just the tip of her cigarette
She smokes in bed

Ba ba ba, ba ba ba da da da da da
Da da da

X2

Mary doesn’t care about herself
So what chance is there for anybody else
Sometimes I wonder about the heartache that lies ahead
Any day now she’ll set fire to her head
She smokes in bed

Ba ba ba, ba ba ba da da da da da
Da da da

X2
Nervous neighbors peeping through the blinds
Piercing sirens cutting through the night
Molten rubble settling to rest
They searched for hours
There wasn’t anybody left
She smoked in bed

Ba ba ba, ba ba ba da da da da da
Da da da

X4
Paulie killed Tony right and Tony killed Ty so it was only right
Bring em back twenty years, they was homies, tight
Sixth grade, for the love of the paper ain't nothing nice
And Paulie just loving life
He got them birds and he serving niggas left and right
Never used to party in them clubs every night
Popping bottles, blowing paper
Balling hard, he know they hating
But they gon' respect it, cause he rocked Tony
And Tony had the hood on smash by his lonely
And Paulie getting money so them bitches all on him
And his young boys riding, they ready to fall for him
Cause word on the street that Paulie did that
Used Key gold digging ass to get back
Text him through her phone, found out where he live at
She woke up in the morning like, I never sent that
But she never told Paulie what she saw
She was running her mouth, fitting to start a war
Cause Tony's little brother sixteen and up the wall
Robbing everything moving and breaking every law (LAW)
And Paulie on a rise now
Niggas that played the middle picking sides now
Plus he heard Tony's brother trying to ride now
So he put a check up on his head, he gotta die now
Paulie's youngest on the corner
Tony's little brother he slipping, yea he's a goner
Fucking with that lean, he dipping one in the morning
Shots fired, niggas scatter without a warning
He strapped too, reach and fixing to get up on em
The gat jam, he bang back trying to avoid em
Them niggas dumping, he get up running and hitting on em
He hit the alley, get a body he dipping on em
Said it's on now, try an kill em it's war now
Swisher in his mouth while loading his four pound
Feeling like he dead there ain't no remorse now
Getting high and he thinking bout kicking in doors now
Momma and lil kids get on the floor now
Finger on the trigger he feel that it's going down
Old ladies gotta hear that thunderstorm sound
Cause they sad when it rain it really gone pour down
And it's raining like Katrina, he got thirty in his nina
Seen Paulie car dropped thirty in his beamer
Paulie wasn't in it when he heared it he was steaming
Addicted to the murder so you know that nigga fiendin'
And he want this nigga dead before Sunday hit
But youngin tryna live on some Sunday shit
And time fly fast it was monday quick
And paulie bout to get back on his gunplay shit
And show em how its done so he loadin up his gun
And show this young nigga he fuck with the wrong one
Got a short temper and clutchin the long gun
And it's on sight he dont give a fuck if the law come
So he out here
Ridin dirty put down them birdies
And without fear niggas lurking
They tryna murder heared he out there
Niggas spin em they tryna hit em
Hitting every corner seeing niggas but he ain't with em
Youngin layin low he know paulie ain't playin thoe
There's money on his head and niggas is sayin go
But youngin he ain't scared, he cool as a fan thoe
He know its get down with that burner or end up a dead soul
It was four in the morn', paulie goin home
Windsheilds wiping, middle of the rain storm
And paulie he ain't slipping yea he got that thang on
You know what he did to Tony he won't get the same song so
When he hit the crib he spin the block befor he park it
Paulie ain't bitch at all Paulie just cautious
But lil did he knoe niggas in the streets talking
And out his rear veiw its like he seen a reaper walking
Nigga wit a hoodie all you hear is heaters sparking
Shot hit the window get low he tryna off em
Youngin boxed him in and Paulie can see the coffin
He get to reaching, trigga squeezing, trying get em off em
Them shots ringing youngin squeezing clip empty
That's when Paulie rose like Derrick, put six in em
Walked down on em he laying in a puddle
Looked him in the face, you ain't learn from your brother nigga

[Verse 1]
My friends are so depressed
I feel the question of your loneliness
Confide, 'cause I'll be on your side
You know I will, you know I will

[Verse 2]
Ex-girlfriend called me up
Alone and desperate on the prison phone
They want to give her seven years
For being sad

[Chorus]
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

[Verse 3]
My friends are so distressed
And standing on the brink of emptiness
No words I know of to express
This emptiness

[Chorus]
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Imagine me
Taught by tragedy
Release is peace

[Verse 4]
I heard a little girl
And what she said was something beautiful
"To give your love no matter what"
Was what she said

[Chorus]
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

[Intro]
My tendency for dependency
Is offending me
It's upending me
I'm pretending see to be strong and free
From my dependency
It's warping me

[Verse 1]
So much love, so rare to dare
Afraid of ever being there
Take me home, I need repair
Take me please to anywhere

[Chorus 1]
Descend
All the way, all the way
(Woah!)

[Verse 2]
Descended from demented men
Struggle with the art of Zen
Please don't look too close at me
You might not like what you see

[Chorus 2]
She said
All the way, all the way
Everyday
Warped and scared
Of being there, of being there

[Verse 3]
Night craving sends me crawling, woah
Beg for mercy, does it show?
A vacancy that's full of holes
Hold me please, I'm feeling cold

[Chorus 2]
She said
All the way, all the way
Everyday
Warped and scared
Of being there, of being there

[Instrumental Outro]

[Chorus: Jorma Taccone]
Damn
I fucked my aunt
I can't believe I fucked my aunt
I fucked my aunt y'all

[Verse 1: Jorma Taccone]
I was thirteen, skinny little freckle-faced kid
Growing up in the country felt like doing a bid
But the summers were my favorite when we swam in the lake
And trips to the city, what a magical place
First baseball game, man, I'll never forget
Crackerjacks, bleacher seats and the crack of the bat
My friend Tim caught a ball, but he gave it to me
And five years later, I fucked my aunt, damn

[Chorus: Akiva Schaffer]
I fucked my aunt
I can't believe that I fucked my aunt
Man, I really fucked my aunt
I fucked my aunt, y'all

[Verse 2: Akiva Schaffer]
Rainstorms always give me the blues
Worst one in ten years on the evening news
She rode her bike over 'cause the street was closed
My aunt standing there in soaking wet clothes
We opened some wine and laughed like kids
She told me funny things that her and my mom did
But then my uncle called and she had to go
And twelve years later, I fucked her sister, damn

[Chorus: Andy Samberg]
I fucked my aunt
Can you believe that I fucked my aunt?
Man, I guess I fucked my aunt
I fucked my aunt, y'all

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg]
It was my eighteenth birthday, the world was still new
My parents threw me a party as parents will do
My uncle's wife gave me a punny gift
It was an ant farm; man, she was a trip
Later that night I was up in my room
I watched as the small ant community bloomed
So simple, yet so complex
I contemplated my own life and wondered what would come next
I took out my favorite ant and crushed it with my dick
And also, I fucked my aunt

[Chorus: Andy Samberg]
Damn, I fucked my ant
And I fucked my aunt
Man, we fucked our aunts (yeah)
We fucked our aunts, y'all

[Outro: T-Pain]
Oh, I can't believe it... they fucked their aunts
I mean, I fucked my aunt, too, but you don't see me making songs about it
Although we technically didn't have sex
Just some above the clothes stuff
And some under the clothes stuff
I mean, what is sex, really? Is it just penetration?
Or do you have to finish? 'Cause I finished...
(Damn, I fucked my aunt, y'all)

[Marx Tweets: Lupe Fiasco and Twitter Followers]

[LP] #PhilosophySunday or pls tag your replies and tweets with #PS to keep things focused

[LP] A Marxist theory today:
Actual Revolution which affects wholesale societal change is only seen via technological advancement i.e. industrial

[LP] it suggests a negation of ideals as truly transformative and that true force behind changes across the board in society is technology

[TW] @LupeFiasco but doesn't it take an human idea to create a technological advancement?

[LP] Indeed But it can posed that the human idea is NOT the end product & w/o such material present the effects would be negated @egolessindigo

[TW] @LupeFiasco French Revolution Lu? As far as I know not any significant technological advances. Else you can educate me #ps

[LP] It can be argued that French Revolution was a failure. And not really a revolution at all. More Iike a civil war @epl82

[TW] @LupeFiasco history has shown that technological advancement is not necessary for revolution. Look at the revolutions in south America/Asia

[LP] What if 1 was 2 say "these revolutions were brought about in direct reaction 2 technological advances & would not hv otherwise @rebelde2012

[TW] @LupeFiasco Marx's theories indirectly killed millions of people, so I don't generally trust any of them #ps

[LP] “@DHoltThe1st: Marx's theories indirectly killed millions of people, so I don't generally trust any of them #ps”

Jesus's as well to argue

[LP] Yes Muhammad too and Buddah as well... @landolakes33 @DHoltThe1st

[TW] ah, so you're thinkin of revolution in the sense of a widescale change of thought and the ways we interact and see one another

[TW] the way an effective Actual Revolution manifests itself isn't purely industrial, it must be sparked by an organic idea #PS

[TW] @LupeFiasco @b_boor that's bullshit a change in society's mindset as a whole and less reliance on technology will start a revolution, #PS

[TW] @LupeFiasco ever read The Book of Daniel by Doctorow? Says revolution is a circle: overthrow power take the power but do the same as former

[TW] @LupeFiasco Foucault: "resistance is never in a position of exteriority in relation to power." Technology moves ideology via accessibility.

[LP] But is tech really in the hands of masses? @Scottjm52 @Scott_Lahn

[LP] Hey guys #LF Mgmt here. Gotta love his lively way with twitter but sadly he's gonna be taking a break to focus on other things.

[LP] I left it to mgmt so I can record etc without arguing with 15 year olds about if show goes on was on my first album or not..

[LP] Thanx again... lupe out...if you Karl Marx overly utopian closet capitalist ass was controversial wait till next Sunday...#DisAintWatUWant

[Hook: Kanye West]
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Life is like a long love song so I vibe
Yellow brick road on 24's as I ride
Shorty is a winner, when I'm in her I get lost
Make her tremble like the middle of December on the frost
UGG boots in a coupe dual exhaust
As I fall deep in love, Mr. West check my pulse
Paintings on the wall, Basquiat is her favorite
Black Maybach way trilla than a slave ship
How can I not spazz, questions that I'm asked
Home owner at nineteen, yo I done learned fast
My first love cheated on me, she was heartless
She fucked the quarterback and seperated partners
I took my quarter back and played another cartridge
I took my locket back and threw it in the garbage
I sang a melody, it sounded nice as T-Pain's
Okay I'm playing follow me, just to peep game
We party hard and fall asleep on the airplane
If she flirty in the dirty, then she fair game
Checkerboard luggage as they holler all aboard!
Portishead in the iPod until I reach a snore
In the clouds of the lear, thinking of Shakir
Run the game like my nigga still was here
In the clouds of the lear thinking of Shakir
We run the game like my nigga here, Baous

[Hook: Kanye West]
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gonna speak, so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gonna see
You'll never find nobody better than me

[Hook: Kanye West]
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Talk, and talk, and talk, and talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gonna keep hating me
And we just gonna be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gonna take off tonight into the night

[Hook: Kanye West]
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
I lay alone awake at night
Sorrow fills my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry
Despite of my disguise
I'm left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me
I guess I'm their soldier
Well, who's gonna be mine?

[Chorus]
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world
After she saves the world?

[Verse 2]
I bottle all my hurt inside
I guess I'm living a lie
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life?
A simple word, a gesture
Someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this buried treasure
Rainbows lead to a pot of gold

[Chorus]
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world (After she saves the world)
After she saves the world? (After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)

[Verse 3]
I've given too much of myself and now it's driving me crazy
(I'm crying out for help)
Sometimes I wish someone would just come here and save me
Save me from myself

[Chorus]
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world (After she saves the world)
After she saves the world? (After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)

[Outro]
(After she saves the world)
After she saves the world

[Verse 1]
Diamonds used to be coal
Look young 'cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
'Til your hands laid on my soul
Baby, that's why you're beautiful

[Chorus]
I'm not wondering why
The sky's blue; that's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love. That could be us."

[Verse 2]
Lovers used to make love
And died just to give us
Their piece of the beautiful
Remember when we made love?
Love
Wasn't it beautiful?

[Chorus]
Don't ask me why
The sky's blue; that's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love. That could be us."

[Bridge]
Diamonds used to be coal (Be coal)
Look young 'cause they got soul (got soul)
And my heart used to be cold (be cold)
'Til your hands laid on my soul
Somebody's got to stay deep in love
That could be you
That's why we're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
Ooh

[Outro]
Why, why?
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful

[Intro]
Aw baby, how you doin'?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh?
Some women were made...
But me, myself?
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
And, uh
What's more special than you?
You feel me?

[Verse 1]
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

[Chorus]
It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much)
It's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

[Verse 2]
Usually I'm humble
Right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know
I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes?
Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda something like me

[Chorus]
It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much)
It's too tough (Tough)
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego
Such a huge ego
But, he loves my big ego
It's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

[Hook]
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I, I can back it up
I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

[Chorus]
It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much)
It's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego (Such a huge ego)
But, I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

[Bridge]
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, you ain't know?
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano...
Whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woo...

[Outro]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I'm in this fight and I'm swingin', and my arms are getting tired
I'm tryna beat this emptiness, but I'm runnin' out of time
I'm sinkin' in the sand and I can barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but I'm hurtin' deep inside
And I can't keep waitin', I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home?
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

[Chorus]
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

[Post-Chorus]
I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely

[Verse 2]
I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you outstretch your hand, looking for mine
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

[Chorus]
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

[Bridge]
I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness, I think I'm drowning
I can't be lonely no more
And I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

[Chorus]
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

[Chorus]
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

[Outro]
I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely
TO MY DEAREST FANS in ANTWERP

I’ve never postponed a show in my life
It was very hard for me
I promise I will make it up very soon
I’m sorry if I disappointed you

Thank you for your concern
I'm feeling much better now
And I'm ready to give you a great show

See you tonight

All my love
Beyonce
I don't know if y'all know this one thing about me, but I ain't no motherfucking celebrity. I don't know if y'all know this one thing about me, but I'm a terrible, terrible, terrible celebrity. I don't know if you know this one thing about me, but I'm the worst kind, the worst kind, the worst kind of celebrity. Because all I do is make real music. All I do is sit in the studio and make real, real shit. And that's it. That's motherfucking it, that's motherfucking it

So I don't want nobody coming up to me with no cameras trying to like, sell pictures and shit to magazines. Asking me no dumbass questions. Throwing me off of my focus and shit. Harassing you all mothafucking day. I ain't no motherfucking celebrity. No, no, no, no it's not me. It's too much goddamn you. Lower, lower. Octave under

Y'all take the pianos an octave down. Yo, take away the "ha, ha, ha." No "ha, ha, ha." Take that shit

It's so funny, somebody asked me "when you do SNL, are you going to do like a skit about the paparazzi and shit and like humanize yourself?" I ain't here to apologize to no motherfuckers, man. It ain't about me humanizing myself. At what point did I become so inhuman where I had to turn myself back? Or maybe I was demonized, maybe I was treated inhumane in that type of situation. I ain't a fucking celebrity. I ain't running for office. I ain't kissing nobody's motherfucking babies--I drop your baby and then you sue me and shit

I'm trying to make some music that inspires people to be the best they can be -- And I don't want nobody to ask nothing else of me! Don't ask nothing else of me. Motherfuckers chasing you down about to make you crash into shit, and all they want you to make is a nigga to laugh and shit. Hell no I ain't doing no 'SNL' skits, this is my goddamn life, and this ain't no motherfucking joke. That's it, stop that shit

[Verse 1]
You don't need me to ever write
I read your last message at least 1000 times
At least 1000, at least 1000 times
Alright, alright, alright
Why did you ever listen to
People trying to hate on you
At least you know that's nothing new
Stop everything you're doing now
'Cause baby, you're awesome
So awesome
You look too good to be at work
You feel too good to ever hurt
I hope you ready for tonight
I'm gon cook, you'll be dessert
You can't be still
You gotta move, you gotta dance
I gotta live, I gotta love
I got a hope, I got a chance
Cause baby, you're awesome
You don't need to listen to your manager
You're way too hot for them to handle you
Baby, not for nothing
I know you're looking for something
And I've got it
Why you fallin' on me
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome
You're so out the park
You're so after dark
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right
Oh, you nnannanaa
I know you must be tired
From running through my mind
Can I come inside?
Cause baby you're awesome
Also, I'm also awesome, also
I'm also awesome
Y'all know
And I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome
You're so out the park, you're so after time
You're so breaking ?, oh it feels so right

[Intro: Jazze Pha]
Ladies and gentlemen
You are now tuned into the very best
T.I., Dream!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Long hair, cute face, big booty, thin waist
Breasts so pretty they can’t be real.. they is) that’s what she’ll say..
She’ll play with her girlfriend tag team on the sex I’ll give way..
Get em on Patron for real they both gone have a field day..
Never have experienced, gorgeous but they curious..
So gorgeous and mysterious I’m panty pumper number one I’m serious..
I’m talking fast cars, bright lights, big city, long nights, pretty women on site
I give it to em all night

[Pre-Hook: The Dream & (T.I)]
It had bright lights
Rolling through the city in that M6
Every other radio station playing my…. Oooo…..
In a minute she gone be right up on mine
And look at you
She ain't had none in a minute so I’m really finna to put it on you
You just got a text from your man over here like he ain’t got no clue
(Tell him when I let you go, shawty)
You know it… (You know what it is, baby)
He can’t love you like I do…

[Hook 2: T.I. & (The Dream)]
He can’t do it like (I do)
He can’t do it like (I do)
He can’t do it like
(So go on shortie twerk that, I’m finna to work that. I do)
He can’t do it like (I do)
You know he can’t do it like (I do)
He can’t do it like
(I'm not like him and I'm finna to put it on ya like..)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Say she got a man but, he don’t really stand up
In that stuff like he supposed to all he do is handcuff
So she come see me relaxed
Give me love receive it back
Sex her, stretch her body out so much she say I needed that
I’m talking prime time porn star
Going hard, going in, riding it like a foreign car, invite a friend to join in
I’m talking fast cars, bright lights, big city, long nights, pretty women on site
I give it to em all night

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Catch me in an old school, new school vert drop, hard top
See me and at least two freaks pulled over in a parking lot
Engaged in conversation rolling listening to the radio
Give it to em rough they say but treat em like a lady though
She never kissed a girl before but fantasized about girls before
Imagined having sex with women just don’t want the world to know
I’m talking fast cars, bright lights, big city, long nights, pretty women on site
I give it to em all night

[Bridge: The Dream]
Ooh baby
Hey baby girl..
All you gotta do is call me when you need me baby
All I need is you
All you need is me
Let me free your little body and take you into ecstasy

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Don't call it a fight when you know it's a war
With nothing but your t-shirt on
And go sit on the bed because you know that you want to
You've got pretty eyes, but I know you're wrong

[Verse 2]
And don't call it a spade if it isn't a spade
Go lie on the floor if you want
The first bit of advice that you gave me that I liked was "They're too strong, too strong"
Get in the shower if it all goes wrong

[Chorus]
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is

[Verse 3]
Yeah, counting cards was the best job he ever had
Cleaning up
He got good with his fours and his twos
Community service was the best job he ever had
Cleaning up
He got sick on the floor and his shoes

[Bridge]
Oh, and she said "It's your birthday, are you feeling alright?"
The next one's the MD, you'll be feeling just fine
Your brother is just sat there, you said you felt snide
You hope that, that the boy will be alright

[Chorus]
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is

[Bridge]
Yeah, well, she said "It's your birthday, are you feeling alright?"
The next one's the MD, you'll be feeling just fine
Your brother is just sat there, you said that you felt snide
You hope that, that the boy will be alright

[Chorus]
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is

[Verse 1]
And I swear there's a ghost on this island
And his hands, all covered in blood
And my wife inquired of understanding
But of course, my dear, you can't
She said, "How can I relate to somebody who doesn't speak?
I feel like I'm just treading water"

[Chorus]
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?

[Verse 2]
Well he comes and he goes, so capricious
And his work appears so rushed
Well I love the house that we live in
And I love you all too much

[Chorus]
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?
Well the criminals and liars
Keep them in your cells as a privilege of mine
And I love the house that we live in
And I love you all too much

[Bridge]
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands

[Break]
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off
She mistakes my name
I see the light come around
Strange as it seems
I'm bursting at the seams
And oh, I've got a woman now

Her wallet photos don't turn me on
I feel her hand come around
And her stone-wash denim jeans are darker than they seem
And oh, I've got a woman now

She said, "My name is Eileen, boy that's all you need
Oh, and this one's on the house, I don't mind"

It all tastes the same
And boy, there's something different about your mouth
And you try chasing dreams, man, it's harder than it seems
And oh, I've got a woman now
And oh, I've got a woman now

[Verse 1]
In jeans so new
"We should eat one before 2"
Man, I'm so high
I think I love you

[Verse 2]
And I was thinking 'bout leaving again
It all depends, are we just friends?
And can you leave a little bit of your K?
For you, babe, it's anobrain

[Outro]
We take your mum's car to the edge of the town
And we drive, yeah, we go 'round and 'round

[Verse 1]
Keep your voice down
And stop looking at my friends
Blow out
They can hear exactly what you say

[Pre-Chorus]
Drink, fall, spew
Telephone you
If you're alone in your room
What's that boy doing?

[Chorus]
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending

[Verse 2]
Can we go now?
Not staying 'til the end
Fall down
Write another song about your friends
Locking me in, knocking me out
Talking like you do
And if you think you're helping me
I don't think I'm helping you

[Pre-Chorus]
Drink, fall, spew
Telephone you
If you're alone in your room
What's that boy doing?

[Chorus]
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending

So I gave her the super meat cause I'm superman

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
The skin that you're in is all soft now
And your bones are dry as ice
What you sitting 'round here for, and why you sad?
'Cause everybody's pushing out babies now

[Interlude]
In the mornings, I was getting high with you
In the mornings, I was getting high with you

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's pushing
(What you sitting 'round here for, and why is that?)
'Cause everybody is pushing
'Cause everybody is pushing

[Outro]
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now, dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now, dead now, dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now, dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now, dead now, dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now

[Verse 1]
Twist around the lounge
Sun drowns the house
Stick another pill in my head and go to bed
We're not doing it again so leave it

[Chorus]
I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

[Verse 2]
Bombs have run out
Call 'round the town
"I could hear you giving her head," she said
You think we're doing it again? Keep dreaming

[Chorus]
I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

[Verse 1]
And this is how it starts:
You take your shoes off in the back of my van
Yeah, my shirt looks so good
When it's just hanging off your back
And she said, "Use your hands and my spare time
We've got one thing in common, it's this tongue of mine"
She said, oh
She's got a boyfriend anyway

[Verse 2]
There's only minutes before I drop you off
All we seem to do is talk about sex
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
I loved your friend when I saw his film
He's got a funny face, but I like that 'cause he still looks cool
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

[Bridge]
Now we're on the bed in my room
And I'm about to fill his shoes
But you say no, you say no
Does he take care of you?
Or could I easily fill his shoes?
But you say no, you say no

[Verse 3]
Now we're just outside of town
And you're making your way down
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
And I'm not trying to stop you, love
If we're gonna do anything we might as well just fuck
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

[Outro]
You've got your tongue pierced anyway
You in your high tops any day
You in your skinny jeans anyway
You and your fit friends anyway
I'd take them all out any day
They've all got backcombs anyway
You all got boyfriends anyway

[Verse 1]
And you're a liar
At least all of your friends are
And so am I
Just typically drowned in my car

It's my party
And I'll cry to the end
You must try harder
Than kissing all of my friends, you

[Chorus]
Yeah, it takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you

[Verse 2]
And you're alive
At least as far as I can tell you are
And so am I
You beat me down and then we're back to my car
And it's so ironic
How it's only been a year
And it's not my fault
That I fucked everybody here

[Chorus]
Yeah, it takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you

Yeah, it takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you

[Bridge]
And I say, do you wanna dance? Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna dance in the bar at the back of the hall?
And I say, do you wanna dance? Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna dance, dance in the back of the hall?

[Chorus]
Yeah, it takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you

More, more, more
(Yeah, it takes a bit more)
(Yeah, it takes a bit more)
It takes a bit more
(Yeah, it takes a bit more)
(Yeah, it takes a bit more)
It takes a bit more

[Verse 1]
And then I saw Him in the crowd
A lot of people had gathered 'round Him
The beggars shouted, the lepers called Him
The old man said nothing
He just stared about Him

[Chorus]
All going down
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down
To see the Lord Jesus (going down)
All going down

[Verse 2]
Then came a man before his feet he fell
Unclean, said the leper and rang his bell
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head
Go now, go now
You're a new man instead

[Chorus]
All going down
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down
To see the Lord Jesus (right)
All going down

[Verse 3]
It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star, took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was a leader of man

[Chorus]
All going down
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down (going down to Bethlehem)
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down

[Guitar Solo]

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star, took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was a leader of man, that's right

[Outro]
All going down
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down

[Part I]

[Verse 1]
When I got on stage, she swore I was six feet tall
But when she put it in her mouth
She can't seem to reach my
Ballin' ain't an issue for me
I'll make a hundred stacks right back next week
Do it all again, I'm faded off the wrong thing, the wrong thing
And I'll admit, baby, I'm a little camera-shy
But exceptions can be made, baby, ‘cause you're too damn fly
For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show
'Cause if you're back here only takin' pictures
You gon' have to take your ass home

[Bridge]
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk

[Hook]
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Don’t hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Don’t hold back

[Verse 2]
You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free
You gotta pay with your body
Not really into kisses leading into nothing
I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right
I might fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you to my West Coast girl
Until they book a show in NYC
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep
Woah, I'm tryna finish all this potion
Baby, take your time, tryna sip it 'til the mornin'
And if you're still up, I'm tryna fuck you in the mornin'
Said I'm two days strong
And never sleep until it's mornin', until the mornin'

[Bridge]
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk

[Hook]
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Oh yeah, don’t hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Don’t hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Oh yeah, don’t hold back

[Part II]

[Verse 3]
I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just 12 months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
Goddamn, I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin' to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderall's
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida, 
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep…

[Outro]
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried

[Verse 1]
Watch me, watch me go
Well, I'm struttin' up ever so slow
And now sting me, get in the groove
'Cause they're bangin' on the door
Yes, they're hard and they'll make a move

[Bridge]
We're wakin' up those sleepers
You know we're so mischievous
Just what you'll do to keep us entertained
We're wakin' up those sleepers
You know we're so mischievous
Just what you'll do to keep us entertained

[Chorus]
(Knock, run)
She's got you up and she's run, run, runnin' away
(Knock, run)
You're knockin' first if you think that you're comin' to play
And I don't mind
'Cause all the time you're talkin' at me
No, I don't mind at all

[Verse 2]
Oh, well, cap-guns and polystyrene planes
Well, I'm buyin' penny bubblies with my change
'Cause sting me, get in the groove
'Cause they're bangin' on the door
Yes, they're hard and they'll make a move

[Bridge]
We're wakin' up those sleepers
You know we're so mischievous
Just what you'll do to keep us entertained
Well, now she said she's going
She's got the towel to throw in
Was just about to blow him and ran away

[Chorus]
(Knock, run)
She's got you up and she's run, run, runnin' away
(Knock, run)
You're knockin' first if you think that you're comin' to play
And I don't mind
'Cause all the time you're talkin' at me
No, I don't mind at all

[Verse 1]
Wait for the day you come home from the lonely part
Look for the girl who has put up with all of your shit
You've never needed anyone for so long

[Verse 2]
You learn in your bed
You've been gone for too long
To put in the time
But it's too late to make it strong

[Chorus]
Now all I want is your pity
Or all I want is your bitter tears
Yeah, all I want is your pity
Or at least all I want are your bitter tears
All I want is your pity
Oh all I want are your bitter tears
Yeah, all I want is your pity
Oh all I want are your bitter tears

[Verse 3]
Wake with a start
And the dog and the girl are gone
So you pack up your things
And head into the lame unknown
You never had needed anything for so long

[Chorus]
And now all I want is your pity
And all I want are your bitter tears
Now all I want is your pity
And all I want are your bitter tears

[Outro]
From now on, I'm someone different
'Cause it's no fun to be predictably lame
From now on, let's do it different
'Cause I just want what I want
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home

[Intro]
Tostitos are the shit

[Verse 1]
I'd rather die than be your slave
Slit my wrist wide and take this stage
Wipe blood out my eyes and you just lay there
You think I'm crazy, I am

[Chorus]
I love you like I love Crack-Crack
I do
I love you like I like to get high
I do
I love you like I love Crack-Crack
I do
I love you like I like to get high

[Verse 2]
I'm just a unicorn, come catch me
Strap me in chains until I bleed
You know I like it, that's why I stay here
Why should I fight it?
I won't, I won't

[Chorus]
I love you like I love Crack-Crack
I do
I love you like I like to get high
I do
I love you like I love Crack-Crack
I do
I love you like I like to get high

[Bridge]
Drove in from my small town
Looking for some action
Thought I could curb the crazy
But I can't
I just crave the pain boy
I just love the thrill

[Chorus]
I love you like I love Crack-Crack
I do
I love you like I like to get high
I do
I love you like I love Crack-Crack
I do
I love you like I like to get high

[Outro]
I'd do, for you, anything
I'd do anything
Drunk girls
Drunk girls
Drunk girls
Drunk girls

Drunk girls
Drunk girls cause a couple of heart attacks
Drunk girls
Drunk girls are unusually mild
Drunk boys
Drunk boys keep in pace with the pedophiles
Drunk girls
Drunk girls are boringly wild

Drunk girls
Drunk girls get invitations from nations
Drunk girls
They got the patience of a millions of saints
Drunk boys
They steal, they steal from the cupboards
Drunk girls
Drunk girls like to file complaints
Drunk girls
Drunk girls are like a night of simplicity
Drunk girls
They need a lover who is smarter than me
Well drunk boys
Drunk boys, we walk like pedestrians
Drunk girls
Drunk girls wait an hour to pee

Drunk girls
Drunk girls know that love is an astronaut
Drunk girls
It comes back, but it's never the same
Drunk boys
Drunk boys, drunk boys, drunk boys, drunk boys
(Drunk boys have such beautiful feelings)
Drunk girls
Drunk girls can be just as insane

Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
So oh oh
That means making eyes across the room

Drunk girls
Just 'cause I'm shallow doesn't mean that I'm heartless
Drunk girls
Just 'cause I'm heartless doesn't mean that I'm mean but
Drunk boys
Sometimes love gives us too many options
Drunk girls
Just 'cause you're hungry doesn't mean that you're lean
Drunk girls
I've heard lies that could curdle your heartstrings
Drunk girls
A couple truths, maybe burn out your eyes but
Drunk boys
Drunk boys leave their irons in the fireplace
Drunk girls
'Cause drunk girls give them too many tries

Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls
Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls
Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls
Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk

Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
Oh oh oh
I believe I'm waking up, but no promises
No oh oh
I believe in waiting out the weather
Oh oh oh
I believe in making eyes across the room
(The day becomes the night)
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
(The day becomes the night)
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
(The day becomes the night)
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
(The day becomes the night)
But still, be honest with me, honestly, honestly
Unless it hurts my feelings!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Uh

[Verse 1]
I don't think that we will be pleased with this
We have waited for a long time
I recall the promises made to us
We've been patient for a long time

[Chorus]
One touch is never enough
You gave the opening, opening
One touch is never enough
People who need people, to the back of the bus

[Verse 2]
I don't see how we could be pleased with this
We've been waiting for a long time
I recall the promises made to us
We've been patient such a long time

[Bridge]
No one is dangerous
We are not dangerous
Unless we get a closer view

[Chorus]
One touch is never enough
People need to move to the back of the bus
One touch is never enough
Complicated people never do what you tell them to

One touch is never enough
People will be pushed in the back of the bus
One touch is never enough
People who need people
Are just people who need people

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
People who need people
Are just people who need people

[Verse 3]
I don't think that we will be pleased with this
We have waited such a long time
There's no way that we can be pleased with this
We've been waiting such a long time

[Verse 4]
We've been waiting such a long time
We've been waiting such a long time
This is getting sort of unreasonable
But we will wait a very long time

[Chorus]
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
People who need people, to the back of the bus

[Outro]
No one is dangerous
No one is dangerous
Until we get a closer view

[Verse 1]
You wanted a hit
But maybe we don't do hits
I try and try
It ends up feeling kind of wrong

You wanted it tough
But is it ever tough enough?
No, nothing's ever tough enough
Until we hit the road

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you wanted it lush
But honestly, you must hush
No, honestly, you know too much
So leave us, leave us on our own

And so you wanted a hit
Well this is how we do hits
You wanted a hit
But that's not what we do

[Verse 3]
You wanted it real
But can you tell me what's real?
There's lights and sounds and stories
Music's just a part

Yeah, you wanted the truth
And then you said you want proof
I guess you're used to liars
Saying what they want

[Chorus]
And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies 'til you take us home
No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies 'til you take us home

[Verse 4]
Yeah you wanted it smart
But honestly, I'm not smart
No, honestly, we're never smart
We fake it, fake it all the time

Yeah you wanted the time
But maybe I can't do time
Oh we both know that's an awful line
But it doesn't make it wrong

[Verse 5]
You wanted it right
No out of mine and out of sight
No dirty bus and early flight
No seven days and forty nights

Yeah you wanted a hit
But tell me, where's the point in it?
You wanted a hit
But that's not what we do

[Chorus]
And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies 'til you take us home
No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies 'til you take us home

[Chorus]
And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies 'til you take us home
No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies 'til you take us home
From this position
I will relax
From this position
I can see the whole place

From this position
Oh, oh just relax
From this position
I make some stand
I make my peace with the man

And it goes pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow

From this position
I can see both of them
From this position
I totally get how the decision was reached
From this position
I can say "serious," or "cop-out," or "hard to define"
From this position, from this position
It's kind of like eating myself to death

With you on the outside
And me on the inside
There's advantages to both
(Advantages to both!)

And me being uptight
And you being all right
There's advantages to each
(Advantages! Advantages!)

From this perspective, from this position
I have a good grip on both of them
Because I have stayed home
And have learned a little more about my neighbourhood
Which is important
You know, there's a lot of good places to eat

So it goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
So it's pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow

With you on the keystroke
And me on the gangplank
There's advantages to both
(Advantages to both)

And you have been all right
And I have been filmed being ridiculous
Oh, eat it, Michael Musto
(You're no Bruce Vilanch!)

Now I have been untied
And you are all cross-eyed
There's advantages to each
(Advantages to each)

And I'm coming back, coming back, coming back
Until there's nothing left in the well
Is that what they call it, the well?
I'm paralyzed
And looking through you
But if nothing's right
We try anyway

As a compromised, aggregate person
I'm amazed at my decision to play

On this occasion, there are a couple of things that we know that we pulled from Fact Magazine
One, the king wears a king hat and lives in a king house
Two, your time will come, but tonight is our night
So you should give us all of your drugs
Three, we have a black president and you do not, so shut up, because you don't know shit about where I'm from that you didn't get from TV

So times have been tough
And times have been tough
You have been put down, washed up, and rinsed out
But honestly
And be honest with yourself
How much time do you waste?
How much time do you blow every day?

And so it's pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Oh, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow

So pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
(The return of the police!)
(The return of the police)

With you on the inside
And me on the outside
There's advantages to both
(Advantages to both!)

With me being wired
And you being tired
There's advantages to each
(Advantages! Advantages!)

From this position
I feel an affinity for the both of them, which is confusing
But honestly
I should be careful because otherwise, I'm being, I'm being, you know, what's it called?
Oh, fuck it

Reclining, I'm getting used to it
Like kissing under a bridge
It's an entirely new
Discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery

And then a couple of weeks at home
And then a couple of weeks away
And then home and away, again
To use up your desire for
Discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery

For an instant
You could have pushed through
But it's a plagiarized
Regret anyway
But what you want for now
Is someone to feel you
And that's the thing you like
Is planning to stay

And all this time
It's so nice
It's so nice
It's so nice

(The return of the police!)
Somebody's calling me to be my girl
Somebody's calling me to be my girl
But my hands don't work; they're more like feet
And the wake-up call, "go back to sleep"

Babe, come with me
And I'll take you to the place I sleep
Oh, darling, come with me
And I'll show you the place I sleep

Somebody's phoning me to be my girl
Somebody's phoning me to be my girl
But the phone won't ring when I'm on the street
And the heart won't beat when I'm half asleep

Somebody's texting me to be my girl
Constantly texting me to be my girl
But the text won't take away nights that creep
And my mouth won't move when I'm in too deep

Babe, come with me
And I'll take you to the place I sleep
Oh, darling, come with me
And I'll show you the place I sleep
All right

Somebody's calling me into their work
Wrapped up and full of good inside their work
But the car won't start when I'm half asleep
And the kids don't cry when you're on your feet

Babe, come with me
And I'll show you the place I sleep
Oh, darling, come with me
And I'll take you to the place I live
The place I live
The place I live
The place I live
The places where I live
Home
Home
Home
Home
Home
Home
Take me home

Just do it right
Make it perfect and real
Because it's everything
Though everything was never the deal

So grab your things and stumble into the night
So we can shut the door
And shut the door on terrible times, oh

Yeah, do it right
And head again into space
So you can carry on
And carry on, and fall all over the place
This is the trick, forget a terrible year
That we can break the laws
Until it gets weird

And this is what you waited for
But under lights, we're all unsure
And so tell me
What would make you feel better?

As night has such a local ring
And love and rock are fickle things
And you know it
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Take it

Forget your past
This is your last chance now
And we can break the rules
Like nothing will last

You might forget
Forget the sound of a voice
Still,​ you should not forget
Yeah, don't forget
The things that we laughed about
And after rolling on the floor
And thankfully, a few make sure that you get home
And you stay home
And you're better

'Cause you're afraid of what you need
Yeah, you're afraid of what you need
If you weren't, if you weren't
I don't know what we'd talk about

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh

Yeah, no one ever knows what you're talking about
So I guess you're already there
No one opens up when you scream and shout
But it's time to make a couple things clear

If you're afraid of what you need
If you're afraid of what you need
Look around you, you're surrounded
It won't get any better

And so, goodnight

[Chorus]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Everybody dance
Screaming on the dance
Everybody dance
Screaming on the dance
Everybody dance
Screaming on the dance
Everybody dance, well baby

[Chorus]

Everybody dance
Screaming on the dance
Everybody dance
Screaming on the dance

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Well baby
Everybody dance
Screaming on the dance
Everybody dance
Screaming on the dance

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeezy season approachin'
Fuck whatever y'all been hearin'
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearin'
A monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinson's
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggas off than Cochran, hah!

[Chorus: Kanye West]
On sight, on sight

[Bridge: Kanye West]
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now 'fore you give it up
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now 'fore you give it up

[Interlude: Holy Name of Mary Choral Family]
Oh, he'll give us what we need
It may not be what we want

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Baby girl tryna get a nut
And her girl tryna give it up
Chopped 'em both down
Don't judge 'em, Joe Brown
One last announcement
No sports bra, let's keep it bouncin'
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the 'Bleau, she tried to sip the fountain
That's when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth

[Chorus: Kanye West]
On sight, on sight

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh

[Outro]
Right now
I need right now
Right now
I need, I need right now
Right now
I need, I need right now

[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

[Refrain: Kanye West]
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwin' contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw on some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See, they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See, that's that privately owned prison
Get your peace today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?

[Bridge]
Nothing bad, nothing bad, noth-
Noth-Noth-, -ing bad, noth-noth-
Bad, nothing bad, nothing

[Outro: Kanye West, Frank Ocean & Kóbor János]
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
'Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
Too high again, too high, ooh hoo-hoo-hoo, woo
Yeah, h-h-h-high, h-high-high, high-high high-igh-high-high
H-high-igh, yeah, high, high-igh
Egyszer a Nap úgy elfáradt (mhm-igh)
Elaludt mély zöld tó ölén
Az embereknek fájt a sötét
Ő megsajnált, eljött közénk

[Verse 1]
I want to
I want to be someone else or I'll explode
Floating upon the surface for
The birds, the birds
The birds

[Verse 2]
You want me?
Fuckin' well come and find me
I'll be waiting
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches
And nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing

[Verse 3]
You want me?
Well, come on and break the door down
You want me?
Fuckin' come on and break the door down
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I apologize for waiting to tell you for so long
I am not human
I am made of bacon, fairy tales, pixie dust, I don't feel
I hung myself and didn't die
I'm omnipotent, I'm alive
Not real, I'm alive

You leave me careless, I like it
I like it

[Hook]
Caught up in the blast
Caught up in the action
Caught up in the bursting flame
There's comfort in dying
There's comfort in burning

Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn, burn

[Verse 2]
Doubt I'll ever be anyone's baby
Living as a unicorn gets so lonely
I have no answers
I have No questions
Stuck in your tandem
Heat that's worth standing
I like it

[Hook]
Caught up in the blast
Caught up in the action
Caught up in the bursting flame
There's comfort in dying
There's comfort in burning

I can feel the accidents happening slowly
Falling for the rapture ever so boldly
I will go willingly
You don't have to kidnap
I'd like to be kidnapped
You leave me careless, I like it
I like it

Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn, burn

[Outro]
Doubt I'll ever be anyone's baby
As I was walking round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try

She had rings on her fingers and
Bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was
Into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls

In the thick of the evening
When the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches and
Was closing the door
I had one of those flashes:
I'd been there before
Been there before
I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

Well, there ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a
Touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with
The look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by

The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Verse 1]
What you do to me is indescribable
Got me sparkling just like an emerald
Set my soul on fire and make me wild
Like the deep blue sea
No other boy ever made me feel beautiful
When I'm in your arms, feel like I have it all
Is it your tattoos or golden grill
That makes me feel this way?

[Chorus]
Got me spinnin' like a ballerina
Feelin' gangsta every time I see ya
You're the king and, baby, I'm the queen of
Disaster, disaster
Got me spinnin' like a ballerina
You're the bad boy that I always dreamed of
You're the king and, baby, I'm the queen of
Disaster, disaster

[Verse 2]
Got mascara thick, I get emotional
You know, I was more than just a party girl
Isn't hard to see what's going on
I'm so far gone (Mmm, so far gone)
When I saw your face, it was incredible
Painted on my soul, it was indelible ('Cause you're the one)
Let's celebrate our twisted fate
We're the broken ones

[Chorus]
Got me spinnin' like a ballerina
Feelin' gangsta every time I see ya
You're the king and, baby, I'm the queen of
Disaster, disaster
You got me spinnin' like a ballerina
You're the bad boy that I always dreamed of
You're the king and baby, I'm the queen of
Disaster, disaster

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen
For the very first time!

[Chorus]
You got me spinnin' like a ballerina
Feelin' gangsta every time I see ya
You're the king and, baby, I'm the queen of
Disaster (Disaster), disaster (Disaster)
You got me spinnin' like a ballerina
You're the bad boy that I always dreamed of
You're the king and I'm the beauty queen of
Disaster, disaster

This shit right here is strictly for my niggas ridin' down Glenwood
(DJ Scream. Hood rich beeotch.)
My niggas on Mooreland Ave. Boulder Cris
You got six 12's in the trunk nigga this shit for you
Let's go. (Hood rich hoe)

[Hook]
Well baby girl was lookin' at my ride
So I guess I'm a have to put her up inside
She was with you first now she's sittin' by my side
This is what happens every time I drive by
When I'm in that double bubble
They give me double bubble
When I'm in that double bubble
They give me double bubble
Yeah

[Verse One]
They see my whip and be like, "That's a mean motherfucker"
Smothered in cream, make her melt like butter
But I don't speak, I throw up the Eastside that mean "What up? "
Come in LZ, so put your system on 'Shut Up'
I hit the scene, real clean like scrub dum dum
They can't compete, they speakers bust the fuck
My kick got beat, they kicks be scuffed up
They beat, just fluff fluff
They weak and scrubbed up
They be like, "Who that is? Can you turn that down? "
Cause they say I got too many 15's in my ride
And the Alpine is vibratin' they booty, chest and thighs
So girls be gettin' juicy wet when they get inside

[Hook]
I got that high

Okay, alright, yeaaaah yeaah let's go yeah
Ah haa haa ah

[Hook]
I think I'm trippin'
Trippin' trippin' to the floor (that's right)
Feelin' different (different different)
Much more different then before
Yeah I'm trippin' (yeah I'm trippin')
From the ceiling to the floor
Feeling different
Cause I'm trippin' to the floor
Trippin' to the floor
Trippin' to the flo

[Verse One]
Started with no books and pages
Just to get out of the hood I was raised in
Cause see the hood ain't no location
The hood is simply where you place me
See now when I look at faces
I give a dap and a good vibration
Cause there is no reason you should be faithless
Cause look how far a hook can take you
From up here earth looks amazing
That's why I'm invading human races
And there is no reason to debate it
I am the universe and you're crazy
Now let's take a new vacation
I was thinking Jupiter, Pluto maybe
See I ain't crazy
I am just trying to wake up and I ain't patient

[Hook]

[Intro] 

[B.O.B talking]:
Don't be afraid, when I die. Because...

[Hook]:
I'm already gone
I'm already way way way up there
I'm already gone
I'm already gone as I'm way up there
I'm all alone
I'm all alone
I'm all alone
I'm all alone as I'm way up there
I'm already gone

[Verse One]
I think I need to have somebody come and tell me I'm not as crazy
As much as I may be (may be?)
Maybe, things were better when I was just a baby (baby?)
Cause baby, ha
Ignorance is bliss, the older I get, I guess I get too curious
Lookin' on the Internet for interestin' shit that just way too serious

[Bridge]
Somewhere along the way
I done went way too far in space
And I guess, can't nobody see me here, cause I'm too far away
I said, somewhere along the way
I done went way too far in space
And I guess, can't nobody see me here, cause I'm too far away

[Hook]

[Verse Two]:
Some people don't ask why (nah)
But...I ask why, I ask why (why?)
And half the time I try to act right, so I don't catch a bad vibe (nah)
Up in the sky like an aeroplane (pwwwwn)
But no I ain't talkin' 'bout Mary Jane (nah)
And yes, there's only a few people that know what I mean when I say I'm everythang (ha)

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
You're just a city in the state of mind
And the streets so cold they are
To get to you up in space and time
Yeah across these stars for you
You're just a picture in my frame of mind
Hanging on these lonely walls inside
To feel and get around way of crime
But they'll never take me alive

[Hook]
Cause we thieves
Don't die
We thieves don't die
Cause we thieves don't die
But we leave behind-hind-hind-hind-hind

[Verse 2]
You're just a city in the state of mind
And the streets so hard they are
To get to you up in space and time
And the Universe are a call
You're just a picture in my frames of mind
But they're falling down to the floor
To feel and get around a way of crime
But they'll never take me alive

[Hook]
Cause we thieves
Don't die
We thieves don't die
Cause we thieves don't die
But we leave behind-hind-hind-hind-hind

[Verse 3]
You're just a city in the state of mind
And the streets so cold they are
To get to you up in space and time
And the Universe are a call
You're just a picture in my frame of mind
Hanging on these lonely walls inside
Feel and get around a way of crime and they'll never take me alive!

[Hook:Extended]
Cause we thieves don't die!

Cause we thieves don't die
We thieves don't die
We thieves don't die

Believe in mine
We lie, we lie down
With a picture on the floor
Believe in mine
We thieves don't die
We thieves don't die
We leave behind
Believe in mine
Believe in mine

[Verse 1]
I been waiting so long (Been waiting)
To have you by my side (Tell you, "I love you")
I, I can't do no wrong (No, you are an angel)
With you by my side, you are my...

[Chorus]
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)

[Post-Chorus 1]
And when you look in my eyes
The pain goes a-way
Euphoria (Euphoria)

[Verse 2]
You feel so damn good (I want you to know that)
Just come take my hand (Closer) (So hear me out)
And we could go to the moon
Look in my eyes as we land (Here now)

[Chorus]
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus 2]
And when you lay in my arms
The pain goes a-way

[Chorus]
Euphoria (Euphoria), euphoria
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Euphoria (Euphoria), euphoria
Euphoria
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

[Post-Chorus 3]
Euphoria, euphoria
And when you're mine, I won't let you go
The pain, it can't stay
Euphoria

[Outro]
Euphoria (Euphoria)

[Intro]
Can you turn the beat up?
A little louder
There you go

[Verse 1]
People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinkin' 'bout her all the time
I never seen somebody put together perfectly
What would I have to do to call you mine?
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes, or you can walk in blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

[Chorus]
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear-view
Let's leave it all in the rear-view, girl
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry

[Verse 2]
Mend a broken heart, girl, if you can
I don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
That responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm havin' some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shootin' stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did, I think I'm still myself

[Chorus]
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear-view
Let's leave it all in the rear-view, girl
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry

[Verse 1]
For my theme song (Black)
My leather black jeans on (Black)
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on (Black)
Enter the kingdom (Black)
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in (Black)
Came to see me in my black skin (Black)
Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin' (Black)
If I don't get ran out by Catholics (Black)
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq, bitch

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Refrain]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (Down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (Now)
But there's nowhere to go (Now)
And there's no way to slow (Down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Verse 2]
Stop all that coon shit (Black)
Early morning cartoon shit (Black)
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb, bitch (Black)
Black out the room, bitch (Black)
Stop all that coon shit (Black)
These niggas ain't doin' shit (Black)
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on, homie, what happened?
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready—ready for action—action

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Refrain]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (Down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (Now)
But there's nowhere to go (Now)
And there's no way to slow (Down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
It's that nigga you've been waiting on
Trynna get more information conversating debating and hating on
I need some pussy that I can take out my frustration's on
Or on a yacht so i can take bad bitches and take a vacation onnnnnnn

[Hook]
I'm faded, I'm smashed
I'm spending all this cash
Got bout five racks in my pocket
I don't really know how long it's gone last
Pour that drink all up in that cup
Throw all that stank in a blunt
Grab that chick with that butt
And guess what? I don't really give a fuck

[Verse 2]
Life is a puzzle that I'm trying to get together
Everyday trynna figure out what two women I can fit together
Ding ding let me get inside the ring because I think I got the prefect match
Don't be nervous come on outcha shell lets wait for the birds to hatch
Shoe fly shoe bitch now it's time for the birds to fly
Meanwhile this purple haze created a little purple sky
If you smoke that dirt don't be jealous of my maryjane
8 albums in motherfucker ain't a damn thing changed

[Hook]
I'm faded, I'm smashed
I'm spending all this cash
Got bout five racks in my pocket
I don't really know how long it's gone last
Pour that drink all up in that cup
Throw all that stank in that blunt
Grab that chick with that butt
And guess what? I don't really give a fuck

[Verse 3]
I done got rich and lost my damn mind
Plaques to plaques got a nigga celebrating all the damn time
LUDA!
Quit fooling around and get some work done
Naw, I'd rather go to magic and see a bitch work some
I think, I think I deserve it I'm in that guinness boook
Rappers throwing socks I throw them right back
Still got these nigga's shoooook
People see me in the movies and they think I went Hollywooood
Only difference is I'm popping a molly with a bunch of molly's and popping a molly is gooood
It does I mean it really does
Was that Luda in a Lamborghini, I mean it really was
Hurry up and get a picture on ya iPhone
Then turn around, bend over and let me get one on my phone
I got it, Im'a save the filter and send it off
Haters throw dirt I'm just so clean and a nigga just rinse em off
Since 99 I've been in go mode
And every time I see your bitch in the club she being ho mode
I press a button and the whole damn crib just going ho mode
And the crib dim the candles get lit and I pour some fucking drinks
Hey did Luda really fuck yo girl?
What the fuck yo thank!

[Hook]
I'm faded, I'm smashed

Body like a 'rari

And she know that she bad, she bad
Baby, I'm sorry, if I make you scream, oh

I'm about to go deep, both feet, more sheets, more squeaks
Neighbors calling the police, now I gotta fuck her on the low key
I'm her homie, but she lonely and she calling me up
So I gotta give it to her good, but first I'ma tease her
Girl, I know just what you want

[Verse 3]
Yeah, nigga we on, fly by night

South of France on a boat, swimmin' on the coast
Take the elevator to the helicopter

White linen, with white women and light women
Complementin' my clothes to let me know that I'm winnin'
One milli a show and I'ma collect interest

[Intro]
Ha, look

[Verse 1]
O-O-Okay, now usually I don't do this, but your ass, got me turnt up
Poppin' all that pussy, booty bouncin', I got a ounce, roll up
Wanna see you get loose, take my credit card, that's my account
Lamborghini's on me, just so I can see the bitch ride around
Everythin' I go, all the Ace in the air, better hide these hoes
I do it like a show, about a hour 45 and I'm out the door
I'm fly as hell with my clientèle, my pockets swole
Got guns for them niggas, roses for them bitches, make a nigga Rock 'n' Roll
I'ma hold my set up, elevate like nigga do better
But if one night, I gotta take life
You gon' see the residue from my Baretta
I got way too many bitches on me for me to be lonely
To worry about a bitch that might be fuckin' a homie
Low key, never that, I put up a .40
Back up motherfucker, don’t act like you know me
I be in that trap, when a nigga was 13, I did that
Saw them Jordan 13’s, sold a ounce, nigga, I'm gon' get that
Got that hunger for that pussy, I'm up in there, that cloud nine
Smoking' on my shit, now she feelin' like she in mile high

[Chorus]
Feel that, won't you feel that?
Murder, murder, girl, I'm gon' kill that
Throw it in the air, where you live at?
If I get it tonight, you bringin' that shit back

[Verse 2]
Y-Y-You never gon' get it like this, never gon', never gon' get it like this
I got a buzz, you fucked up, playin' that future, light years
In V.I.P. put your purse right here, ass and your glass up, let's cheer
And this party never stop until I fuck every girl in here
O-O-Okay, I'm 23 tryna get billions, V.A. nigga on a stage and a nigga paid
Nigga, better pay me millions, every time that I hit it and I blaze on a winter day
What you mean I'm hoggin'? I'm ballin' hard, you other niggas in the lane
Tryna violate, 3 seconds in the paint, 23 I'm MJ
Too much, I got, fuck nigga, that’s your problem
Open her mouth up, open her mouth up, give me the bottle
Oh shit, your bitch, she about to swallow
You smokin' weed while I'm pilled up, takin' two L's, Apollo
You gon' try to call her tomorrow, that number change, that’s my bitch
You cryin' about it, unfollow, direct message to my dick
'Cause you never gon' do it like this, never gon', never gon' do it like this
I was singin' as a kid but now I'm 23 with a clip, DJ better play my shit

[Chorus]
Feel that, won't you feel that?
Murder, murder, girl, I'm gon' kill that (Yeah)
Throw it in the air, where you live at? (Haha)
If I get it tonight, you bringin' that shit back

[Verse 3]
O-O-Okay now this is for my homies (Homies), them niggas that never really had shit (Yeah)
Now everythin' I'm ownin' (Ownin'), 10 million sold, that’s a bad bitch (Bitch!)
Red chucks and that Cali life (Haha), my niggas ridin' for me
Ratatatata, all them hoes singin' jeep cherokee
And your bitch about to roll out, straight to the house
Fuck on the couch, touchin' my dick, girl, it's a pull-out
Poppin' a molly, fuckin' with bitches that fool around
Smokin' that good, we start fuckin', I put it down
So baby, what’s the hold up?
I'ma turn you on but let's turnl it like that
I know you feel that, feel that, feel that shit right now

[Chorus]
Feel that, won't you feel that?
Murder, murder, girl, I'm gon' kill that
Throw it in the air, where you live at?
If I get it tonight, you bringin' that shit back

[Verse 1]
Darlin’, tell me something I don’t know
Be my baby, be my GTO
Call me something no one else calls me
I forget how I want it, that electricity

[Chorus]
Well, my heart was breaking and got left unlocked
Didn’t see you sneak in, but I’m glad you stopped
Tell me something I don’t already know
Like how'd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity?

[Verse 2]
Love like locked horns, love like dominos
Be my midnight, be my ebb and flow
I forget how I want it, how it crept up on me
It takes over, electricity

[Chorus]
And my heart was breaking and got left unlocked
Didn’t see you sneak in, but I’m glad you stopped
Tell me something I don’t already know
Like how'd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity?

[Bridge]
Separated, there I face it
Love like thunder, love like falling snow

[Chorus]
Tell me something I don’t already know
Like how'd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity?

[Chorus]
What's wrong with the world today?
Things just gotta get better
Sure ain't what the leaders say
Maybe we should write a letter

[Verse 1]
Say dear Mr. Man
We don't understand
Why poor people keep struggling
But you don't lend a helping hand

Matthew 5:5 say
The meek shall inherit the earth
We wanna be down that way
But you been tripping since the day of your birth

Who said
That to kill is a sin
Then started every single war
That your people been in?
Who said that water
Is a precious commodity
Then dropped a big old black oil slick
In the deep blue sea?

Who told me, Mr. Man
That working 'round the clock
Would buy me a big house in the 'hood
With cigarette ads on every block

Who told me Mr. Man
That I got a right to moan?
How 'bout this big old hole
In the ozone?

[Chorus]
What's wrong with the world today
Things just got to get better
Dear Mr. Man, we don't understand
Maybe we should write a letter

[Verse 2]
Listen, ain't no sense in voting
Same song with a different name
Might not be in the back of the bus
But it sure feels just the same
Ain't nothing fair about welfare
Ain't no assistance in AIDS
Ain't nothing affirmative about your actions
Till the people get paid

You're thousand years are up
Now you gotta share the land
Section one, the fourteenth Amendment says:
No state shall deprive any person

Of life, liberty, or property
Without due process of law, Mr. Man
We want to end this letter with three words
"We tired  of y'all!"

Tired, tired
So tired
Mr. Man

[Spoken Intro]
One, two, three, four! (Roll that faster, man)
One, two, three, four!
(Oh, we gotta time that
The whole point of a count is that it's in time, innit?)
One, two, three, four!

[Verse 1]
Well, I watch you tangle every weekend
It might start different but it ends up the same
One minute, you're casually speaking
The next it all goes up and you pour fuel on the flame
With your jerrycan of words and tones

[Pre-Chorus]
And no one's gonna start a revolution
So we best leave it well alone
And there's something that Frankie used to say
Apparently

[Chorus]
Oh, he said, settle for the draw
Well, you're not gonna get no more
So you should settle for a draw
I told you once I'm sure, I told you once I'm sure
You should settle for a draw
Why don't you settle for a draw?

[Verse 2]
Well, you're right, it is one set of rules for her
And then another set for you
But that's just the way it is, I suppose
And there's nowt you can do
And let's not fall in the trap of answering back
I am just a beginner but she'll be the only winner
That's for sure, so take the draw, if it's available
And if it sets on fire
Don't get out your jerrycan of words and... tones

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
And no one's gonna start a revolution
So we best leave it well alone
And there's something that Frankie used to say
Apparently

[Chorus]
Oh, he said, settle for the draw
Well, you're not gonna get no more
So you should settle for the draw
I told you once I'm sure, I told you once I'm sure
You should settle for the draw
Why don't you settle for the draw?

[Intro]
Yeah, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Lord, know some hoes from the past
Like, "Damn Cole, wish I knew that you would be rich"
Well, shoulda asked
It's funny how these niggas on some real "be cool with me" shit
I bag two bitches like it's two of me, bitch
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Finally got my own bedroom in this bitch
No more sleeping in my brother room
Like, "Man, I might as well be sleeping in my mother room"
'Cause how I'm supposed to sneak hoes with my bro here?
Plus she gon' find out I been rocking all his old gear
This his flow here, this is no fair, this is so pure
This is so clear, this is one breath, this is no air
Ain't no wedding but I do the most here
I'm the President, you the co-chair
You the player, yeah, I'm the coach here, nigga, I coast here
This weather got me set up on this West Coast, yeah
Avoidin' the snakes, AKs, and coke, yeah
Get my dick wet, but I never let it soak there
Man, I been thinkin' 'bout movin' out
What? Country boy in the city
Of New York nine years, ran that shit like Diddy
Riding through South Side Queens like Fiddy

[Chorus]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes 'cause they watching you"
I told her, "Awww baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You 'bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop, drop)

[Verse 2]
Now if you only had one wish is it devious?
'Cause you already know who your genie is
Ain't get a cover now your mag on my penis
Like damn, he turned out to be a genius
Damn, real shit nigga, no Pixar
You niggas soft like Meagan Good's lips are
My kicks hard, my whip hard
I came out the womb with my dick hard
Back when I was playing Stomp the Yard
It'd be a bunch of niggas up on campus talking hard
Don't get exposed to these hoes boy, knock it off
I seen your mama in the Benz when she dropped you off
Damn, now who more thorough than me?
I paint a picture of my pain for the world to see
Could paint a picture of the game but my girl would see
Gotta ask myself, "What mean the world to me?"
Me, me

[Chorus]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes 'cause they watching you"
I told her, "Aw baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop
Hey make that ass drop
Make that ass drop

[Interlude]
Make, hey, make that ass drop (Drop)
Hey, you seen me in this every damn day (Drop)
It got the dick hard as a rock (Drop)
And I can't control (Let it ride)
Hehe, control

[Verse 3]
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street wit'
Yeah
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street wit'
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah, back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush, but I still stopped to holla, shit
That's the least I owed her 'cause see I tried to hit
On the first night, and nah, I ain't proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it, huh
And I never called back, how thoughtfulless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist, nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit, my prerogative, nigga
Is to hit and never commit
Not realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call, she was hurtin'
Now she's staring dead in my face, she was smirking
Like, "Yeah, I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga
You ain't worth shit, nigga"

[Outro]
Hm, this the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with

[Verse 1]
I'm traveling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some café
A defector from the petty wars
That shell shock love away

[Verse 2]
There's comfort in melancholy
When there's no need to explain
It's just as natural as the weather
In this moody sky today

[Verse 3]
In our possessive coupling
So much could not be expressed
So now I'm returning to myself
These things that you and I suppressed

[Verse 4]
I see something of myself in everyone
Just at this moment of the world
As snow gathers like bolts of lace
Waltzing on a ballroom girl

[Verse 5]
You know it never has been easy
Whether you do or you do not resign
Whether you travel the breadth of extremities
Or stick to some straighter line

[Verse 6]
Now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock
They're either going to thaw out or freeze
Listen, strains of Benny Goodman
Coming through the snow and the pinewood trees

[Verse 7]
I'm porous with travel fever
But you know I'm so glad to be on my own
Still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger
Can set up trembling in my bones

[Verse 8]
I know no one's going to show me everything
We all come and go unknown
Each so deep and superficial
Between the forceps and the stone

[Verse 9]
Well I looked at the granite markers
Those tribute to finality to eternity
And then I looked at myself here
Chicken scratching for my immortality

[Verse 10]
In the church they light the candles
And the wax rolls down like tears
There's the hope and the hopelessness
I've witnessed thirty years

[Verse 11]
We're only particles of change I know I know
Orbiting around the sun
But how can I have that point of view
When I'm always bound and tied to someone

[Verse 12]
White flags of winter chimneys
Waving truce against the moon
In the mirrors of a modern bank
From the window of a hotel room

[Verse 13]
I'm traveling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some café
A defector from the petty wars
Until love sucks me back that way

[Verse 1]
No regrets Coyote
We just come from such different sets of circumstance
I'm up all night in the studios
And you're up early on your ranch
You'll be brushing out a broodmare's tail
While the sun is ascending
And I'll just be getting home with my reel-to-reel
There's no comprehending
Just how close to the bone and the skin and the eyes
And the lips you can get
And still feel so alone
And still feel related
Like stations in some relay
You're not a hit and run driver no no
Racing away
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

[Verse 2]
We saw a farmhouse burning down
In the middle of nowhere
In the middle of the night
And we rolled right past that tragedy
Till we turned into some road house lights
Where a local band was playing
Locals were up kicking and shaking on the floor
And the next thing I know
That coyote's at my door
He pins me in a corner and he won't take no
He drags me out on the dance floor
And we're dancing close and slow
Now he's got a woman at home
He's got another woman down the hall
He seems to want me anyway
Why'd you have to get so drunk
And lead me on that way
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

[Verse 3]
I looked a coyote right in the face
On the road to Baljennie near my old home town
He went running thru the whisker wheat
Chasing some prize down
And a hawk was playing with him
Coyote was jumping straight up and making passes
He had those same eyes just like yours
Under your dark glasses
Privately probing the public rooms
And peeking thru keyholes in numbered doors
Where the players lick their wounds
And take their temporary lovers
And their pills and powders to get them thru this passion play
No regrets Coyote
I just get off up aways
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

[Verse 4]
Coyote's in the coffee shop
He's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs
He picks up my scent on his fingers
While he's watching the waitresses' legs
He's too far from the Bay of Fundy
From appaloosas and eagles and tides
And the air conditioned cubicles
And the carbon ribbon rides
Are spelling it out so clear
Either he's going to have to stand and fight
Or take off out of here
I tried to run away myself
To run away and wrestle with my ego
And with this flame
You put here in this Eskimo
In this hitcher
In this prisoner
Of the fine white lines
Of the white lines on the free free way

[Verse 1]
I was driving across the burning desert when I spotted six jet planes
Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain
It was the hexagram of the heavens, it was the strings of my guitar
Amelia,  it was just a false alarm

[Verse 2]
The drone of flying engines is a song so wild and blue
It scrambles time and seasons if it gets thru to you
Then your life becomes a travelogue of picture postcard charms
Amelia, it was just a false alarm

[Verse 3]
People will tell you where they've gone, they'll tell you where to go
But till you get there yourself you never really know
Where some have found their paradise, others just come to harm
Oh Amelia, it was just a false alarm

[Verse 4]
I wish that he was here tonight, it's so hard to obey
His sad request of me to kindly stay away
So this is how I hide the hurt as the road leads cursed and charmed
I tell Amelia it was just a false alarm

[Verse 5]
A ghost of aviation, she was swallowed by the sky
Or by the sea like me she had a dream to fly
Like Icarus ascending on beautiful foolish arms
Amelia, it was just a false alarm

[Verse 6]
Maybe I've never really loved, I guess that is the truth
I've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude
And looking down on everything, I crashed into his arms
Amelia, it was just a false alarm

[Verse 7]
I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel to shower off the dust
And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust
I dreamed of 747s over geometric farms
Dreams Amelia, dreams and false alarms

[Verse 1]
Old Beale Street is coming down
Sweeties' Snack Bar boarded up now
And Egles the Tailor and the Shine Boy's gone
Faded out with ragtime blues
Handy's cast in bronze
And he's standing in a little park with his trumpet in his hand
Like he's listening back to the good old bands
And the click of high heeled shoes

[Chorus 1]
Old Furry sings the blues
Propped up in his bed with his dentures and his leg removed
And Ginny's there for her kindness and Furry's beer
She's the old man's angel overseer

[Verse 2]
Pawn shops glitter like gold tooth caps
In the grey decay
They chew the last few dollars off old Beale Street's carcass
Carrion and mercy
Blue and silver sparkling drums
Cheap guitars eye shades and guns
Aimed at the hot blood of being no one
Down and out in Memphis Tennessee

[Chorus 2]
Old Furry sings the blues
You bring him smoke and drink and he'll play for you
It's mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel
But there was one song he played I could really feel

[Verse 3]
There's a double bill murder at the New Daisy
The old girl's silent across the street
She's silent waiting for the wrecker's beat
Silent staring at her stolen name
Diamond boys and satin dolls
Bourbon laughter ghosts
History falls to parking lots and shopping malls
As they tear down old Beale Street

[Chorus 3]
Old Furry sings the blues
He points a bony finger at you and says "I don't like you"
Everybody laughs as if it's the old man's standard joke
But it's true, we're only welcome for our drink and smoke

[Verse 4]
W. C. Handy I'm rich and I'm fey
And I'm not familiar with what you played
But I get such strong impressions of your hey day
Looking up and down old Beale Street
Ghosts of the darktown society
Come right out of the bricks at me
Like it's a Saturday night, they're in their finery
Dancing it up and making deals

[Chorus 4]
Furry sings the blues
Why should I expect that old guy to give it to me true
Fallen to hard luck and time and other thieves
While our limo is shining on his shanty street
Old Furry sings the blues

[Verse 1]
A strange boy is weaving a course of grace and havoc
On a yellow skateboard through midday sidewalk traffic
Just when I think he's foolish and childish and I want him to be manly
I catch my fool and my child needing love and understanding

[Chorus 1]
What a strange strange boy
He still lives with his family
Even the war and the navy
Couldn't bring him to maturity

[Verse 2]
He keeps referring back to school days and clinging to his child
Fidgeting and bullied, his crazy wisdom holding onto something wild
He asked me to be patient, well I failed - "Grow up!" I cried
And as the smoke was clearing he said, "give me one good reason why"

[Chorus 2]
What a strange strange boy
He sees the cars as sets of waves
Sequences of mass and space
He sees the damage in my face

[Verse 3]
We got high on travel and we got drunk on alcohol
And on love the strongest poison and medicine of all
See how that feeling comes and goes like the pull of moon on tides
Now I am surf rising, now parched ribs of sand at his side

[Chorus 3]
What a strange strange boy
I gave him clothes and jewelry
I gave him my warm body
I gave him power over me

[Verse 4]
A thousand glass eyes were staring in a cellar full of antique dolls
I found an old piano and sweet chords rose up in waxed New England halls
While the boarders were snoring under crisp white sheets of curfew
We were newly lovers then, we were fire in the stiff blue-haired house rules

[Verse 1]
I went to Staten Island, Sharon
To buy myself a mandolin
And I saw the long white dress of love
On a storefront mannequin
Big boat chuggin' back with a belly full of cars
All for something lacy
Some girl's going to see that dress
And crave that day like crazy

[Verse 2]
Little Indian kids on a bridge up in Canada
They can balance and they can climb
Like their fathers before them
They'll walk the girders of the Manhattan skyline
Shine your light on me Miss Liberty
Because as soon as this ferry boat docks
I'm headed to the church to play Bingo
Fleece me with the gamblers' flocks

[Verse 3]
I can keep my cool at poker
But I'm a fool when love's at stake
Because I can't conceal emotion
What I'm feeling's always written on my face
There's a gypsy down on Bleecker Street
I went in to see her as a kind of joke
And she lit a candle for my love luck
And eighteen bucks went up in smoke

[Verse 4]
Sharon, I left my man
At a North Dakota junction
And I came out to the "Big Apple" here
To face the dream's malfunction
Love's a repetitious danger
You'd think I'd be accustomed to
Well I do accept the changes
At least better than I used to do

[Verse 5]
A woman I knew just drowned herself
The well was deep and muddy
She was just shaking off futility
Or punishing somebody
My friends were calling up all day yesterday
All emotions and abstractions
It seems we all live so close to that line
And so far from satisfaction

[Verse 6]
Dora says "Have children"
Mama and Betsy say "Find yourself a charity
Help the needy and the crippled
Or put some time into Ecology"
Well there's a wide wide world of noble causes
And lovely landscapes to discover
But all I really want to do right now
Is find another lover

[Verse 7]
When we were kids in Maidstone, Sharon
I went to every wedding in that little town
To see the tears and the kisses
And the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown
And walking home on the railroad tracks
Or swinging on the playground swing
Love stimulated my illusions
More than anything

[Verse 8]
And when I went skating after Golden Reggie
You know it was white lace I was chasing
Chasing dreams
Mama's nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans
He showed me first you get the kisses
And then you get the tears
But the ceremony of the bells and lace
Still veils this reckless fool here

[Verse 9]
Now there are twenty-nine skaters on Wollman Rink
Circling in singles and in pairs
In this vigorous anonymity a blank face at the window
Stares and stares and stares and stares and stares
And the power of reason
And the flowers of deep feeling
Seem to serve me
Only to deceive me

[Verse 10]
Sharon you've got a husband
And a family and a farm
I've got the apple of temptation
And a diamond snake around my arm
But you still have your music
And I've still got my eyes on the land and the sky
You sing for your friends and your family
I'll walk green pastures by and by

[Verse 1]
There's a crow flying black and ragged, tree to tree
He's black as the highway that's leading me
Now he's diving down to pick up on something shiny
I feel like that black crow flying in a blue sky

[Verse 2]
I took a ferry to the highway then I drove to a pontoon plane
I took a plane to a taxi and a taxi to a train
I've been traveling so long
How am I ever going to know my home when I see it again?
I'm like a black crow flying in a blue, blue sky

[Verse 3]
In search of love and music, my whole life has been
Illumination, corruption, and diving, diving, diving, diving
Diving down to pick up on every shiny thing
Just like that black crow flying in a blue sky

[Verse 4]
I looked at the morning after being up all night
I looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light
I looked out the window and I saw that ragged soul take flight
I saw a back crow flying in a blue sky
Oh, I'm like a black crow flying in a blue sky

[Verse 1]
I've got a blue motel room with a blue bedspread
I've got the blues inside and outside my head
Will you still love me when I call you up when I'm down?
Here in Savannah it's pouring rain
Palm trees in the porch light like slick black cellophane
Will you still love me when I call you up when I get back to town?

[Chorus 1]
I know that you've got all those pretty girls coming on
Hanging on your boom-boom-pachyderm
Will you tell those girls that you've got German Measles
Honey, tell them you've got germs
I hope you'll be thinking of me because I'll be thinking of you
While I'm traveling home alone
Tell those girls that you've got Joni, she's coming back home

[Verse 2]
I've got road maps from two dozen states
I've got coast to coast just to contemplate
Will you still love me when I get back to town?
It's funny how these old feelings hang around
You think they're gone, no, no, they just go underground
Will you still love me when I get back to L.A. town?

[Chorus 2]
You and me, we're like America and Russia
We're always keeping score
We're always balancing the power
And that can get to be a cold, cold war
We're going to have to hold ourselves a peace talk
In some neutral café
You lay down your sneaking round the town honey
And I'll lay down the highway

[Outro]
I've got a blue motel room with a blue bedspread
I've got the blues inside and outside my head
Will you still love me when I get back to town?

[Verse 1]
I met a friend of spirit
He drank and womanized
Then I sat before his sanity
I was holding back from crying
He saw my complications
And he mirrored me back simplified
And we laughed how our perfection
Would always be denied
"Heart and humor and humility"
He said, "Will lighten up your heavy load"
I left him then for the refuge of the roads

[Verse 2]
I fell in with some drifters
Cast upon a beach town
Winn Dixie cold cuts and highway hand me downs
And I wound up fixing dinner
For them and Boston Jim
I well up with affection
Thinking back down the roads to then
The nets were overflowing
In the Gulf of Mexico
They were overflowing in the refuge of the roads

[Verse 3]
There was spring along the ditches
There were good times in the cities
Oh, radiant happiness
It was all so light and easy
'Til I started analyzing
And I brought on my old ways
A thunderhead of judgment was
Gathering in my gaze
And it made most people nervous
They just didn't wanna know
What I was seeing in the refuge of the roads

[Verse 4]
I pulled off into a forest
Crickets clicking in the ferns
Like a wheel of fortune
I heard my fate turn, turn, turn
And I went running down a white sand road
I was running like a white-assed deer
Running to lose the blues
To the innocence in here
These are the clouds of Michelangelo
Muscular with gods and sun gold
Shine on your witness in the refuge of the roads

[Verse 5]
In a highway service station
Over the month of June
Was a photograph of the Earth
Taken coming back from the moon
And you couldn't see a city
On that marbled bowling ball
Or a forest or a highway
Or me here least of all
You couldn't see these cold water restrooms
Or this baggage overload
Westbound and rolling, taking refuge in the roads

[Free Speech Tweets: Lupe Fiasco and Twitter Followers]

[LP] Today's idea for ponder comes from Julian Assange and his intriguing assessment of the impotence of western free speech via economic forces

[LP] He says:

"The west has fiscalised its basic power relationships through a web of contracts, loans, shareholdings, bank holdings and so on."

[LP] "In such an environment it's easy 4 speech 2be "free" becuz a change in political will rarely leads 2any change in these basic instruments."

[LP] "Western speech, as something that rarely has any effect on power, is, like badgers and birds, free."

[LP] "In states like China, there is pervasive censorship, because speech still has power and power is scared of it."

[LP] "We should always look at censorship as an economic signal that reveals the potential power of speech in that jurisdiction."

Julian Assange

[LP] The core of what he is saying is that the proliferation of free speech inversely represents the lack of effect it has on power structures.

[LP] The more the speech is "free" the less powerful it really is. It is a very radical angle. Any takers?

#PhilosophySunday

[TW] @LupeFiasco Julian Assange proved in a way that speech is not free.. Not when it comes to the west. Here your speech is mediated... and controlled by those in power. Speech is not truly free when it is corralled under the terms of who it's directed at

[TW] @LupeFiasco I think Assange is absolutely correct. Speech is very feared, mostly when it's unpopular and free.

[LP] But what he is inferring is that power does NOT in fact fear "free" speech at all. It is "free" becuz it is not feared. @CalebFnCool

[TW] @LupeFiasco occupy wall street was a powerful and dangerous free speech movement that was aimed towards eliminating US capitalism #PS

[LP] Actually u could say the "danger" of OWS was mitigated becuz it was built on the powerless premise of western free speech @kamilahvictoria

[TW] Salman Rushdie is more impactful in India because he is persecuted for his writings. It ironically brings exposure @LupeFiasco #PS

[TW] @LupeFiasco i dont think the fact that it's free makes it less powerful, it's the intent and lack of meaning or thought behind it #ps

[LP] Look at this way. How much to do u truly cherish something that was given to u for free as opposed to a thing u had to pay $$$ for? @cbuddz

[TW] .@LupeFiasco but the attempt to stifle peaceful protests like Occupy shows the US government is scared of free speech #PS

[LP] I don't think so. I think it was the OWS aesthetic that was unpleasant to the power structure. Inconvenient but no threat @JordanRaeLake

[TW] @LupeFiasco can you use his view on free speech when he worked to leak information?

[LP] I think the reaction to the leaks by the US is because it threatened external relations NOT the internal Western status quos @mullady21

[TW] @LupeFiasco Free speech, rarely appreciated until it's taken away, most of our generation raised in the U.S. has never experienced this. #PS

[LP] Does this "taking away" lead to a sort of resentment or anger that could possibly empower speech overall? @MIKJAGGA

[TW] @LupeFiasco Part of this thinking is also derived from the idea that the western world is as good as it gets and can ever be #PS

[LP] Very interesting @TravisGBTBB

[TW] @LupeFiasco one could say that America has more of a stranglehold on their people than China does. #PS #Solzhenitsyn

[LP] Ah the Spector of democratic tyranny... @EvansBranagh

[TW] @LupeFiasco so our goal is to have a opinion worth silencing? Because being allowed means you and your word has no meaning.

[LP] It may mean that silence is more powerful that words. As it removes a barometer for the power structure to "test" society @AvaryF

[TW] @AvaryF @lupefiasco I feel even with an opinion worth silencing we're still somehow overshadowed by ignorance

[LP] "What they do not know will hurt them" so to speak Or Biggies line "Bad Boys move in silence." Limit the information accessible @AvaryF

[TW] @LupeFiasco for example the OWS movement would be incredibly strong now had the power system not given the movement media attention #PS

[TW] @LupeFiasco I would argue that Information overload functions as a form of censorship because it is almost impossible to find the truth anyway

[TW] @LupeFiasco speech if everyone had a Bugatti and flaunts it, it goes down in value. speech becomes an materialistic thought in this essence

[LP] Speech defined as a being a material is very interesting. #ps #twittergold right there @xygoma_

[TW] @LupeFiasco a politician's speech is not seen as 'powerless'. If people organised themselves better & then spoke, neither would theirs. #PS

[LP] It can b argued tht a politicians freespeech is the least powerful of all Think of the ambiguity of the "campaign promise" @_MudassarRashid

[LP] And that's #PhilosophySunday for this week. Thanks 2 everyone who chimed in! Shout 2 yall who struck #twittergold . See y'all next week #ps

[Intro: Akiva Schaffer]
Lonely Island
We been in it for a minute now
This some grown man shit

[Chorus: Akiva Schaffer]
I got that diaper money
I got that diaper money, dude
I got that diaper money
I’m a grown-ass man

[Verse 1: Akiva Schaffer]
Ayo, I got that diaper money
'Cause my kids need to shit
So I stay on my hustle
To keep my pocketbook thick
I got papers and papers and papes
All for my baby’s mistakes
Just so my carpets and drapes
Don’t get shit on ‘em

[Chorus: Akiva Schaffer]
I got that diaper money
I got that diaper money, dude
I got that diaper money
I’m a grown-ass man

[Chorus 2: Jorma Taccone]
J-Orgus
I got that wife pussy
I got that wife pussy
I got that wife pussy
I got that pussy on lock

[Verse 2: Jorma Taccone]
I got that wife pussy on lock, 24-7
Whenever she lets me, I’m in same-pussy heaven
And the best part about it
Is no one else can have it
And also I can’t have it
Unless she says I can
I see a girl on the street
And I can’t, so I won’t
See my wife at home and I would
But she hates my guts

[Chorus 2: Jorma Taccone]
Wife pussy
I got that wife pussy
I got that wife pussy
I got that pussy on lock

[Chorus 3: Andy Samberg]
Young Sandwich
I got that grave plot
I got that grave plot
I got that grave plot
It’s right off the highway

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg]
Wobble-dee-wobble-dee-drop
Into my grave plot
You afraid of death
Well I’m afraid not
'Cause I got the bomb spot
Right off the highway
I did it my way
A very small percent of the time-way
I got my coffin picked out
Styrofoam painted like wood, tricked out
It’s even got handles to lower me smooth
And my tombstone only has minimal typos

[Chorus 3: Andy Samberg]
Grave plot
I got that grave plot
I got that grave plot
Right next to my dad

[Outro: Akiva, Jorma, Andy & All]
I got that diaper money
I got that wife pussy
I got that grave plot
I’m a grown ass man!

[Hook]
Thoughts keep running through my head
Running through my head
Thoughts keep running through my head
Running through my head
Thoughts keep running through my head
Running through my head
Running through my head
Thoughts keep running through my head

[Verse]
Now tell me
The definition of a politician
I ain't gon' vote for you
And I ain't signing no petition
You give us debt
And you call it a college tuition
We break our neck for these checks
You take our percentage bitch!
Ain't nothin but a bitch
If you for Uncle Sam
Then you're probably a snitch
If I ruled the world
With my rules and shit
I'd probably roll the constitution up into a spliff
Cause I just ain't with it
I just don't get it
How we gettin' broker
But they boost the price of livin'?
Got you working triple
Just to eat some rice and chicken
Plus your credit to the limit
Just to drive a Honda Civic
Man they got us on our tippy toes
And all we wanna do is fly
They keep us pigeonholed
But you see me, I ain't that guy
Cause I'm a different soul
And on this road I travel on
I pay a different toll
A different toll
See this weight I'm carrying on my shoulder
Is a different load
What the fuck you think I go to sleep with my pistol for?
What the fuck you think is keeping me in the studio?
I swear I'm trying to tell 'em fuck you
We're paying attention for
I'm a motherfuckin' G
My presence is evident
Consider this a blessing
My effort is heaven sent
You might as well respect it and cherish it
Cause whenever I perish
Only then will you see what the message is
To be an American

[Hook]

Not frightened after you trust your own thoughts
Catch the delirium, contagious

I feel I show you more
You're my eight packs of soft
Savor like a now or later
Mmm
I think about you now or later

I'll be your savior, call me
Catch you if i can, call me

Feel I've gone far
Tell me where to go from here
Little girl, Lost boy
That's how I feel
Sail me away

[Hook]

Picture yourself

(beat change)
Just picture yourself
Picture yourself
Picture yourself
Picture yourself in a candy land
I wanna go there, alone
All of the morphine you can stand
Padded rooms
Picture yourself

Bitch! Put my dick on yo face, put my gun in yo purse
Put my work in yo pussy, bitch don’t cum on the work
Pass the weed to your slime, these niggas greener than lime
So many knots in my pockets, them bitches need a massage

Get his mama address, then send his parents his head

Kidnap em, call they boss, and ask 'em who gone buy these niggas

All sold up nigga, hold up nigga
Pimps on the loop, put yo hoes up nigga
Handcuff that bitch when we roll up nigga
We’ll hit that bitch, run pole up in her
Head and shoulders of another ho up in her
With the legs hangin' out
Is she dead? Just about
Then we rollin some loud and leave up out the house
We leave out the house, counting 100’s and 50’s
And go do a show for 250

How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Don't want to stay alive when you're 25

Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face
A funky little boat race

Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
But, man, I need a TV when I've got T. Rex
Hey, brother, you guessed

It's a real mean team
We can love

And my brother's back at home
With his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
What a drag
Too many snags

Well, I drunk a lot of wine
And I'm feeling fine
Gonna race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around
Or is it in my head?
Oh, brother, you guessed

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
I heard in Miami they're making it nasty
Send me a pic, Gambino Aveeno that ashy to classy
When you were the shit it was loose in this bitch
Drinks, drugs, chicks and Uggs
Weirdos sipping Cuervo or that Indica
Grown man singing "Where is the Love"
Who the fuck no grown man?
Young boys who make no sense
Young girls with that old chest
Now I'm like oh yes, oh yes
Reflex
We just go squirrel shit
That's nuts, ask us
Do we give fuck?
No

[Hook] x4
Body so tight

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
And like that
I had one taste and I'm right back
She squeezed into that tight dress
But she squeeze out for that night cap
Got a few girls and they white-black
Red-yellow, few brown
So I beat it up like Knockout
And she ain't last for like 2 rounds
It's the new sound
For strippers and students to get down
Just hits now
Fly ladies get loose with it
All the bourgie bitches just sit down
These mixed girls with two-tones
With the nice bodies, they too toned
Came here with like five girls
That'll circle-twerk with no shoes on
Like: work
Damn baby, you don't need a holiday
She got a body language you know what that body say
Tattoos on her body like that body paint
Drop it low, bring it up I bet you everybody say:

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
This G shit: gold chains and a v-neck
Yeah we flex, star status
Do the whole world with no regrets
Just G jets
Concepts, this type of shit you ain't seen yet
Did a whole tour for like six months
So the game mine, no reset
Fast money, my reflex
These fly beats, that's Reflex
Killin' the shit for like, how long?
Y'all give me my respect?
Got skills man, I'm sayin'
These young chicks, I raise em
She fine now but in three years
I bet the whole style'll be amazing
Like
Give her three years I bet that body right
Coppin' clothes better now she know her body type
Her ex-man, trippin' wishin' that he got it right
Get a body bag, she killin' everybody like:

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I just want to ask a question:
Who really cares, to save a world in despair?
Who really cares?
There'll come a time (There'll come a time)
When the world won't be singing (When the world won't be singing)
Flowers won't grow (flowers won't grow, no)
Bells won't be ringing (the bells won't be ringing)
Who really cares? (Who really cares?)
Who's willing to try? (Who is willing to try?)
To save the world, (to save the world)
That's destined to die (that is destined to die)
When I look at the world (when I look at the world)
It fills me with sorrow (it fills me with sorrow)
Little children today (children today)
Are really going to suffer tomorrow (really suffer tomorrow)
(Oh!) What a shame (what a shame)
Such a bad way to live (such a bad way to live)
Oh, who is to blame? (Who is to blame?)
We can't stop living, (when we can't stop living)
Live, (Live)
(Live for life) Live for life
(But let live everybody)
Live life for the children (live life for...the children. Oh, for the Children)
You see, let's...let's save the children
Let's...let's save all the children, (Save the babies, save the babies!)
(And if you want to love, you got to....save the babies)
(Oh you've got the feeling, you've got the feeling)
(You will save the babies, all of the Children)

[Verse 2]
But who really cares?
Who's willing to try?
To save our world
To save our sweet world
To save a world
That is destined...to die
Oh, la la la la, la la la
Oh, oh, dig it everybody

Nah, nah, nah, nah-nah, noh

I just wanna live how it should be
Over, what it is
Over
Can I get a heartbreak?
Over
Unstick my thoughts, unstick my heart
Unstick these words, go from the start

[Chorus]
Take me to reality
And drag me to the truth
Take me to reality, oh
Drag me to the truth

Come clean, soul
Yearning for things, are numb
Do me good then just so
Nah, nah, nah, nah-nah, noh
Look with the light, I see
Top of my sight, I'm scared
Can't sleep at night
Nah, nah, nah, nah-nah, noh

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna live how it should be
Over, what it is
Over
Can I get a heartbreak?
Over
Unstick my thoughts, unstick my heart
Unstick these words, go from the start

[Chorus]
Take me to reality
And drag me to the truth
(Drag me to the truth)
Take me to reality, oh
Drag me to the truth
(Drag me to the truth)

[Verse 1]
Quiet as a kitten
Reply as silent as a Raphael-given instrument for stickin'
Or maybe riot as a lion
Would he tie in tiger for attention?
Tiggers and Poohs, niggas and jews
Mr. Opulent Christopher Robinson too
Reversal like
When that predetermined term expires on a turtle's knife
What of Korea, are you scared?
Or is something not there, like a Welsh rabbit full of hares
Animal farms and imaginary bears
The body is a house like a kangaroo pouch
Or an oyster-hoisted cow over crescent moons as it looms low in the night sky
Platoons of coons stand ready for the drive-by
Steady as the medley booms from the Akai
Affirm as in "Aye aye"
Like it the second
Like a junior, like a third, like a eye
Like a observe from the view of a bird as it fly high
Sitting heavy like spaghetti in the belly of a wise guy
Who let these G's out the PI_STY?
Seems they taking cues from The Wire
Okay decorum, and keeping you from wanting to buy it
But you still buy it like you never left its sight
And like a slow gunfighter gun: unfired
Cow dung walls, hermit crabs in the mall, sting ray from the stars and barnyard laws
These are

[Hook: Atoms for Peace sample]
Hey hey, just cause I got thumbs, that don't mean everybody is dumb, huh huh?
Just cause I got one, that don't mean that they not dumb, what what?

[Verse 2]
Quiet as a mouse in the House of God
In the jaws, like tyrants in the mouths of mobs
Ripping it to pieces like a picture and a preacher
If a cricket was a speaker, it's its own chicken bones on the garbage can top
Ugly mother freakers is predator, opposite, on top of it, to make it fox
So if similar appeal, administer the seal to make it real
Elephantine but never mind
Half-ton gorillas in a midst, they'll never find
Hungry as a hippopotamus, gobble it 'til your bottom and your body is as wobbly as Skrillex
Eeyores and Piglets, blind bats nailing tails to a riblet
Time only limited(ed) if you make it
Blind rat's nails hold tales of Unseeing Eye selves
Out is out, so they only seeing thy shells
Ghost Dog
Oh lawd
These are

[Hook 2: Atoms for Peace sample]
Hey they not dumb
I ain't smart just cause I got thumbs, what, say what?
Hey hey, just cause I got one
That don't mean I'm better cause they got none, say what, say what say what?

[Verse 3]
The butcher says to the bovines
You're all just pastrami when it's showtime
Cowboy co-signs, attack the cat samples
Own worst enemies
Chop down the trees, we need the axe handles
Like a heel in a sandal saying "hell no"
Or you trapped like the yells of a nail in the shell-toe
Clever as a fishbowl on a sailboat
Landlocked as a ham hock on a railroad
Sandbox by the swimming pool
Two times as clever as a fishing school
Pills for the pressure
Broken seals on the pills for the pleasure
If you feeling ill, whatever
Animal farm, you're all dumb
Tickle 'em with your articulated thumb
A tapeworm will never play the drums, but um
These are
These are

[Hook 3: Atoms for Peace sample]
Hey hey, just cause I got one
That don't mean I'm smart cause they got none
W-what, w-what
Am I not an animal cause I got thumbs?
That don't make me smart cause they got none, say what?
W-what, w-what
Here we come
Am I not an animal cause I got thumbs, say what?
Say what, say what?

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Listen, closely
Hear the music playin'
Let it take you to places far away and relax your senses
Just do what you wanna do
No need for questions
It's only for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's so amazing, oh, how you can't escape it
The movement takes you and never let's you go

[Chorus]
Can't you feel the music in the air?
Close your eyes, let the rhythm take you there
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Forget about your troubles, it's alright
Let 'em go 'til we see the morning light
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun (The sun)
Come and dance to the music of the sun, the sun (The sun, yeah)

[Verse 2]
So real, so right
Can't explain the feeling
Like the sunlight brings to life new meaning
No need for stress (No need for stress)
Save that for another day
No second guessing
Just trust me when I say

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's so amazing, oh, how you can't escape it
The movement takes you and never let's you go

[Chorus]
Can't you feel the music in the air?
Close your eyes, let the rhythm take you there (Let the rhythm take you there)
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun (Music of the sun)
Forget about your troubles, it's alright
Let them go 'til we see the morning light (See the morning light)
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun (Come and dance to the music of the sun)
Come and dance to the music of the sun, the sun (Of the sun, oh, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's so amazing, oh, how you can't escape it
The movement takes you and never let's you go

[Chorus]
Can't you feel the music in the air?
Close your eyes, let the rhythm take you there (Let the rhythm take you there)
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Forget about your troubles, it's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
Let 'em go 'til we see the morning light
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun (Come and dance to the music of the sun)
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Let it take you far
Come and dance to the music of the sun
It'll take you far away, far away
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Can't you feel the music in the air?
Close your eyes, let the rhythm take you there
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun

[Verse 1]
Like the summer of Sam, back in '69
I'd be heavenly, deadly on the grind
'Cause to sing this nice has to be a crime
I be murderin' and murderin' 'em

Like the summer of love back in '69
You can say that I'm yours, but my body is divine
I belong to everybody that I walk by
Like hi, hi

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the master of my destiny
You haven't seen the best of me
And if you want the rest of me
You'll have to pay a lovely fee
Hard to stay far, far away from me
'Cause I am the baddest girl in NYC
You can look but please don't touch, boy
Stay away from me

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm a cinnamon girl
Keepin' it fresh on the far east side
Baby, I'm a tenement girl
Keepin' it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby, I'm a dangerous girl
You should stay away from me

[Post-Chorus]
I be murderin' and murderin' 'em
I be murderin' and murderin' 'em

[Verse 2]
Like the summer of Sam, back in '69
I'll be tying them up, and hang 'em out to dry
'Cause I'm hot like that when I walk, they die
I be murderin' and murderin' 'em

Like the summer of love back in '69
When I get on the microphone my, my
They be looking at each other like ay, ay, ay
Bye, bye

[Pre-Chorus]
Please excuse m-my vivacity
Capacity for head games
Is incredible
It's better if you stay away from me
I know it's hard, hard to stay far, far away from me
I am the baddest girl in NYC
You can look but please don't touch
But boy, step away from me

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm a cinnamon girl
Keepin' it fresh on the e-east side
Baby, I'm a tenement girl
Keepin' it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby, I'm a dangerous girl
Baby, you should stay away from me

[Post-Chorus]
I be murderin' and murderin' 'em, happily
Murderin' and murderin' 'em, ah-ah
Murderin' and murderin' 'em

[Bridge]
I'm diggable, predicatable
No, everyone knows all my people
I'll give you a fistful
You know you'll be in a fight
Unmissable, invincible, behavior is despicable
If you're lookin' for fun you can come out with me tonight

I am the baddest girl in NYC
I am the baddest, ya liking what you see? Yup!

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm a cinnamon girl
Keepin' it sweet on the far east side
Baby, I'm a tenement girl
Keepin' it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Honey, I'm a dangerous girl
You should stay away from me

[Chorus]
I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now, you fall asleep with another
Damn you

[Verse 1]
'Member how we used to escape for the summer?
Fireworks and sparklers would light up the black skies
We'd hold on tight for our lives to each other
Hello, hello, where did you go?

[Pre-Chorus]
We were two kids livin' life on the run
Like the American dream, baby
Nothing to lose and we'd get messed up for fun
We went too fast, too young

[Chorus]
But I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now, you fall asleep with another
Damn you
Damn you

[Verse 2]
Flowers in my hair, and your breath smelled like whiskey
Promise anywhere that I go, take you with me
Dancing on your feet, like a child, to the radio
Hello, hello, where did you go?

[Pre-Chorus]
We were two kids living life on the run
Of the American dream, baby
Nothing to lose and we'd get messed up for fun
We went too fast, too young

[Chorus]
But I won't cry my self to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now, you fall asleep with another
Damn you
Damn you
Damn you
Damn you

[Bridge]
Every once in a lifetime
Dreams can come true
Now and then, when the stars shine
You meet somebody like you

[Chorus]
And I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
I pray your life is sweet, you fucker
Damn you
Oh, oh, damn you
Damn you

[Verse 1]
I guess it’s symptomatic of a slight infatuation
Stalkin' you has sorta become like my occupation
Used to be a beauty queen with simple acquisitions
Met my local rock star now I’m havin' visions

[Pre-Chorus]
I fell for you, you like me too
Let’s get it on, check one, two
I fell for you, you want me too
Let’s get it on

[Chorus]
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
I’m makin' out with you while you’re singin' your song
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
You’re playing your guitar and it’s turnin' me on
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walkin’ around like you don’t care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it’s wrong, I don’t wanna be right

[Verse 2]
I get so systematic in this kind of situation
I need it, have to have it, t-take over, domination
Used to be so simple, never wantin’, never wishin’
Now I’m hooked on fame and I’m a girl on a mission

[Pre-Chorus - Variation]
I fall for you, it’s all for you
Let’s get it on, check one, two
I fall for you, it’s all for you
Let’s get it on

[Chorus]
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
I’m makin' out with you while you’re singin' your song
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
You’re playing your guitar and it’s turnin' me on
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walkin’ around like you don’t care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it’s wrong, I don’t wanna be right

[Bridge]
A funny little thing about love is that you’re blind all the time
And even when you think you had enough
You’re wanting more, it isn’t right but
You can’t stop

[Chorus - Variation]
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walkin’ around like you don’t care
You got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walkin’ around like you don’t care
You got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it’s wrong I don’t wanna be right

[Verse 1]
He don't like no small things
Even ridin' 'round on tall dreams
I don't wanna go
He's a sweet baby, but he looks mean
In his soft leather and his blue jeans

[Pre-Chorus]
He got a way, oh, baby, he got a way, oh, baby
He got a way with his words
They be like diamonds and pearls
They be like diamonds and pearls
He gives to his little favorite girls

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

[Verse 2]
He don't like no spotlight
Stands real quiet in the moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]
He got a way, oh, baby, he got a way, mm, baby
He got a way with those words
They be like diamonds and pearls
They be like diamonds and pearls
He gives to his little favorite girls

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

[Bridge]
Lovin' you isn't right
Black leather moonlight (I give in)
Lovin' you isn't right
It's original sin

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

[Outro]
I feel like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Like I can do anything that I like
I feel like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Tonight
Baby, tonight
Tonight

[Verse 1]
Baby has a broken heart
She can't belong to only one
Until another girl is found
I don't pay for anything
My cigarettes or diamonds rings
My feet don't even touch the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Chariots of gold, I ride with Jay-Z, Jared Leto
I'm a superpower, now they call me the tornado
I got roses in my hair, I belly dance, and do the tango
Sometimes I get lonely, everybody told me no

[Chorus]
No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on

[Verse 2]
Cleopatra used to rule
But she got nothing on me now
'Cause I'm the last girl on earth
I turn the television on
They only play my favorite song
Since I'm the last girl on Earth

[Pre-Chorus]
Chariots of gold, I'm sitting, sipping cherry cola
Caesar said he'd fall in love with me if I was older
I own all of Mexico and I got my own roller-coaster
Sometimes I get lonely, millions can hold me now

[Chorus]
No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on

[Bridge]
I stay up late at night, try not to think about it
Pretend I'm happy, ruling all the world without love
I get so tired being on display somehow
Sometimes I get lonely, but millions all know me now

[Chorus]
No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
There's no such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on

[Intro]
You know you're dirty right?
Let me wash you off...
*water falling*

[Verse]
Wash your body, body
So I can kiss your body, body
I wanna rub your body
I know you're ready
And you want this super love
Want your super body on top of this super thug
We been getting twisted all night drunk up in the club
Girl I wanna kiss it so let me give you a rub down
Down, down, turn that thing around
For me, for me, baby please
Let me rub... rub

[Outro]
Now you're clean...

[Verse 1]
Walking is an art, so is my body
Papi is a workaholic, I'm his little party
I'm Miss Parlor-Tricks, sips of the Bacardi
I can make you dope, sick from the naughtiness
He says "Who the best?" You is!

[Chorus]
I'm glamorous, famous
Notorious, dangerous, "but you're crazy"
"I'm gonna leave you,"
He said, "You're not a real girl
You're like a cartoon
All caught up in this fame game
Yo, good luck, good luck, good luck
May all the stars in the sky
Bow down to you, we're through."

[Verse 2]
You gotta be smart and I'm a little smarty
Papi is a gangsta, I'm his little dolly
Party favor favorite of them all
He says "Baby doll is so sick"
Sick off your naughtiness-ness-ness-ness-ness

[Verse 3]
Let's go to Vegas
He say "who the best?"
He said "She is, she is but, yo
She crazy like in every single way
Like a hurricane
You gotta get out of the way
But she's hot, and she's cold
And she's cool and she's bold
And she's full of rage like me
And I like the game, yo"

[Bridge]
Cause I'm glamorous I'm famous
Notorious dangerous but I'm crazy, yo
Glamorous dangerous
Notorious but famous but I'm crazy

[Chorus - Variation]
He's gonna hate me
He wants a real girl
I'm like a cartoon
All caught up in this fame game
Yo, good luck, good luck
He said "We're through"

[Verse 1]
Ooh-Ooh baby, can't you hear our favorite song?
Ooh-Ooh baby, make me wait a bit too long
I don't ever want to stop, show me everything you got
I've done this before, and I should know better
Ooh-Ooh baby, what planet are you on?
What ya waiting for? What ya waiting for?

[Chorus]
Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Say you wanna put your hands on me?
Did you say that there's a chance for me?
Are you ready now?
Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Should be taking off your pants for me
Are you ready for me, finally?
Are you ready now?

[Verse 2]
Ooh-Ooh baby, look at all your high-brow friends
Ooh-Ooh baby thinkin' I don't understand
Cuz I'm drinkin' diet coke a lot, sucking on my lollipops
I know that I'm not that grown up, but no one's better
Ooh-Ooh baby, when you gonna be my man?
What ya waitin' for? What ya waitin' for?

[Chorus]
Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Say you wanna put your hands on me?
Did you say that there's a chance for me?
Are you ready now?
Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Should be taking off your pants for me
Are you ready for me, finally?
Are you ready now?

Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Say you wanna put your hands on me?
Did you say that there's a chance for me?
Are you ready now?

[Bridge]
You tell me that you love me
I know you do, I know you do
It doesn't matter what they say, it's true

[Chorus]
Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Wanna put your hands on me?
Say that there's a chance for me?
Are you ready now?
Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Should be taking off your pants for me
Are you ready for me finally?
Are you ready now?

[Chorus]
Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Say you wanna put your hands on me?
Did you say that there's a chance for me?
Are you ready now?
Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Should be taking off your pants for me
Are you ready for me finally?
Are you ready now? Are you ready now?

[pre-hook]
It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love
It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love

[Verse 1]
You make me wanna be
Like one of those girls
From the 1950's
Wearing those big pearls
I'll cook you breakfast
Coffee on your desk, yes
I might burn your toast
But baby I'm still the bestest

[pre-hook]
It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love
It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love

[Verse 2]
You make me wanna be
Like one of those girls on the colored TV
It was a new world
The Dick Van Dyke Show
We're Cher and Bono
The way I sing 'I got you babe'
Makes you say "Oh no"
Cause you're the class president
Without Jackie O
And I'm singing happy birthday
Like Marilyn Monroe

[Chorus]
(One)
This is not a school girl crush
(No, two)
This is not a puppy love,(uh-un)
It's the real thing
When you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby
(One)
This is not a school girl thing
(No, two)
What about the diamond ring? (uh-un)
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it baby

[Pre-hook]
It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love
It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love

[Verse 3]
You make me wanna be
Like one of those girls
Calender pin-up queen and platinum curls
I'll do my summer pose
Golden sand between my toes
You can pack my favorite snacks of
Veuve Clicquot with Ho-Ho's
You're everybody's hero and you're hitting it home
While I'm singing for the soldiers like Marilyn Monroe

[Chrous]
(One)
This is not a school girl crush
(No, two)
This is not a puppy love,(uh-un)
It's the real thing
When you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby
(One)
This is not a school girl thing
(No, two)
What about the diamond ring? (uh-un)
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it baby, baby, baby

[Bridge]
And if I call you on the telephone
I might overdose
Cause I'm strong, but I'm lonely like Marilyn Monroe

This is not a school girl crush
This is not a puppy love
It's the real thing
When you told me you loved me
What ever happened to hold m and trust me babe

[Chorus]
(One)
This is not a school girl crush
(No, two)
This is not a puppy love,(uh-un)
It's the real thing
When you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby
(One)
This is not a school girl thing
(No, two)
What about the diamond ring? (uh-un)
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it baby

[Pre-hook]
It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love
It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love

[Verse 1]
I had a man, he was sweet as pie
I met him as I waked right by him
He said, "Baby you so fine that when you walk
Even the stoplights stop talk about you
I saw you and I had to make you mine
‘Cause you ultimately the most fine
You know a man like me
Gotta have a woman that's killer
She's got a be killer, killer, killer, baby"

[Chorus]
Fly body, dope in the face
Fly body, dope in the face

[Verse 2]
The way you talk, well, you make me smile
And I'm lookin' down ‘cause I'm kinda shy
You know you're so fine that when you talk
Even the roses get up to walk to you
You're crazy but I knew that at the time
I just cannot resist your golden grill
And your stupid pickup line

[Chorus]
Fly body, dope in the face
Fly body, dope in the face

[Bridge]
There's something about you when you say
“Come on, come on with me babe.”
And I don't know why but I know
Wherever you go, I'm gonna follow

[Chorus]
Fly body, don’t mean a thing
Fly body, don’t mean a thing
Fly body, dope in the face

[Post-Chorus]
You're gonna be the, you’re gonna be the
You’re gonna be the death of me
(Yes you are, you are)

[Outro]
You so fly, you so dope, babe
You so fly, you so dope, babe
Fly like a bird

[Intro]
What do you need to get high for?
When your baby's to die for?
Quit your job, let's make a ride for it

[Verse 1]
If you want it supersize, I can do that for you
If you want it double fries, I can do that for you
If you want a good surprise, I can do that for you
If you won't believe your eyes, I can do that for you

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you need to get high for?
When your baby's so die for?
Quit your job, let's make a ride for
It's us against the world

[Chorus]
If you want a cola, I can make it colder
If you want a bad girl, nobody's bolder
And if you want the Queen of New York then you
Better call me, call me

[Verse 2]
If you want some dirty lies, I can do that for you
Watch me dance for other guys, I can do that for you
Tell you everything's alright, I can do that for you
Never ever leave your side, I can do that for you

[Pre-Chorus]
What do I need to get high for?
There ain't no reason to cry for
Quit your job, let's make a life
Boy, it's us against the world

[Chorus]
If you want a cola, I can make it colder
If you want a bad girl, nobody's bolder
And if you want the Queen of New York then you
Better call me, call me

[Bridge]
Lights, lights, sights, sights
Buy me Coca Cola in the middle of the night
Ah-ah-ah
Lights, lights, sights, sights
Buy me Coca Cola in the middle of the night
Ah-ah-ah

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you need to get high for?
When your baby's so die for?
Quit your job, let's make a ride for
It's us against the world

[Chorus]
If you want a cola, I can make it colder
If you want a bad girl, nobody's bolder
And if you want the Queen of New York then you
Better call me, call me

[Verse 1]
Got a light in your eyes, I can see it
Look into my mind to believe it
Try hard to remember the beach
Blue water from the sea, hands all over me
Tattoos, they were glistening
It's been so long since someone made me different

[Chorus]
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive
It’s just you and the sun, it’s just you and the sun now baby

[Verse 2]
Gonna light up the skies, I can see it
You're God’s favorite child, boy, believe it
Try hard to remember the days
Sick as fucking cyanide
Diamonds and getting blazed
Your tattoos, still magnificent
No longer high, but you're not very different

[Chorus]
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive
It’s just you and the sun, it’s just you and the sun now baby

[Bridge]
I get so damn tired
You set my soul on fire
Ignite me, inspired
Make me higher and higher

[Chorus]
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive
It’s just you and the sun, it’s just you and the sun now baby

[Verse 1:]
I'm coming through to meet ya
Girl I can't wait to see ya
Just stepped up out of Magic
I'm feeling like an addict
I need a little touch-up to help me go to sleep
Sugar I'm about to pull up, buzz the gate for me
I step off through the door, stumbling from all the sipping
I pull you to the floor, you hide from all the kissing
Oooh I know you with it, so let's take it slow
I brought you a ticket baby, I'm gone do a show

[Pre-Hook:]
Baby you the juice, watch me be the gin
Hit it like a nigga who just got up out the pen
From the floor to the kitchen
Kitchen to the bathroom
Bathroom to the shower
Take a break and bring it back in an hour oooh

[Hook:]
I'm in my zone tonight, I'm feeling alright
I got this wine in me, I got that weed in me
And girl I'm feeling like a soldier, wanna do it rough
I know you like it when I hold you, girl I wanna oooh
Make it rain tonight
And I ain't talking bout no money girl
I'm a make it rain tonight
And I ain't quitting til I get it right

[Verse 2:]
Now baby stand up
Put your hands against the wall while I kiss down your spine
I'm sure you know where I go from here
And I know you feel when I'm kissing in your kitten
And I know you gone be tripping when I step inside your love
I just wanna love
Oooh the closer I get to you
I said it keeps on getting better and I love when we're together

[Pre-Hook:]
Baby you the juice, watch me be the gin
Hit it like a nigga who just got up out the pen
From the floor to the kitchen
Kitchen to the bathroom
Bathroom to the shower
Take a break and bring it back in an hour oooh

[Hook:]
I'm in my zone tonight, I'm feeling alright
I got this wine in me, I got that weed in me
And girl I'm feeling like a soldier, wanna do it rough

You say "T-R-E-Y Songz you the king of the world"
Baby you're 

[x4] so sweet ooooh

Til you beg me for me to stop and it hurts to let me go
Now say it "T-R-E-Y Songz you the king of the world"

[Hook:]
I'm in my zone tonight, I'm feeling alright
I got this wine in me, I got that weed in me
And girl I'm feeling like a soldier, wanna do it rough
I know you like it when I hold you, girl I wanna oooh
Make it rain tonight
And I ain't talking bout no money girl

And I ain't quitting til I get it right

[Outro:]
See baby when I, when I, when I hit your phone and tell you I'm coming through
You know what it do
I come to give you what you missing
Your love description man your love is dripping
Make it rain tonight
So close your eyes and imagine the best love you ever had
She say "T-R-E-Y Songz you the king of the world"

[Verse 1]
We are the crowd, we're c-comin' out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you, it's so magical
We'd be so fantastical
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I

[Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

[Verse 2]
I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rock star in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes
Shadow is burnt, yellow, dance and we turn
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops I cry, it don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that, baby, I

[Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

[Bridge]
Real good, we dance in the studio
Snap, snap to that shit on the radio
Don't stop for anyone
We're plastic, but we still have fun!

[Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

[Verse 1]
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way

[Chorus]
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof

Bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down
My level's too high to bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down, I said
Bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down
My level's too high to bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down, I said

[Chorus]

[Intro: Maya Rudolph and Lonely Island]
Okay everyone
Welcome to grammar class
Today we're learning about semicolons
Oh, oh, oh
Yes, Lonely Island?
We use semicolons everyday
Can you give me an example?
Oh, hell yeah

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, & Akiva Schaffer]
Get ready for a whale of a time; Shamu
My whole team coming clean; shampoo
These dudes is comic relief; Whoopi
And I'm the motherfucking monster; cookie
When you see me better cross the street; Frogger
Then go home and write about it; blogger
"Did I do that?"; Urkel
"Yo Angela, Who's The Boss?"; Merkel
I'll take you where you've never been; Oxnard
Then make you suck a bull’s nut; ox nard
If Miss Moore married Josh; Demi Brolin
A comma and a fucking dot; semicolon

[Chorus: Solange]
We run these streets; stop lights
All eyes on me; spot lights
Each semicolon brings us closer to the top

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, & Akiva Schaffer]
I'm loud and I'm zipping around; jet ski
Your dick is lil' like Wayne; Gretzky
But Gretsky's got a big dick; clarification
Everyone was rude to me; Paris vacation
My stomach's getting fat; food
Leave trash inside my car; rude
You're acting all mach-i-o; Ralph
But I'll eat all you cats; Alf

[Chorus 2: Solange]
We run the game; umpire
Always chase the night; young squire
These semicolons are my light inside the dark

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, & Akiva Schaffer]
It's right under your nose, semicolon; mouth
Opposite of north, semicolon; south
Right over your home, semicolon; attic
Hooked on semicolons, semicolon addict

[Chorus 3: Solange]
We got the game on lock; toy chest
You're too big for your clothes; boys’ vest
You know we out of control; no brakes
Your birthday party sucked; no cakes

[Breakdown: Solange]
When it comes to punctuation
You know we're number one
And to the people of every nation
Feel the power of the semicolon

[Outro: The Lonely Island and Maya Rudolph]
Semicolons
We rest our case
No actually those are examples of colons
You all get Fs
Wait, what?
I stay higher than racial tension, with a facial expression
Tensed up like I'm suffering from a case of nasal congestion
Eyes hazel, complexion beige, age still in question
Critics hate my tape, kids can't wait for the next one
As long as there's rejects, my tape never ejects the deck
That's the level of respect each CD gets
While ya'll graspin at straws like me snorting crushed Aspirin
And gasping at air and collapsing in malls
I'm just a realistic impression of artistic expression
Whose tape was in the deck when kids shot up the delicatessen
So when I launch a verse full of controverse
That'll haunt you worse than Ma$e before he joined a church (P Diddy!)
I'm sorry kids I dismissed this class
I'm going back in the broom closet to sniff this gas
Um, Mr. Mathers just missed the bathroom
Pissed his pants and the world still kissed his ass
This is my last album cause this is my last Valium
Just pick my ass up when I pass out in the bathroom
If ya'll don't like the shit that you're hearing
Then blow me 'til your lipstick is smearing
And I can see my dick disappearing
May 23rd
That means we're taking over this year, you heard?, you heard?
Yo, May 23rd
That means we're taking over this year, you heard?, you heard?

[Skit: Eminem, Steve Berman]

["Ain't Nuttin' But Music" by D12 plays in the background]

"This motherfucker, man..."

[Eminem knocks the door.]

[Eminem sighs and the door opens.]

"It's ridiculous, I can't believe it!—Oh, hold on a minute. Em..."
"What up?"
"Have a seat. Dre, I'll call you back."

[Steve hangs up the phone.]
"What now?"
"I don't even know where to start..."
"Okay...?"
"I got the album from upstairs..."
"And..."
"And this, is by far, the most..."

[Eminem cocks a gun and shoots at Steve.]
"...incredible thing... I've ever... heard..."

[Verse 1]
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you (Crawlin' back to you)
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few? (Had a few)
'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too busy)
Busy bein' yours (Bein' yours)
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

[Outro]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you’d stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
(Do I wanna know?) Too busy bein' yours to fall
(Sad to see you go) Ever thought of callin', darlin'?
(Do I wanna know?) Do you want me crawlin' back to you?

[Chorus]
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love

[Verse 1]
I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there, but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel so helpless here
Watch, my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

[Chorus]
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love

[Verse 2]
Now I'm dreaming, will ever find you now?
I walk in circles, but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this, but I know I'm not that strong

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel so helpless here
Watch, my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

[Chorus]
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love

[Bridge]
All the years, all the times
You were never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing
And all the tears, all the lies, all the waste
I've been trying to make it change
And now my eyes are open

[Chorus]
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free

[Verse 1]
The painted faces congregate
In the mating season
To second homes, they go alone
In no rush to leave them

[Chorus]
And there's a fountain and a scimitar
Shaped yellow light
And it picks you up
And cuts you down to size

[Verse 2]
When the people there and the furniture
Start to seem important
When a moment more, when you catch the floor
With a vivid and absorbent sharpened arc

[Chorus]
Like the scimitar
Shaped yellow light
That picks you up
And cuts you down to size

[Bridge]
Well, I had questions for the tap dancer sat on my lap
And she had child-proof caps on her answers
Stone blower, blow me a stone
And show me that handsome enhancer
She had a rock on her throttle
And a brown glass bottle full of shavings from the sun
Although those shoes affect your step
Don't forget whose legs you're on

[Chorus]
And there's a fountain and a scimitar
Shaped yellow light
And it picks you up
And it cuts you down to size

[Intro]
Aaow!
Hoo-hoo!

[Verse 1]
I don't care what you talkin' 'bout, baby
I don't care what you say
Don't you come walkin' beggin' back, mama
I don't care anyway
Time after time I gave you all of my money
No excuses to make
Ain't no mountain that I can't climb baby
All is goin' my way

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughin', baby? Don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughin', baby?

[Chorus]
So just leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (leave me alone)
Stop it!
Just stop doggin' me around (Just stop doggin' me)
Hee-hee!
Hoo-hoo!

[Verse 2]
There was a time I used to say "Girl, I need you"
But who is sorry now?
You really hurt, you used to take and deceive me
Now who is sorry now?
You got a way of makin' me feel so sorry
I found out right away
Don't you come walkin', beggin', I ain’t lovin' you
Don't you get in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughin', baby? Don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughin', baby?

[Chorus]
So just leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (Leave me alone)
Stop it!
Just stop doggin' me around
Hee-hee!
Hoo-hoo!
Aaow!

[Refrain]
Cho! Cho!
Cho! Oh!
Cho! Cho!
Cho!

[Verse 1]
I'm headed for the border, it's on my mind
And nothing really matters, I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror, is he hot on my tracks?
Is he getting nearer?, I feel some heat is on my back

[Chorus]
(Speed demon) Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon) Doing it on the highway, gotta have it my way
(Speed demon) Mind is like a compass, I'm stopping at nothing
(Speed demon, he say) Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right

[Refrain]
Cho!

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing gonna stop me, ain't no stop and go
I'm speeding on the midway, I gotta really burn this road

[Chorus]
(Speed demon) Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon) Doing it on the highway, gotta have it my way
(Speed demon) Mind is like a compass, I'm stopping at nothing
(Speed demon, he say) Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right

[Refrain]
Cho!

[Bridge]
Speed demon, you're the very same one
Who said the future's in your hands, the life you save could be your own
You're preaching about my life like you're the law
Gonna live each day and hour like for me there's no tomorrow
Go! Go!
Go! Ow!

[Refrain]
Cho! Oh!
Cho! Cho!
Cho!

[Chorus]
(Speed demon) Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon) Got fire in my pocket, I just lit a rocket
(Speed demon) Just pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
(Speed demon) Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
(Speed demon) Just pull over, boy, and eat your ticket
Pull over, boy, pull over, boy, and get your ticket right (Ooh!)

[Outro]
Uh! Ah!
C'mon! Hoo!
Get your ticket right, ah
Pull over, boy
Get your ticket right
Pull over, boy
Pull over, boy, and get your ticket
Eat your ticket, get your ticket
Eat your, get your
Hoo! Aah!
Ooh!
Get your ticket right, ah
Hoo!
Ooh!

[Intro: Stevie Wonder & Michael Jackson]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-nah!
Hoo-hoo! Dancin'-hee!
Doggone lover!
C'mon, boy

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
I watched you on the floor
Cheek to cheek
She's getting to you
You didn't see, her eyes on me, no
She looked right through you
(Before you make) Before you make
(A big mistake) Remember
That looks can fool you, babe (Hee!)
There's something I would sure appreciate
(If you can keep a secret)

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me)
Baby loves me, no, she acts like I'm not there
(That doesn't mean she doesn't love me–ooh)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
If they ask her
Tell 'em that we're just good friends
Dah! Chika-chika-chika-ah!
Just good friends
Ah! Chika-chika-ah! Ooo
(Doot-do-do-doo, hee! Aaow!)
Just good friends

[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder, Stevie & Michael]
You better take advice
Never trust first impressions
I tried to hide this affair
From their suspicions
So even if she's asking you to stay
You better know where you stand

[Refrain: Stevie Wonder & Michael Jackson]
Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me)
Baby loves me, no, she acts like I'm not there
(That doesn't mean she doesn't love me–ooh)

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder]
Now if they ask you
Jus' tell 'em that we're just good friends
Yes, just good friends
(Just good friends)
Root-do-do-do
(Doot-do-do-do)
(Just good friends)

[Bridge: Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Both]
Listen up, hee!
We've got a problem here
I can see the signs
I guess the lady is still making up her mind
Say: "We're just good friends" (Ohhh!)

[Refrain: Stevie Wonder & Michael Jackson]
Baby loves me, though she never shows she cares
No, you won't see her kiss and hug me (Just good friends)
My baby loves me, though she acts like I'm not there
You doggone Lover, hee!
Aaow!
Don't you wanna know?

[Outro: Stevie Wonder & Michael Jackson]
Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares (Hee! Hee!)
She doesn't kiss and hug me (Just good friends)

Hee! Hee! Hee! Hoo! Hoo!
My baby loves me, baby

Baby loves me, baby loves me, ooh-ooh-ooh!

Baby love me, don't she? Oh! (Oh!)
Don't even try it! (Hee-Hee)

Don't point your finger, not dangerous
This is our planet, you're one of us

[Chorus]
We're sendin' out, a major love

[Intro]
I just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you, God I need you
I love you so much

[Verse 1: Michael & Siedah]
Each time the wind blows, I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now, you are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart, at your call
I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on, I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

[Chorus: Both & Siedah]
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael & Siedah & Both]
At night when the stars shine, I pray in you I'll find a love so true
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me? I'll wait for you
You know how I feel, I won't stop until I hear your voice saying, "I do" ("I do")
This thing can't go wrong, this feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't worth living, if I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael & Both]
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
(Oh, oh, and it feels)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
(Uh-huh)
I just can't stop loving you

[Bridge: Michael & Siedah & Both]
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I want to see you for always

[Chorus: Both]
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
(No, baby, if I can't stop) (Oh)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
(Oh! Oh! Oh, oh) (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
(Hee-hee-hee, without you, girl, you know I do)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
(Oh, oh) (Oh, woah-woah!)

[Prod. by Joshua "Ammo" Coleman and Martin Johnson]

[Verse 1]
In the beginning
I never thought it would be you
When we were chillin'
Smilin' in the photo booth
But we got closer (Yeah)
'Til you were eating off my spoon
You're coming over
And we would talk all afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
"We’re going all the way"

[Chorus]
Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sure
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

[Verse 2]
Wait, this could be perfect (Yeah)
But we won't know unless we try (Try)
I know you're nervous
So just sit back and let me drive

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
"We’re going all the way"

[Chorus]
Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sure
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Kiss me like it's do or die
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And take me to the other side

[Bridge]
Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Let your love crash into me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
"We’re going all the way"

[Chorus]
Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July (Yes they do, yeah)
Just take me to the other side (Take me, baby)
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sure
So tonight (So tonight)
Kiss me like it's do or die (Kiss me, kiss me)
And take me to the other side

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Take me to the other side
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And take me to the other side
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Kiss me like it's do or die
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And take me to the other side

[Outro]
Jason Derulo
Hey Jimmy, where you going?
I don't know where I'm goin'
My Dad died, and uh, he left me his degrees
My mom would always say "Dad, why don't you work?"
But he just kept learning
All the other kids' parents were working and saving up money for school
And I was actually in school all while my dad was in school!
He was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree
And now I'm just glad he left me these
Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what I have
These are documented
My father left them to me
And I'm going to leave them to my kids
I'm going to learn too
I'm going to get super smart, so I, too, can die without money
But I'll be the smartest dead guy!
Who has that?

[Verse 1]
Everybody's laughing in my mind
Rumours spreading 'bout this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me? Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me? Cause baby I didn't

[Chorus]
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me, that should be me

[Verse 2]
You said you needed a little time for my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies? What you doing to me, you're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're tryna break my heart, it's working because you know that

[Chorus]
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me

[Bridge]
I need to know should I fight for love or disarm
It's getting harder to shield this pain in my heart
Oooh

[Chorus]
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me
Holding your hand, that should be me
The one making you laugh oh baby, oh that should be me
That should be me giving you flowers, that should be me talking for hours
That should be me, that should be me, that should be me

[Outro]
Never shoulda let you go, I never shoulda let you go
That should be me
I'm never gonna let you go
That should be me
I'm never shoulda let you go
I'm never gonna let you go
That should be me
I'm never gonna let you go

[Verse 1]
Come into me, I know mystical garden
Orchards and violets, all mysteries are parted
Life is a mirage ghost, imagination
Pure inspiration called justification

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Nothing's impossible, nothing's concealed
Everything here is for real
What gives fantastic ghouls all in your head?
Who creates these wonders like nobody can?

[Chorus]
Siegfried & Roy
You know it's Siegfried & Roy
So be it
Siegfried & Roy
I'm gonna Siegfried & Roy

[Interlude]
When it's Siegfried & Roy, it's the mind over magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game in the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you

[Verse 2]
Move of the head, and I'll change your emotions
Strange things appear, from euphorics, devotions
Everything's happening, nothing's unreal
Hallucinating the mind in the real

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Seeing black panthers that suddenly fly
White tigers stalking your mind
Hallucinating the things that you see
This kind of magic's so hard to believe
Be it...

[Chorus]
Siegfried & Roy
You know it's Siegfried & Roy
So be it
Siegfried & Roy
I'm gonna Siegfried & Roy

[Interlude]
When it's Siegfried & Roy, it's the mind over magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game in the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you

[Bridge]
When it's Siegfried & Roy, it's the mind over magic in true
When it's Siegfried & Roy, it's the mind over magic in true
(Seeing is believin')
When it's Siegfried & Roy, it's the mind over magic in true
Hallucinations, the game of this kind
This kind of magic, throw over mind

[Chorus]
Siegfried & Roy
You know it's Siegfried & Roy
So be it
Siegfried & Roy
You're gonna Siegfried & Roy
So be it
Siegfried & Roy
You know it's Siegfried & Roy
So be it
Siegfried & Roy
So be it
Siegfried & Roy
You're gonna Siegfried & Roy
You know it's Siegfried & Roy
So be it
Siegfried & Roy (Hoo!)
Siegfried & Roy (Hoo!)
Siegfried & Roy
Siegfried & Roy
Siegfried & Roy
Siegfried & Roy

They call me, go against the grain, the swagger's reckless
Since 12 smack a nigga, grab his necklace
And the nigga gon' respect this, Dog come through like Deebo
Ain't gotta touch his life but gettin paid off C-lo
That's yo' man faggot, he know, go hard and get down
Whenever Dog hit town, I shut shit down
But I want it NOW, if I see it, I'mma take it
And you better hope I don't want it all cause, I'll leave you naked
I ain't never had to fake it, Dog come through with no gun
I'll show son, I'm scared of no one, and I don't run
I tell niggas, X is back
And it ain't where I'm at, it's what I'm givin niggas, X's back
C'MON!

[Hook]

[DMX]
They on that peep Dark whisperin, walk soft shit
I'm a dog, course I recognize a bitch
And I ain't speak cause I was actin funny nah, it's not what I'm about
You just look mad different without a fuckin dick in your mouth
Soon as I seen you I knew you was see-through, cause I seen through
I ain't mean to, he made me hit him, that's what the thing do
If we were big as our hearts you'd be, half my size
I only fuck with the real Scarface and Nas
Niggas love to think the worst - but put
What you think in this hand a pile of shit in the other, which one'll get filled up first?
I stay remindin niggas what the gun do
Wherever I'm at niggas don't come through, if they do they run through (c'mon!)

[Hook]

[DMX - repeat 2X]
(It ain't my fault) that on the mic, y'all niggas suck

[Hook]

[Outro: DMX]

[8X]

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Delusional Thomas]
Uh, ign'ant-ass white kid (White kid)
But I'm still bicycling and recycling ('Cyling)
And I'm still eating gummy bear vitamins
All my bitches taking Vicodin, huffing nitrogen (Go)
Hyper than Williams' middle son
Since I was a little one, moms had to put me on the Ritalin
Made a swisher run, crack the 40 then I lit a blunt
Told Chuck I had a couple raps, so we kicked the drums
All the best rappers are usually dead
But I'm the poison that left a widow Juliet
In the studio with candles lit and Buddha heads
Coming up with all the coldest shit, take your Sudafed
Contagious, speaking while sedated
God shit, make 'em want to add a couple pages to the Bible
I ain't got nothing left in my will
'Cept, "Throw it all in the casket, it's mine still"
Uh, I need some backpack cast raps
Took a break just to kill the game half-assed
Set some rat traps, went and took a cat nap
Woke up, threw the dead bodies in the trash bags
Act polite, but I'm nasty on the mic
Your bitch don't want my dick, then she has to be a dyke
Slap her but she like it, tell me, "Master, feed me pipe"
I'm the scotch on the rocks, you the Appletini type

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it
Gees...
Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it
Gees, woah...

[Verse 2: Mac Miller & Delusional Thomas]
Ugh, still fucking with these hoes, though (Hoes, though)
Bozo on these doppelgänger Jojos (Jojos)
Take a bitch to Soho for some Froyo
Tell her she gon' blow it: Romo
And now I'm out in Cali like Tone-Lōc (Tone-Lōc)
Young boy, but I'm chilling with some grown folk (Grown folk)
No joke, Most Dope, you just bowl smoke
How much coke you gotta sell to make a boat float?
Hit 'em, hit 'em 'til they tell me, "No more" (No more)
I'm a highly difficult ropes course
Pulling up to Rome on a chrome gold horse
Say "Wassup?" to the Pope, pull off in a Porsche
Who you kidding? Your flow's warshed
I ain't in the street but I'll grill you from the porch (Bitch)
I been had hoes, I played sports (For real)
Her ass out the bottom of her shorts (Woah)

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Suck my dick before I slap you with it
Gees...
Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it
Gees...

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Uh (Black James Bond and a white Shaft) (Yeah)
Turned my daughter to a queen, turned a dollar to a dream
Flashy as high beams, smoking on good weed
Something from kush seeds, the only strand to smoke for us OGs
I'm rich car service, no car keys (Yeah!)
First class flight, 'bout to land to a new bitch (Yeah, yeah)
She fuck me and swallowed every homie I came wit' (Aww, aww)
MCM bag and nigga, bet some weed in it
Two-hundred dollars worth of Backwoods, we all living (Yeah, yeah)
Brought the gangsters back to bucket hat, how real is that? (Ou)
I'm getting money, rub my tummy, that's my baller sack (Ugh)
Quarter million in a safe in case I get a case
Faggot-ass judge hatin' on me 'cause my money straight (Yeah)
Dropped ten racks in all fifty states (Bitch)
Gon' name my next tour Million-Man March (Aww, yeah)
Make a nun throw it back while I pull her scarf (Yeah)
She gave me head, my nuts touched her cross, boss

[Chorus: Mac Miller & ScHoolboy Q]
Figg Side!
Suck my dick before I slap you with it (Ou-ou! Yeah!)

[Intro: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
Doesn't get much better than that (Nah!)
So unfair, so.. unfair advantage
(Yo, it doesn't feel much better than that)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It's the dream, it's Kobe and Jordan on the same team
In the best prime of their game and the same Kanye
You know the name and it's not pronounced Kane
And every time, you know I spit that flame
Ayo we gettin' out our dreams, gettin' out our dreams
And we gonna buy some things, and we got him out of Queens
Talkin' 'bout my man Consequence, once for the Tribe
Talkin' 'bout my man GLC and now he's around
Talkin' 'bout John Legend, take 'em all the way to Heaven
Speakin' of Heaven, Common speaks the heavenly words
The nouns and verbs and whatever you heard
Whatever synonym, we killin' 'em, everybody feelin' him
The people's choice, the people's champ like Paul Wall
All haters, I gotta say fuck all y'all
No, I won't waste my energy no more
I have to be more concerned about Sierra Leone
I'm talkin' 'bout people that's dyin' for diamonds
And the way that uh
They got uh, capa
What I want to say, monopoly over the country
And every time you say somethin' people act funky
The diamond industry want me, they say I'm bringin' out the bad
What I want, people to stop buyin' diamonds?
No, I want everybody to stop lyin'
They say conflicts is only one percent, and look at all the money rappers spent
We throw the diamonds in the screen, nah mean?
But it affects the families cause people is dyin' for these things
I mean in the diamond rivers they'll mine all day
And might only get paid two cups of rice a day
Is this the price to pay for the icy way?
We like to floss away, even your boy 'Ye
With my Jesus piece, I gave diamonds to my niece
If I had a brother, Kanye, Common made "I Used to Love H.E.R."
Used to love her and I still do, lyrically I kill you
Dog I don't feel you, your style is like mildew
Real old, I'm real cold, listen to this beat, real soul
Your style is real old, dollar bill fold
Stackin' money ain't funny, and I'm out in UK
And I ask 'em who's the best, and they say "you K"
Ooh way ooh way
Yeah I feel it and I gotta kick it off the top of the dome
Microphone controller, that's an M.C., it's in me
I can lead a crowd, I went to your show, it's empty
Go to my shit, it's sold out, every single seat
Every time I drop, because like Shaq, I bring the heat
And anybody that freestyle on the level that I do
Should be winnin' Grammys too
So if you do it like me, you can do it like this
And uh, they say I'm a teacher like the one called Kris
That's KRS but nah it's Kanye West
And every time I spit the rhymes, uh straight off the flesh
I could bring it down to the bone straight from the heart
And from the heart is where I did it 'fore I ever chart
And then I spit it, we get it, we did it, we do it a lot
Kanye spit it, we do it, we makin' it hot
I got patterns like Saturn, the rings, the rings
Uh, Gold Digger, that's the single, the single
Gotta hit the club just to mingle, to mingle
Why you all in my face? I'm tryna do my thing dude
Back off, I'll have Barry smack the fuck out of you
Everybody wanna know what they can get out you
Aww here's my demo, dawg, here's my group
Dawg, please back me up, you're heated up, you're soup
Y'all gassed, I passed, I flow, I rhyme
I'm uh, that's the way, that yah boy gotta shine
Straight from the Chi city, everybody ride with me
And you see the same questions and I gotta teach the lesson
This some, this some sick freestylin', I hear you're readin' it
I gotta keep goin' cause y'all fans, y'all needin' it
Uh, you say I'm too high like I smoke weed in it
And they say "he arrogant, he's always conceited, shit"
Well what you want from me? Y'all just can't stop me
You could look in my pants and tell that I'm cocky

[Bridge 1: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
(Laughing)
(Oh my God, Oh my God)
(Damn) Yeah
We back, we back like we ever left, huh
(Crazy!)
Like we ever left, huh, like we e', like we ever left, huh
Like we ever left, uh, uh, uh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Can I get an encore, do you want more?
Kanye on the Westwood Tour
Chillin' with Westwood
Go to Chicago, that's Kanye West's hood
And the label called G.O.O.D
Should I holla at these bitches? You should
You might need one, you might need one
You might fuck one
If you eat out like McDonald's
I ain't no clown like Ronald
Uh, more like Donald
Trump, with the way I get it crunk
Like my man Lil Jon, but call him Lil Kan'
He all the same, flow like Lil Wayne on Tha Carter
And I'm signed to the Carter faculty
'Cause the Roc is in back of me
Actually, that look like stacks to me
Ch-ching, ch-ching
Yah nahmean, yah nahmean, I'm doin' my thing
Out in U.K., London
And they call me number one
Japan, you're number one
That's Ichiban
And I learned that from KRS-One
Won once again like One
Like Puff, my friend, and One
One, give me one of them
Talkin' 'bout one drink, one hand
One cup of Henny, one cup of Hypno
If you ran out of it, yo, you got to get more
And I might sip slow but I never sip Mo
I sip Cris-o, Cris-y-Cris
And I gotta break it down like Missy Miss
She had the "hee hee, who got the keys?"
You don't need that if you got the no start V
Where you push the button, that ain't nothin'
All y'all talkin' somethin', y'all stay frontin'
Kanye dropped the beats to get 'em jumpin'
Lucifer, top of the morning to yah
Cheerio, hit up the flow, bring it back, oh
From Chicago, uh
And I'm rockin' the Dolce Gabbana
Fashionable persona
GQ, who knew he'd be the flyest?
Like T.W.A.C.W.K
K.A.N.Y W.E.S.T
Be the B.E.S.T

[Bridge 2: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
You know, I'mma stop it right there
(Laughs) I just, I just feel like
I 'on't know if I feel like rappin' right now
(Oh my God!)

I got raps for yah, uh huh
I got raps for yah
I got, uh, I got raps for yah
We goin' to mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say
Uh, uh
I 'on't know, I 'on't know what
I got so many joints right know, runnin' through my head
I 'on't even know what to yeah
What should, what should I spit?
I could just freestyle off of these messages
Please can you tell
Okay this is a girl writin' this
Please can you tell my uh, boyfriend Danny
That I love him loads, with all my heart
And I can't wait to see him tomorrow

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
She can't wait to see you tomorrow Danny
She love you, mhmm
You know what that mean?
You gonna get some
I wonder if she gon' be wearin' one of those tight outfits
And you know that I like that shit
I ain't sayin' I ever met her but come on
You must be pimpin' and you ain't sweat her, you know?
She writin' you on one of these hip-hop shows
Made me wonder if she's a hip-hop ho
No disrespect, you know
I don't know you so
I will not disrespect, so don't please press eject
On the tape cassette, and don't knock it out of your decks
So with much respect, obliged, when I rhyme
Sometimes some things just pop out, sometimes
I must be a, I forgot the medical name
Not a narcoleptic that be sleepin'
How people was sleepin' when I made it deeper
And I gotta be creepin' cause you know they didn't peep it
Uh, they call me Rockafella's best little secret
Uh, I got the beats for the Jeep
When people used to rock Amigo's and Suzuki's
And the Isuzu's, this the way you flow
Do flow, aye yo you just like Menudo
Played out about mad years ago
And uh, I could rock off the top, I got years of flow
I got so many albums to go, at least about seven
Jesus Walks had me all the way
Thought I was gon' rhyme that, no you didn't time that
Yo that's where the line's at
Look at my shows, look how long that the line's at
All the way to the back, sold out, one night
That's the way it is when you done it right
Take time to drop a album, don't just be buyin' beats from everybody
Cause everybody ain't got it, I got it
I get it, I only give it to those who really live it
Like Jay-Z, the Game, and my dogs that really did it
Like Kweli, like Common, like dudes that really spit it
I'm talkin' 'bout they go onto the radio and hit it
And as far as makin' your songs, it's all wrong
You be doin' everything that everybody else is on
Man, I'mma break it down, let me take it down
Here goes the instructions on how to not say nothin'
Look, you take the crack concept
And you do that 'til it's all dead and gone, you do it all wrong
Now uh, you take the car concept
And I see it every video, every single place I go
Same shit

[Bridge 3: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
Man you know the beat ran out on me
I was gonna, I was gonna, I was gonna break down
(That was mean, that was mean!) I was gonna break down to people
Exactly how to make the good song and the good album for a change
(Let's go, let's go, let's go!)

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
First of all, what you need's a beat from me
If you can't get a beat from me, get a beat from your guy
He'll prolly do it for free
And if he do it like 

[?] he'll prolly do it for E
And if he do 

[?], he'll prolly do it for skeet
Yo, yo-yo, yo-yo-yo, you gotta bring with your flow
You gotta take it on-beat and off-beat
And don't rap on no fuckin' soft beats
You know that real hard shit, regardless, I played my part in this
Like, this Corner beat, this what you want when you want a beat
And that's when you really is gonna be
A hip-hop legend like Kan, like Kan
Like, of course the Louis Vuitton, 'ton, don, don
If I do say so, myself
And I do all the time, every rhyme
Cause I'm, I'm feelin' myself
And if you was me, you'd be feelin' yourself, you see
If you out in London, you just hopped on a plane
And you just came out of the bathroom, you just got you some brain
Uh, you doin' your thing
And plus you flossin' that Rocafella chain
Aye yo, you know you let Kan spit on 'em
I'm rockin' the Rocafella chain with no conflicts on 'em
Oh, oh
Now let me bring it back to the flow, flow
And how you make the album and you make some dough, dough
Get you a good manager cause your manager'll fuck your game up
Fuck your name up
And uh, if you've been runnin' to a 

[?]
Trade your chain for some studio time
See a lot of people be flossin' before they get a chance to
A lot of people want club records they wanna dance to
A lot of people want basslines, they will enhance you
Bass in the club is good too, what you should do
Is prolly get a single like Alicia Keys
And if you don't know her, holla at Alicia please
You know one of 'em light skin bitches with the braids
Actin' like they got it made

[?] you give a dawg with a fade
You get somebody that's weak, you get somebody that you know can't flow
And you rap before him, and let him go
And people gon' be like well least you was better than dude
And 

[?] I don't mean to be rude
And another thing you can do
If you could channel the spirits like I channel
I'm not talkin' 'bout lightin' candles, I'm not talkin' sayonce
I'm talkin' 'bout talkin' to God, I mean just like once
What I do before I rhyme, every day is I pray
I pray to God that he make these songs in a certain way
I let him speak through me, through the beats, through the music
I mean, sometimes I go into the booth and lose it
I mean, I know he speakin' when I freak it in it a way
That I coulda never thought of somethin' better to say
So, our father, who art up above us
I know any time we fuck, you still love us
Like when I'm cursin' in my verses and I even do, what's worse is
When I'm spendin' too much, spendin' on purses
And shoes for my girl when I should be helpin' the world
Give back to the charity, he still don't embarrass me
He still let me be, He still keep it real
See that's the thing about humans, we got free will
See the angels gotta do exactly what God want 'em to do
God is still with you, even when we don't do
So, follow the path, follow the laws
Follow the reason, the reasons why it's wrong
You never heard a freestyle like this before-'fore
And I know that hip-hop fans want more

[Outro: Kanye West]
Westwood, what's good
Holla at your boy, Kanye the Louis Vuitton Don
The Roca stay, buildin'
Yeah, it's G.O.O.D. Music baby
After you freestyle like that you just talk shit for about eight minutes

[Intro]
This first song is called "A World on Fire"
AHHH!! AHHHHH!!!
This next song is a little bit longer than that one
It's really sad, it's about how sad I am, it's called "Sad"
Get on my level, Madison
Picture a depressed onion cutting itself

[Verse 1]
I met a homeless man named Rich
He wasn't, isn't that terrible?
I saw a flyer for a lost dog and the dog didn't have any legs
I saw a diabetic kid trick or treating
I saw a giraffe who had a short neck
That was sad, or a deer
I saw an old man get hit by a train
He didn't see it in the pouring rain
He didn't hear me shout "Look out for the train"
'Cause I didn't say anything

[Interlude]
I just thought to myself, "Oh this is gonna be sad"
And it was. I'm a genius

[Verse 2]
I saw a man with only one eye... in a 3D movie
I saw a little boy drop his ice cream cone directly on his mother's corpse
I saw a kitten stuck in a tree then the kitten jumped off and he hung itself
I saw a boy who had red hair
I went to a store looking for something to buy
But they only sold paintings of the same sad guy
No, wait! This store sells mirrors!
See what I did there?
Let's rock!
No...

[Interlude]
The world's so sad, Madison
Pain, war, genocide, racism, sexism
But I gotta remember there are good things about it too
Like the fact that none of that's happening to me, score!
Still though, it's hard not to be sad about it
How do y'all do it?
I've been telling you terribly sad things this whole song, you haven't been sad at all
You've been happy. No, you’ve been laughing
That’s it, laughter, it’s the key to everything
It’s the way to solve all the sadness in the world
I mean, not for people who are actually sad, but for the people like us who’ve gotta fucking deal with ‘em all the time
Being a comedian isn’t being an insensitive prick capitalizing on the most animalistic impulses of the public, it’s being a hero!
The world isn’t sad. The world’s funny! I get it now! I'm a sociopath!

[Verse 3]
I saw an old man slip and fall, what a fucking idiot
I saw a woman at her daughter’s funeral
Hahaha! Classic comedy!
Everything that once was sad is somehow funny now
The Holocaust and 9/11?
That shit’s funny 24/7
'Cause tragedy will be exclusively joked about
Because my empathy is bumming me out
Goodbye sadness
Hello jokes
Thank you very much

[Verse 1]
Oh so long for this night I prayed
That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbon's in the sky for our love
If allowed may I touch your hand
And if pleased may I once again
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

[Chorus]
Do...Do
Do Do Do Do Do
HMM HMM

[Verse 2]
This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love
We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry
From now on it will be you and I
And our ribbon in the sky
Ribbon in the sky
A ribbon in the sky for our love

[Chorus]
Do...Do
Do Do Do Do Do
HMM HMM

[Outro]
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
Can't love her, can't trust her (fuck that ho)
I swear that I can't put no one above her (what)
That money (money), what we live for (gettin' it)
Find out, that she stealin' I'mma kill her
Swear I can't love her, can't trust her
I'd be a damn fool just to cuff her
Can't love her, can't trust her
Can't love her, can't trust her

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Drop, Phantom, camera, Rolls
Tripped her out her pantyhose
She heard Gucci Mane's a dog (woof)
You know the way I handle hoes
All my hoes got bitches too
All my guns come with extensions
Girl who the fuck you talkin' to?
Better watch your tone and get out my business
She always home I'm always gone
Ho stick to me just like cologne
Kush is still Guwop cologne
I smell like five pounds of strong
She won't believe me, she won't believe me
She don't believe me, she don't believe me
G-G-Gucci Mane be real and flexin'
I can buy thirty five SS's
She call my phone I hit decline
And I ain't fine with fuckin' textin'
Cold dirty world you better wear your boots
You know it's hurtin' me to hurt you it hurts me too
I know I got a cold heart but baby not about you
I know I lie but if the shoes changed you'd lie too
My ride or die bitch she gone and I miss my boo
I ride by you in the coupe fuck I miss my roof

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
Can't love her, can't trust her (fuck that ho)
I swear that I can't put no one above her (what)
That money (money), what we live for (gettin' it)
Find out, that she stealin' I'mma kill her
Swear I can't love her, can't trust her
I'd be a damn fool just to cuff her
Can't love her, can't trust her
Can't love her, can't trust her

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Who? Rich Homie baby
First of all, I can't trust no woman
So baby leave, all my bitches
Take off like Bessie Coleman
Bitch you freakin', niggas ain't speakin'
Let them know this
Them niggas leachin', give me back
All my shit you owe me
That trigger squeezin', shootin'
At all these motherfuckers
Breakin' on polices, fuck dinner trays
Got three covers
Straight out them trenches
Me and my nigga workin' double
He love them millions
Know what the crazy thing is?
I hate I love 'em (I do)
Oh, me and Guwop straight up East Atlanta with it
Word around town? (What's that?) Your new drop rented
(I know) I got loose knots in my denim (yeah)
And a shoe box full of benji's (Rich Homie)
Two shots and I'm in 'em

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
Can't love her, can't trust her (fuck that ho)
I swear that I can't put no one above her (what)
That money (money), what we live for (gettin' it)
Find out, that she stealin' I'mma kill her
Swear I can't love her, can't trust her
I'd be a damn fool just to cuff her
Can't love her, can't trust her
Can't love her, can't trust her

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
I heard she can do some tricks with her mouth nigga
Heard that bitch got a thing for them Boss niggas
Heard she be lyin' on them boys that floss nigga
I heard she can do some tricks with her mouth nigga
I heard (ugh) I heard (what) I heard (what)

I heard that bitch stay on her shit
So you know the ho loyal
I heard that bitch got a bitch
Come to find out she been lyin', she from Florida
Shawty make sense (cents), she a dime and a quarter
She pay her rent and she spoil her daughter
And that don't mean shit cause the bitch still lied
No eyes, I'm blind
To the fact that a bitch
Ain't even got a dime, she broke
But she fine, she need help
She tired, they listenin'
She wired, she snitchin'
Be quiet, I'm runnin'
I'm hidin' my truck
Outside, it runnin'
And I'm out I'm smashin'
Me and Gucci, we wildin'
We laughin', Cinemax
It's a movie, hit the gas
And we'll lose 'em fifty bags
And I'll move 'em, nigga ask
I do this, four bitches one jacuzzi

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
I heard she can do some tricks with her mouth nigga
Heard that bitch got a thing for them Boss niggas

I heard she can do some tricks with her mouth nigga

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
She suck the dick like no teeth
She on her knees like she got no knees
It's three and we ain't got no lean
Gotta call somebody need more PT
I walk straight in it don't frisk me
Don't run up on Wop that's risky
I'm a black silverback with big nuts
Big bomb, big pistol
Hundred fifty in this handgun
Fuck with me, nigga fuck with me
I met a bad bitch, she was a bad bitch
But no draft pick cos she a broke bitch
Go hang yourself here the rope bitch
Drink two shots of Clorox, bitch
God damn you got a mouth on you could be a model
Can't really put no price on you, cause baby swallow
Suck my dick and lick my balls all night girl you a baller
And if I ever see the bitch in LIV she get a bottle
For my ex girl at Central Station, 300 dollars
And you can keep your husband, I don't want your ho don't need the problems
Sippin' lean while she suckin' my dick, I got a boner
Smokin' weed while she eatin' other bitches cause I'm a stoner
Rich Homie Quan and Gucci, we trap scholars

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
I heard she can do some tricks with her mouth nigga

[Intro: Delusional Thomas]
Hallelujah, thank God I have a future
Prayin' I don't waste it gettin' faded
'Cause I'm smokin' ********* until I'm coughin' up tar
Feel the surge, energy curve like a lumbar
I don't act hard, I still read Babar
Trippin' out, lookin' at a bunch of Google map stars
Shit, they got a app for... that

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
But me, I'm still trapped inside my head
It kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm livin' paradise, so what I have to worry 'bout?
Dealin' with these demons, feel the pressure
Find the perfect style (Perfect style)
Makin' sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
And I experience a touch of my epiphany in color form
Difference between love and war inform me, I'm above the norm (Above the norm)
Give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts
Rhymin' like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed
I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice
And I don't know what I'm runnin' from, but I'm runnin' still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothin' real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fuckin' deal (Fuckin' deal)
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil
But I want that Rolls-Royce that the homie Lennon drove
So, if you don't talk about some money, I'ma send you home
Unconventional, special but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's lettin' me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity, I let 'em go (Let 'em go)
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow (Would let it slow)
That's just me all wildin' out and bein' extra though (Extra though)
Yeah

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
And if God was a human, it'd be yours truly
Watchin' horror movies with some foreign groupies
Thinkin' this decor suits me (This decor suits me)
I do drugs, get more loopy
I'm in tune to ancient jujitsu spirituals, it's blissful (It's blissful)
Lookin' out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet (Could finally meet)
I think I'm JFK's final speech, they try assassinatin' all of my beliefs
(But I'm asleep) So whisper to me for the peace of mind
And he be high, some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine (Shrine)
Twenty thousand on my watch 'cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine (Be divine)
Yeah, can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now, it's just not the same (Not the same)
I'm lookin' out my window, ashin' on the pane (Ashin' on the pane)
Shit, wonder if I lost my way (Lost my way)

[Verse 3: Delusional Thomas]
Yeah, don't you ever wanna hide away? (Hide away)
Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today (Die today)
I'll greet the devil with a smilin' face (Smilin' face)
Shit, that God fellow may reside in space
As, times are wastin', I'm freebasin' with Freemasons
My girl's switchin' the locks, the keys keep changin' (Keep changin')
Dreamin' of places, my own personal creations
If there's a party in Heaven I plan to leave wasted (Leave wasted)
Retracin' my steps way back to Biblical times
We-we all gon' end up meetin' at the finishin' line

[Outro: Mac Miller]
And these words that I command you today shall be in your heart
And you shall teach them diligently to your children
And you shall speak of them when you sit at home
And when you walk along the way, and when you lie down
And when you rise up, I am the lord, your god

[Intro]
Yah
Yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Look
Concoction of hamentashens (Okay)
Launchin' a bottle rocket (Okay)
Done bein' nice, I'm here for your life and all the profits (Whoa)
I'm not your conscience, you nuts? Almonds and Häagen-Dazs
Auction off your grandfather's watch from the Holocaust (Okay)
I'm iconic, naked, walk in the garden bird watchin'
Alarmin' all of these cardinals like I need a pope (Pope)
Puffin' that white smoke (Smoke,) get faded and play the maestro
I'm ice cold, bunny slippers, nice robe (Probably velvet)
Sneaky bitch stole my Rollie last night, yo (Night, yo)
I might know some dyke hoes who can fight though (Yeah!)
Walkin' on a tight rope, underneath a microscope
But close-up we all just molecules and isotopes (That's very deep)
My psychic don't know the future
To live life, you kids might just close your computer (Get some exercise)
The street lights might blind you though (Blind you though)
Make a collage and look at it through a kaleidoscope

[Chorus]
There's a bird in the sky
Look at him fly, why?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Ugh
Let the money pile, I'll be runnin' wild
Life's a motherfuckin' joke so we fuck around
Feel like I do this in my sleep (Do this in my sleep)
Literally, I do this in my sleep

[Interlude]
It's an impression of Bueller
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
A little TV money (Okay), dollars for sense of humor (Yeah)
Scholar but my attendance like Bueller, so no use for a tutor
Some cold brews in the cooler (Have one,) comin' through
In the wood-grain PT Cruiser, stuntin' (Stuntin')
I'm pissed off like a blind person lookin' for a restroom (Restroom)
Prob'ly be dead soon, inhalin' cigarette fumes *Coughs*
Sorry for that blind people comment, that was just rude (Yeah)
And I was raised better, say, "God bless you" (God bless you,) haha
I'm Kenny Powers, you more of a Debbie Downer
My bitch takin' off her trousers every time I get around her
I'm nasty, I never shower, go sleep on a bed of flowers
Not into this conversation, I've been in my head for hours, I'm out

[Chorus]
There's a bird in the sky
Look at him fly, why?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Ugh
Let the money pile, I'll be runnin' wild
Life's a motherfuckin' joke so we fuck around
Feel like I do this in my sleep (Do this in my sleep)
Literally, I do this in my sleep

[Intro: Mac Miller]
No
Yeah
No
Ugh

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Passport, fillin' it up with stamps
Set a camp up on my land, swam the rivers of Japan (Yeah)
She keep on askin' for a rack, so I ran
Lookin' back, like, you can't see who I am
Think my bitch don't know me no more (No more)
'Cause every time she's sad, I can't console her no more (No more)
If money buy you love (Love), then love's not enough ('Nough)
So, tell me why you on your knees cryin' to the floor
If you had the chance
Would you take the time you need to make it right?
The clouds are gray, but would you pay the price to paint 'em white?
Might have a baby on the way
'Cause I've been goin' in raw, it feel better, that real pleasure
I'm not real, I think I never was (Was)
I get a rush every time she let me get a touch (Touch)
I need to feel that (Love), I need to feel that (Pain)
My garden hasn't been growin', so can you bring that (Rain)?
I keep my head up (High), a little fed up (Lies)
They always tell me where my mind is on this LP
I don't (Exist), hiero-(Glyphics)
Pyro-(Technics), meta-(Physics)
Telekinetics put 50K on my credit card (Card)
Look for the answers, I'm searchin' but I ain't gettin' far (Far)
Let's get it on, I'm royal like Tenenbaums in Lebanon
Decepticon, hit it 'til my head is gone

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
Point me to a road (To a road)
And I'ma run it, bloodhound with my nose (My nose)
To the money, ain't fuckin' with these hoes (Never that)
Gettin' ducats 'til I die, while my foes (My foes)
Busy runnin', fuck it, marijuana smoke in my stomach (Um)
Toasted in public (Ugh)
Head in the clouds, when my toes in the struggle
Like, who dare to test it? (Test this)
There's a few new rules in effect, bitch (Ugh, yeah; in effect, bitch)
Listen up, go

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
See, this a rather spooky action movie, roll it up and pass it to me
Hash and booty, absolutely, smack a groupie actin' boujee
(See a creature) At its beauty (Need a feature) Rather shoot me
Truly, bitches must have them bad jeans and back is Coogi
Had to do these rapper tunes to let 'em know the trap is booming
Past the views of Catholic schoolers, fact
But you, in fact, assuming
Back to doing (Cash pursuing), posted up like (Patrick Ewing)
Rapper feuds are sad if you would battle for a stack or two
These... eloquent irrelevant sentences show my penmanship
Indefinite boundaries show you the end of it
Don't forget, you infested in nesting crevices
Allowin' birds to fall to their death before they even fly (Brr-r!)
He and I are not the same
Doctor, doctor, please prescribe me somethin' for the pain
Money in machines ('Chines)
Those will make you change (Change)
If I go tomorrow, I just hope it ain't in vain, but I can't complain

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
Point me to a road (To a road)
And I'ma run it, bloodhound with my nose (My nose)
To the money, ain't fuckin' with these hoes (Never that)
Gettin' ducats 'til I die, while my foes (My foes)
Busy runnin', fuck it, marijuana smoke in my stomach (Um)
Toasted in public (Ugh)
Head in the clouds, when my toes in the struggle
Like, who dare to test it? (Test this)
There's a few new rules in effect, bitch (In effect, bitch)
Listen up, go

[Intro: Tree Jay & Mac Miller]
Quack, quack
Uh
Uh-huh
Uh

[Verse 1]
I'm
Chillin' for an hour, smokin' weed, watchin' Worldstar
Benz in the garage, pro'bly gotta drive your girl car (Ooh)
You ain't a rapper if my homies never heard y'all
I just spit a punchline, smile then they bird call (Brr)
Hit your sister in the face with a Nerf Ball (Ouch)
Dealin' with some shit that really don't concern y'all (Nah)
Punch a fan if he get a fucking word wrong
Wavy, givin' you some shit that you can surf on (cellphone)
Findin' me a bitch I can swerve on (Swerve on)
Frank Thomas, homie, 'bout to put the hurt on (Hurt on)
Your bitch a night light, in bed she turned on
Roll some weed, tell her burn one, burn one

[Hook]
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one (Burn one)
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one (Yeah)
Burn one, burn one, burn, burn, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn, burn, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn, burn, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn, burn, burn one

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I used to give a fuck about success
Now I just want to see Mila Kunis undress (Yep)
Hope she down for butt sex (Yep,) it would be a cum fest (Yep)
Uh, sorry, that's some shit I had to confess (Uh-huh)
Crazy-ass bitch doing 911 threats
Came in the game smoking Newport Hundreds
Now I'm at the top and the crown fit, gold on my outfit
Surrounded by this pussy I'ma drown in (Drown in)
You got that wet pack, bitch, come and gimme that (Come and gimme that)
You know we wanna know where them titties at (Where the titties at?)
Got 'em gassed, they be askin' what I'm cooking wit'
Have your little brother ask your moms what a pussy is (Uh)
Corruption, stunting at the function
Your girl pussy smell like Sour Cream & Onion (Ugh)
Pay attention, you gon' learn somethin'
Roll that weed up, burn one

[Hook]
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one (Uh)
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one (Woo)
Burn one, burn one, burn, burn, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn, burn, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn, burn, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn, burn, burn one (I think I fucked it up again, but whatever)

[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Soul!

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Ever since a nigga had recess
Mothafucka felt like a grown-up (Soulo)
Momma come and bitch about a curfew
I was still playin' 'round the corner
Seven years old, saw my first porno
Damn, that fucked me up
At ten, I bust my first nut on this older ho gut, but so what?
Let's recap, the Earth spinnin' too rapid
I'm livin' too fast, sinning's a habit
I can't hack, fornicate, act this rabid
One bean short of an acid tablet
The security guard sparks my cigarette
The old head go 'head, cop me a brew
Sometimes them Koreans be cool
These shades make me look twenty-two
They say, "You'll learn when you get older"
I just say that that ain't true
That just mean when you was younger
You ain't get turnt up like us, fool
Just got L's so I'm ridin' high, still in high school but I do
Everything I will do, when I'm twenty-five, no lie (Uh)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I was young with ambition, fucked around with these hoes (Hoes)
Never needed permission, went and lived the life that I chose (Chose)
Premonition-type visions, you see the world as it goes (Goes)
Tell 'em all what they missin', while I watch it as it unfolds
I'm dodgin' my death, confident kid
I was tryna grow up with the best (Oh, oh)
Watchin' my step, never no college plan
Found myself noddin' off always on test-day
I coulda been a great graduate
Woulda got one of them hoes from "The Bachelor"
Could've been smart, could've been a doctor
Life full of drama, little soap opera
Fallin' in love, lucky that I caught ya
Almost got her knocked up, would've been a father
All about energy, make good memories
I'm the fuckin' Dalai Lama (Ooh!)
Only eighteen but I had my own business
Then I got fame like, "What the fuck is this?"
Whole bunch of cameras, fake-ass bitches (Yeah, yeah)
Everybody around wanna treat me all different
Oh, I'm cool, 'cause I got money? (All this money)
Back in high school, none of these hoes was tryna fuck me (Fuck me)
I thought it was a conspiracy
Sometimes my thoughts start scarin' me
You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit's for the parakeets

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
They, they, they been lookin' for somebody like me
Big bag of weed and a muddy iced tea
Somethin' brand new, wonder what it might be
You party off them drugs, movin' at a nice speed
If you eighteen years and older
Eighteen years and older
If you eighteen years and older
Eighteen years and older

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
I wanna rule the world, take care of my family
And take care of my girl, plant a couple seeds
Blaze a gang of trees
Went to see a rated R movie 'bout me
They said you must be
Eighteen years and older
Eighteen years and older
Eighteen years and older
Eighteen years and older
Eighteen years and older

[Intro]
Yup, yup
Yup
Uh

[Verse 1]
I hope you're proud of me, dude I grew to be
Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
Going through memories like they were movie scenes
I know I been the shit, all these people full of me
I admit, I guess I'm full of myself, too
There's just a bunch of shit, I wish I could tell you, but
This life move fast, I never knew that
Yours wouldn't have lasted, the dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stop
For now, I need to run to any place that a train stops
And everybody wanna talk to me about some business shit
Never really listening, couldn't get real interested
My days gettin' darker, so the haze get sparked up
All this hate sound the same when my name get brought up
You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up
So I could meet your son and talk you up

[Chorus]
I remember
When we were just kids
We knew nothing at all
And we would talk about the life we lived in
West Virginia
Lost somewhere out in
West Virginia

[Verse 2]
It's a
Dark sign when your friends start dyin'
Like, "How could he go? He was part-lion"
Life goes on, the tears all dried and
Couple years are gone by by then, uh
Can you please help me find my friend?
I give you anything you need multiplied by ten
I heard he moved to a place where the time don't end
So you don't need money, all you got is time to spend
Yeah, life's short, don't ever question the length
It's cool to cry, don't ever question your strength
I recommend no limits, intricate thought
Go 'head, just give it a shot, you'll remember shit you forgot

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause way back then I didn't know shit
And I don't know shit now
When the world's lookin' hopeless
I'ma still hold shit down

[Chorus]
I remember
When we were just kids
We knew nothing at all
And we would talk about the life we lived in
West Virginia
Lost somewhere out in
West Virginia

[Guitar Solo]

[Intro]
Yeah
Can you feel it?
No, no, don't—don't answer that, that was a rhetorical question
Ahem, rhetorical (Rhetorical)
Uh

[Verse 1]
Forever life been never nice, we expedite the process (Yeah)
And every night I get advice, 'cause life is way too complex (Yep)
Heaven's lights are hella bright, ironic how that came to be
But can't you see? This angel speaks
She's sayin' the place is safe for me
I told her, "Wait for me," the make-believer normally disguise
Transform before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs
The morning rises and I'm fast asleep
Somewhere off in the master suite
Havin' dreams of Latin queens and nasty freaks
My mind, it wanders to places yonder and even farther
When I'm sleep walkin', I'm Stephen Jobs or I'm Peter Parker
A genius author, a Jesus preachin' just to feed his daughter
The weed to spark up, yeah, he's a goner, fuck these prima-donnas (Woah)
I'll always wonder what happened three thousand years ago
I like to toy with the idea that we really know
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?
In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me, we are kings

[Chorus]
I'm wearin' a blindfold, like, "Where did the time go?"
I know you hear me up there, give me a sign though
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Baby, I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Take me away, girl, somewhere they won't be
Hold me closely, look at me, don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind go?
Said, will you follow me wherever my mind go, ho?

[Interlude]
I'm just tryin' to make it all make sense
Uh

[Verse 2]
As you hypothesize on how to monetize and take advantage of
All the time we fall behind, get lost in this Aquarium (Gone)
America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up
We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria
Confessions that I have, the curiosity about life and death
Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest
Read about the meanings of dreaming and all its messages
Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes (Uh-huh)
We all in search for substance (Substance)
That drugs your pain and numbness (Numbness)
Circumstances advancin' the second chance for this beloved
I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this comin' (Comin')
But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrow's trend (Not again)
Your life, it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained
Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days (Forgotten days)
Life, it works in such mysterious ways (Ways)
All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say, ayy

[Chorus]
I'm wearin' a blindfold, like, "Where did the time go?"
I know you hear me up there, give me a sign though
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Baby, I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Take me away, girl, somewhere they won't be
Hold me closely, look at me, don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind go?
Said, will you follow me wherever my mind go, ho?

[Outro]
(Wherever my mind goes)
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
(Wherever your mind goes)
Will you follow me wherever my mind go, ho?
(

[?])
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
(

[?])
Will you follow me wherever my mind go, ho?
Will you follow me wherever my mind go, ho?
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Will you follow me wherever my mind go, ho?
Will you follow me wherever my mind go, ho?

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Uh, bitches stay hatin', this is claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid
Bitches stay hatin', this is claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid picture

[Verse 1: Vinny Radio]
Fresh off a steroid swisher
Pistol at the peephole, that's a paranoid nigga
One of a kind though, ain't nobody close to me
Your ass is straight over D, I'll bag it like groceries
It's whatever though, whatever cross my mind
Haters got no watch, I ain't got the time
Vinny got more flow than a box of wine
Rare as a copper dime, I got an awkward mind
But it's beautiful, like Russel Crowe
Fire at the fingertips, can't extinguish it
Shorty gave me tight head without shrinkin' it
Coolest kid out, on my Chuck Inglish shit
Mac and Vinny always get the people loose
Fall back, strike back, just like evil do
The birds prey on us like eagles do
It's like claymation the way they bend and move

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Uh, bitches stay hatin', this is claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid
Bitches stay hatin', this is claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though? (Yeah)
I'ma be a ghost (Yeah), take a Polaroid picture

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Monster and Michael Keaton, I'm offin' you while you sleep
And you talkin' but it's so cheap, and I'm popular for a reason
I got a pool but it's sharks swimmin' in the deep end
Don't get much sleep, two minutes to get a dream in
Is all you need, it's crazy
The colony was lost at sea gettin' wavy
The rawest rapper, baby forehead autographer
On top of Saturn, I'm sendin' shots from a rocket blaster
Believe me, this is where geniuses live
It's Most Dope, we holier than all of Jesus' kids
But we speakin' to heathens and all of these Even Stevens
Who don't need a reason, just want a bitch they can feed with semen
No need for sleepin', Cheeba gon' keep me dreamin', I'm faded
Been in Cali a lil' too long, it got me jaded
Hit Japan and I'm Instagrammin' camera-shy Samurais
Fuckin' up a Jerm beat, teach you how to vandalize
The bandana Santana tied
The sound amplified screams on Kennywood's Steel Phantom rides
My pockets fat, I'm still lookin' for some pants my size
They over-analyze everything I fantasize
We could have a conversation, we could pantomime
Girl, you could come a little closer, put your hand in mine
This life a prison, it's time to set you free
Watchin' movies in silence, describin' what I see

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Uh, bitches stay hatin', this is claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid
Bitches stay hatin', this is claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid picture

[Intro]
See, it's brackets, nigga
Them hoes ain't fuckin' you
'Cause you ain't in that bracket, nigga
Learn life, it's levels to this shit, young boy
Ayy, O, you feel me?

[Chorus]
Lil' nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit—oh Lord!

[Verse 1]
'Cause it's levels to this shit, levels to this shit
Can't fuck my ho, 'cause it's levels to this bitch
And I be rockin' Prada like a devil in this bitch
And a Birkin bag like a gold medal to this bitch
And I'm heavy as it get
Shinin' like a motherfuckin' bezel on my wrist
All my niggas mobbin' so we heavy in this bitch
Thirty grand for the Muller, that's a Chevy on my wrist
Woo! Cocaine Mulsanne
Young nigga blowin' up; Kurt Cobain—boom!
Skatin' on them like I'm Lil Wayne
And this 458 don't do the lil' lane—vroom!
Swerve on 'em, niggas gotta nerve on 'em
'Cause I heard the feds got him and he had them birds on him
But a nigga back home and now niggas roll with him
Caught a case, what you think? Nigga fuckin' told on him
I ain't get my shit snatched yet
You ain't get your bitch back yet
One call, niggas aim that TEC
Blood drawn, headshot, nigga brains on step
Hot shit if you pop shit
And I don't want your opinion if you ain't got shit
We young niggas, we winnin', I pull up, drop shit
Mob shit, with more keys than a locksmith

[Chorus]
Lil' nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit—oh Lord!

[Verse 2]
Damn, Tommy, you ain't got no job!
DC, we the motherfuckin' mob
Young nigga gettin' straight to the money
In a Range with your honey, I pull up, like, "Ahh!"
I make them power moves with Jay and them
Them boys shootin', don't play with them
Maybach, Rozay and them
Rollin' down Collins, call Rugs, hit the A with them
Compound niggas live now
If it's the finals I'm ballin' like I'm LeBron now
I call up Onyx and tell them bitches to calm down
I treat the jet like a taxi the way I'm flyin' round
And I don't fuck with no niggas
If they don't fuck with my niggas
And I ain't fuckin' no bitches, if they fuckin' my niggas

[Chorus]
Lil' nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit—oh Lord!

[Verse 3]
One time for the real niggas
Two times for the bad bitches
Y'all suckas be cuffin' hoes
'Cause y'all suckas never had bitches
I hit the dealer, bought another Rolls
That's the reason why you mad, nigga?
That's the reason why you hatin' on me?
I love ballin'—my bad, nigga
'Cause it's levels to this shit, levels to this shit
Can't fuck my ho, 'cause it's levels to this bitch
'Cause it's levels to this bitch
And a Birkin bag like a gold medal to this bitch
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, hold up!

[Chorus]
Lil' nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit—oh Lord!

[Verse 1]
Haven't we met?
You're some kind of beautiful stranger
You could be good for me
I've had the taste for danger
If I'm smart then I'll run away
But I'm not, so I guess I'll stay
Heaven forbid
I'll take my chance on a beautiful stranger

[Pre-Chorus]
I looked into your eyes
And my world came tumbling down
You're the devil in disguise
That's why I'm singing this song
To know you is to love you

[Chorus]
You're everywhere I go
And everybody knows
To love you is to be part of you
I've paid for you with tears
And swallowed all my pride

[Refrain]
Da-da-da da-da-da-da da da-da, dum
Beautiful stranger
Da-da-da da-da-da-da da da-da, dum
Beautiful stranger

[Verse 2]
If I'm smart then I'll run away
But I'm not so I guess I'll stay
Haven't you heard?
I fell in love with a beautiful stranger

[Pre-Chorus]
I looked into your face
My heart was dancing all over the place
I'd like to change my point of view
If I could just forget about you

[Chorus]
To know you is to love you
You're everywhere I go
And everybody knows

[Pre-Chorus]
I looked into your eyes
And my world came tumbling down
You're the devil in disguise
That's why I'm singing this song to you
To know you is to love you

[Chorus]
You're everywhere I go
And everybody knows
I've paid for you with tears
And swallowed all my pride

[Refrain]
Da-da-da da-da-da-da da da-da, dum
Beautiful stranger
Da-da-da da-da-da-da da da-da, dum
Beautiful stranger

[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
You know one thing I hate?
It's when a person come up to me or I hear somebody say, “It must be nice”
You know my answer that is, “You must be a hater”
Tell me why you mad fo' (Remo the Hitmaker)
Hey, listen here, Luda, we gotta keep it real, boy
We gon' do it like this, baby
Listen here, you know what I'm saying? Luda

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & Ludacris]
Tell me what they mad fo', come around the hood
See us sitting there looking good
Tell me what they mad fo' 'cause you be on the radio
Sounding like you made a million dollars
Yeah, time to start putting grown-ass men on time out
Tell me what they mad fo'
Huh? Tell me what they mad fo'
Go to the corner and cry somewhere, man
Tell me what they mad fo'
Old insecure ass, nigga, yo heart pump Kool-Aid, man
Tell me what they mad fo'
What you mad at me for? Luda

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Is it 'cause I got houses on every coast?
Or that I'm on that Forbes list makin' rich rappers look broke?
While they're blowin' that smoke, I'm blowin' a couple million, makin' a killin' stuntin' on impostors
Only rapper in the game with a Grammy and an Oscar (and the winner is...)
7-figure movie deals, 8 figure bank runs
And I'm still feedin' the same hood that I came from (yeah!)
Any car that you got, I've already drove
Any chick that you hit, my nigga, I've already hoed (I did, ow!)
Say it with your chest like these diamonds in my charm
Name on my headphones, label tatted on my arm (oh!)
Air traffic control say, “Ludacris is insane”
That niggas daughter's birthday's the tail number on his plane (tell 'em, real talk)
Fuck with me but nobody's fuckin' with me
Takin' a shot of my cognac, more millions, real G's chug it with me
If I'm happy, there's no reason you should be sad for (why?)
So will somebody, can somebody please

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & Meek Mill]
Tell me what they mad fo', ah, come around the hood
See us sitting there looking good, skrrt
Tell me what they mad fo' 'cause you be on the radio, yeah
Sounding like you made a million dollars
Tell me what they mad fo', ha
Tell me what they mad fo'
Is you niggas hatin' 'cause you mad
Or is you mad 'cause you hatin'?
Tell me what they mad fo'
Choose one, hater
Tell me what they mad fo'

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Now if these niggas hatin' on me, I'ma kill 'em dead
If I wasn't rappin' I'd be probably be in the feds
In the cell, gettin' mail, with a million dollar bail
But instead of countin' blues, I'ma take this YSL
And this Gucci, and this Louis, Prada 'cause I'm hotter
I used to ball in Philly, with that nina Iguodala
I beefs up in my Beamer, check aboard my collar (skrrt)
And when I check my bank account, I'm checkin' for them commas
I'm like all these niggas haters, all these bitches fuckin'
At 24 I went and bought a Ghost like it was nothin'
At 25 I bought that Aston Martin, now we stuntin'
And you nigga still talkin' all this money, shit, you bluffin'
You bluffin', you bluffin', I really think you bluffin'
100,000 dollars, magnum bottles just crush 'em
Now tell me why you hatin'? You hatin' 'cause you mad?
Or is you mad because you hatin'? Boy, you sad

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & Chris Brown]
Tell me what they mad fo', come around the hood
See us sitting there looking good
Tell me what they mad fo' 'cause you be on the radio
Sounding like you made a million dollars
Tell me what they mad fo'
Huh, tell me what they mad fo'
Tell me what they mad fo'
Tell me what they mad fo'
Haha, look, yeah, okay

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I see why you mad, I'm countin' all this money
And I'm poppin' all these tags, hoppin' to it, fuckin' bunnies
Real nigga, one hundred, you tryna do it, I done it
I spit sick on this rap shit, make 'em sick to they stomach
I'm clean, man, you hate, mad 'cause I make it keep it real with a real nigga
I got racks on racks and a black Maybach, call it black on black 'cause I kill niggas
In the club, all girls, no niggas, don't talk to me 'cause I ain't really tryna hear niggas
In the coupe, it's the truth and the roof go poof, vamoose, I can make it disappear, nigga
See this the type of shit that I be sayin'
Just because I'm ballin', that don't mean a nigga playin'
Yup, haters can blow me like a fan
Flyer than a bitch, I don't think I'ma ever land
But in the meantime, baby, what's your plan?
You can call me daddy but I can't be your man
Fiendin' like the addicts, when I pull it out, they panic
Bi-bi-bitch, I do damage, you gon' need an ambulance

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Tell me what they mad fo', come around the hood
See us sitting there looking good
Tell me what they mad fo' 'cause you be on the radio
Sounding like you made a million dollars
Tell me what they mad fo'
Huh, tell me what they mad fo'
Showtime
Tell me what they mad fo'
Put one hand in the air if you know somebody
That's mad at you right now for no reason
Tell me what they mad fo'
Can you hear me now? Ayy

[Verse 4: Swizz Beatz]
Ayy, ridin' around in my Jeep, bumpin' that 2Pac (ayy, ayy)
I'm walkin' around in my hood, cocked back two Glocks  (bam)
98 in my status, I came back, I'm the baddest
Christian's on my feet, I told you, I'm the baddest (damn, ayy)
All the way in Paris, don't talk, you'll get embarrassed (yeah)
My watch is fuckin' up, yeah, you get embarrassed (ayy)
500 hunnid on them racks, pulled out them stacks (get 'em, Gs)
Niggas talkin' crazy, drop top Maybachs (ow!)
My life is just ludicrous, sucker, you just new to this
430's pullin' up, godddamn we do this shit
Chickens and the waffles, chillin' in the villa
Bumpin' Ludaversal, gettin' that scrilla

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & Pusha T]
Tell me what they mad fo', huh, come around the hood, ayy
See us sitting there looking good
Ladies and gentleman
Tell me what they mad fo' 'cause you be on the radio
Sounding like you made a million dollars
Ha, tell me what they mad fo'
Yuugh
Tell me what they mad fo'
Woo
Tell me what they mad fo'
Hey Luda, you know why these haters mad right?
Tell me what they mad fo'
The truth shall set you free

[Verse 5: Pusha T]
If you sellin' all the records and you fuckin' all the bitches
And you sit a top of the charts and you livin' out your wishes
With your chains all smothered and your watches all glittered
And your Ghost and your Phantoms all comin' home to visit
Or maybe 'cause your bitches was never really your bitches
With your baby mama fuckin' every rapper in the business
Niggas sayin' you was better when the drugs was in your system
Now your crack swag gone ever since you came from prison
Got you tweetin' all stupid, is you skatin', is you dissin'?
Found out your Ghost leased and your Phantom just rented
Won’t need it in your name like Pac when he went missin'
Makaveli lives on so I'm ridin' on you bitches
Hail Mary be the witness, Lord Willin', I was dealin'
Stupid motherfuckin' five star, tatted on his ceilin'
Bulls eye, be the motherfuckin' target for this killin'
Ain't y'all the motherfuckers with the millions?

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Tell me what they mad fo', come around the hood
See us sitting there looking good
Tell me what they mad fo' 'cause you be on the radio
Sounding like you made a million dollars
Tell me what they mad fo'
Huh, tell me what they mad fo'
Tell me what they mad fo'
Tell me what they mad fo'

[Intro: Ludacris]
Hey, leggo

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ludacris]
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty on the floor 'cause she know a nigga watching
Dirty on the floor 'cause she know a nigga watching

So bend that ass for this cash on the floor, leggo

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Shake it, shake it like you mean it (yeah)
You take another shot, me and your girl gon' double team it (hey!)
She drop it to the floor like I ain't even never seen it
And runnin' that dirty mouth like I ain't even tryna clean it
So I, grab a cup, fill it to the brim
Then hand you a nightcap and say, "We goin' for a swim" (hey!)
Later on at the cribbo, hard as a armadillo
She said she thinks she love me, so I told that bitch, "Ditto"
Fetchin' these Georgia peaches then let 'em ride off they leashes
They thinkin' I'm so facetious 'til I beat that pussy to pieces
I'm checkin' they facial features, they shakin' like some sort of seizure
And thinkin' I'm some sort of creature, ATLien, nice to meet ya, Luda

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ludacris]
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty

So bend that ass for this cash on the floor, leggo

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Throw it, throw it like you know it (ooh!)
These girls be actin' shy but you just ain't afraid to show it (ha)
I got all this money and I'm damn sure finna blow it
'Cause she asked me for a drink and I'm damn sure finna pour it
I'ma, make it strong, she said she like it fruity
In another 30 minutes, I'll be feelin' on her booty (oh!)
An hour after that, I'll have her twisted like a cyclone
Legs wrapped around me 'til she squeeze me like a python
I call that slizzer, we both been gone off that liquor
She let down all her defenses and yes, I give her the business
With the quickness she came to her senses, while I'm tappin' and snappin' pictures
Relentless but so persistent, now she said it's just Ludacris' (woo!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ludacris]
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty on the floor 'cause she know a nigga watching
Dirty on the floor 'cause she know a nigga watching
She with her friends, they model
They popping ass like they popping bottles
I'm with my niggas, we got dough
So bend that ass for this cash on the floor, leggo

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Pop it, pop it like a stripper (stripper)
Pop it like a soda can, pop it for a Snicker
Pop it for these fast balls, throw it like a pitcher
When the waitress yellin', "Last call," drop it on a nigga, blaw
The stealth bomber, flew her to Punta Cana (ayy)
We sippin' on some coladas I'm takin' off her pyjamas
She nasty with a nice persona, she bitin' me like piranha
The modern day Jeffrey Dahmer, she must get it from her mama

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ludacris]
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty (yeah)
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty (yeah)
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty (yeah)
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty (ooh)
She dancing dirty on the floor 'cause she know a nigga watching
Dirty on the floor 'cause she know a nigga watching
She with her friends, they model (yeah)
They popping ass like they popping bottles (woah, woah, woah)

So bend that ass for this cash on the floor, leggo (yeah, yeah, girl)

[Verse 1]
Come away little lass
Come away to the water
To the ones that are waiting only for you
Come away little lass
Come away to the water
Away from the life that you always knew
We are calling to you

[Verse 2]
Come away little light
Come away to the darkness
In the shade of the night we’ll come looking for you
Come away little light
Come away to the darkness
To the ones appointed to see it through
We are calling for you
We are coming for you

[Verse 3]
Come away little lamb
Come away to the water

Come away little lamb
Come away to the slaughter
To the ones appointed to see this through

[Verse 4]
Come away little lamb
Come away to the water
To the arms that are waiting only for you
Come away little lamb come away to the slaughter
To the one appointed to see this through

We are coming for you
We are coming for you

[Intro]
I was missin' in action on the side of a carton
I was taken in a Datsun from a street in Acton
I was missin' in action on the side of a carton
I was taken in a Datsun from a street in Acton

[Verse 1]
I was sipping on a Rubicon, thinking 'bout where I come
It's all this for revolution
Cuttin' up the coupon, saving for a telephone
Can I call home? Please, can I go home?
I was sipping on a Rubicon, thinking 'bout where I come
It's all this for revolution
Cuttin' up the coupon, saving for a telephone
Can I call home? Please, can I go home?

[Pre-Chorus]
Painted nails, sunsets on horizons
Palm trees, silhouette smells amazing
Blindfolds under homemade lanterns
Somewhere in the Amazon, they're holding me ransom
Painted nails, sunsets on horizons
Palm trees, silhouette smells amazing
Blindfolds under homemade lanterns
Somewhere in the Amazon, they're holding me ransom

[Chorus]
Hello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?
Hello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?
Hello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?
Hello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?

[Verse 2]
Smoking on a Benson, tryin' to get me undone
Let me go, I don't want your attention
Under submission, out of frustration
I'll do it, I'll scream for the nation
Smoking on a Benson, tryin' to get me undone
Let me go, I don't want your attention
Under submission, out of frustration
I'll do it, I'll scream for the nation

[Pre-Chorus]
Painted nails, sunsets on horizons
Palm trees, silhouette smells amazing
Blindfolds under homemade lanterns
Somewhere in the Amazon, they're holding me ransom
Painted nails, sunsets on horizons
Palm trees, silhouette smells amazing
Blindfolds under homemade lanterns
Somewhere in the Amazon, they're holding me ransom

[Chorus]
Hello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?
Hello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?
Hello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?
Hello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?

[Verse 3]
Minutes turned to hours and became our dates
When we shared raindrops that turned into lakes
Bodies started merging and the lines got grey
Now I'm looking at him thinking maybe he's okay
Minutes turned to hours and became our dates
When we shared raindrops that turned into lakes
Bodies started merging and the lines got grey
Now I'm looking at him thinking maybe he's okay

[Outro]
Hello! This is M.I.A., it's okay, you forgot me
Hello! This is M.I.A., it's okay, you forgot me
Hello! This is M.I.A., it's okay, you forgot me
Hello! This is M.I.A., it's okay, you forgot me
Hello! This is M.I.A., it's okay, you forgot me

[Verse 1]
You got some nerve coming here
You got some nerve coming here
You stole it off, give it back
You stole it off, give it back

[Chorus]
Good morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all the magic
And took my memory

[Verse 2]
You know you should, but you don't
You know you should, but you don't

[Chorus]
Good morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all my magic
Took my melody

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna & Adam Levine]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

[Chorus: Adam Levine, Rihanna, Both]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Verse 2: Rihanna & Adam Levine]
Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes you burn to learn I'm with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine & Rihanna]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Rihanna]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Bridge: Adam Levine & Rihanna]
Baby, baby, please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind
(Promise not to leave me behind)
Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think, but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time
(Talk to me, yeah, talk to me)

[Chorus: Rihanna with Adam Levine]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
(Talk to me, yeah, talk to me)

[Chorus: Adam Levine, (Rihanna), Adam Levine & Rihanna]
Keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before (Did before)
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Ja Rule]
Aaaah

Niggas don't want it

Understand that, knawmean?
We doin this shit straight gangsta style, Gotti style nigga
Fuck y'all

Uh, uh, uh
Ja's the torture
The high class, toss to D
Grimy and gritty, outter limits in this inner city
Niggas is definately assed-out, fuckin wit me
End up wit a gun in your mouth, straight cheese
I should bust em
Cuz see me killin you don't mean nothin
I'll put you through a lifetime of sufferin nigga
Then you'll learn that bridges ain't made to be burned
Drug money is rightfully earned, well deserved
Some rules just think, are fit for takes
And Ja's rules make em large, that you fatefully break
Unless you wanna get spanked, with the 9 fully loaded
We can murder each other, meet at the Crossroads
And if I die tonight, in the immortal words of Pac
My niggas gonna hunt you till you drop, believe that
Niggas is capable of all that, take your mom for ransom
Give little kids back, that's the way we do things
Never leave shells, never drop names
Roll with the game as it change
Ja's to blame, I'ma let this world share my pain
In my demise you can put it on my grave
"Here lies a lost soul of rage, seen brighter days
And outta darkness done graduated, may he lay"
And this I swear, here in Hell we don't play fair
Cross the line, with my nine I'll be bringin you here
Motherfuckers

[DMX]
Check it out y'all

Check it out y'all
Check it out, check it out
Check it out y'all

Dizown, with the dizark, cuz that's that kid
Unmask that kid, look at that bastard kid
That don't mind having to break shit or take shit
That mutherfucker, if you ain't me you ain't shit
You fuckin faggot
You know I coulda been stuck it to you
Nigga I would even think about fuckin wit you
But I bet now your man is thinkin twice bout who to fuck wit
Shit is gettin bad, I'm robbin niggas I grew up with
And I know it's just a matter of time before I get shot
I'ma torture this niggas little sister and make him watch
Give a nigga a little room, now he's tryin to house shit
But I bet you look back on some mouse shit
When I put this in your mouth, bitch
Aaaah, a nigga bein broken off quick
Yeeck, is the sound he makes chockin off dick
How you feel, he eatin with a straw he has to suck through
Fuck me? No fuck you, now I gotta touch you
Fuckin bitch suckin dick like a jockstrap
Put them Glocks back
Tryin to be the first punk to have shot that
Get that? Got that? You know where you gonna be layin right?
I'm tellin you, hah, you know what the fuck I'm sayin right?
You will respect this, cuz it gets reckless when I cut the
Dun-nun-nun-nun-nun-nun, be like "What the--No"
But it's too late cuz the heat-seaker done found the heat
The concrete done found your meat
Guts hittin the ground still hot from steam comin off
Eyes rolled back in his head, and coughin up chunks of flesh
Then niggas'll roll with his monstrous death, beatin punks to death
Ain't nuthin left but the memory of what used to be your life
Funeral payments, and dried up blood on my knife
Y'all motherfuckers don't understand, when it's on it's on
Hoping the casket with shades, cause your eyes is gone
I know I'm wrong, that's why I did my dirt and slid
But you made it happen, with that bullshit you did
Now you want peace? Well take a piece of this ammunition
And get your ass tugged out the Hudson by some old man fishin
My mission is almost complete
This message will self-distruct in two seconds
Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeep

[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
You know one thing I hate
It’s when a person come up to me
Or I hear somebody say “it must be nice”
You know my answer that
Is “You must me a hater”
Tell me why you mad for
Listen Luda we gotta keep it real boy
We gonna do it like this baby
Listen here you know what I’m saying

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Tell me what they mad for
Come around the hood
See us sitting there looking good
Tell me what they mad for
Cause you be on the radio
Sounding like you made a million dollars
Tell me what they mad for

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Time to start putting grown-ass men on time out
Go to the corner and cry somehwere man
Old insecure ass nigga
Your heart pump Kool-Aid man
What you mad at me for
Is it cause I got houses on every coast
Or that I’m on that Forbes list making rich rappers look broke
While they’re blowing that smoke
I’m blowing a couple million
Making a killing stunting on impostors
Only rapper in the game with a grammy and an oscar
7-figure movie deals, 8 figure bank runs
And I’m still feeding the same hood that I came from
Any car that you got i’ve altready drove
Any chick that you hit, nigga I’ve already ho’d
Say it with your chest like these diamonds on my tongue
Name on my headphones, label tatted on my arm
Air traffic control say “Ludacris is insane”
That niggas daughter’s birthday’s the tail number on his plane
Fuck with me but nobody’s fucking with me
Take in the sight of my cognac, more millions
Real G’s chug it with me
If I’m happy there’s no reason you should be sad for
So will somebody, can somebody please…

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Ha!
Is you niggas hating ’cause you mad
Or is you mad ’cause you hating?
Choose one, hater
Now if these niggas hating on me I’mma kill them dead
If I wasn’t rapping I’d be probably be in the fifth
In the cell, getting mail, with a million dollar bail
But instead of counting blues, I’mma take this YSL
And this Gucci, and this Louis, Prada ’cause I’m hotter
I used to ball in Philly, with that nina and get dollars
I beefs up in my Bimmer, check aboard my collar
And when I check my bank account
I’m checking for them commas
I’m like all these niggas haters, all these bitches fucking
At 24 I went and bought a Ghost like it was nothing
At 25 I bought that Aston Martin, now we stunting
And you nigga still talking all this money shit you bluffing
You bluffing, you bluffing, I really think you bluffing
100,000 dollars man them bottles we just crush ‘em
Now tell me why you hating? You hating ’cause you mad?
Or is you mad because you hating, boy you sad

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Ok, I see why you mad, I’m counting all this money
And I’m popping all these tags
Hopping to it, Fucking bunnies
Real nigga, One hundred
You trying to do it, I done it
I spit sick on this rap shit
Make them sick to they stomach
I’m clean man, you hate
Mad ’cause I’m gonna keep it real with a real nigga
I got racks on racks, and a black maybach
Call it black on black, cause I kill niggas
In the club all girls, no niggas don’t talk to me
‘Cause I ain’t really trynna hear niggas
In the coupe it’s the truth
And the roof go poof, vamoose
I can make it disappear nigga
See this the type of shit that I be saying
Just because I’m balling, that don’t mean a nigga playing
Haters can blow me like a fan
Flyer than a bitch, I don’t think I’mma ever land
But in the meantime, baby what’s your plan
You can call me daddy but I can’t be your man
Fiending like the addicts, when I pull it out they panic
Bitch I do damage, you gonna need an ambulance

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Swizz Beatz]
Showtime
Put one hand in the air if you know somebody
That’s mad at you right now for no reason
Riding around in my jeep
Bumping that 2pac
I’m walking around in my hood
Cocked back two Glocks
98 in my status
I came back I’m the baddest
Christian’s on my feet
I told you I’m the baddest
All the way in Paris
Don’t talk you’ll get embarrassed
My watch is fucking…
Yeah you get embarassed
My life is just Ludacris
Sucka you just new to this
430s pulling up
God damn we do this shit
Chickens and the waffles
Chilling in the villa
Bumping Ludaversal
Getting that scrilla

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Pusha T]
Yuck!
Hey Luda, you know why these haters mad for right?
The truth shall set you free
If you sellin’ all the records and you fuckin’ all the bitches
And you sit a top of the charts and you livin’ out your wishes
With your chains all smothered and your watches all glittered
And your ghost and your phantoms all comin’ home to visit
Or maybe cause your bitches was never really your bitches
With your baby mama fucking every rapper in the business
Niggas saying you was better when the drugs was in your system
Now your crack swag gone ever since you came from prison
Got you tweeting all stupid, is you skatin’, is you dissin’
Found out your Ghost leased and your Phantom just rented
Won’t need it in your name like Pac when he went missing
Makaveli lives on so I’m riding on you bitches
Hail Mary be the witness, Lord Willin’ I was dealing
Stupid motherfucking five star, tatted on his ceiling
Bullseye, be the motherfucking target for this killing
Ain’t y’all the motherfuckers with the millions?

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Belligerent ghouls
Run Manchester schools
Spineless swines
Cemented minds
Sir leads the troops
Jealous of youth
Same old suit since ninteteen-sixty-two
He does the military two-step
Down the nape of my neck

[Chorus 1]
I want to go home
I don't want to stay
Give up education as a bad mistake

[Verse 2]
Mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
Knees you in the groin
Elbow in the face
Bruises bigger than dinner plates

[Chorus]
I want to go home
I don't want to stay

[Verse 3]
Belligerent ghouls
Run Manchester schools
Spineless bastards, all
Sir leads the troops
Jealous of youth
Same old jokes since nineteen-two
He does the military two-step
Down the nape of my neck

[Chorus]
I want to go home
I don't want to stay
Give up life as a bad mistake

[Verse 4]
Please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
He grabs and devours
He kicks me in the showers
Kicks me in the showers
And he grabs and devours

[Chorus]
I want to go home
I don't want to stay

[Hook]
Got buddy, my buddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
My buddy, pour muddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
Muddy, muddy, muddy, muddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
Real mud, that boy pour mud
God damn that boy pour muddy

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got a buddy pour 'da shit real muddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
I got a buddy pour the sprite real dirty
God damn, god damn, god damn
I got a buddy from the country
Buddy thank me from the city
He ain't country shitty nigga
But the nigga really picky
Drinkin' on a pint and he cost a pretty picture
Gucci Man and Dolph, freshest niggas in the city
I'dda 

[...], trap suit with the rats
He cost a large 99, I was sellings sack
Waka threw me out the house and I moved in with pot
Sleeping on the floor, I didn't even have a stack

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Take a whole 2 litre
Throw a whole pint in it
Man I'm the club 'sleep
Cause that lean got me trippin'
And I smoke an ounce with it
Plus I'm on the mollies nigga
Clear crystals keep me up
That lean break me down nigga
When we pour it up it be muddy
South Memphis niggas I'm with OG Boo Dirty
I'm on a paper route, I gotta fuck with Young Dolph
100 dolla' ammunition, Pee Wee take 'em out

[...], punch 1000 pint suck
Nigga wanna spend a 80, no I hear ya' do
Soon as I lift out of court, I stared pourin up
And we don't pour red, we pour purple bruh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
All I drink is mud
Take your girlfriend turn her to my night time slut
But we don't hardly ever fuck
I swear I'm scared of that bitch cause her pussy too good
Damn; or maybe could be me
I'm full of that syrp, jumped in that pussy and fell asleep
Shit, I can't be doing this
Walk up with my pistol in my hand and went and took a piss
Damn, yeah I've been going ham
Ask the streets about me they goin' tell you who I am
Yeah, your lil' sister say she love me
Your baby mama wan' fuck me
And my cup extra muddy

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means (of slender means)
Each household appliance is like a new science in my town

[Refrain 1]
And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean

[Chorus]
And when a train goes by it's such a sad sound
It's such a sad thing

[Verse 2]
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
Every sensible child will know what this means
The poor and the needy are selfish and greedy on her terms

[Refrain 1]
And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean

[Chorus]
And when a train goes by it's such a sad sound
It's such a sad thing

[Verse 3]
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life and I think about death
And neither one particularly appeals to me

[Refrain 2]
And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
In the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

[Verse 1]
Well, I wonder
"Do you hear me when you sleep?"
I hoarsely cry (Why?)
Well, I wonder
Do you see me when we pass?
I half-die (Why?)

[Chorus]
Please, keep me in mind
Please, keep me in mind

[Verse 2]
Gasping, but somehow still alive
This is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping, dying, but somehow still alive
This is the final stand of all I am

[Chorus]
Please, keep me in mind

[Outro]
Well, I wonder
Well, I wonder
Please, keep me in mind
Oh, keep me in mind
Keep me in mind

[Verse 1]
You walk in here with your guitar man
Your shining boots and your full on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you've got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

But don't ruin yourself I aren’t your competition
Don't flatter yourself that was never my intention

[Hook]
I want to talk about what you are that I aren’t
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been

[Verse 2]
I walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words I wrote down on a page
When I was 12 years old a small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues
I tell them, "this is what I do"
And it’s what I put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume
And say life on musical road is rough conditions
But the easy ride was never my ambition

[Hook]
I want to talk about what you are that I aren’t
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been

[Verse 3]
Let's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games

[Hook]
So what have you got that I ain't?
And what can you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be, girl, and who I've always been

[Intro]
I feel fantastic!
I wanna fuck something!
(It's about to be a hell of a night) x3

[Verse 1]
Luda!
Rollin' down the highway
Nothin' for me to do but smoke up if it's a Friday
Break it down, spread it out, nigga, roll up!
And let's see what they about, call them hoes up
Ludacris, man these bitches want my last name
Sip slow but I'm drivin' all in the fast lane
Get the fuck up out my way, man, move bitch!
And quit yappin' if you never wanna do shit
I'm all about it, get your mind right
Been makin' money since before I was in the limelight
Grind right... Bitch what's uuup?
Top down, but I feel like gettin' fucked uuuu-u-u-u-up
I get high but the bass low
A real nigga, what your woman wanna shake for
When you shake it for a baller, better shake it right
'Cuz it's about to be a hell of a night

[Hook]
It's about to be a hell of a night x4
I'm fucked up! (x4)
I'm high as hell! (x4)
It's about to be a hell of a night

[Verse 2]
Club packed, and women gettin' they drink on
Just looking for a reason to get they freak on
Catch me up in the VIP and it's roped off (Why?)
TO keep raggedy ass hoes off
And I'm 'bout to have a smoke-off
Rich nigga, but I'm trying to get broke off
Turn it up as I make the beat break down
Ass up... FACE DOWN!
Yeah, that's still the best way to get it
Down the middle, that's the best way to split it
I'm talkin' money, Disturbing Tha Peace racked up
One too many American black cards stacked uuuu-u-u-up
Backed up and it's on
Don't get beat down to the song
I see these hatin' ass niggas wanna fight
Well it's about to be a hell of a night

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm always looking for trouble to get into
Tell your girlfriend's friends, bring friends too
What you drinkin'? I got it, I pour it all up
Southside, my partners they throw it all up
I don't want a menage, so bitch, let go
I'm tryin'a get three women, play Connect 4
Congratulations, you made it into the Top 5
Your mouth helped me push the Bentley into Mach 5
She got me speedin' in the red zone
Or as Luda like to call it, it's the Head Zone
Heads up! A bread winner, the bread's up
So make a peace sign baby, put your legs up
Is it really that good to ya?
Do you like it when a nigga talk hood to ya?
Do you like a lil' scratch, lil' bite?
Well, it's about to be a hell of a night

[Hook]

[Chorus 1]
Unruly boys who will not grow up
Must be taken in hand
Unruly girls who will not settle down
They must be taken in hand

[Chorus 2]
A crack on the head is what you get for not asking
And a crack on the head is what you get for asking

[Chorus 1]
Unruly boys who will not grow up
Must be taken in hand
Unruly girls who will not settle down
They must be taken in hand

[Chorus 2]
A crack on the head is what you get for not asking
And a crack on the head is what you get for asking

[Chorus 2]
A crack on the head is what you get for not asking
And a crack on the head is what you get for asking

[Outro]
A crack on the head is just what you get
Why? Because of who you are!
And a crack on the head is just what you get
Why? Because of what you are!

A crack on the head
Because of the things you said (things you said)
The things you did

[Chorus 1]
Unruly boys who will not grow up
Must be taken in hand
Unruly girls who will not settle down
They must be taken in hand

[Sample: Conversation between couple]
"Why haven't I heard from you?"
"I been busy."
"Well, have you at least thought about what we talked about?"
"Yeah, about leaving with you? Yeah, I THOUGHT about it..."
"Why are you trippin'?"

[Intro: Ludacris]
Oh you talkin bout Ol’ girl from up the street right?

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I be like damn she got a way about her
And everybody always got something to say about her
She so fine, she so classy, but that bitch mean
Everybody wanna throw a little dirt up on her, but that bitch clean
Quit hatin’ on her, recognize her from a mile away
When she be walkin’ man it be hard to find the words to say
When she be talkin’ disrespect it pay no nevermind
She just grill em' dressing up she known to take her time
Then go a kill him, go hit the club and make these bitches sweat
Not even trying, turning heads just off a silohutte
And I ain't lying somebody taught her well
She never slip and I think she’s out here casting spells

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
She a trip (Trip, trip, trip)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Now matter what she always on her grind
She seems just to know what to do to stay on my mind
She send me pics of her naked posin’ like in a magazine
I wanna hit like a drum whenever she go and shake it like a tamborine
Yeah that percussion and always got the latest bags
Her shoe game stupid and she never fights and never nags
She’ll keep it movin’ got no time for games, lames, false claims
Callin’ out names, Dames, all on the same thang mayne
End of discussion, what you thought she’ll throw you for a loop
Know what's expected? you might even let her drive your coupe
She’ll never wreck it, she respect the finer thangs, diamond rangs, diamond chains
Down to carry Vera Wang get a grip
She a motherfuckin trip

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
She a trip (Trip, trip, trip)
She a trip (Trip, trip, trip)
That bitch a trip (Trip, trip, trip)
That girl a trip (Trip, trip, trip)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
That bitch a trip if I ain't never seen it
I get up in the guts, she be tellin’ me to beat it like I fuckin’ mean it
I can't believe it, got a nigga thinkin’ maybe I’da met my match
So I put her in a track, and yes in fact you’ll catch me spendin’ stacks
All up in Saks and I ain't never been one to trick
Like what am I doin? but it's something ’bout the way she ride that dick
My mind is ruin and she using it to her advantage
She love that I’m grown but I think she got some other victims
I’m not alone, who thought this bad bitch was out here pimpin
Catch a nigga slippin’, rippin tags off the latest clothes and bags
She so bad that she can't go nowhere without a bunch of niggas
Trying to holler but she all bout that body dollar

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
She a trip (Trip, trip, trip)

That bitch a trip (Trip, trip, trip)

Sipping Coronas with my vato
Me casa you know es su casa
Big cat we used to call El Gato
Now, GuWop, they call me El Chapo, nigga
I use to trap out all the bandos
Abandoned homes with boarded windows
Who the fuck that is peeking in my window?
Fuck boys know I keep that extendo (GuWop)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
'Cause my MAK-90 stay with me
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me

[Bridge: Gucci Mane]
Trap house, trap house, trap house, trap
Trap house, trap house, trap house, trap
Trap house, trap house, trap house, trap house
Trap house, trap house, trap house, trap
Trap house, trap, trap house, trap
Trappin' off a pack, know I trap house trap
Trap house, trap, trap house, trap (Maybach Music)
Trappin' off a pack, know I trap house trap

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
You know I got me an agenda
Break that thing up in my blender
Got a warrant, no surrender
Sub-machine with that extender
I came up on a pissy mattress
I got more money then all these rappers
Tried to hit me up in traffic
But I had to work my magic
I'm riding 'round with my lieutenant
I let 'em count it and I spend it
Bitches come after my business
Catching bodies in these trenches (Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
'Cause my MAK-90 stay with me
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
'Cause my MAK-90 stay with me

Trap House III

[Intro 1: "Take Me Back To Dear Old Blighty"]
Oh, take me back to dear old Blighty
Put me on the train for London Town
Take me anywhere
Drop me anywhere
In Liverpool, Leeds or Birmingham
But I don't care
I should like to see—

[Intro 2]
I don't bless them

[Verse 1]
Farewell to this land's cheerless marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between archers
Her very Lowness with her head in a sling
I'm truly sorry but it sounds like a wonderful thing
I say Charles don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your mother's bridal veil?
(Oh, oh-oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
And so I checked all the registered historical facts
And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the 18th pale descendent
Of some old queen or other
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Some nine year old tough who peddles drugs
I swear to God, I swear I never even knew what drugs were
(Oh, oh-oh, oh)

[Verse 3]
So I broke into the Palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said, "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said, "That's nothing, you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you are tied to your mother's apron
No-one talks about castration
(Oh, oh-oh)

[Verse 4]
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like love and law and poverty, oh, oh
(These are the things that kill me)
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair, oh
(These are the things that kill me)
All their lies about makeup and long hair, are still there

[Verse 5]
Past the pub that saps your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the pub that wrecks your body
And the church, all they want is your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb

[Outro]
Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonely
Here her head, she lay
Until she'd rise and say
"I'm starved of mirth,Let's go and trip a dwarf"

Oh, what to be done with her?
Oh, what to be done with her?

Ice water for blood
With neither heart or spine
And then just
To pass time; let us go and rob the blind

What to be done with her?
I ask myself
What to be said of her?

But when she calls me, I do not walk, I run
Oh, when she calls, I do not walk, I run

[Verse]
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking when I said
I'd like to smash every tooth in your head
Oh-oh, sweetness, sweetness, I was only joking when I said
By rights you should be bludgeoned in your bed

[Bridge 1]
And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her Walkman started to melt (Oh)
(Hoo-hoo-hoo)

[Chorus]
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh-oh)
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race

[Bridge 2]
And now I know how Joan of Arc felt (Oh)
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her roman nose
And her hearing aid started to melt

[Chorus]
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh)
Bigmouth oh-ho-ho, ha ha, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh)
Bigmouth oh-ho-ho, ha ha, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh)
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh)

[Verse 1]
I was minding my business
Lifting some lead off
The roof of the Holy Name church
It was worthwhile living a laughable life
To set my eyes on the blistering sight

[Chorus]
Of a Vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way

[Verse 2]
A scanty bit of a thing
With a decorative ring
That wouldn't cover the head of a goose
As Rose collects the money in a canister
Who comes sliding down the bannister?

[Chorus]
A vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way

[Verse 3]
The monkish monsignor
With a head full of plaster
Said "My man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
As Rose counts the money in the canister
As natural as rain
He dances again
My God!

[Chorus]
The Vicar in a tutu
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh...
The Vicar in a tutu
Oh yeah
Oh...

[Verse 4]
The next day in the pulpit
With freedom and ease
Combatting ignorance, dust, and disease
As Rose counts the money in the canister
As natural as rain
He dances again and again and again

[Outro]
In the fabric of a tutu
Any man could get used to
And I am the living sign
And I am the living sign
And I am the living sign
And I am the living sign
And I am the living sign
And I am the living sign

[Verse 1]
The last night of the fair
By the big wheel generator
A boy is stabbed and his money is grabbed
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
She is famous, she is funny
An engagement ring doesn't mean a thing
To a mind consumed by brass money

[Chorus]
And though I walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout

[Verse 2]
The last night of the fair
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait on her mother's side
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait on her mother's side

[Chorus]
And though I walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout

[Verse 3]
Then someone falls in love
And someone's beaten up, someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine
And someone falls in love
And someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine

[Chorus]
And though I walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout

[Verse 4]
This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said: "How quickly would I die
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said: "How quickly would I die
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

[Bridge]
So scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
(This means you really love me)
Scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
(This means you really love me)

[Chorus]
And though I walk home alone
I just might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout

[Intro]
On the day that your mentality
Decides to try to catch up with your biology
Come round

[Chorus]
Cause I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over, all over my face

[Refrain]
On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology

[Chorus]
I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over, all over my face

[Verse 1]
A double bed and a stalwart lover, for sure
These are the riches of the poor
A double bed and a stalwart lover, for sure
These are the riches of the poor

[Chorus]
And I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over my face

[Verse 2]
A tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
Raised on Prisoner's Aid
He killed a policeman when he was thirteen
And somehow that really impressed me
And it's written all over my face
Oh, these are the riches of the poor
These are the riches of the poor

[Chorus]
And I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's written all over my face

[Refrain]
On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology

[Outro]
And if you ever need self-validation
Just meet me in the alley by the Railway station
It's all over my face

[Verse 1]
What she said
"How come someone hasn't noticed that I'm dead
And decided to bury me? God knows, I'm ready!"

[Verse 2]
What she said was sad
But then, all the rejection she's had
To pretend to be happy could only be idiocy

[Chorus 1]
What she said
Was not for the job or lover that she never had

[Verse 3]
What she read
All heady books she'd sit and prophesise
(It took a tattooed boy from Birkenhead
To really really open her eyes)

What she read
All heady books she'd sit and prophesise
(It took a tattooed boy from Birkenhead
To really really open her eyes)

[Chorus 2]
What she said
"I smoke 'cause I'm hoping for an early death
And I need to cling to something!"
What she said
"I smoke 'cause I'm hoping for an early death
And I need to cling to something!"

[Verse 1]
Park the car at the side of the road
You should know time's tide will smother you
And I will too
When you laugh about people who feel so very lonely
Their only desire is to die
Well, I'm afraid it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh

[Chorus]
But that joke isn't funny anymore
It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone
It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone
More than you'll ever know

[Break]
Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down

[Verse 2]
It was dark as I drove the point home
And on cold leather seats
Well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my face after all

[Outro]
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
Happening in mine, happening in mine
Happening in mine, happening in mine

I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now, now, now it's happening in mine, happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine, happening in mine
Happening in mine, happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now, now, now it's happening in mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine

[Chorus 1]
I won't share you, no
I won't share you
With the drive
And ambition
The zeal I feel
This is my time

[Verse 1]
The note I wrote
As she read, she said
"Has the Perrier gone
Straight to my head
Or is life sick and cruel, instead?"
"Yes!"
No - no - no - no - no - no
No - no - no - no - no - no
Oh...

[Chorus 2]
I won't share you, no
I won't share you
With the drive
And the dreams inside
This is my time

[Verse 2]
Life tends to come and go
That's okay
As long as you know
Life tends to come and go
As long as you know
Know, know, know, know, know
Know, know, know, know
Oh...

[Chorus 2]
I won't share you, no
I won't share you
With the drive
And the dreams inside
This is my time

[Verse 3]
I want the freedom and I want the guile
I want the freedom and the guile
Oh, life tends to come and go
As long as you know
Know, know, know, know
Know, know, know, know
Oh...

[Chorus 3]
I won't share you, no
I won't share you
I'll see you somewhere
I'll see you sometime
Darling...

[Intro]
Oh hello
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
Hung by his pretty white neck
Some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
And I missed my bed
And I soon came home

[Verse 1]
They said, "There's too much caffeine in your bloodstream
And a lack of real spice in your life"
I said, "Leave me alone because I'm alright, dad
Surprised to still be on my own"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the strain of the pain again

[Chorus 1]
A rush and a push and the land that we stand on is ours
It has been before, so it shall be again
And people who are uglier than you and I
They take what they need and just leave

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain of the strain all over again

[Chorus 2]
A rush and a push and the land we stand on is ours
It has been before, so why can't it be now?
And people who are weaker than you and I
They take what they want from life

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Oh, but don't mention love
No, no, don't mention love

[Chorus 3]
A rush and a push and the land we stand on is ours
Your youth may be gone, but you're still a good man
So phone me, phone me
So phone me, phone me, phone me

[Outro]
Oh, I think I'm in love
Oh, I think I'm in love
Oh, I think I'm in love (I think I'm in love)
Oh, I think I'm in love, oh

[Verse 1]
The lanes were silent
There was nothing, no one, nothing around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
With a hard-faced
Three-word gesture

[Chorus]
I started something
I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
...And now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
Uh, that's what tradition means

[Verse 2]
And I doused another venture
With a gesture
That was... absolutely vile

[Chorus]
I started something
I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
...And now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
Uh, that's what tradition means

[Verse 3]
And now eighteen months' hard labour
Seems... fair enough

[Chorus]
I started something
I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
...And now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
Uh, that's what tradition means

[Chorus]
I started something
I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
...And now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
Uh, that's what tradition means

[Outro]
Okay Stephen. Do that again

[Verse 1]
The death of a disco dancer
Well, it happens a lot 'round here
And if you think peace
Is a common goal
That goes to show
How little you know
The death of a disco dancer
Well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd rather not get involved
Oh

[Chorus]
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice
Very nice
Very nice
Very nice
But maybe in the next world
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice
Very nice
Very nice
Very nice
Very nice
But maybe in the next world
Maybe in the next world
Maybe in the next world

Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice
Very nice
Very nice
But maybe in the next world
Maybe in the next world

[Outro]
(The next world)
(Maybe in the next world)
The death of a disco dancer
The death of a disco dancer
The death of a disco dancer

[Outro 2 - Instrumental]

[Chorus 1]
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious

[Verse 1]
There were times when I could
Have "murdered" her
(but you know, I would hate
Anything to happen to her)
No, I don't want to see her

[Bridge 1]
Do you really think
She'll pull through?
Do you really think
She'll pull through?
Do...

[Chorus 2]
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
My, my, my, my, my, my baby, goodbye

[Verse 2]
There were times when I could
Have "strangled" her
(but you know, I would hate
Anything to happen to her)
Would you please let me see her!

[Bridge 2]
Do you really think
She'll pull through?
Do you really think
She'll pull through?
Do...

[Outro]
Let me whisper my last goodbyes
I know - it's serious

[Chorus]
Stop me, oh-oho, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Stop me, oh-oho, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
Only slightly, only slightly less
Than I used to, my love

[Verse 1]
I was delayed, I was waylaid
An emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
And the pain was enough to make
A shy, bald, Buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder
Who said I'd lied to her?
Oh, who said I'd lied because I never? I never!
Who said I'd lied because I never?

[Verse 2]
I was detained, I was restrained
And broke my spleen
And broke my knee
And then he really laced into me
Friday night in Out-patients
Who said I'd lied to her?
Oh, who said I'd lied? Because I never, I never
Who said I'd lied? Because I never
And so I drank one
It became four
And when I fell on the floor I drank more

[Chorus]
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love

[Chorus]
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
Cause you're evil
And you lie
And if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
And some may say
When usually it's Nothing
Surely you're happy
It should be this way?

[Verse 1]
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
And "May the lines sag, may the lines sag heavy and deep tonight"

[Chorus]
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
Cause you're evil
And you lie
And if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
And some may say
When usually it's Nothing
Surely you're happy
It should be this way?

[Verse 2]
I said "No"
And then I shot myself
So, drink, drink, drink
And be ill tonight

[Outro]
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
Behind
Behind
Behind
Behind
Behind
Behind
Oh, unhappy birthday
Behind
Behind
Behind
Oh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Oh, Glenn, oh, Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Oh Glenn
Because there's somebody here who really, really loves you

Oh, Glenn, stay home
Be bored, It's crap, I know
Tonight

Oh, Glenn, oh, Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Oh, Glenn, oh, Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Because there's somebody here Who'll take a hatchet to your ear

The frustration it renders me hateful, oh...
Oh, don't come to the house tonight
Oh, don't come to the house tonight
Because you'll slip on the trail of all my sad remains
That's why, that's why goodbye my love, goodbye my love
Goodbye my love, goodbye my love
Goodbye my love, goodbye my love
Goodbye my love, goodbye my love
At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
And oh, the plans they weave
And oh, the sickening greed

At the record company party
On their hands - a dead star
The sycophantic slags all say :
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"

Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
Double-pack with a photograph
Extra track (and a tacky badge)

A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them!"
(sadly, this was your life)

But you could have said no
If you'd wanted to
You could have said no
If you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please then!"
(sadly this was your life)

But you could have said no
If you'd wanted to
You could have walked away
...Couldn't you?

I touched you at the soundcheck
You had no real way of knowing
In my heart I begged "Take me with you...
I don't care where you're going... "

But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
Just a child from those ugly new houses
Who could never begin to know

Who could never really know
Oh...

Best of! Most of!
Satiate the need
Slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and feel deceived
Climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(This was your life...)

And when it fails to recoup ?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby

I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
You're just the same as I am
What makes most people feel happy
Leads us headlong into harm

So, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I danced my legs down to the knees
But me and my 'true love'
Will never meet again...

At the record company meeting
On their hands - at last! - A dead star !
But they can never taint you in my eyes
No, they can never touch you now

No, they cannot hurt you, my darling
They cannot touch you now
But me and my 'true love'
Will never meet again
So, goodbye
Please stay with your own kind
And I'll stay with mine

There's something against us
It's not time
It's not time
So, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

I know I need hardly say
How much I love your casual way
Oh, but please put your tongue away
A little higher and we're well away
The dark nights are drawing in
And your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
And "love" is just a miserable lie
You have destroyed my flower-like life
Not once - twice
You have corrupt my innocent mind
Not once - twice
I know the wind-swept mystical air
It means : I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
It means: I'd like to seize your underwear
What do we get for our trouble and pain ?
Just a rented room in Whalley Range
What do we get for our trouble and pain?
...Whalley Range!
Into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
I need advice, I need advice
Nobody ever looks at me twice
Nobody ever looks at me twice

I'm just a country-mile behind
The world

I'm just a country-mile behind
The whole world
Oh oh, oh...

I'm just a country-mile behind
The world

I'm just a country-mile behind
The whole world
Oh oh, oh...

Take me when you go
Oh oh, oh...

Take me when you go
Oh oh, oh...

I need advice, I need advice

[Verse 1: Morrissey]
Upon the sand, upon the bay
"There is a quick and easy way" you say
Before you illustrate
I'd rather state
I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am

[Chorus: Morrissey]
And sorrow's native son
He will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
Oh

[Verse 2: Morrissey]
End of the pier, end of the bay
You tug my arm, and say "give in to lust
Give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
Soon be dust"
Oh, I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am

[Chorus: Morrissey, Annalisa Jablonka]
And sorrow's native son
He will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
(Oh, really?)
Oh

[Verse 3: Morrissey]
I could have been wild and I could have been free
But nature played this trick on me
She wants it now
And she will not wait
But she's too rough
And I'm too delicate
Then, on the sand
Another man, he takes her hand
A smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in womanhood
I lost my faith in womanhood
I lost my faith

[Outro: Morrissey]
Oh
Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds
Oh, oh

[Verse]
Please don't cry
For the ghost and the storm outside
Will not invade this sacred shrine
Nor infiltrate your mind
My life down I shall lie
If the bogey-man should try
To play tricks on your sacred mind
To tease, torment, and tantalize
Wavering shadows loom
A piano plays in an empty room
There'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
And when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
For you are all that matters
And I'll love you till the day I die
There never need be longing in your eyes
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
Ceiling shadows shimmy by
And when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
There's sadness in your beautiful eyes
Oh, your untouched, unsoiled, wondrous eyes
My life down I shall lie
Should restless spirits try
To play tricks on your sacred mind
I once had a child, and it saved my life
And I never even asked his name
I just looked into his wondrous eyes
And said, "Never, never, never again"
And all too soon I did return
Just like a moth to a flame
So rattle my bones all over the stones
I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
Oh, see how words as old as sin
Fit me like a glove
I'm here and here I'll stay
Together we lie, together we pray
There never need be longing in your eyes
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine, mine
Climb up on my knee, sonny boy
Although you're only three, sonny boy
You're, you're mine
And your mother she just never knew
Oh, your mother
As long, as long, as long
I did my best for her
I did my best for her
As long, as long, as long as, as long
I did my best for her
I did my best for her
Mine

[Verse 1]
All men have secrets and here is mine
So let it be known
For we have been through hell and high tide
I can surely rely on you
And yet you start to recoil
Heavy words are so lightly thrown
But still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you

[Chorus 1]
So, what difference does it make?
So, what difference does it make?
It makes none
But now you have gone
And you must be looking very old tonight

[Verse 2]
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
Because you asked me to!
But now you make me feel so ashamed
Because I've only got two hands
But I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh

[Chorus 2]
So, what difference does it make? (Oooooh)
What difference does it make? (Oooooh)
It makes none
But now you have gone
And your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight

[Verse 3]
Oh, the devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole, and then I lied
Just because you asked me to
But now you know the truth about me
You won't see me anymore
Well, I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh
But no more apologies
No more, no more apologies
Oh, I'm too tired
I'm so sick and tired
And I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh
Oh, my sacred one...
Oh...

[Verse 1]
Bought on stolen wine
A nod was the first step
You knew very well
What was coming next

Bought on stolen wine
Oh, a nod was the first step
You knew very well
What was coming next

[Chorus]
Did I really walk all this way
Just to hear you say:
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"
Oh, but you will
For you must
I don't owe you anything, no
But you owe me something
Repay me now

[Verse 2]
You should never go to them
Let them come to you
Just like I do
Just like I do

You should never go to them
Let them come to you
Just like I do
Just like I do

[Chorus]
Did I really walk all this way
Just to hear you say:
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"
Oh, but you will
For you must
I don't owe you anything, no
But you owe me something
Repay me now

[Verse 3]
Too freely on your lips
Words prematurely sad
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
Life is never kind
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight
Over the moor, take me to the moor
Dig a shallow grave
And I'll lay me down
Over the moor, take me to the moor
Dig a shallow grave
And I'll lay me down

Lesley Anne, with your pretty white beads
Oh John, you'll never be a man
And you'll never see your home again
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for

Edward, see those alluring lights?
Tonight will be your very last night

A woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his sacred head"

Hindley wakes and Hindley says
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, and says
"Oh, wherever he has gone, I have gone"
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death
Fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death

Hindley wakes and says
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, and says
"Oh, whatever he has done, I have done"

But this is no easy ride
For a child cries

"Oh, find me, find me, nothing more
We are on a sullen misty moor
We may be dead and we may be gone
But we will be, we will be, we will be, right by your side
Until the day you die
This is no easy ride
We will haunt you when you laugh
Yes, you could say we're a team
You might sleep
You might sleep
You might sleep
But you will never dream
Oh, you might sleep
But you will never dream
You might sleep
But you will never dream"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for

Oh, find me, find me
Find me
I'll haunt you when you laugh
Oh, I'll haunt you when you laugh
You might sleep
But you will never dream
Oh
Over the moors, I'm on the moor
Oh, over the moor
The child is on the moor
Pray for yourself one time
One time, time

Young Medusa
Never sure, i just do
I jumped off the bridge
You say i fell
I say i flew
Missing parachute
Feeling like topanga
Patty mayonnaise
Kind of average
With queen qualities
Got molecules, i possess
Ever more nothing less

[Refrain]
I think I'm starting to feel something
Here in the dark
I think I'm starting to feel something

[Hook]
Keep burning up
Keep burning up
Pray for yourself one time
One time, time

Broken glass unswept in my mind
Brooms to heavy to bare
Struggles that i find
Confusion
Gravity is relative
Sand castles are still real life
They hold dreams
Like the real ones do
I take care building castles too

[Refrain]
I think I'm starting to feel something
Here in the dark
I think I'm starting to feel something

[Hook]
Keep burning up
Keep burning up
Pray for yourself one time
One time, time

[Hook]
Keep burning up
Keep burning up
Pray for yourself one time
One time, time

[Intro]
Ah

Brains up, yeah, alright, ah

[Verse 1:Mike Posner]
If they call the cops on it, IDGAF
I won't stop, No, IDGAF baby
Baby girl you should call me tonight
Cause brother buck it and I know how to talk to you right
Understand when I'm off in your vibe, IDGAF baby

[Pre-Hook]
Shake your ass one time for me, then Repeat, Repeat, Repeat
Whoa, fill my glass one time for me, then Repeat, Repeat, Repeat, alright
I'm just in the lab making hot shit with P, with P, with P
Shake your ass one time for me, then Repeat, Repeat, Repeat

Sing it!

[Hook]
Girl, let's do it over and over again
I'm not selfish, bring your friend, alright
See the morning ain't up, so repeat
Come on, You gotta repeat

[Verse 2:Mike Posner]
They can't tell me nada, no, IDGAF
Tell your mama, go ahead, IDGAF baby
Baby girl we play like shit

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Break]
Let me be inside you girl

Let's go, (come on ,come on) ah (come on ,come on)

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
Skateboard mental
Spit that lethal
As far as the beat go

Before we speak yoh
No extends for c notes
Only a key note
Mysteries of the fish, yeah, I am Nemo
Your girl wanna try, why you look at me for
Yoda, stronger, Make her work that key go
Bitch, I take your bitch, me and my PO

[Hook]

[Outro]
IDGAF, yeah!
IDGAF, yeah, so easy
IDGAF, baby

[Verse 1]
Look out the left, the captain said
The lights down there, that's where we'll land
I saw a falling star burn up
Above the Las Vegas sands

[Verse 2]
It wasn't the one that you gave to me
That night down south between the trailers
Not the early one that you can wish upon
Not the northern one that guides in the sailors

[Chorus]
Oh, star bright, star bright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

[Verse 3]
You got the touch so gentle and sweet
But you've got that look so critical
Now I can't talk to you, baby, I get so weak
Sometimes I think love is just mythical

[Verse 4]
Up there's the heavens, down there's a town
Blackness everywhere and little lights shine
Oh, blackness, blackness dragging me down
Come on, light the candle in this poor heart of mine

[Chorus]
Oh, star bright, star bright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

[Verse 5]
I'm drinking sweet champagne, got the headphones up high
Can't numb you out, can't drum you out of my mind
They're playing "Goodbye, baby, baby, goodbye
Ooh ooh, love is blind"

[Verse 6]
Up go the flaps, down go the wheels
I hope you got your heat turned on, baby
I hope they finally fixed your automobile
I hope it's better when we meet again, baby

[Chorus]
Star bright, star bright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
Shouldn't have got on this flight tonight
I got one motherfucking responsibility in this world
That's me and that's it motherfucker
For anybody and everything that I think has shit, do you understand?!
That's a question best posed to yourself
I'm giving you a chance
I'm giving you a shot at redemption
Do you understand that?
I don't give a fuck about any stupid motherfuckers
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck

[Intro: Emeli Sandé & Kendrick Lamar]
You don't know what pain is, you just fuck with famous
I don't know you, I can tell your energy is dangerous
You don't know how long it took to finally come alive
So bitch don't kill my vibe
Yeah, I can feel the changes, and I can tell you hating
Save your breath I'm sick to death of fake congratulations
You don't know how much I had to give to come alive
So what, So what?, So bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
I'm a break out and then hide every lock
I'm a break out and then hide every lock

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Hook]
Wake up in the morning and I’m headed to a check, bandz

On the way to a check, hey

Pull up to the car show, I’m springing I got spring

Money game retarded, bitch don’t get me started

Got the drop top maybach, sitting in the driveway
Hit the secret Sundays, balling till there’s Monday

Soulja boy, bricks on bricks that’s what I soulja boy
Riding through the hood, everything all good

Riding through my city bitch don’t come through here and start

[Hook]
Headed to a check, check, I’m headed to a check, check

Headed to a check, headed to a check
Headed to a check on the way to a check, backs, yeah

[Intro]
It's about halfway through the show, so I think it's time to talk about how deep I am
And I'm pretty fucking deep, guys
So deep that I named the song... "Hashtag Deep"

[Verse 1]
Have you ever stopped to watch a bluebird drop from a tree, and take to the air?
Me neither
Have you ever took time out to finish a rhyme but the right words just weren't there?
Meat cleaver

[Pre-Chorus]
The people in my life are like grains of sand
'Cause they stick together, yeah
Often near my butt hole

[Chorus]
If life is an ocean, I am a deep and handsome fish
A fish that's drowning
If the artistic process is a birth canal
Then I am a freshly jellied kid
Come witness my crowning
These thoughts of mine
Must be a sign that I'm
Hashtag Deep

[Post-Chorus]
If Jesus can walk on water, can he swim on land?
Probably not

[Verse 2]
Have you ever accidentally peed on the toilet seat instead of on your girlfriend's face
Me neither
Me neither!
Have you ever wrote a song note for note, and not a single note was out of place?
Duh

[Plays off key]

[Pre-Chorus]
The people in my life are like blades of grass, how?
Cause they're all so grounded
But at least grass stays away from my butthole

[Chorus]
Art is a harlot
And I am her sassy urban friend
Uh, bitch why you being so selfish?
If mama is right and the world is my oyster
Then I must have an allergy to shellfish
You don't know
How could you know
If life makes you wish you were dead
Just put on a good movie then promptly put a bullet in your head
Spend forever asleep
Cause life pales in comparison to living the dream
Hashtag

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse]
Dream like you never seen obstacles
Chasing obscene profits, so we ain’t stopping for the red lights Look in my rear view, all I see is niggas headlights
Catch me if you can, hoe, they try and sack me and I scramble
Look up in the sky, you’ll see exactly where I am, bo
Hey, don’t you see me, man?
Making my wishes come true, with no genie, man?
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beenie Man
I’m on these rich niggas ass, no bikini, man

[Curtains closing]

[Footsteps]

[Screech of microphone]

[Ken Kaniff]
Eeehhh, Is this thing on?

[Fading out]
Eh….Wait…..Hello?
Eh…..Goodnight

Bought a new car, dawg, I just got a plot

You hurtin, for certain
Rollin up a pound of kush, karate choppin trees

Fuck bein' on some chill shit

And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it
Yeah, that mean I'm way up (Way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly, but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay-up

Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it

Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this

Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up

Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

[Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

[Verse One: Mike Posner]
Yes I know it's been too long
Probably seems I'm always gone
Still don't know where I belong
Wrote this song
Heaven just a plane away
I know my mom, she can't wait
When I feel I've lost my way
I go home, home, home

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Back home
Back home
Back home
Home
Back home

[Verse Two: Mike Posner]
It doesn't feel too much changed
I still get called my government name
Everything still feels the same
Back home, home, home

[Hook]

[Interlude: Mike Posner talking]
Aye. Ladies and gentlemen we have a very special guest with us today. He goes by the name of King Chip

[Verse Three: King Chip]
Either Hopkins or Burke Lakefront
When I touch down we gon' blaze up
We gon' sleep late when we wake up
We gon' crash tomorrow to get away from
Them bad vibes that you call me 'bout
And all them problems you was talkin' 'bout
Man, I really wish Hawk was 'round
And I ain't seen my dawgs in way too long
I can never get use to being away from home
Let me get a haircut, got to pull to roots
Thornhill Drive, yeah these my roots
I remember hittin' Tower City on that Rapid
Now I got a store in Tower City, how that happen?
Never thought Cleveland would be a place I'd visit
But when you from the Midwest man ain't nothin' given

[Hook]

[Intro]
I can do it anyway you want it, yeah
I’m the same as the way I stared
I can do it anyway you want it
Alright, yeah

[Hook]
I’d like to propose a toast
To the future, here’s a toast
To the past
Grab a glass, I'mma turn this bottle upside down
Tomorrow to my momma, hope I’m making you proud
Here’s a toast, to right now

[Verse 1]
This one’s for Ray for telling me not to stop dreamin'
This one’s for Mackme who held me down from the start
I’ve been trying to chase back down the feelin'
That I probably never even really had to start
I remember when I told my mom
The record label really liked my song
She told me "Mike stop smoking weed"
Now she sees me on the TV

[Hook]
I’d like to propose a toast
To the future, here’s a toast
To the past
Grab a glass, I'mma turn this bottle upside down
Tomorrow to my momma, hope I’m making you proud
Here’s a toast, to right now

[Verse 2]
To the Jack in the bottom of my Solo cup now
To the thangs that he’s about to make me do
I would probably do the same shit if I was sober
I just use that as my excuse
I remember when I told my friends
Just wait until 20-10
And I'mma have my CD on a shelf
At least that’s what I would tell myself

[Hook]
I’d like to propose a toast
To the future, here’s a toast
To the past
Grab a glass, I'mma turn this bottle upside down
Tomorrow to my momma, hope I’m making you proud
Here’s a toast, to right now

[Outro]
I could do it anyway you wanted
I’m the same as the way I started
I could do it anyway you wanted
Yeah I’m the same

[Verse 1]
I went to school with Maria, the other day I seen her
Dancing up and down on the pole
When I was smoking on sativa
She was a cheerleader
What happened to her? Nobody knows
Got me feeling like an asshole
I got it perfect, and I don’t know
If I deserve it
And when I’m on stage, I see a memory
It fucks me up cause, it could have been me

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say she’s on the class a team
Stuck in her day dream
Been this way since 18, but lately
Her face seems, slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries and they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
Cause we’re just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
She don’t wanna go outside tonight
And in her pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
And it’s too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly

[Verse 2]
I ain’t spoken to my best friend in over two years
It’s fucked up cause he’s addicted to them pills
And he’s fucked up
Not too long ago, we was on the come up
Your two best friends got signed, no such luck
See you was in the group with Sean
When he was still Sean The Don
And we was all just tryin' not to wake up my mom
But Kanye didn’t want you
A couple years later then I got signed too
You always felt like we didn’t do enough for you
If you done been patient, we could make more moves
And now I’m hearing stories
I know your two best friends just living our your dreams
I love you Pat
I love you Pat
I feel like I let you down and there ain’t no fucking drug for that
Here we go, here we go

[Chorus]
Cause we’re just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And he don’t wanna go outside tonight
And in the pipe he flies to the motherland
Gets dope from the pusher man
And it’s too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly

[Hook: Mike Posner]
At this time next year I'mma have enough to buy the whole damn thang, thang, thang
Yeah I am doing pretty good right now but I swear just wait, wait
Imma take it to the top, top, top of the world 

[X6]

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Imma take it to the top, ha, I knew it
You came in here solo, nah, I crewed it
Funny I turned all my "I'm gonna be's" to I do it
Been ballin' out for a minute, still play like I'm gettin' recruited
I showed and proved it and came up in the game and made a name, clap it up
Seem like yesterday, man we was in your hooptie, lappin' up
How sometimes you have to look back in your life and laugh it up
Tryna make it to the top and throw my dawgs a ladder up

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Ain't no artist in the game that could match this
Gym shorts on a date with an actress
And I'm still gon' hit
I could pllllllt on the tracks and it's still gon' hit
Fuck the dress code, these ain't retros
Who that smooth voice is with the best flow?
Yours truly
Keep your feelings to yourself let me do me

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Verse 3]

[Big Sean]
Same ol' G, I just made a crib replacement
Whip replacement, floatin' down the street, floatin', bitch I've been paradin'
Everybody 'round me paid like gettin' rich contagious

[Mike Posner]
Another hit, 'scuse me while I run the bases
Sister's graduating, so yeah I'm feeling good
Midwest beard all over Hollywood
See the way they hatin', see the way I shine
Dexter Ave, it's a big mural, me and Sean

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Outro: Mike Posner (Big Sean)]
I do it
(Man, that's my line, lil bitch, you ain't even say it right)
Fuck you bro, I say it how I want
Laughs
(Champagne)
This is my problem with interviews, you know. What if you did music and someone else could come in and change your words around and then release it to the radio? And you don't even get a chance to listen to it before they dropped it to radio. That's how interviews are. You, you say what you say and then you'll get paraphrased and then they'll do shit like, if you say a joke, most jokes are inappropriate. They's, they're like fucked up things that you say but it's kind of funny the way you word 'em. And if you take away, you know, the setup or the punchline, you just sound absolutely crazy. Which is, they love to do that because I love to joke and I give them too much and then my shit don't be like all dry ass interviews and stuff, like I don't have media training or whatever. And then, so they take that, and I, and I told Gabe, I said look, well I wanna, I wanna do uh, I wanna get approval over the shit, just because I wanted to be as entertaining as possible, I want people to have the information. And you know, like a lot of magazines, they got real uptight, they like, "no you 'on't get approval, you 'on't get approval, you don't get approval." So, you know, when I say the line 'bout The Rolling Stone, I don't have a problem with Rolling Stone. I really appreciate the fact that they did put me on the magazine and I realize that you know I was halfway out of my mind for the past two years and shit. I was, you know, off that drug called fame and shit like that, I was really like, I was like a little crazy, you know what I'm sayin', like I've calmed down and shit and like come back to Earth. So, you know, for the editor of Rolling Stone, I wanted to say that. But I do wanna say that it was pieces of the article that was, information in the article that was incorrect. And you know, if you allowed me to proofread it, the people could've had the proper information. And just to speak to the Dave LaChapelle, 'cause Dave LaChapelle's one of my favorite photographers, modern-day Warhol. I wanna speak to the cover. You know, people say, "Okay well he has a god complex." Fam if someone's in college and they do like a play where they emulate Christ, do they have a god complex? Are they allowed to do that? You know, it's because of my position, it's like I'm not allowed to be creative. So every cover I take has to just be a picture of my face and shit, just... look it's my face! It's me! And sometimes it's like after you see—after I see me so much, I get tired of me and shit... I gotta look at me every day! I wanna do shit that's exciting to me. So the Rolling Stone's cover was exciting to me, that shit went down in history. I did it purely for creative reasons, it was't speaking upon you know, anything disrespectful to Christianity, to anything like that. It was something I did purely creative. Lot of times I do shit and people take more out of it. You know like I said Bush doesn't care about Black people and then people took it and said, "Well you said, "Bush hates Black people."" You know, everybody takes it and makes it what they want it to be. When you know, I just say, I express something. You know, the other day somebody came to me like, "Okay well who you voting on? Barack or Hillary?" And I'm like I'm not really political dawg, I'm not getting into like you know I'm taking sides and this type of thing. He's like, "What do you mean you're not political? You're not..." I was like, fam! I'm emotional! I'm social! I'm like... I'm an artist! Like if you give me the opportunity, I'm like the fan that got too close to the stage and shit. I'm the glitch in the matrix, I'm like the last person to say, yo I really feel... I know I'm supposed to feel like this and know I'm supposed to read this teleprompter or whatever, but I feel like this what I wanna say. That doesn't put me... I'm never going politically incorrect or anything. I don't know about politics like that. I just know about people. I make music for people

[Intro: Bo Burnham, Disembodied Voice, Right Brain]
Okay, um, we're moving right along here, um...
Hello, patient 24602
I'm sorry, hello. How are—
How are you feeling?
Um, not great
Has the treatment been working?
Uh, I don't think so, no
What are your remaining symptoms?
I just, I—I internalize my feelings a lot, I have trouble articulating how I'm feeling to other people, I feel like I just, I'm—
So basically, you're still a little bitch
Yes, very mature of you, disembodied voice way up there
I was just joking, nigga
Alright, you're not as safe in Wisconsin as you might think with that shit
I'm not human, I can say whatever I want
Alright, just, just get to the point, what's wrong with me? Please, please
Your emotion and logic are at war
Your creativity and analysis are at war, and most simply, your left and right brain are at war
My left and my ri—
To fix the problem, we must separate them from each other
Sep—
Splitting your neurological functions in
5... 4... 3... 2... 1...
Well, we book an appointment or something? You don't just start counting down to major medical procedures
This may hurt a bit
I don't know what it is. Just tell me what you're—
Isolation complete

This is Bo's Right Brain: subjective, creative, sensory. Aware of feelings, aware of people. He's emotional, and an idiot
That's your opinion, just, careful with opinions
Okay boys, play nice

[Verse 1: Left Brain & Right Brain]
I am the Left Brain, I am the Left Brain
I work really hard until my inevitable death brain
You got a job to do, you better do it right in the right way with the Left Brain's might
I like Oreos and pussy, yes! In that order!
And I cried for at least an hour after watching Toy Story 3, Woody!
I am the Right Brain, I have feelings, I'm a little all over the place
But I'm lustful and trustful and I'm looking for somebody to love Or put my penis in
Here comes a female, here comes a female
Puff your chest out, take your phone out and check your email
Our evolutionary purpose is repopulate
So gather data now and see if she's a possible mate
Holy fuck, I think she might be the one
There's something about her, I just can't describe it
Tits
I am the earth, she's the glorious sun
I want her to trust me and I just want her to—how do I say this? Sit on my face? Sit—SIT ON MY FACE!
Alright now, Right Brain, you're being insane
No, Left Brain, I'm just being alive
You should try it, you might like it
I worked hard to give him everything he cared about
You were worried 'bout the things he was scared about
I'm calm and collected when you act wild
I am the adult, you are the child
You think you're the right one every time
You think you know everything but you don't know anything at all
Half of his problems were supposed to be mine
But you wanted everything
I hope that you're happy, 'cause he's sure not

[Interlude: Left Brain & Right Brain]
Well according to my calculations, I'm sorry, let me run the numbers again, um, you're a pussy
Name calling, really? You're gonna just do name calling?
I'm name calling names alright, I'm just stating facts, and the fact is, you're a quivering pussy
I'm the pussy? Well at least I don't play with toys still, okay
Rubik's cubes are not toys alright, they keep my spatial reasoning skills sharp
Left Brain plays with toys! Look at you! Mister, you're a toy player...
Well,​ at least I did my fucking job, alright? I kept him working, I kept him productive You were supposed to look after him, you were supposed to keep him emotionally stable for all this. Now you're trying to blame me for how he's feeling, how he's feeling! If he's feeling unhappy it's because you failed him. You did this to him, he hates you I know he does, he fucking hates you!
*sobs*
Right brain, look, I'm sorry, okay?
No you're not

[Verse 2: Left Brain, Right Brain, Disembodied Voice]
Look, maybe there's something that we could do together
Together?
Take the best parts of both of us, put them together
I'm listening
It would let you let your feelings out, it would let me analyze
So you could man the themes, I'll man the form
It's something that George Carlin did, it's something that Steve Martin did
It's something special that we could both perform, do you know what it is?
Juggling! We could juggle and juggle our cares away!
It was—it was comedy, we could do comedy together, and—
Initiating reassembly
Alright, Left—Right brain, look, we’re gonna do comedy together alright? We gotta do comedy
Alright, alright, Left Brain, I'll do comedy with you
Look, we can fix him like this, we can make him happy again, I promise, alright?
Reformation in 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...
Left Brain... Left Brain, I love you!
I know
Experimentation complete

[Outro]
Thank you very much

Thank you guys for coming, it's so nice. I wanted to record the CD in Madison because it's always been one of my favorite places to play. I played here last year, I don't know if some people came to that one?

That's very nice, thanks for coming, again, I appreciate it. Um, there's gonna be—you know, there's little silences in the show as I'm moving in between pieces, don't feel like you have to fill that silence with laughter or applause. I don't want you leaving this show saying, you know, "My hands hurt from clapping, my stomach hurts from laughing." I just want you leaving this show thinking, "Oh, well..."

And we're on our way...

[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

[Chorus]
So we keep waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

[Verse 2]
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

[Chorus]
That's why we're waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And we're still waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

[Outro]
Now we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change

[Intro]
Uh huh, uh, yeah, ya know
It's the boy Wiz
Sometimes I gotta sit back and think, ya know
The audacity I have for these n*ggas man, ya know
But you know I just gotta focus on the positive, ya know
Cuz' the negative ain't gonna do nothin' but.. you know what I'm sayin'
Bring me down, and I've worked too hard to get where I'm at
I can guarantee you one thing, I ain't going nowhere
I'ma be right here baby, 412
Uh huh, and this the Prince, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Homie we came up, niggas hatin' cuz not havin' paper just ain't us
Take it from me, shit for free, nobody gave us
Tired of strugglin' so we hustle to get the change up, yeah, yeah
Hustle to get the change up, yeah, yeah (Repeat X4)

[Verse 1]
Uh, look homie I'm from the ill-gritty, city where they kill plenty
Lost some niggas along the way, some of em' still wit' me
So why don't ya'll come through, while the boys show you
How we livin' in the 412
Where young niggas got no intentions of workin' jobs
Cookin' that raw is they definition of workin' hard
Chop it, bag it, hit the block and work it hard
Tired of strugglin', so we started hustlin'
Gotta bring that money in, didn't wanna run the streets
But lookin' at an empty plate'll make a nigga wanna eat
And get up on his feet, hustlin' and scramblin'
A (..?) will let the cold world make a man of him
And fam listen, pay attention to who you 'round
Another man can never pull you up, but he can pull you down
This somethin' every real nigga can feel here
They hate me for the fact that I'm still here (and I ain't going nowhere)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo, some say I mention drugs in every one of my songs
Not knowin' you ain't gotta be doin' wrong to get your hustle on
Long as you're goin' hard, I was taught, growin' up in Pittsburgh
Shit it means, gettin' cake by any means
Niggas on that rap shit, niggas on that crack shit
Most niggas will clap quick, end up on your back split
Some niggas will 9 to 5, and never make a pack flip
Tryin' to get that cheese, some niggas end up on that rat shit
'Round here that's how you get sent into a back-flip
Nothin' else to be said, my niggas try and see bread
Tired of them stomach pains, niggas try and keep fed
Fillin' up your pipe veins, green for the weed-head
City full of pipe-dreams, believe me i been sold those
Heavy chronic habit, we gon' need the whole zone
I stay higher than the Ozone Layer
I'm from the Burgh, nigga don't go there

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I never backed or run away, slacked for one day
Had somethin' on my chest, and held back what i wanna say
That's how i wasn't raised, manned up quicker
The young boy grew up into a stand up nigga
Fuck you pay me, I demand them figures
I'm gettin' mine shorty, we young niggas on the rise, on the grind Shorty had enough of the lies
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Growin' up, brewin' up
Guerrilla gettin' trained up
Look out, look out
From over the rooftop
Growin' up, brewin' up
Guerrilla gettin' trained up
Look out, look out
From over the rooftop
Competition coming up now
Load up, aim, fire, fire, pop
Competition coming up now
Load up, aim, fire, fire, pop

[Verse 1]
Row da boat straight to da ocean
Give him a run a run at his own game
Signal the plane an' I landed on the runway
A survivor, independent foreigner
First your beats had me running to the running man
Then your chat had me wanna do the boogie man
Click suits and booted in the Timbaland
Freakin' out to Missy on a Timbaland

[Chorus]
Growin' up, brewin' up
Guerrilla gettin' trained up
Look out, look out
From over the rooftop
Growin' up, brewin' up
Guerrilla gettin' trained up
Look out, look out
From over the rooftop
Competition coming up now
Load up, aim, fire, fire, pop
Competition coming up now
Load up, aim, fire, fire, pop

[Verse 2]
You shoulda been good to me
Then I wouldn't get so rowdy rowdy
You shoulda kept ya eye on me
Then I wouldn't get so baddy baddy
Whether you are swingin' out to swing beat
Laying low and jacking up to Lou Reed
Chasin' out to Pixies and the Beasties
Doin' acid with hair colored geek freaks
Fast forward onto the' 04
Got my own flow get you to the dance floor
Little mamma doin' the booty rolls
Crump clowns got me rootin' for the linos

[Chorus]
Growin' up, brewin' up
Guerrilla gettin' trained up
Look out, look out
From over the rooftop
Growin' up, brewin' up
Guerrilla gettin' trained up
Look out, look out
From over the rooftop

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
How I'm going crazy crazy crazy bitch I get it
These bitches popping mollies like the hippies in the 60's
Bring your ass to East Atlanta I don't do deliveries
I'm talking like I'm Tony Montana
Homes ain't killing no children
In Sun Valley with blue new Ballys and
Bricks all under the building
Homegirl said her man getting money
But I ain't seen the nigga I missed it
New Lambo and I'm sitting real low
Sliding riding without my ceiling
Used to be my ho, you can have that ho
My nigga I ain't got no feelings
Before I started rapping, Gucci Mane was selling dope
Her brother want to meet me but I'm steady saying 'no'
Call my phone again, I'mma have to tell 'em 'go'
2 hundred squares, hundred pairs
What's the price - low (Gucci)

[Hook: Bankroll Fresh]
Bring them things in, bring them things in
When you come, man make sure you have them dividends
Hope you got a whole bunch of hundreds
So I can easily count it
Man I'm going hard, summertime them Forgies mounted
How you doing? Im going stupid, going dumb bitch
I'm a Zone 3 nigga you know I'm on that slum shit
And my nigga from that 6
And he juugin off them bricks
And he fucking with Yung Fresh
And they know the streets is back (hey)

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Johnny Dang on my wrist
Cost 'bout a couple bricks
Got Vellanos on my whips
Forgiatos on my whips
Got the .40 on my hip
With 'bout 50 in the clip
Hit the kitchen, hit the strip
Drop some pounds and some zips
Hit the block, sell it here
Hit your block, let it rip
She give me top in that six
Bitch my watch very clear
And my pockets very fat
And I stay spending racks
Spend them stacks, get it back
12 chickens in the back
Migos meet me in the front
Bitch this ain't what I want
Try to play me like a punk
My niggas will leave you slumped
Migos meet me in the front
Bitch this ain't what I want
Try to play me like a punk
My niggas will leave you slumped

[Hook: Bankroll Fresh]
Bring them things in, bring them things in

And my nigga from that 6
And he juugin off them bricks
And he fucking with Yung Fresh
And they know the streets is back (hey)
Chasing summer on the rooftops
On the high beats and the air we breathe, the air we breathe
Running reckless, couldn’t care less
I remember it will set you free, it will see you free!

Oh, I can be a little stronger
And try a little harder
We can do better
If we love a little louder
Love a little louder
Love a little louder
Love a little louder
Love a little louder

Lost the daylight
Loving red light
Tasting first touch
What you wanna feel?
What you wanna feel?

And we’re rising and stumbling and fall
Here we are, here we are, here we are
You and me, is you and me
Oh, I can be a little stronger
And try a little harder
We can do better
If we love a little louder
Oh, I can be a little stronger
And try a little harder
We can do better
If we love a little louder
Love a little louder
Love a little louder
Love a little louder
Love a little louder

[Chorus]
We be the illest
We be the illest in here
I know you feel us
We be the illest in here
Illest in here
We so muthafuckin' ill!

[Verse 1: Kev Nish]
Yeh, I be Illin' out from LA, I be illin' out all the way
Got a v-mail from my K-Town chick that wanna hook up and blaze
I got OG cannabis (can I bust?), girl, one puff will put you in your grave
Got three pills and four jimmy hats, cause we don't kid and play
Popov, yo, guess who's getting drunk, no muthafuckas can't out-drink us
If you sipping that hate, don't get drowned, so cold polar bears on my nuts
Y'all know who we be, I hold it down for the East
Cause I keeps it pimpin', Peter Griffin, yellow tinted on Z's

[Bridge: J-Splif]
Drippin' on yo couches
Drippin' on yo couches
Sippin' Tanqueray with Orange Bang we on that Tropicana
Drippin' on yo couches
From the hills to public housing
If you feelin' ill then damn you ill
Be the illest on a thousand

[Chorus]
We be the illest
We be the illest in here
I know you feel us
We be the illest in here
Illest in here
We so muthafuckin' ill!

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
Yeah, nice chain, what a nice night
My ice bright, I play the wall like a night-light
Tangerine tambourine from the West Wing
The best thing about my room? Versace bed springs
I'm in the building, more gold than Rumpelstiltskin
Aw shit, look who it is: the white Russell Simmons
Jody Highroller, Far East Movement
We so ill, I think I need some codeine fluid
Riff!

[Bridge: J-Splif]
Drippin' on yo couches
Drippin' on yo couches

[Outro: Prohgress]

And "double L" is for the way I blow that smoke in ya face
We roll on "E's" and we be easy rollin that bank
And "ST" is for the Illest shit we rep every day

[Intro: Mac Miller]
This is madness! (Madness)
This is an outrage! (An outrage)
As a matter of fact, this is outrageous! (Outrageous!)
Hahahah, yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Young sire, slap the fuck out Jon Cryer
Rough rider, raw bust inside a vagina like I want kids
My head continues to be haunted
I burn a city down while I'm unconscious
Maybe go and take some Quaaludes, conversate with Jesús
Batting practice with the motherfuckin' ghost of Babe Ruth
Do as a saint do, turn painful to graceful
The devil on my trails, I'm tryna find the Holy Grail
*Coughs* Right there
And if Mars is the farthest that man has set his target
Then I don't know why I even started
I'm sick of bein' too nice to people who don't do shit but consume light
Told myself, "Fuck the world, kid, just do what you like
Go and have a food fight, start yourself a new life
You're too bright to be inside a bunch of mediocrity
But all those big words ain't gon' get you paid
And those abstract ideas for sure won't get you laid
You got it made in that mad house
What the fuck you got to be sad 'bout? Go 'head and rap now
Do what you do best
I mean, that's what you do best
Matter fact, motherfucker, you a suit vest, you need to buy a new dress
I heard you and your girl live in a duplex
I'ma put her ass in a suplex, the sun east, the moon west
If you got a clue, what does a clue get? Nothin'"

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
My milk and honey, my chérie-chérie amore
My Cinderella in her carriage by the doorway
Her ruby slipper made the wizard send the scarecrow
And the lion through the forest
To the Wicked Witch's fortress where she scorched them in the foreplay
Remember that? He said he'd fight the box to see the wizard
When he was visited by Dorothy who came here on a blizzard
Now the whole world's in color, still
How Auntie Em was next of kin but not her mother, real
Her face was careworn
I suspect she migrated to Kansas up from Dearborn
And had beef with Mrs. Gulch since the very beginnin' of year one
Mr. Candyman, the parables parabolic
The poetry's like the poems and psalms of Ecclesiastes
Lightnin' should strike the stone and then Moses should make a tablet
The Judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet
And yell, "Hear, hear," finally some order to this rap shit
Finally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips
I keep my shit crispy and elegant
So miss me with the irrelevant, the godbody is heaven-sent
The hard-body is reverence, since the son of Byford
Brother of Fal, every rhyme's halal
Every line is kosher, livin' la vida loca
Shout out to Tony Toca, we ballin' like we suppose to...

[Bridge]
Higher now over it all
Livin' it up
I ain't coming down

[Verse 1]
Yo, I got a crazy feelin' like

Everybody's jumping
Grass monkey to the sound

I see you covered in gold
From the window to the wall
Dirty bass is in your boombox
Banging tron

[Hook]
(I would've take you higher)
Let me see your hands up in the air

[Verse 2]
Check it out yo

White girls in the boot
Peeling clothes like Tanturines

So when we teen

[Hook]
(I would've take you higher)

You could ask yourself a question, do I feel lucky?
Well do you, punk?
Ladies and gentlemen

(Verse 1: Michael Jackson)
Father comes home from work and he’s scared to death
Mother runs to the table and the note she read
Father runs to the table he said what’s going on?
Mother cries desperately, our little baby is gone

(Chorus)
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

(Verse 2: Michael Jackson)
She wrote that she's tired of step-daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things while sexually abusing her
Just think that she’s all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive she ain’t got nothing to eat
(Chorus)
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?

(Verse 3: Jay-Z)
Maintaining this is the same old thang
Little stress, little fault, too much change
I see you kept it moving, you see I kept improving
See now we have an agreement, remember how I used to walk up and down the street man
Put it down to the streets watching saying hood it down
Just to earn nothing what good is it now

(Chorus)
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Save me from this living hell
Save me cause that I'm gonna do
Save me I'm tired and I'm fed
Save me cause this because of you
Save me cause I’m on a debt
Save me cause I don't want no more
Save me cause terror arrived
Save me
(Verse 4: Michael Jackson)
Now she’s on the move, she’s off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money is good
She gets off from the train station, a man is waiting there
I’ll show you what the money is, girl just let down your hair
He’s taking her on the streets of sunset boulevard
She’s selling her body ha girl that will take ya far
The police comes around the corner somebody up there told
He’s arresting this little girl she’s only 12 years old

Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are X 4

(Outro)
Father comes home from work and he's scared to death
Mother runs to the table and the note she read
Father runs to the table he said what’s going on?

[Hook]
Take me away, way , way, way , way , way, way
Take me away, way, way, way, way
(Pick your planet, break it, roll it, blow it, then get blown away.)
(Pick your planet, break it, roll it, blow it, then get blown away.)

[Verse 1]
5,4,3,2,1 blunts passed off
Pick your planet, roll it, toke it, smoke it, then we blast off
I'll probably be on mars when I light up
Clean up, then head down to Venus to get wifed up
The nigga in me wanna go to Pluto to get iced up
Race through space
Damn these colors vibrant
I'm going on a trip without the luggage
But there's baggage cause I bagged it
If the police see I have it
Flash the badge and they'll try to

[Hook]
(Cuts off)

[Outro]

[Verse 1: Jay K]
Yeah and I know she can't say no, all she see is green so she ridin' when I'm sayin' so

I ain't trying to gas you up nigga I ain't ethanol
Bringin' home that bread and bacon
I got high cholesterol, my nigga I get it, what about you
I promised mamma' Benz and a new house too
And man I'm addicted to that good pasta and that cooked lobster
Paper chasin' I'm gon' probably need a foot doctor
LL I'm in love with the label boy
Bitch I'mma dog I wake up and chase the paper boy
But do you niggas really know about paper?
But do you niggas really know about paper?

[Hook]
Iraq in this bitch, Iraq 

[I turn the club to]
Iraq in this bitch/Iraq in this bitch

[One call] Iraq in this bitch
Iraq in this bitch Iraq in this bitch

[You better get down] Iraq in this bitch
Iraq in this bitch, Iraq 

[You better get down]
Iraq in this bitch//Iraq in this bitch
Iraq in this bitch

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Now why why why/Would you compare me to you
If you think we're equal/Then bitch, you are remedial
Remember who you're speaking to/Call it egotistical
But I am one of one, Yup and there is not a sequel, sequel
Soon as I approach in/Please do not approach him
Or you will need a little more than Ibuprofen (B.I.G.)
Please try and test us/One hand gesture
We'll fill they ass with lead like standardized testing, testing
And you already know where I live
How could I make it out that bitch being a bitch
(I know) I'mma drink glass after glass
(I know) I tend to act for ass over ass
Bet a stack I'll make your bitch come over
There's diamonds on deck like a nigga playing poker
I hear them niggas talkin' but bet all they do is look
See, to you I'm Mr. Big but to him, I'm Mr. Bush, Bitch. Look, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dustly McFly]
Success brings envy
I gotta watch out for these jealous thugs
So I am working with these mags like editors
I went from trapping to rapping to make a extra buck
But now I keep that shotty by me like a Elmer Fudd
McFly shitting, I know the haters smell us
I make it hard to breathe they need oxygen inhalers
I'm so froze I need a double sweater//I got two softball hoes
And every time I run home, they give me double headers
You can't come to my city talking absurd
And don't take it from me, just ask Young Berg
So if I snatch your bitch, you better get to walking
You think you cute? You probably look better in a coffin
Flight leer ice gear, Phantom, I just must steer
Little nigga just build a buzz/You just had a light year
And I am sick of all of this hating shit
Had 'em dumping like a bad ass relationship

[Hook]

[Intro]
These niggas know
Huh

[Verse 1]
Armed and dangerous, call the law
Stick to the script, no audible
Country ass nigga with an Audemars
Can't spell the shit but I order more
French hoes treat me like Charles De Gaulle
Get good head on the Autobahn
Hit hood hoes out in Baltimore
Pack the shows like wall to wall, my God
Five steps like Dru Hill
Came home from the first tour, with
Bad credit and a school bill
Middle finger to the bursar
Finally famous but
Ain't too much really change with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us notorious, that was '97
Saw my old teacher and she asked how I'm livin'
You ain't know my shit drop bitch? 9-11
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Nigga you should too, if you knew
What this game would do to you
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Better me than you

[Bridge]
I must confess, I copped the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same

[Chorus]
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know

[Verse 2]
These niggas know, boo-ya nigga?
Came through the door like who y'all niggas?
Stole a nigga flow, I could sue y'all niggas
Better yet put a hot one through y'all niggas
Nah, let me stop frontin' for y'all niggas but
Don't let the college shit fool y'all niggas
Ain't the hardest nigga in the land
But a grown ass man, and I will step to y'all niggas
Like what's the problem?
Ain't gettin' paper, nigga here's a loan
My shit long, need a hair salon
Get it cut, shut the fuck up
And wipe your face with my money 'til your tears is gone
No cryin' ass, lyin' ass
Can't afford a whip, but you buyin' ass
This Fresh Prince nigga, I ain't Jazz
Fucked yo bitch, nigga I ain't ask
She pitched it to me like Sosa (Oh God)
What the fuck was I s'posed do?
Deny that, rather try that, but I never fly that
Keep hoes bi-coastal
And they buy postals, ain't shit for free
Dick the only thing that they get from me
Sit VIP, get a sip for free
Later on she'll be sippin' me, literally
Picture me at the tip-top
With your bitch lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
This B.I.G. nigga, this Pac
Minus six shots, but it's still this hot
Thirty grand and that's just for the wristwatch
Hate to brag but backpacker that's hip hop
Write my life and make sure that the script hot
And pray the kids watch, if not
These niggas know
If not, these niggas know

[Bridge]
I must confess, I copped the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I must confess, I cut the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same

[Chorus]
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know

[Verse 1]
Stretching out your tightness
Good enough to make you grow
We are all in favor of this motion

Stretching out your tightness
Time to open up your hole
When it rains, I let myself get wet

I have always wanted to
Give something to my brother
Proposing to expose your head
Just something that is like no other

[Chorus]
I'll stretch you out
I'll stretch you out, my friend
I'll stretch you out

[Verse 2]
The juice that flows from intuition
Is my liquid fare
We are all in favor of the open end
Three pounds of love and knowledge
Are expanding in my skull
Truth be told, we let the good times roll

I have always needed to
Receive it and believe it
And it's making and creating love
Tender titillation

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm a fish and I can swim all day
I can swim in so many ways
Make it up as I go along
That way it is never wrong

I'm a bird and I can fly away
I can shift in so many shapes
Make it up as I go along
That way it is never wrong
Owwwwwwww....

[Bridge]
There's a glowing up around the moon
It is showing
We want to play in the water that is flowing

[Verse 4]
Very legendary
Extra planetary fairy
Varied truths, she's making just for you

Yes I have always wanted to
Give something to the stranger
M-m-m-moving to improve the groove
A mental transformation

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
It's very far away
It takes about a half a day to get there
If we travel by my, dragonfly
No it's not in Spain
But all the same you know, it's a groovy name
And the wind's just right
Hey!

[Chorus]
Hang on my darling
Hang on if you want to go
Hear it's a really groovy place
It's uh, just a little bit of uh, said uh
Spanish Castle Magic

[Verse 2]
The clouds are really low
And they overflow with cotton candy
And battlegrounds red and brown
But it's all in your mind
Don't think your time on bad things
Just float your little mind around
Look out! Ooh

[Chorus]
Hang on my darling, yeah
Hang on if you want to go
It's a ha, as you can see
A really groovy place
It's just a little bit of
Spanish Castle Magic
Yeah baby, listen

[Instrumental Break]
Yeah, It's all in your mind babe
Ow! Yeah

[Chorus]
Hang on my darling, hey
Hang on, hang on if you want to go
Oh girl, that's right baby
It's a, a little bit of
Spanish Castle Magic, hey
Little bit of
Spanish Castle Magic
Hey, I can't sing this song

[Outro]
Yeah baby
Get on baby, yeah
It's all in your mind
Little bit of daydream here and there
Oh, yeah, oh, hey!
Everything's going to be alright
Young money, young, young, young, young money, young mula baby

[Hook:]
And I can smell her looking at I
She recognize real I don't wear no disguise
And I can see it in her eyes
She fucking me with her eyes
She fucking me with her eyes

[Lil Wayne:]
Gazing out the window of somethin foreign
Thinking to myself-self
How come getting money never gets boring

[Hook]

[Kidd Kidd:]
Her chanel frames are like X-rays
She see us out the club and into the bed
She picture me in her head and her givin' head
Handcuffs and whips I'm a sex slave
No wraps on ma back, rah, whatcha name?
I yell kunta rah kunta kinte
With one foot off I still try to escape but who can I run to like escape
I guess I got some attention to pay
The girl blazin like a doughnut on a early sunday
And I could be the chocolate on top of her sundae
She lookin at me like a fat bitch infront of entree

[Hook]

[Mack Mane:]
You see she wreckless eye baller feelin a nigga swagga
If looks was fuckin no telling how many kids we done had
Got me feelin like Missy, cause she all in my grill
And be face off the peel time to give her that whip a peel
Betcha I can get her home, 4 shots of patron
And then I know it's on tell my niggas look I'm gone
Ma you grown so don't worry bout your girls tryna criticize
One night with Mack & babygirl you'll be dick-notized
Fatten up your hips and thighs
Help that ass bout out
And on the next song tell her give ma dick a shout out
See she could be ma sockee
And I could be her plug
Or she could be ma fiend and I could be her drug
No disguise

[Hook]

[Nicki Minaj:]
All I do is ice grill em

He know my pussy stay warmer than a cardigan
Slippery, slimey, excuse me don't mind me

You know that special head, like I'm in special ed
Got me givin you these nasty looks

The Mistress

[Hook]

[Intro: Andy & Robyn]
Party people (party people)
We have taken control of your minds (your minds)
So get on the floor (oh, yeah)
‘Cause it’s time to kick up dirt, now let’s work (huh!)

[Chorus: Robyn]
Hey, we’re gonna dance tonight, okay?
We all shining bright
Let the music take you away, don’t ask questions
Just do everything that we say

[Verse 1: Jorma, Andy, & Kiv]
On the floor! Ladies, shake that ass
Shake that, shake that ass, work it, twerk it, drop it fast
Fellas! Whip your dick out, whip, whip your dick out
Indiana Jones and whip your fucking dick out
Now punch your friend! Punch, punch your friend
Get on the fucking floor and punch your best friend
Make your butt look flat, make that shit flat
Use the art of perspective or hide it in a hat
Go stupid, get stupid, because we said to do it
Go dumb, eat garbage, we going kindergarten

[Chorus: Robyn]
Yeah, you know, some of it might seem strange
But don’t think, just obey
Let the music play, ’cause we put it in the song
So do everything that we say

[Verse 2: Jorma, Andy, Kiv, (Robyn), All, & The Lonely Island]
Have a motherfucking baby on the floor
Raise it in the club, home-school it by the door
Now be ambidextrous – fuckin’ ambidextrous
We’ll come around and test you, it’s a biggie on our checklist
Now ladies, whip your dick out, whip, whip your dick out
Don’t ask how, just fuckin’ figure it out
Now make your booty speak, teach that ass English
Make it suck helium and talk like this
Now eat a banana, potassium for stamina
Then build a school (yeah), burn it down (yeah)
Get on the floor and do it now
Fuck a house (yeah), eat a shoe (yeah), all because we told you to!

[Bridge: Robyn, Andy, & Jorma]
So raise your glass, then break the glass
Then stomp your bare feet on the glass
Champagne corks, pop 'em off
Middle fingers up, now chop ‘em off
Then pose nude for a family friend
Never speak of it again
The party’s here, and you can’t escape
So just do everything that we say

[Outro: The Lonely Island]
Go zombie, be brainless
Here we are, entertain us
Get stupid, go moron
We going kindergarten

[Verse 1]
Between the lunch and dinner rush
Kelly caught that outbound bus for Vegas
We're all out here talking trash, making bets
Lips wrapped round our cigarettes
She always thought she was too good to be a waitress

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, we all say that we'll quit someday
When our ship comes in, we'll just sail away

[Chorus]
But we're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
Out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke

[Verse 2]
Well, Janie got divorced again
Her ex-husband's in the pen
From two to five, five to ten and longer, hah
And Brenda's traded smokes for cake
Still hadn't lost that baby weight
And that baby's 'bout to graduate from college

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm just flicking ash into the tray
Tell them both it'll be okay

[Chorus]
But I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah (Hey yeah)
I'm out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
Yeah, we're just blowin' smoke

[Bridge]
We all say that we'll quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake
We all say that we'll quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake

[Middle 8]
Wipe down the bar, take out the trash
Light one up and count my cash
Swear I'm never coming back again

[Chorus]
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
Out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
Yeah, we're just blowin' smoke

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Ain't nobody gonna tell me shit
I'm still wrapped around your fingertip
And all my friends, they love to call me whipped
But what they just don't know

Is I've looked in New York City
And I've looked in Boston too
I found a couple that are pretty
But I'm still gonna stay with you

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Ain't nobody gonna tell me shit
I'm still wrapped around your fingertip
And all my friends, they love to call me whipped
But what they just don't know

Is I've looked in San Francisco
And I've looked all through L.A
I've looked in Dallas, Texas
But they didn't feel the same
So I looked in Detroit city
Then I checked back at Duke
I found a couple that were pretty
But I'm still gonna stay with you
I'm still gonna stay with

[Outro]
I'm still gonna stay with you

[Verse 1]
Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away (Rock, right)

[Verse 2]
Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go

[Pre-Chorus]
When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away

And when the groove is dead and gone (Yeah)
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever, on
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you
I wanna rock with you

[Chorus]
I wanna rock (All night)
With you girl (Sunlight)
Rock with you, rock with you girl (Yeah)

B-B-B-B-Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love
Uh-huh, honey

[Refrain: Kanye West]
All them other niggas lame, and you know it now
When a real nigga hold you down, you s'posed to drown

[Chorus: Ponderosa Twins Plus One, Brenda Lee & Kanye West]
Bound to fall in love (Bound)
B-B-B-B-Bound to fall in love (Bound)
Uh-huh, honey

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walk-around-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane around, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit
This that red-cup-all-on-the-lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Brenda Lee]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

[Chorus: Kanye West, Ponderosa Twins Plus One & Brenda Lee]
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches
Bound (Bound to fall in love)
Bound (Bound to fall in love)
Uh-huh, honey

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Brenda Lee]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Uh-huh, honey

[Chorus: Kanye West, Ponderosa Twins Plus One, & Brenda Lee]
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Bound to fall in love
Bound
Bound to fall in love
Bound
Uh-huh, honey

[Hook: Shawn Jay/ Tity Boi (2 Chainz)]
This the hardest beat I ever heard
That's my shit, that's my shit nigga, that's my shit
You see them 24's on the curb
That's my shit, that's my shit nigga, that's my shit
You see them big blunts full of purp
That's my shit, that's my shit nigga, that's my shit
Everything I got I worked for
That's my shit, that's my shit nigga, that's my shit

[Verse 1: Shawn Jay]
Shawn Jay the type to break a ho, young chasin major dough
Cut the check with DTP, now chickens try and play me close
Ballin in the mall with Chaka, shoppin for the latest clothes
Turn your lady to a bopper, watch how I take your ho
Niggas see I get that money, now they wanna wait to blow
Underground grindin, perfect timing in a crazy flow
Put Georgia on your mind and now I'm ridin on the radio
Your ass ain't no DJ, my advise stop playin me folk

[Verse 2: Smoke]
I'm ridin in my drop cut, these 24 inch not scrubbin
In my plastic sack, I got more purple than Baby Bops buddy
So materialistic, we're chopping early today
What rolls around my throat, arm wristed in a bouqet
15's in the back blasting, Peep the candy as I pass em
Watch the chamillion paint flop, like Chingy's last album
Cocoa Chanelle frames, on woodgrain
Old grain blown thangs on my hip, but that's the clips

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dolla Boy]
I'm married to the streets and this beef shit's apart of it
Jumped out with heat, niggas didn't want no parts of it
Pull up in the club, looking like they wanna start something
Fuckin all these niggas hoes, that ain't ever dawned on me
Tired of the fussin, bitches blushin, bumrushin
The car treat me like a star but I ain't done nuttin
Summer almost over with but I ain't done frontin
They hate we gettin money, we gon make these niggas love it

[Verse 4: Tity Boi (2 Chainz)]
Pay my dues, takin crews, just me and my haitian dudes
Makin loot, even made the news in my gator shoes
Three fifty seven Glock, nine, a tech twenty two
Everything I ride in on at least twenty twos
This hustler music is what you hear in them drug zones
They play it in their chevy loud plus it's a club song
That's seven fourty five, that's my whip
The biggest house in the neighborhood, that's my shit

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Perfect Harmony]
I get high like cooley, ruling with the toolin
On a 22, still got that uzi in that hoopty
Niggas all flashy, showing off their jewelry
Til I shoot it through their heart like cupid
Give it to 'em raw like sushi, then I'm back on the groupies
Young nigga with a gun nigga, Norfclik where I'm from nigga
Shut up and roll that blunt nigga and I don't even stunt nigga
Quiet cause I hit them lips, roll up on a nigga with a clip now that's my shit

[Verse 5: Ludacris]
I may be rich but never satisfied, making hoes camera shy
Comin down topping blades, call me The Last Samurai
I'll cut cha, gun butt cha, Knuck ya then buck ya
It calls for Hammer Time if you think we can't touch ya
Cause we too legit to quit, nigga run up on your click nigga
Not action heroes but we all making six figures
So put your choice to it, women get moist to it
A songs worth a million once I lend my fucking voice to it

[Hook]

Loving him for eternity, eternity, eternity

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Hey baby, how you doin' tonight?
I wanna let you know
I wanna tell you just how I feel
I wanna love you, baby
And it's going so right
I wanna burn a candle
Turn the darkness to light

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
With the fire we make
It's getting hotter and hotter
Like a moth to a flame
I can't stay away
From the fire we make
It's getting higher and higher
Like the night to the day
I can't stay, I can't stay away
No, no, no, no
Stay away

[Verse 2: Maxwell]
Hi baby, won't you tell me the truth?
You wanna be the one
You can't stay away
Oh, hey darling
Don't you make no excuse
We can chase the sun
And burn the hole inside you

[Chorus: Maxwell]
With the fire we make
It's getting hotter and hotter
Like a moth to a flame
I can't stay away
From the fire we make
It's getting higher and higher
Like the night to the day
I can't stay, I can't stay away

[Bridge: Alicia Keys & Maxwell]
This abyss of the world and it takes us to the stars
It's getting higher and higher
It's the fire we make (It's the fire we make)
Getting sweeter and sweeter
Like a night to a day (About to make up these flames)
I can't stay away
Say it's, no no (Yeah)
No no no, no no no, can't stay away (Baby. can't stay)
No no no (No, you can't)
No no no (Baby, baby, baby)
No no no, yeah

I wanna tell you, I wanna love you

I can't be done
I just can't stay away
I wanna make some much fire with you, baby (Flame on, baby)
I wanna go, gonna go to you darling, ah (Woo.. that's right)
I say yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Right there
In the middle of a conversation
Wasn't anything special you said
It was just there
Right then
I didn't have time even to overthink it
I loved you and all of a sudden
I was all in

[Bridge]
It's like my knees are all weak and the butterflies
They were dancing and taking all of my air
From that moment on it was very clear

[Chorus]
That's when I knew I fell in love
That's when I knew you were the one
That's when I knew you stole my heart away from me
That's when I knew that I was sunk
That was the moment that I knew I was in love
That's when I knew
That's when I knew
That's when I knew

[Verse 2]
That day
I didn't know we were going where the night would end
I didn't know there was something brewing and if it was
I didn't know how much I care
That touch
When you barely held my hand, I was overcome
With feelings I don't understand
Not in a million years I didn't think that we'd be here

[Bridge]
It's like my knees are all weak and the butterflies
Got me dancing and taking all of my air
From that moment on it was very very very very clear

[Chorus]
That's when I knew I fell in love
That's when I knew you were the one
That's when I knew you stole my heart away from me
That's when I knew that I was sunk
That was the moment that I knew I was in love
That's when I knew
That's when I knew
That's when I knew
Don't you know it?
Hey
That's when I knew, baby
That's when I knew
That's when I knew
Baby

[Verse 3]
You know (that) you know
You know what you feel
And there's no denying
That love is for real
There is nothing to do
Just let it in
Gotta surrender

[Chorus]
That's when I knew I fell in love
That's when I knew you were the one
That's when I knew you stole my heart away from me
That's when I knew that I was sunk
That was the moment that I knew I fell in love
(That's when I knew)
(That's when I knew)
(That's when I knew)
That’s when I knew with that minute
That’s when I knew it was that beautiful
Sometimes you get it, sometimes you get it
That’s when I knew it, baby
Yeah, that’s when I knew
That’s when I knew we fell in love

[Verse 1]
You used to the sound of a heart that's breaking
I know it don't faze you anymore
You're the king of the game that you're playing
I know you've played it a hundred times before
You fill your bedroom up with trophies
Then you get a kick out of closing the door
Got all the words to keep on hoping
I know you've said them a hundred times before

[Chorus]
Then there's me, all fox for your gun
Then there's me, just love me for fun
Then there's me, no use in pretending
Oh there's me, 101

[Verse 2]
I might as well stand in front of a bullet
Close my eyes and kick the chair to the floor
It's like a speeding train is coming
I know you've crashed it 100 times before

[Chorus]
Then there's me, all fox for your gun
Then there's me, just love me for fun
Then there's me, no use in pretending
Oh there's me, 101

[Bridge]
Everybody says I gotta be crazy
That I deserve everything that I get
But I got a feeling
That makes me wanna ignore all that you've done a 100 times before

[Chorus 2]
'Cause then there's me, could I be the one?
And baby, there's me, to make you undone
Uh darling there's me, no use, no use in pretending
Oh there's me, 101
Me, 101

[Outro]
So I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be a 101
Maybe it's time, maybe it's me
Maybe I could be, maybe pretend
I gotta be, I wanna be 101
Yeah, baby

[Verse 1]
If I fell in love with you, would you understand me, dear?
Love is weird
I colored you a valentine
Struggled just to stay inside the lines
I lose my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I really can't believe I lost myself again

[Chorus]
Looking for something crazy
Beautiful love
And now I'm talking in circles again
Have my love, baby
Are you hungry for wonderful? 'Cause I am
Wonderful, 'cause I am

[Verse 2]
I wrote a song about your eyes
Ate a slice of cherry pie
I cried all night
On a bench inside the park
I'll kiss you slowly in the dark
I'll never stop

[Pre-Chorus]
I really can't believe I lost myself again

[Chorus]
Looking for something crazy
Beautiful love
And now I'm talking in circles again
Have my love, baby
Are you hungry for wonderful? 'Cause I am
Wonderful, 'cause I am

[Bridge]
Baby, take me for a ride
Maybe get a little high in a place we have never been
Time is nothing but a line
We leave everything behind
It'd be so wonderful, wonderful

[Chorus]
Looking for something crazy
Beautiful love
And now I'm talking in circles again
Have my love, baby
Are you hungry for wonderful? 'Cause I am
Wonderful, 'cause I am

[Outro]
(Looking for something crazy)
Wonderful I am (beautiful nothing, now)
I am, I am (I'm talking in circles again)
It's killing me, boy, yeah
I am, I am
You'll know how wonderful I am
Wonderful I am
Wonderful I
Oh wassup
Oh wassup
That nigga B.o.B
That nigga Willie Joe

[Hook]
Hey, she's a heavy breather
Hey, she's a heavy breather
Hey, she's a heavy breather
Everytime I run up in her
Hey, she's a heavy breather
Hey, she's a heavy breather
Hey, she's a heavy breather
Everytime I run up and I breathe
In the club sweat, got her-got her drippin' wet
Homie I'm a vet, wrist match the icy neck
Baby you the best, I don't mean no disrespect
But she's a heavy breather, she's a heavy breather

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
There's plenty pussies in here, but I'm looking at that butt
She be dropping like she hopped up out the bath tub
Now don't get arrogant because we looking at you
We ain't really watching you, we just watching what your ass does
Baby, you look like you could really use it
And don't make no excuses, cause we was made to do this
Now don't be acting baby, I'll give you asthma baby
I'm looking at your body and you're pretty fascinating
You got more body then a Chevy with the double doors
Make me wanna cut a flip and do a somersault
Now don't get mad at me baby because it's your mama fault
You bout to pop up out your Wonder Bra

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Willie Joe]
What's poppin'?
What goes on?
Tree and that patron got me in the zone
Tell your man you came with the plans postponed
Cause Willie Joe bout to take your pretty ass home
I'm a heavy breather, I got to get the gash
I took her to the pad, and then that nigga stabbed
I hit her with a jab, and then an upper-cut
She had a mean-strut, cute-face thunder-butt
DJ play the cut, now she ready Freddy
She put her ass on me, she breathin' extra heavy
Mami when you ready, we can do the move
From the B to the A, lets do it cruise

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hagon]
She the exception defyin' all of nature's laws
Said she want it right now up against the wall
Are you a big girl? mama could you take it all?
I like that outfit but mama could you take it off?
I tell her somethin' good, haters try to undo it
Don't think I ain't made for it, cause I'm cuttin' to it
See women want a nigga who ain't gonna go behind her
But at the same time beat it up from behind
I got that pussy so wet, a river run through it
After me she renamed shit, a nigga run through it
Because I beat it up and left her ass out of breath
In the bed touching herself, breathing heavy like...

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Señor, señor, can you tell me where we're headin'
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon
Seems like I been down this way before
Is there any truth in that, señor

[Verse 2]
Señor, señor, do you know where she's hidin'?
How long are we gonna be riding?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Will there be any comfort there, señor?

[Chorus 1]
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck
And there's an iron cross still hanging from around her neck
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Where's she held me in her arms one time and said
"Forget me not"

[Verse 4]
Señor, señor, I can see that painted wagon
Smell the tail of the dragon
I can't stand the suspense here anymore
Can you tell me who to contact here, señor?

[Solo]

[Chorus 2]
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field
And a gypsy with a broken flag and flashing ring
Said "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing"

[Verse 5]
Señor, señor, you know their hearts are hard as leather
Give me a minute, let me get it together
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor
I'm ready when you are, señor

[Verse 6]
Señor, señor, let's overturn these tables
And disconnect these cables
This place don't make sense to me no more
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, señor

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Fuckin' round with Gucci it gone lead to an injuring
Treat ya like third period turn ya to history
Nigga say he did this but nigga's a mystery
I bet it sucks ya found out your favorite rapper's a sissy
This purple shit I'm sippin got them young niggas trippin'
He faking like he got a cough to get a prescription
You came to Atlanta but didn't ask my permission
You walked in normal but ya walked out with stitches
I'm Mister Nighttime I lose my mind with the bottles
At Ocean Prime at lunchtime eatin' steak with a model
Down south president like Jimmy Carter from Georgia
Hundred-thousand-dollar Charger parked at my headquarters

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Picture that, picture that, picture that nigga
Picture that, picture that, picture that
Jumpin' out the Phantom, talkin' real mannish
Robin's Jeans saggin, bein' broke I can't imagine that
Picture that, picture that, picture that nigga
Picture that, picture that, picture that
Jumpin' out tha Rari, lookin' really handsome
Brick Squad going broke, I can't even fathom that

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
They say a bird in the hand beats a bird in the bushes
But there's a killer in the bushes and your shooters are some pussies
Try to rob Gucci Mane, right plan wrong nigga
Tried to make it to the Ham, got pulled over Villa Rica
Leave your sister a pistol, a kilo of the crystals
A scale, a bale, some bands and some scissors
And my money stretch longer than the Chattahoochee River
If its ten a key then I'm goin' to Chattanooga!
You say I know you like I knew you then why I do you like I do you
Bitch I flew here and you grew here
I'm not new here what's it to you?
I pour fours, and deuces, and drinks, and juices
Sell bales, and bricks, and blunts, and loosies

[Hook]

[Hook]
I'm a socialite, yeah I'm a socialite
Poppin' bottles, rockin ice
Burr! It's goin' down tonight
I'm a socialite, Black socialite
Night life, cocktail party, getcha swag right
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Paparazzi, TMZ, all eyes on me
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Paparazzi, TMZ, all eyes on me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm popping bottles in a party with Rihanna and Madonna
Head to toe in Dolce & Gabbana smokin' blunts of marijuana
Kimi, Khloe, Kourtney ballin' with me, I keep models near me
Listening to me crystal clearly, like the clarity of earrings
I'm the Don Dada, ain't none better, at the trendsetter who here trendsetter
All suede, soft leather, you point her out I go get her
Ain't no nigga, gold digger, goldfish, or gorilla
Got more swag or more pizzazz than that young nigga on that 4-wheeler
No shirt, tatted out, buddy looks, layin' him out
Purple Label, Bally, Louis, Fendi, Prada, Gucci down
Anywhere that I touch down, that night, it's my town
Best dressed, dead fresh, you niggas better go and ask around
Wipe me down

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Black Ferrari, yellow feet, red carpet here I fuckin' come
White stones, bright white diamonds on my fucking thumb
Porsche cost a couple 'them, see me in the other one
So it's only right that I came back with another one
458, red on red, make a girl so scared that she pee in the bed
Hearing voices in my head, screaming 'Gucci Mane ball out'
So I got 'em restocking the shelf cause I just bought the whole mall out
Michael Jackson in the hood, I hit the stage the hoes fall out
Like what the fuck is up, it's Gucci Mane the G
Yeah the G-U-double C-I-M-A-N-E in this bitch
Take a picture with me baby and it just might change your life
Smoking Swisher after Swisher, bar tab fifty K a night (Gucci!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]

Catch me in Las Vegas poppin' bottles next to Baby'n'them
Red diamond rings so bright jewelers be askin' 'what ya paid for them?'
Catch me in Miami on a yacht with my label'n'them
Waka Flocka, Brick Squad, Gucci, bitches cray for them
Courtside at the Hawks game, you would think I'm coaching them
Sit so fucking close to them but nah your boy ain't coaching them
Clubbin' at a fashion show, think I'm fuckin' both of them
The way lil' mama catwaking, got me think I'm skrokin 

[stroking] them
You gone see me hopefully, cross your fingers make a wish
Truly ain't no hope for me, I can't stop thinkin' I'm the shit
I'm the shit, I'm the shit, if I want I'll buy that bitch
If she don't wanna fuck with me then it's her loss I'm fucking rich!

[Hook]
James Dean, James Dean
I know just what you mean
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look alright
If I could see it on the silver screen

You were the lowdown rebel if there ever was
Even if you had no cause
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen

We'll talk about a low-down bad refrigerator
You were just too cool for school
Sock hop, soda pop, basketball and auto shop
The only thing that got you off was breakin' all the rules
James Dean, James Dean
So hungry and so lean
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen
Little James Dean, up on the screen
Wondering who he might be
Along came a Spyder and picked up a rider
And took him down the road to eternity

James Dean, James Dean, you bought it sight unseen
James Dean, James Dean, you bought it sight unseen

You were too fast to live, too young to die, bye-bye
You were too fast to live, too young to die, bye-bye
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye, bye

Some people say that rappers don't have feelings
We have feelings (we have feelings)
Some people say that we are not rappers
(We're rappers)
That hurts our feelings
(Hurts our feelings when you say we're not rappers)
Some people say that rappers are invincible
(We're vincible) we're vincible

What you are about to hear are true stories
(Real experiences) autobiographical raps
(Things that happened to us) all true
Bring the rhyme

[Jemaine]
I make a meal for my friends, try to make it delicious
Try to keep it nutritious, create wonderful dishes
Not one of them thinks about the way I feel
Nobody compliments the meal

[Hook 1]
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
(I feel like a prized asshole, no one even mentions my casserole)
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
(You could've said something nice about my profiteroles)

[Bret]
Here's a little story to bring a tear to your eye
I was shopping for a wetsuit to scuba dive
But every suit I tried is too big around the thighs
And the assistant suggested I try a ladies' size

[Hook 2]
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
(I'm not gonna wear a ladies' wetsuit, I'm a man!)
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
(Get me a small man's wetsuit please)

[Jemaine]
It's my birthday 2003, waitin' for a call from my family
They forgot about me

[Hook 3]
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
(The day after my birthday is not my birthday, mum)

[Bret]
I call my friends and say let's go into town
But they're all too busy to go into town
So I go by myself, I go into town
Then I see all my friends they're all in town

[Hook 4]
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
(They're all lined up to watch that movie, Maid in Manhattan)

[Bret and (Jemaine)]
Have you even been told that your ass is too big?
(Have you ever been asked if your hair is a wig?)
Have you ever been told you're mediocre in bed?
(Have you ever been told you've got a weird shaped head?)

Has your family ever forgotten you and driven away?
(Once again, they forgot about J)
Were you ever called homo cause at school you took drama?
(Have you ever been told that you look like a llama?)

[Bridge]
Tears of a rapper, tears of a rapper
I'm crying tears of a rapper, tears of a rapper

[Murray]
Yes, well all good examples

[Intro]
Uh huh, yeah, yeah, listen, ok

[Verse]
I'm a dime, you a nickel-ette, light skinned-ed pigment
Write my own shit, y'all copyrighting infringement
I eat these rap bitches, somebody get me a dinner mint
Pussy make him tattoo my name upon his ligament
Fuck wrong with them, my nerves they keep tweaking'
Tell them I'm the chief, I'm runnin' with Mohikans
Tell them this is church, and tell them I am the deacon
Tell them that I'm Black, Chinese, and Butter Pecan
Pull up in the Range, I'm givin' them more reasons
Hit up Lil Wayne, while I'm in the 4 Seasons
Tell Gudda, Mack, and Kidd Kidd I'm here
I'm colder than a cough, I'm wetter than swimwear
Got all these little bitches, g-gettin' p-pink hair
I'm pretty and I'm fly, I'm up in the pink Lear
I needed an assistant, I got me a pink queer
Decorated his office, with flowers and pink chairs (C'yeah)

[Outro]
Listen...
Nicki Minaj, Nicki Lewinksy, The Mistress
Where the fuck is the president?
Young Money

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
(Ah!) You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain 'till it hurts
You've taken all my money
And you want more

Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies
Who are fools of the first division

[Chorus]
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own

Killjoy, bad guy
Big talkin' small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy
To replace me?
Can you face me?
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good? Are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide? (I think you should)
Is your conscience all right?
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good? (Feel good!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
(Ah!) Talk like a big business tycoon
You're just a hot air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
You're just an overgrown schoolboy
Let me tan your hide

Dog with disease
You're the king of the sleaze
Put your money where your mouth is
Mr. Know-All, was the fin on your back part of the deal?

Shark!

[Chorus]
Death on two legs
Tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart (You never did)
Of your own (Right from the start)
Insane, should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Make yourself null and void
Make me feel good (I feel good!)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I go off to work on Monday morning
Tuesday, I go off to honeymoon
I'll be back again before it's time for sunny-down
I'll be lazing on a Sunday afternoon

Bicycling on every Wednesday evening
Thursday, I go waltzing to the Zoo

[Bridge]
I come from London town
I'm just an ordinary guy
Fridays, I go painting in the Louvre

[Verse 2]
I'm bound to be proposing on a Saturday night (There he goes again)
I'll be lazing on a Sunday, lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday afternoon

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Standing on the rooftop
Just out of earshot
Looking at this gangster guy
Thinking he's a hot shot
Pouring me a big shot
Trying to get me drunk and high

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He wishes to be seen with me
In his limousine
And he says we'll have a real good time
Well X-X-O but I want you to know

[Chorus]
Every single night
In the lights
I'll be sparkling bright
I'm just a party girl
Trying to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight
It's alright
Let the fire ignite
I'm a party girl
And I'm just warning you

[Post-Chorus]
You don't get it
You just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display
Bringing New York down to St. Tropez
You don't get it
You just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
(1) I won't fall in love
(2) I won't ever stop
(3) I'm partying all night
(4) I'm gonna make it pop

[Verse 2]
Kissing on your light yacht
Show me what you got got
Play a little rock n roll
On an island hotspot
Maybe we should dot dot dot
(Lose control)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do you think it's really mean
That I'm only on the scene
Cause I want a little danger boy?
Well X-X-O but I told you so

[Chorus]
Every single night
In the lights
I'll be sparkling bright
I'm just a party girl
Trying to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight
It's alright
Let the fire ignite
I'm a party girl
And I'm just warning you

[Post-Chorus]
You don't get it
You just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display
Bringing New York down to St. Tropez
You don't get it
You just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
(1) I won't fall in love
(2) I won't ever stop
(3) I'm partying all night
(4) I'm gonna make it pop

[Bridge]
But it's not about us
Just forget about us
Tonight
Put your cigarette down
Baby light up the town
Beside me

[Post-Chorus]
You don't get it
You just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
You don't get it
You just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display
Bringing New York down to St. Tropez
You don't get it
You just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
(1) I won't fall in love
(2) I won't ever stop
(3) I'm partying all night
(4) I'm gonna make it pop

(Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill)
(Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill)

[Verse 1]
Jimmy pulls up in his blue Chevy Nova
I have been dyin' for him to come over
I’m in my party dress, he say "You such a mess"
I am the New Jersey Dance Queen
He is the gangster action king
He knows that I be selling the body
My man the best 'cause he knows what’s up

[Pre-Chorus]
He knows it’s a big bad world, knows that I’m a good girl
He understands the sale of self
(Cause cash comes quick when looks can kill)

[Chorus]
Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
(Yeah, yeah)
Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
(Twenty of 'em wrapped up tight in silk)

[Verse 2]
J is a romantic roller coaster
He don’t do anything he supposed to
I like 'em tough and mean, Jim is the worst that I've ever seen
I am the trailer park darling, he is the one-time come-back king
He knows that I be lookin' to die
He says, baby, pay respect to the high

[Pre-Chorus]
He knows it’s a big bad world, knows that I’m a good girl
He understands the sale of self
Cause cash comes quick when looks can kill

[Chorus]
Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
(Twenty of 'em wrapped up tight in silk)

[Bridge]
I like your ultraviolent swing
I like it when you treat me mean
You turn my mood from black to blue
I like your ultraviolent swing
I like it when you treat me mean
You turn my mood from black to blue
(Yeah)
(Twenty of 'em wrapped up tight in)

[Chorus]
Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill

[Intro]
Dig pimp... I'ma holla at y'all in a minute, I'm finna go change clothes mayne
Go get real spiffy mayne, go kick it with my broad, I'ma holla atchall later..

[Verse 1]
I left the kids at the crib, and the squad in the trap
Now I'm in the two-seater with my broad in my lap
The alpines beatin', but I'm far away from rappin'
Bumpin' Prince, Sade, or some Marvin Gaye perhaps, I
Put up my blues, put on some tailor made slacks
Some wing tip shoes, whachu know about that?
Button down, cufflinks, hair cut, no hat
Just felt like gettin' clean and show I know how to act
At Neiman & Marcus let my girl blow three or four stacks
Gotta forever to cut the food, and damn I'm relaxed
In a real cool mood, no beef, no gats
But then real close by, niggas better know that

[Chorus - Jazze Pha]
I ain't hangin' with my niggas, pullin' no triggaz
I'll be back to the trap, but for now
I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today
I ain't hangin' with my potnaz, I'm out eatin' lobster
I'm on some grown man shit, ya dig
I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today

[Verse 2]
This shit look hard, no drama from none of my baby mama's
With my hottie, takin' shots of sake in Benihanas
Known to kick it like we riches, got Richie and Madonna
Or either Will and Jada, on vacation for the summer
Me and my lil' mama, blowin' big as we wanna
Gotta big sack of some of that shit from California
A bottle of Patron and a six pack of Corona
Dro aroma got the six hot steamin' like a sauna
So I let the top back and I bend anotha corner
Check into the W, so I can put it on her
Got the suite for a week, but we can stay a lil' longer
I ain't trippin', that's the shit that make relationships stronger

[Chorus - repeat]

[Hook]
Tonight I'm gon chill with my lady friend
She the type to keep a nigga open
I'm chillin' with my bitch today

[Verse 3]
I left the stress in the streets and I'm a long way from home
Put up the vest and the chrome, even through with my phone
My potnaz don't wanna be on the shit that I'm on mayne
Livin' life and kickin' it like a grown man
Sittin' in the sand, drinkin' pina coladas
With a double shot of rum, just chillin' right by the water
No judges, no lawyers, in a whole 'nother world
Just a bottle and this ?? dro, blowin' with my girl

[Chorus - repeat]

[Repeat Hook]
I don't need the hype
They call me- fuck it- I don't need no introduction
No ad-libbing my name 100 times for nothing
You already know it's K. Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
I'm more focused, I'm nothing like you new guys
Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
Cause your homey said you you was a few times
Which is too many times, they lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in a booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my A/C
My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me
I shoot, and how have you laying between the sheets with the Isleys
I push the coupe like a high speed
The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
This ain't rap it's really a porno re-winded back
Finally the finest of 'em all is back
To define the laws of crack
Y'all don't obey, y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK
You're nothing more than a little John phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime
Modern-day Issac Hayes, theme song to Shaft
Equivalent to the theme song to your career, study my craft
You ignorant: I do it without a pen and pad
Just inspiration: something you never had
If my pockets is something you trying to grab
I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
I'm on a mission for pay
And you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But actually you ain't accurate fucker with this music biz
The industry like, "Fuck it, let the music be his"
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
Do he really fuck with President Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Had the bidding war popping like an auction
Nine or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my porch
But money was barricading my door, I couldn't open it
Money on my passenger side, now who you rolling with?
Black diamonds, not no rose-gold shit
Teamed up with Watt's finest
Jay Rock won't you avalanche these niggas so I can rock-climb 'em?
(Jay Rock: Give me a minute my nigga let me go find 'em)
Bring 'em back to me, the 5'6" rap bully is back for the first time, killing you niggas
I hope you got nine lives, it's not Nas or Jigga
But where Jigga left off that is where I pick up
I got them holding their breath without having no hiccups
Screaming, "Fuck the world" with a capital F
Real niggas: we the last ones left, MY NIGGA
I raise the bar for rapping the West
So have your shit up to par if you rep for the West
Cause you see homeboy, we ain't getting respect
So we got to get it back, take it back, to the Jheri curls
And the Raider caps, my khakis on
Address the issue in my last three songs
Man, Game know about you West Coast clones
And nigga we hate twins
Put some change on it, see if it makes sense, ya know
I got to be the new breed top 5 minus 4
That's number one, cause second is the first loser
Don't beef with me homey, if you want your future
Rap ain't promised, you might think it's slamming right
But look at Onyx, they ain't too tight
Interscope consults it: look at Suge Knight
I'm trying to get money like the Oasis
If you ain't on the same shit like my gold D's, keep rolling
I keep rolling, never stop
Top Dawg Entertainment: Presents K-Dot

[Intro]
Woo
Said, somebody do somethin' please
Yeah, yeah
Can somebody do somethin' please?
Yeah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Said, somebody do somethin' please
Somebody do somethin'
Somebody do somethin'
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody

[Verse 1]
I said, uh, I close my eyes before I cross the street
If a car about to hit me, then he ought to beep
Watchin' Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep
It's harder than it seems, I'm under water in my dreams
Yes, I’m in awe, jigsaw, puzzles not complete
I'm just an idea, nothin' concrete
I came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines
They tryna change with us, but come to the same difference
So, shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
I don't mind those hatin' on my style
Tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low
Said, I'm no god
I don't think that I'm a human though, 'cause I'm so odd
And people sellin' drugs, they can't find no job
If Christ made a million off of sellin' the cross
Okay, let bygones be bygones, mind strong as pythons
Day that I die on will turn me to an icon
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on
Best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan

[Chorus]
Somebody do somethin' please
Can somebody do somethin' please?
Somebody, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody do somethin' please
Can somebody do somethin' please?
Somebody, yeah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2]
Sippin' Jameson
Like I was majored in whiskey flavorin'
When I'm drunk, I'll cut your head off, leave it danglin'
FlyLo's still tryna put me on to Ableton
Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me
Said, I ain't nobody, but neither are you
Contemplatin' if I even still believe in the truth
I'm so stubborn, I'd rather write my own history book
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
Hell nah
All your songs are sixteen's and a hook
We here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution
I'm down for this movement, tryin' not to lose it
Jewish Buddhist consumin' the views of Christianity
I wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in a igloo
Hear the fish bitin' nice right now
Can't figure out life and feel right right now
If I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it

[Interlude]
Hands up in the air like this, right now, let's go

[Chorus]
Somebody do somethin' please
Somebody do somethin' please
Somebody, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody do somethin' please
Can somebody do somethin' please?
Yeah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Yeah
Said, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I said there ain't no party like aristocratic party

[Intro]
It's our party, we can do what we want (Ear Drummers)
It's our party, we can say what we want (Mike WILL Made-It)
It's our party, we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want, we can screw who we want
It's our party, we can do what we want
It's our party, we can say what we want
It's our party, we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want, we can screw who we want

[Verse 1]
Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
'Cause we came to have so much fun now (Hey, hey, hey)
Bet somebody here might get some now (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a "Hell no"? (Hell no)
'Cause we gonna go all night
'Til we see the sunlight, alright (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
So la-da-di-da-di, we like to party
Dancing with Molly
Doing whatever we want
This is our house, this is our rules

[Chorus]
And we can't stop (Woah)
And we won't stop (Woah)
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?
And we can't stop (Woah)
And we won't stop (Woah)
We run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody, yeah-yeah

[Post-Chorus]
It's our party, we can do what we want
It's our party, we can say what we want
It's our party, we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want, we can screw who we want (Hey)

[Verse 2]
To my homegirls here with the big butt
Shaking it like we at a strip club
Remember only God can judge ya
Forget the haters, 'cause somebody loves ya
And everyone in line in the bathroom
Tryna get a line in the bathroom
We all so turned up here
Getting turned up, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So la-da-di-da-di, we like to party
Dancing with Molly
Doing whatever we want
This is our house, this is our rules

[Chorus]
And we can't stop (Woah)
And we won't stop (Woah)
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?
And we can't stop (Woah)
And we won't stop (Woah)
We run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody, yeah-yeah

[Post-Chorus]
It's our party, we can do what we want
It's our party, we can say what we want
It's our party, we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want, we can screw who we want (Hey)

[Bridge]
It's our party, we can do what we want to
It's our house, we can love who we want to
It's our song, we can sing if we want to
It's my mouth, I can say what I want to
Yeah, yeah, yeah, eh

[Chorus]
And we can't stop (Yeah)
And we won't stop (Oh)
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?
And we can't stop (Woah)
And we won't stop (Woah)
We run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody, yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
We can do what we want to
We can do what we want to (Hey)

[Verse 1]
I drop it like it's hot on the pole, on the pole
Shining in the club, neon gold, neon gold
They call me "Firecracker" and alcohol's a factor
I drop it like it's hot, baby bold, baby bold
A little bit of fun for your soul, for your soul
They call me "Firecracker", 'cause ain't nobody faster

[Chorus]
I'm your go-go dancer, midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart, queen of the night
Vegas baby, if you pay me
Anything you like, anything you like
Go-go dancer, midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart, Queen of the night
Vegas baby, if you pay me
Anything you like
Go-go-g-go-go dancer tonight

[Verse 2]
Pushing up my (uh), in your face, in your face
Keep your fingertips on my waist, on my waist
I'm your go-go dancer, credit card romancer
Corner of the road with the lights and the lace
Catch me after twelve, in the place, yeah, the place
Boy, break out your dollars, baby needs a new fur

[Chorus]
I'm your go-go dancer, midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart, queen of the night
Vegas baby, if you pay me
Anything you like, anything you like
Go-go dancer, midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart, Queen of the night
Vegas baby, if you pay me
Anything you like
Go-go-g-go-go dancer tonight

[Bridge]
I'm the girl next door, let me come in
I know I go-go dance but I do it for kicks
I never have to work 'cause my daddy is rich
I'm partyin' all night, shinin' in the lights
Is it a crime to wanna shine
In my white go-go boots and my silver design?
I know it makes you wild
I know it makes you wild

[Chorus]
I'm your go-go dancer, midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart, queen of the night
Vegas baby, if you pay me
Anything you like, anything you like
Go-go dancer, midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart, Queen of the night
Vegas baby, if you pay me
Anything you like
Go-go-g-go-go dancer tonight

[Verse 1]
You've got style, that's what all the girls say
Satin sheets and luxuries so fine
All your suits are custom made in London
But I've got something that you'll really like

[Chorus 1]
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body

[Verse 2]
Feel the silky touch of my caresses
They will keep you looking so brand new
Let me cover you with velvet kisses
I'll create a look that's made for you

[Chorus 2]
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body
Gonna dress you up in my love, in my love

In my love (All over, all over)
From your head down to your toes

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus 2]
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body
Gonna dress you up in my love, in my love
(All over your body) All over your body
In my love (All over, all over)
From your head down to your toes

Gonna dress you up in my love
(All over, all over)
Dress you up in my love

(Gonna dress you up in my love)
(All over, all over)

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You hid your skeletons when I had shown you mine
You woke the devil that I thought you'd left behind
I saw the evidence, the crimson soaking through
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

[Chorus]
And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side, powerless

[Verse 2]
I watched you fall apart and chased you to the end
I'm left with emptiness that words cannot defend
You'll never know what I became because of you
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

[Chorus]
And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side, powerless

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side, powerless

[Outro]
Powerless (Oh, oh, ooh, aah, ooh! Oh, oh, ooh, aah, ooh!)
(Oh, oh, ooh, aah, ooh! Oh, oh, ooh!) Powerless

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Separate
Sifting through the wreckage, I can't concentrate
Searching for a message in that fear and pain
Broken down and waiting for the chance to feel alive

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Come apart
Falling in the cracks of every broken heart
Digging through the wreckage of your disregard
Sinking down and waiting for the chance to feel alive

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
Like an army falling one by one by one
Like an army falling one by one by one
Like an army falling one by one by one
Like an army falling one by one by one

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Now, in my remains (One by one, one by one)
Are promises that never came (One by one by one)
Set this silence free (One by one, one by one)
To wash away the worst of me (One by one by one)

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Like an army falling (One by one, one by one)
One by one by one (One by one by one)
Like an army falling (One by one, one by one)
One by one by one

[Verse 1]
Like shining oil, this night is dripping down
Stars are slipping down, glistening
And I'm trying not to think what I'm leaving now
No deceiving now, it's time you let me know
Let me know

[Chorus]
When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone

[Verse 2]
This air between us is getting thinner now
Into winter now, bittersweet
And 'cross that horizon, this sun is setting down
You're forgetting now, it's time you let me go
Let me go

[Chorus]
When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone

[Bridge]
And tell them I couldn't help myself
And tell them I was alone
Oh, tell me I am the only one
And there's nothing left to stop me

[Chorus]
When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone
I'll be gone (I'll be gone)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
No regret for the confidence betrayed
No more hiding in shadow
'Cause I won't wait for the debt to be repaid
Time has come for you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Victimized, victimized!
Never again victimized!
Victimized, victimized!
Never again victimized!

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
They're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot I'll give 'em
As the siren climbs higher on this violent rhythm
For you snakes in the grass, supplying the venom
I ain't scared of your teeth, I admire what's in 'em
You been waiting in the shadows there, thinking you're hidden
But the truth is, you don't have the stomach to get 'em
Go on already, hit 'em, yeah, you gotta be kidding
Wanna talk about a victim? I'mma put you there with 'em

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Victimized, victimized!
Never again victimized!
Victimized, victimized!
Never again victimized!
NO!

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I dreamed I was missing, you were so scared
But no one would listen 'cause no one else cared
After my dreaming, I woke with this fear
What am I leaving when I'm done here?

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Don't be afraid
I've taken my beating, I've shared what I made
I'm strong on the surface, not all the way through
I've never been perfect, but neither have you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Forgetting all the hurt inside
You've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else
Can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Forgetting all the hurt inside
You've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else
Can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are
I can't be who you are
Maybe you'll see one day we'll be free
From fear, from fear, remember my name
I won't forget you, even passing
I know we'll meet, don't you forget me
Strange how things work, nothing's promised
Let your heart beat, your guide, mine
Your guide, always we will survive
I will go on, no need for care
Won't you trust me?

I know it's hard when you can't trust
No one, nothing, you can't let go
You can trust me, I will never leave you
Right here, always by your side
I am happy that we got to share this life
Who knows, maybe we will learn to fly
Heartbreaks, setbacks, breakups, makeups
Love, love, love, love, love
Breakdowns, buildups, knock downs, broke down
But still try, try try

Baby, this could be a change for us to see
Maybe, we'll figure out where we're supposed to be
Until we find the truth there's something we should do
Can't let the love stop flowing from me to you

You know we tried way too hard to find
A love that's really blind so why even try
Because we know that there's still hope
Just don't let go

Baby, this could be a chance for us to see
Maybe, we'll figure out where we're supposed to be
Until we found the truth there's something we should do
Can't let the love stop flowing from me to you
Sometimes it's hard to think straight
When there is just so much
Crowding your space
You've got to drown everything out
And see what you want to see
Listen with your heart and see through all of your fears
Open up your world
That's just yours cause life just seems so short
But if you play the game you can win in the end

Heart begins to race
Hands begin to sweat
On the edge of death
If you lose you have to play again

Life's a special stage
Zone in on your goal
Sit back and relax
Play the game and play to win
Doo wah doo wah doo wah doo wah
If you miss the point
You must understand
Life is just a game
It's all in your hands
Doo wah doo wah doo wah doo wah
It's all in your hands
Don't you know you rock my world?
Don't you ever leave me Turbo Tron
Don't ever wonder where I'm going

I always come back to you
Don't you worry about me

Don't you know you rock my world?
Don't you ever leave me Turbo Tron
Don't ever wonder where I'm going

I always come back to you
Don't you worry about me

Don't you know you rock my world?
Don't you ever leave me Turbo Tron
Don't ever wonder where I'm going
I can see clear across the night
Eyes open white burning bright as light

I can see clear across the night
Eyes open white burning bright as light

Can you hear the sound of infinity?

[Verse 1]
The room is spinning, and I’m not winning
It's about 3:42
And I don’t know where the bathroom is
My friends say you should eat something
But I’m not hungry, just wanna keep dancing in this corner, baby
This song is jammin'
So let’s just slide on the dance floor, baby, onto the dance floor

[Chorus]
I just wanna party, you should be here with me
In this ecstasy, baby
I just wanna party, you should be here with me
In this ecstasy, baby
I just wanna party, you should be here with me
I’m on ecstasy, baby
I just wanna party, you should be here with me
In this ecstasy, baby

[Verse 2]
Who are you? Why you talking so loud?
I forgot you was my friend
Your purse is nice, baby, is it leather? Or could it be suede?
I’m confused as hell, stuck in a pattern grid world
Don’t want it to stop
(ughh....) Oh, shit, I’m fucked up

[Chorus]
I just wanna party, you should be here with me
In this ecstasy, baby
I just wanna party, you should be here with me
In this ecstasy, baby
I just wanna party, you should be here with me
I’m on ecstasy, baby
I just wanna party, you should be here with me
In this ecstasy, baby
Endless nights I spend
Trying to figure out
How to live without you

And though easier it seems it is
Never stood a chance at this
How was it a hit and miss
We'll never know
It's time to go
Closing time at two
Don't know what to do
I can't get you off my mind
And so baby just a drink or two
The more I sit and think of it
Another drink and it'll slip
From the mind
Please pour the wine

Now that it's past two
Took off both my shoes
I don't really care at all
Because I don't really have a choice
You know we both chose our paths
Now it's got to stick and last
For the time
I paid the price
Lonely nights I spend
Trying to make sense
I'm just tired of it all
But still it's always gonna be my fault
You and me
We're meant to be
And it's okay
Walkin' through the forest
Straight trippin' in the darkness
Straight up seein' goblins
Where no need to be frightened
Then I go grab the ice cream
Kinda stuck in my day dreams
Night time turn to day dreams
Then in walks in the Jondy
Lotus and the Jondy (x14)

Lotus and the Jondy (x8)
It's superficial the way that you listen
Open your ears and your mind
Just take the time to
Look a bit deeper
You'd be surprised what you find inside
We're only human
That makes it simple
But all our lives are complex
And it's fine
It's fine

Can you read my mind
Or can you read my heart
Cause they're not one in the same
Your good intentions they're broken and beaten
Heaven and earth are all one in the same
Do you know time will pass you by
You'll die
We'll die
Nothing lasts forever
Seasons will change
Black hair turns gray

Constantly
It's perpetual (ahem)
Try to do your best
I know I'll see you again
In another life
Thank you for sharing your love and your light
Though we say goodbye
We will say hello again
You'll always live in our hearts and our minds
Thank you for being a friend
That you were to me
I cherish the moments of all our good time
You traveled beyond
Your legacy lives on
Go forward as the eagle
To your endless planets

I know I will see you again
In another life
Thank you for sharing your light with the world
Travel beyond
Your legacy lives on
Now enter the void
Forever, the Jondy

[Verse 1: Usher]
I just wanna get your attention
I really wanna be all up in your head (turn the lights on)
'Cause what I got, you going to get some
But girl, that's only if you ain't scared

[Bridge: Usher]
And I won't knock, won't ring no bells
You just float that bottom up in the air
I'll get you hot, I know you oh so well
And when I walk in, all that I wanna hear

[Chorus: Usher & Ladies]
Is you say, "Daddy's home, home for me"
And I know you've been waiting for this loving all day

And girl, tonight we gonna do a lot of sexing, yeah
Can't nobody do your body like this

Oh, I won't knock, won't ring no bells
You just float that bottom up in the air
Said I'll get you hot, I know you oh so well
And when I walk in, all that I wanna hear

[Chorus: Usher & Ladies]

Hey, hey, hey, daddy

[Verse 3: Plies]
Knock knock, guess what? The goon's home
Gone three days, bought a quarter mil home
Miss me to death, guess what she wrote
I miss you too, put that on your ringtone
Told her when I get back, she can have the Range Rov'
But I'ma take it back, if she ride lame, hoe
Isn't that the house you wanted? I'll buy you two of those
A hundred thou, baby? That's just two shows
Have you ever made love with your neck froze
With all VVS diamonds in your ear lobes?
Stay out the Maybach, baby, 'cause it ain't yours
I would've bought you one, but you wanted the Benzo
Take your shoes off and I'll rub your fat toes
Let me pour Kool-Aid on you, real slow
And I'll kiss it all off before it hits the floor
Daddy's home, you know how that goes

[Chorus: Usher & Ladies]
Is you say, "Daddy's home, oh, home for me"
And I know you've been waiting for this loving all day
Your daddy's home, it's time to play
(Daddy's home, so it's time to play)
Now, baby, you ain't got to give my loving away
"Daddy's home, home for me"
And I know you've been waiting for this loving all day
You know your daddy's home and it's time to play
(Daddy's home, so it's time to play)
So you ain't got to give my loving away
So all my ladies, say, "Hey, hey, hey, daddy"
Hey, hey, hey, daddy
So all my ladies, say, "Hey, hey, hey, daddy"
Hey, hey, hey, daddy

[Outro: Usher & Ladies]
Poke it on out, poke it out right there
I'ma fall back while you work that chair
Do your damn thing, let the neighbors hear
Hey, hey, hey, daddy
Poke it on out, poke it out right there
I'ma fall back and let you work that chair
Do your damn thing, all I want to hear
Neurotic Society is a song about people not being, or not being able to be, who and what they truly are, due to the current social construct. I am not targeting any particular group of people, but rather targeting everyone in our society who hides behind neurotic behavior, rather than deal with it.

The world we live in now is, in many ways, an abhorrent distortion, an accumulation of generations and generations of response to negative stimuli. Many don’t even have a concept of what normal is, by virtue of having lived afraid, ashamed, as victims of abuse, or inadequately handled for so long. I believe in coming up from under that fear and allowing the psyche/soul to truly heal. I understand that healing is a process, but I also believe that it is our responsibility to seriously care for ourselves, so that we can extend that level of concern for others and positively affect our environment.

I want what is best for Humanity. Humanity, aligned with the Spiritual principles, that help each individual conquer fear, and transcend limited circumstance. I believe in healing and dealing with the traumatizing events of our lives, both in this lifetime, as well as those passed down to us, or inherited, so we can live as fully as possible.

The whole world suffers from a lack of honest dialogue. Character and integrity have suffered at the hands of political correctness and corporate agenda, while our society moves further and further towards unhealthiness and breakdown. I oppose these trends.

Everyone has a right to their own beliefs. Although I do not necessarily agree with what everyone says or does, I do believe in everyone’s right to protest.
The overarching message of my music is to get up and stop compromising! And hopefully it will stimulate and motivate the changes that our society needs.

Artists are constantly under media and public scrutiny. This is not a one-way street. Those of us with the charge of putting out faithful vibrations, have a responsibility to report what we see, and to write about what we know. I have seen some of the best and also some of the worst representations of human behavior. The same way that I exalt that which is high, is the same way I expose that which is abusive, in order to motivate and remind if not all of us, than as many as possible, of the Higher Calling.

[Intro]
You left me for somebody else now
You left me for somebody else now
You left me for somebody else now
You left me for somebody else now

[Verse 1]
I never saw this day coming
That you would ever wanna leave me
Baby, you told me no matter what
Your heart would always beat for me
Always beat for me, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm alone, since she wanna be ghost, yeah
I don’t really like it, but I gotta take it, damn, damn, damn, girl
When you coming back? So you never coming back? Yeah
I, I don’t believe that, but right now I gotta accept the fact

[Chorus]
You left me for somebody else now

Because I wouldn't be your body

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you treat me bad, made me feel like you was my everything
You made me feel you was worth something, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
You had me feeling like you really cared
Told me you would always be there
But you're not here and that's not fair (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm alone, since she wanna be ghost, yeah

[Bridge]
You left me for somebody else
You left me, baby, you left me
You left me, oh yeah, you left me
Baby, you left me, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
And now I'm all alone
No passion relaxin', they attract to my cologne
Cars, cash and fashion, look at it, I put you on
Money greedy for the cheese, add the provolone
You let him fuck, I don't buy that
'Cause Tommy by my gut, make 'em to fuck and turn this shit to Iraq
My shit blazin', tell me where you hot at?
She can't save you, I know where you hide at
She left me, but I seen it comin', ESP
Hit me below the belt, right under my testes
Got a nigga goin' crazy, missin' wet sheets
I should'a knew she want a waiter, check please
Audimars on the wrist
Supposed to be spendin' it on my bitch
Always claimin' I'm a fuck nigga
But it's funny how you trust niggas

[Verse 1: AlunaGeorge]
I know you're smart
You spin me round like a knot
You know the pieces, pieces of my heart
Sometimes its fun, you pull my strings one by one
Until you get me, get me, onto one

[Pre-Chorus: AlunaGeorge]
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
I don't need you
Giving it straight to me, giving it straight to me
You're just gonna get knocked back
I don't need you
Telling me how to be, telling me how to be
Just gonna get knocked back
Just gonna get knocked back
Just gonna get knocked back
Just gonna get knocked back
Just gonna get knocked back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back...

[Chorus: AlunaGeorge]
Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying
Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying

[Verse 2: AlunaGeorge]
Only you can look at me the way you do
You always tint me, tint me black and blue
Such a shame, you frame me with such disdain
You got me washed out, washed out colour drained

[Pre-Chorus: AlunaGeorge]
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
I don't need you
Giving it straight to me, giving it straight to me
You're just gonna get knocked back
I don't need you
Telling me how to be, telling me how to be
Just gonna get knocked back
Just gonna get knocked back
Just gonna get knocked back
Just gonna get knocked back
Just gonna get knocked back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back...

[Chorus: AlunaGeorge]
Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying
How do you stay motivated in the midst of everything that's going on?
How do you build your personal momentum and how do you get in the zone?
Right? And I'm glad you asked

Three things, you better catch it
My mother used to say, people love watching fire burn! Alright?
Okay, that's one thing I know about life
One thing I know about life is a guarentee, right?
Change is inevitable!
And listen to me
As much as you like to be in your comfort zone
As much as you like to be stable
As much as you like to control your environment
The reality is: everything changes

Alright here's my last one
My last one is make
Carl you gotta give me that term again
It's spontaneous combustion I think is what they call it Right? Right. And what happens is...

[Verse 1]
Defeated no more
I just feel I let you go
Been cheated, I've been fooled
But in my heart I'm glowing gold

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta let this fire keep burning
‘Cause I can’t seem to let this show
Instead of running I keep it slow
‘Cause I won’t let this take control

[Chorus]
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on

[Verse 2]
Defeated no more
I stood and watched you take it all
I’m healing, I’m reborn
Now I'm shaking off the cold

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta let this fire keep burning
‘Cause I can’t seem to let this show
Instead of running I keep it slow
‘Cause I won’t let this take control

[Chorus]
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on

[Bridge]
I can feel it working from the last you know
(I can feel it working, but can you?)
I can feel it working from the last you know
(I know you think you’re hurting but can you love?)
I can feel it working from the last you know
(I can feel it working, but can you?)
I can feel it working from the last you know
I know you think…
Can you love?

[Verse 3]
Defeated no more
I feel your shadow disappear
I've pleaded and I've fought
But now I know I'll make the rewards

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta let this fire keep burning
‘Cause I can’t seem to let this show
Instead of running I keep it slow
‘Cause I won’t let this take control

[Chorus]
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on

I can feel it working from the last you know
(I can feel it working, but can you?)
I can feel it working from the last you know
I know you think…
Can you love?

[Verse 1]
There are voices in my head
And my heart is trying hard to drown them out
I keep hearing what they say
They've enticed me into what they’re all about
Willpower slips away
And I’m weakening with every word they say
So I contemplate my fate
As I do, the whisper turns into a shout

[Pre-Chorus]
You bring out the darkest side of me
Chased out from a place that I can’t reach
I would love to practice what I preach
But you bring out the darkest side of me

[Chorus]
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me

[Verse 2]
Risking everything I had
I was keen to find the worst that I could do
Drove the sanity away
Brought destruction to the people that I knew
My head became a cage
I became a puppet on the stage
And even though we’re not okay
The feeling brings me pleasure all the same, all the same

[Pre-Chorus]
You bring out the darkest side of me
Chased out from a place that I can’t reach
I would love to practice what I preach
But you bring out the darkest side of me

[Chorus]
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me

[Verse 1]
I’ll be giving up, oh
Home is where the heart is
And I gave it to you in a paper bag
Even though it’s tarnished
You told me it’s the best you ever had
You got my secret combination
And I don’t be giving that out easily
With my deepest dedication
You can tell that you were brought the same for me

[Chorus]
So please don’t let go, cause you know exactly what we found
So please don’t let go my darling
You keep me locked up underground
It’s gonna be you and me
It’s gonna be everything you’ve ever dreamed
It’s gonna be who and me
It’s gonna be everything and everything, we’re meant to be
We’re meant to be

[Verse 2]
Rolling with the punches
So they won’t get inside our happiness
Love is always hunted
But your arrows are soaring through my chest
Cause you know you give me something
Yeah you give me exactly what I need
Got my blood pumping
You know you always draw more blood, I bleed

[Chorus]
So please don’t let go, cause you know exactly what we found
So please don’t let go my darling
You keep me locked up underground
It’s gonna be you and me
It’s gonna be everything you’ve ever dreamed
It’s gonna be who and me
It’s gonna be everything and everything, we’re meant to be
We’re meant to be

[Verse 3]
In your big house on the hills
Where you keep your dollar bills
And you stashed my heart
Somewhere in the dark
Keep it safe I know you will
Know you will, know you will
Know you will
I know you will

[Verse 1]
Tell me just what I should be expecting
‘Cause here I am on my own free will
Fortune favors the brave
So they say
I might as well fix up and play your game
Make the memory the reason
Remembering the time when you and I fell behind
But found a way to justify

[Pre-Chorus]
We cannot replay
The aesthetic or feel
We had our brighter day
Was it synthetic or real?

[Chorus x2]
I'll protect the memory
If baby you can’t recall it
You can’t recall that
22nd January
If baby you can’t recall it
I won’t forget that

[Verse 2]
Was it just as real as you expected?
Does looking back give you a chill?
Show me something you prefer today, yeah
Or maybe you've grown up and I'm the same
That amnesia gave you freedom
Or maybe you’re the kind who tells a lie just to lie
And never have to say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]

[Bridge]
Putting faith in your relief
I'll suspend your disbelief

[Chorus x3]

[Verse 1: Jessie Ware]
I can help you run away for good
Overtake what you had understood
All it takes is a little understanding
After all, don’t question if I would

[Chorus: Jessie Ware and Disclosure]
Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don’t resent it
‘Cause I can stop you from nothing
I’ll fulfill your desires for you

Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don’t resent it
‘Cause I can stop you from nothing
I’ll fulfill your desires for you

[Post-Chorus: Jessie Ware and Disclosure]
I'll fulfill your desires for you
I'll fulfill your desires for you

[Verse 2: Jessie Ware]
I can take the low out of lonely
I can stop the sense of slowing down
Don't you lie but if you only tell me
I will help, just let me turn it around
(Turn it around)
(Turn it around)

[Bridge: Jessie Ware]
Owning up to worry
No time left for me (no time left for me)
Owning up to worry
No time left for me (turn it around)
Owning up to worry (owning up to worry)
No time left for me (no time left for me)
Owning up to worry (owning up to worry)
No time left for me

[Chorus: Jessie Ware and Disclosure]
Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don’t resent it
‘Cause I can stop you from nothing
I’ll fulfill your desires for you

Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don’t resent it
‘Cause I can stop you from nothing
I’ll fulfill your desires for you

[Outro: Jessie Ware and Disclosure]
I'll fulfill your desires for you
I'll fulfill your desires for you
I'll fulfill your desires for you
I'll fulfill your desires for you
I'll fulfill your desires for you

[Verse 1]
Talk to me, and watch me crumble
You will see me come undone
Faithfully I will look over
There I'll find what you've become
(What you've become)

[Chorus]
You help me lose my mind
And you bring me something I can't define
Help me lose my mind
Make me wonder what I felt before
Keep biding my time
How much longer have I been waiting for?

[Verse 2]
Jealousy will be washed over
Carefully we will come through
Could it be easy to start over?
Somehow I will bring you to
(What you've become)

[Chorus]
You help me lose my mind
And you bring me something I can't define
Help me lose my mind
Make me wonder what I felt before
Keep biding my time
How much longer have I been waiting for?

[Bridge]
Waiting, waiting, I've been waiting
Waiting, waiting, I've been waiting
Waiting, waiting, I've been waiting
Waiting, waiting, I've been waiting
Waiting, waiting, I've been waiting
Waiting, waiting, I've been waiting
Waiting, waiting, I've been waiting
Waiting, waiting

[Chorus]
You help me lose my mind
And you bring me something I can't define
Help me lose my mind
Make me wonder what I felt before
Keep biding my time
How much longer have I been waiting for?
You help me lose my mind
And you bring me something I can't define
Help me lose my mind
Make me wonder what I felt before
Keep biding my time
How much longer have I been waiting for?

[Verse 1]
Somethin' is boilin', boilin' in me
Someone is toyin', toyin' with me
It won't get out, it won't stop
It don't move out, it won't leave
It won't get out, it won't stop
It don't move out

[Chorus]
I need it now (Ayy, mmm)
I need it now (Ayy, mmm)
I need it now (Ayy)
I need it now (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
Someone's ignorin', ignorin' defeat
But the taste of your poison, your poison is sweet, so sweet
He won't give up, and I won't up and go
I don't know how
He won't give up, and I won't up and go
He's had enough, I won't leave
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
I don't know how
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
He's had enough

[Chorus]
I need it now (Ooh, oh)
I need it now (Oh, woah, yeah)
I need it now (Oh, oh)
I need it now (Ayy, oh)

[Bridge]
Took my heart and kept it
Now my wounds are setting
There's no choice left to choose
I've become so reckless
All my love's affected
With the remnants of you, you

[Chorus]
I need it now (Ayy, mmm)
I need it now (Ayy, mmm)

[Outro]
(Oh, woah)
(Oh, woah, yeah)
(I need it now)
(I need it now)

[Intro]
Oh yeah
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Interlude]
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

[Bridge]
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Ah, changes are taking the pace I'm going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, oh, look out you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Outro]
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

Queens
Better slow down baby
One two, one two
Uh, better slow down baby
Just pulled up to the club on your mother's back

[Hook: Action Bronson]
You need to slow down baby
My whole team cash and load out baby
I’m a hero in my hometown, baby
Stop talking, just go down, baby

[Interlude: LL Cool J]
Ayo, Action
It ain't no fun if the G.O.A.T. don't get none!

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
The ripper, the master, charismatic bastard
Game is strange like blondes Ramadan fasting
Indoor pool look like Uncle Luke's casting
Never too old to fly a fake bubble ass in
Peep the rhetoric, nobody can better it
None of y'all confederates, I'm daddy, you're a surrogate
Murder these mics, boy, felon after the predicate
Fuck what you heard, baby, that shit's all irrelevant
Third as fly or half as intelligent
Step on that horseshit like Hannibal's elephants
Watered-down garbage ass rappers prevalent
All I wanna know is how the fuck y'all sellin' it?
Ahahahaha!

[Hook: Action Bronson]
You need to slow down baby (slow down)
My whole team cash and load out baby (no!)
I’m a hero in my hometown, baby (Flushing!)
Stop talking, just go down, baby

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
In front of Queens Center Mall, leg up on the sweatpants
Same outfit every country that the jet lands
Jetlagged, just left France
Stuff a motherfucker face into a bedpan
Shimmy in the GMC Jimmy
So I can make assists like Mike Bibby
Nice titties on a dyke that like swimming
Smokin' drugs, rollin' dice, and white linen
89 Testarossa, will I fit in?
The Jeep's so big make you wanna take a shit in it
Your bitch been in it
Treated her mouth like I was primitive
I talk shit cause I'm livin' it
It's me!

[Hook: Action Bronson & Lloyd Banks]
You need to slow down baby (slow down, baby)
My whole team cashin' lowdown baby
I’m a hero in my hometown, baby (hometown, baby)
Stop talking, just go down, baby

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Uh! I'm a mac, she gon' hook a nigga up on the expressway
That neck play, thousand diamonds in my x-ray
Light the park like when the Mets play
Clean as a fuck, we make a mess, hey, I'm beamin' on up
Twenty bucks, twenty women, spend my evenin' on stuck
I get em out on clockwork, hit my sleeve with the cuff
They know what's up
Young, black, and hungry in the presidential
A hundred somethin' dimes, white 11 special
Takin' a moment while you're roamin'
I set the trap, set back, watch my cologne win
Designer logo on my uni while I'm rollin'
Crowded pockets in her Louis bag are Trojans
Banks!

[Hook: Action Bronson]
You need to slow down baby
My whole team cashin' low-down, baby
I’m a hero in my hometown, baby
Stop talking, just go down, baby

[Outro: Action Bronson & LL Cool J]
You need to slow down baby
I'm out here, but don't ever fuckin' get it twisted
I’m a hero in my hometown, baby
We on the strip, Friday night, it's lookin' like the award show
You need to slow down baby
Catch me with my bitch, hair color hot sauce
I’m a hero in my hometown, baby
Oh, man, look who just fuckin' pulled up! (What up?)
It's me

[Verse 1]
First thang first, baby girl let's get acquainted
My name Gucci Mane, baby tell me what you dranking
That boy is a lame, he don't got no super game
My name Gucci Mane and baby girl that's just a name
Tell me who you came with and the reason that you came
You don't need to be here girl you should be ashamed
Baby let me help you, I'll be your shelter in the rain
Let me be your doctor tell me where you feeling pain
I can be your pill baby, I can keep you sane
And I can be your whip, I can whip you off the chain
I know you heard bout Guwop and my boys we off the chain
I'm the boss and spilling sauce
Cause Gucci don't know how to sang

[Hook]
I'm at this point of my life, important part of my life

I'm at this point of my life, girl would you set me aside
I'm at the point of my life, I'm having sex with your mind

[Verse 2]
To all the hustlas worldwide, and from coast to coast
Put your glasses in the air and propose a toast
Grab the pretty girl that you love the most
Ladies grab your boyfriend, baby hold him close
I got a girl From a Island and she love me mo
Got another girl and she love my boat
Got another girl love to sell my dope
Got another girl love to buy me coats
But they ain't you bae, no they ain't you babe

See they ain't you babe, it's me and you babe
And there ain't nothing else I can do but be with you, babe

[Hook]
I'm at this point of my life, important part of my life

Come at this point of my life, girl would you set me aside

[Verse 1]
I'm the matriarch of your land
When you need to take my hand
Come into my arms, I'll keep you safe from harm
I'll keep your precious heart

[Verse 2]
Some people try to drag you down
Take it from me, stand and be proud

[Intro: J. Cole]
This for all my niggas in the city
But this shit really for Queens though
Really for Queens though, ya know?
Big city of dreams, motivated by schemes
Getting money regiment with my gettin' money regime
Ya nah mean? Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
New York Times, come listen to these New York rhymes
A southern nigga with a New York mind
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be Kings
Getting to the money, it seems, by any means
As I, watch it all pan out, try not to stand out
Fish out of water, yet an official reporter
Up here, life is a bitch, I blow a kiss at her daughter
In the city where niggas will leave your shit outta order
So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news
Shot {censored} brother in the head, thank the Lord he ain't dead
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened up once
My nigga visibly stressin', a mess, he smoking his blunt
What could I say? I can't relate to that, all I do is pray for that
This the city of God told me go and make it at
I got a date with destiny, I'm running late for that
Grab a paper, hey kid, you gotta pay for that

[Chorus: J. Cole & 50 Cent]
The New York Times, yeah
The New York Times
Extra, extra, read all about it
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been nowhere if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces on the train mane
New York, New York

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hop on the F train, took the express train
Skip that local shit, my vocals sick, that's how success came
Once kings, now we pawns in this chess game
Wall Street got black slave blood stains
Which means, we built this city
And never got scraps while the devil got fat
In fact, reparations for niggas in desperation
Fuck money, get my kid a real education
Blood money spills, had a real revelation
Southside make you realize there's still segregation
Don't wanna preach, I'm just thinking out loud
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking 'bout how
My motive, to lead my niggas to paradise
Imagine the world free from pain and we no longer scared at night
Far from the crime, the blind leading the blind
We don't make it primetime 'til we dyin'

[Chorus: J. Cole & 50 Cent]
The New York Times
The New York Times, yeah
The New York Times
Extra, extra, read all about it
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been nowhere if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces on the train mane
New York, New York

[Verse 3: Bas]
How I go from selling reefer and plates
To eating steaks with Cole and playing FIFA with Drake?
Shoulda been in the States, property of the Jakes
Now I'm plotting on profits and properties on the lake
Let me properly integrate you to it
Show you how the heads of states and gangsters do it
Them niggas talk a lot of shit but they ain't been through it
I done been up in everything, cars you never seen
Cities you never heard of, from the streets where they murder
Police observe us 'til they reach the verdict
Kill 'em all, fucking kill 'em all
If you can't send 'em to the pen, send 'em to the morgue
Send 'em to the Lord, fuck it, send his broad
Hundred shots through the dark but they never hit my heart
Nigga, bitch nigga, take a pause
Hundred shots through the dark, you can never hit my heart

[Chorus: J. Cole & 50 Cent]
New York Times
The New York Times, yeah
The New York Times
Extra, extra, read all about it
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been no where if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces, on the train mane
New York, New York

[Chorus: J. Cole & Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Lil' sip, took a lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, t-took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
'Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
'Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
'Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death
Blaow

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

[Outro: J. Cole]
Don't shit last, don't shit last and you know that
Went to hell, got hot didn't melt
The only man above me is God himself
All these other niggas is below me
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi
What up Queens
Cole is the King and you know that
Started with a dollar and a dream, and you know that
Never give a bird bitch a ring, you should know that
Bitch, bitch
That should be my new ad lib
I got a new one. I finally got a cool ad lib
Be at all the shows everybody be like, bitch
Bitch, bitch
Or you can do the low cool shit, bitch

[Outro Skit: Lil Cole]
Yo, yo, yo pull over right here, right here, here you go
Yeah pull over right here, to the right
Pull over, pull over, pull over, pull over
Ight, look look, park right here
I'ma be out it'll be like thirty minutes tops
It'll be like thirty minutes, I'll be right back out, ight
Bitches come and go, bitches come and
Yo, yo what up, what's popping, I'm back, I'm back
Yo you got that piece ready for me, that Jesus piece
Nah the gold, the rose gold joint, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah let me see that, oh shit what is that some
What's, what the fuck is that platinum
Is that? What's that chain right there
Is that-ss-ss white gold, that's platinum
Is that plat, well niggas doing platinum again, niggas doing, niggas ain't even platinum yet right, oh shit bout to make
Yo I'm trying to bring that shit back, kill these niggas
Let me see that one too, the wat, the watch, the platinum watch

[Intro: Choir & J. Cole]
I'm a born sinner
But I die better than that, I swear
It's way darker this time
*Laughs*

[Chorus: J. Cole & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov, now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Cole, time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Sometimes I brag like Hov, sometimes I'm real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough, look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers tryna steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet, I'm real life hot, homie
Get your weight up, fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots
And I don't mean no disrespect whenever I say faggot, okay, faggot?
Uh, don't be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass that's between you and whoever else's dick it is
Pause, maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya? Boy Meets World, I'm tryna find a new Topanga
And bang her out, no hanging out
My pops was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James, wait a minute, that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne, say fuck it
If the hoes like it I love it, nigga, nigga, nigga
Used to watch Rap City, Big Tigga, Tigga
Rap nerd, even copped Rah Diggah, Diggah
Pac had a nigga saying fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie
I was only like 11 so forgive me
A decade later I'd be all up in the city
Tryna get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didn't want it it was fuck him again
One day, he gon' regret playing me
Little did I know in a year he'd be fucking paying me, what could you say to me? I
Beat the odds like Vegas, I used to rap about haters
Before niggas was hating me, now they hate to see
A young black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free, pardon me

[Chorus: J. Cole & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Got the game back, and I ain’t ever letting go

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I'm the prince of the city, I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parts where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli
And so I'm wondering really what could you actually tell me
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese sorry
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas sorry
Never seen his pops 'cause he's sorry
Fucked up education, would ask for reparations
But I’m probably just gon' go and buy Ferraris, vroom
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the TV so the demons in 'em
I'm in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil, now I'm pleading with him
Like give me my soul

[Bridge: J. Cole]
My nigga, I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
But the Devil don't play fair

[Refrain: J. Cole]
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
These next three bars is dedicated to the retards
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati;
Is you stupid, nigga? Young black millionaire
Old white billionaires, I'm sure that they can do without me
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more A's I would've been a summa cuma laude
Beyoncé told me that she want to cop the blue Bugatti
That shit is more than what I'm worth, I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward, awkward
Want to know what else is really awkward, awkward
When niggas buy rings for bitches I had flings with
I'm praying I don't see 'em at the Oscars, Oscars

[Interlude: J. Cole]
Hey J. Cole, this way, hey
Oh, hey, what's up? What's goin' on with you? Okay
Big smile, man, big smile, let me see that crooked smile
J. Cole, J. Cole, this way, look this way
Oh friend hug, friend hug, just keep it friendly
We friends, friends

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Re-adjustin' my target audience, 'cause it's obvious
I've gone astray, losing my way like Timberlake
Produced by Timbaland on that goddamn FutureSex/LoveSounds
What's playing in my mind, just the sound of my whole career
Crash and burning, the thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years until I let the Devil steer
Now what have we here? Mask my tears, but I

[Bridge: J. Cole, Yolanda DeBerry & Tanikka Myers]
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again

[Outro: J. Cole & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Allow me to re-introduce myself, my name is Cole
My nigga
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Allow me to re-introduce myself, my name is Cole
My nigga
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner

Uh huh, uh huh (yeah, Rihanna)

Uh huh, uh huh (good girl gone bad)
Uh huh, uh huh (take three, action)
Uh huh, uh huh (Hov)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z & (Rihanna)]
No clouds in my stones, let it rain
I hydroplane in the bank coming down with the Dow Jones (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better
You know me, in anticipation for precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
With little Ms. Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at? (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
You have my heart and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines but you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there, with you I'll always share because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
You're becoming a dream to me, a fairytale fantasy
Nothing can never compare an image to my memory
Girl, I'm asking, could you be my queen? A vision on a magazine
That's when I'll be there, it's something we both share because

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
When the sun shine, we'll shine together
You know I'll be here forever
Although it's a lot of rain outside
Girl, it's getting late, and you can stay the night
But you can dip out anytime whenever
I can call a car, I ain't tryna stress ya
I'm looking for the one with the glass slipper
Baby girl, you can be my Cinderella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
You can be my Cinderella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
You can be my Cinderella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
You can be my Cinderella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Bridge: Rihanna & Chris Brown, Both]
You can run into my arms
It's okay don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and say my name some more
I'll be all you need and more (ah, you ready?)
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna & Chris Brown]
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath, I'mna stick it out till the end
But you can dip out anytime whenever
I can call a car I ain't tryna stress ya
I'm looking for the one with the glass slipper
Baby girl, you can be my Cinderella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
You can be my Cinderella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella ella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

It's raining (raining)
Ooh baby, it's raining (raining)

Oh baby, it's raining (Rihanna)
You can always come into me
Come into me

[Hook: Da Pak]
Niggas, bitches, pimps, tricks
Whoever you with, let me see them armpits
Musty or dusty, ashy or nasty
When your paths meet, let me see them armpits
Hey, yo
Hit somethin'
Pop somethin'
Move somethin'
Rock somethin'
Spit somethin'
Cop somethin'
Do somethin'
Lock somethin'
You want your life? The lift your arms up!
Nigga put your palms up, get them guns up!

[Verse 1]
Come on over ho, we got weed in the Rover
If you don't get your hands up, you can bleed in your shoulders
I'm the holy ghost ask them Jehovahs
I leave no witness, nobody but the chauffeur
You might see me on the sofa with Oprah
Nope, you gon' see me on the screen
For catchin' a 3 to 15 for this cream
?
I'm doing hit-runs with my hit-team
Somebody get shot, nobody get seen
Girl you a party ho, but that fit look nice on your body though
I don't party though...
Bitch! I'd rather stick niggas for their money
And baby, this ain't a party song
But I'll hit hoes with the Bacardi long
Dick stroking, pussy bust that shit open
Big pimping, big scoping, your tip closing

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We backed up in this Expo
Drugged, gats up
Time ticks to conflict, the bomb hit
Explosion, blows with yo neck slow drips, holes
Get 'em up are you finna win or what?
Hands, get 'em up
It's too clutch, by the guts, send 'em up
As far as them blocks go, we got those, hit 'em up!
Popped a mo', let's go henny in the cup
Optimal, make 'em stop, drop and roll
With the hot flows, spot clothes, gotcha dough
Shot ya ho, dragged her out the hospital
Unlock the door, pop the trunk, lock the fo'
Ridin' in the drop-top slow, copped the dro
Spot the popos but they only obstacles
Jump from the pot smoke, won't stop the show
Got the dough, lash out ?
?, C'mon!
Yeah, yeah, uh, what? Yeah niggas, what? What? What? Uh, What?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Hey, yo
I pop something, write for a little; drop nothing
Unarmed? Nuh-uh, lights on 'em pistols stop fronting
While y'all chase birds like Road Runner for phone numbers
I be in the back with bone crushers and known hustlers
Big bill niggas, big deal niggas
One call you're killed, all ill niggas
Want beef? Better be extra sure
My niggas be under your floors
So stay on your toes like pedicures
My 16s make other rappers quit dreams
Try to sing, enlist in the marines
Zero tolerance, I leave heroes hollering
You better have Shapiro and Cochran or you can ring it up like Jostens
Feel me? 'Course not
Still be on top
On the rock, bill me for your spot, for real B
Honor that
18, longer gat, corner cat, stronger raps
When Lu on, who gon' be stopping that?

[Hook]

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I died today my nigga, was it business, was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed 'cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we'd grow to be murderers?
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless, I saw but never noticed
That a college point is right to "Be all that you can be" posters, uh
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if
This the realest shit I wrote, but know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'll find it
And knew one day you'd come back and rewind it, singing

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it 'cause this music biz is a cliff
I got her life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming, "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you, "You the only reason why I don't flip
And go insane," my roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no
Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby, you go Whitney, damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows 'em
Don't you ever go expose 'em
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show, more for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself, I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test, but where's the tutor for me?
Pops came late, I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Choir]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: J. Cole]
This music shit is a gift

[Produced by J. Cole & Nate Jones]

[Intro]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time my man is murdered; the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name

[Refrain]
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 1]
I used to print out Nas' raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read them in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who'd a thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though ‘cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play
And I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said, "You the one, yo, why you make that shit?"

[Chorus]
I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 2]
I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made "You Owe Me"
Dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par
When I followed my heart
Granted, my heart was tainted
By my mind that kept on sayin'
"Where's the hits?" You ain't got none
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none
And, dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcome
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I studied the shows, the fans, study they hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game

[Chorus]
But on the way I let Nas down
I got no one to blame
I'm ashamed, I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you can never understand, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 3]
I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core
Then I can open the door
Reintroduce 'em to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so, I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross
Dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass, please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose
I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it
How could you fail to respect it?

[Chorus]
Letting Nas down, I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight
May I never lose sight, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Intro: Mike Epps (Sampled)]
Married men act totally different when they're by themselves, don't they? You see 'em with their wife, "What's up Tony?" "Hey man, how's everything going brother? Oh, just taking it easy, hanging out with the old lady. Alright, God bless you, take it easy now, alright." You be like that nigga ain't like that
You see him by himself, "What's up Tony?" "Hey, where's the bitches at, nigga?! Where's the bitches?!"

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Gimme my space, Lord, ain't enough time to chase
All these dreams, nah mean? I got no time to wait
Love my girl, but I told her straight up, "Don't wait up"
Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked and made up
Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up
Feelin' like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wan' be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She'll never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowin' when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wan' let her down
But you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Aw shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying, "Baby, won't you throw them bands on me?"
And I came to spend
She pop a molly, let the motherfuckin' games begin
I'm running away

[Chorus]
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on

[Verse 2]
When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher say we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: "Are you sure?
Even a murderer? Even a whore?
Even a nigga running through bitches on tour
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit?"
She losin' faith in him and he knows the shit, like, "What the fuck is a break?
Don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got 'til it ain't no more
No more tears, it's been ten long years
Damn near, I don't know if I can wait no more"
And who can blame her, you complain about
Every time you out, you come back she poutin'
Sleeping back to back, this is wack, we 'bout
To go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out
On account of your guilt and she has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evenin'
And even in your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman, at least you know you got Lois Lane
But you

[Chorus]
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on

[Verse 3]
Yeah
Unbelievable, seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age three I knew this world was three below
Listen, even though my ego low, achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me, "Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color they face is"
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby, that's
Not quite what you expected, but you
Refuse to neglect it, 'cause you
Know your wifey loves you, thus you refuse to accept it
That’s the type of shit that turned my granny light-skinned
Rich white men rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now, the chains concealed
In our thoughts, if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from fifty-mill like Dave Chappelle?
You know

[Chorus]
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on

[Intro]
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ah, ayo, ah
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I hate rich niggas, god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Who you had to kill? Who you had to rob?
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top, damn it?
Or maybe that's daddy money, escalator, no ladder money
Escalade, new Caddy money
Worst fear going broke cause I'm bad with money
Crooked smile nigga, momma never had the money, damn
I ain't tripping
Nigga Jordan and I ain't Pippen, yeah
Up the steps, I ain't slipping
Tears, blood, sweat, and I ain't cripping
Here's a song you can sing along with
When you down on some let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas, you think she out here getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog, now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga, plus dawg, I'm a grown man now
I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crashed and it only killed his lame ass
I'd be glad it's that nigga, nigga
Did Kay dirty now it's back to broke
Refund checks, used that to float
Momma gets depressed, falls in love with the next maniac
On crack, use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes, tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Could've drowned, but I grabbed the rope

[Pre-Chorus]
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

[Chorus]
Sing, you got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

[Verse 2]
I hate rich niggas, god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now
Hear my shit and tried to switch now
Know you felt the shit just now, know you felt the shit just now
Ain't there more to you? Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power, fuck it more to you
Saw through you and it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for mo' money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but this ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watched lil Jermaine do his thang before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat
He gave it all he got, and now a nigga don't paint the same, damn
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Think of old school niggas like Dana Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame, my brain the same
Yeah, nigga, at least he ain't insane
At least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy, motherfucker, you just afraid of change
That's new, maybe that's true
But listen here, I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you
When I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I can't maintain no more
Tad bit extreme I know
Money can't save your soul
But there go you

[Pre-Chorus]
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

[Chorus]
Sing, you got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

[Outro]
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

[Verse]
Mo' money, yeah
Mo' money, blow money, show money
Party money, side ho money, dope money
New clothes money from shit that I wrote money
So much money I don't know who stole from me
Hard to keep track I'm used to having no money
Still broke compared to niggas with old money
I mean the type of niggas that laugh at Hov money
Billionaires with petroleum and coal money
Probably kill they selves if they had Cole money
Talk shit and I'ma see you like you owe money
I'm wrapping up the album, fourth quarter I'm so money
I'm overseas looking for trees to grow money
Peter Popoff, robbing people for hope money
Prostitutes collecting that "let me stroke" money
Put up a couple dollars for the liquor store money
Used to dread the strip club cause I couldn't throw money
Now the strippers give a nigga the throat for no money
How mama gonna teach you how to save your money
When she barely on the boat, got stay afloat money
Blacks always broke cause we don't know money
Spend it 'fore we get it and could never hold money
No wallets, nah, nigga we'd rather fold money
Money control niggas, white man control money
Laughing like "yeah yeah my nigga get your money"

[Refrain]
(I said) Set it off on my left, set it off on my right
(I said) Liquor all on my breath, bitches all in my sight
(I said) Real niggas tryna fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
(I said) Gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life
(I said)

[Bridge]
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
Troubles of this, troubles of this world

[Verse 1]
Yeah, god flow
Paint a picture like a young Pablo, Picasso
Niggas say "Live fast, die young," so I drive slow
And pray I die old
In the drop with the top low
Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo
Kept it straight, shit, cause y'all know
And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the Chi go
I ain't fuck her, but I'm thinking 'bout it
My niggas say why you gotta think about it?
The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much
If I gotta be frank about it
Ain't worth the stress
First the text, then the draws, see first is sex
Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next
Nah, bitch can't get a dollar
Cole on Twitter, bitch can't get a follow
Can get a nut, heard "Can't Get Enough"
Now she fuck a nigga thinking that she may have hit the lotto
No way, Jose
Could write a book called, "The Things Hoes Say"
Show a lot of love to my sisters though
But these bitches so predictable
I'm in trouble

[Chorus]
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
Getting to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
I take it to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man

[Refrain]
Set it off on my left, set it off on my right
(I said) Liquor all on my breath, bitches all in my sight
(I said) Real niggas tryna fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
(I said) Gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life
(I said)

[Verse 2]
And I'm going back to school
Only for the hoes and a class or two
Young bad bitch made the pastor drool
Everybody sweat her like Catholic school
Sat next to her in the back of the class
Cheated off her test and I'm grabbing her ass
She like "Don't you know this shit already?"
"Nigga, ain't you rich already?"
Yeah, but I got dumb as shit
Hanging 'round these rappers 'cause they dumb as shit
But I'm back on track, jump shot wasn't that good
Couldn't sell crack but I rap good
That's one stereotype
Know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type
Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya
I'm Koopa, I never been the Mario type
No saving hoes
I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches that a nigga went to school with is major hoes
And they mans don't know, they mans don't know, fo' sho
Had a nigga baby, little mans don’t know
Mama, was a freak, got it in on the low
12 years later when my song come on, he ask
"Mama, did you fuck J. Cole?"
Whoa

[Chorus]
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
Getting to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
I take it to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man

[Refrain]
Set it off on my left, set it off on my right
(I said) Liquor all on my breath, bitches all in my sight
(I said) Real niggas tryna fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
(I said) Gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life
(I said)

[Intro: J. Cole & Amber Coffman (Sampled)]
She knows
She knows, ayy
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly, I've never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I'm gonna run, run away (Oh, I), run run away, run away (Oh, I-I-I)
Run away and never come back (Well, all right)
Run run away, run run away (Oh, I), run away (Oh, I-I-I)
Show 'em that your color is black (Well, all right)

[Verse 1]
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man what you want, what you want?
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit, huh
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit, but not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club, getting dubs
With a bad bitch in his ear, sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

[Chorus]
And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down, she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows

[Refrain]
Well, all right, oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well, all right
Oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well, all right

[Verse 2]
Damned if I do, shit, damned if I don't
I'm passing up on bad hoes
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want?
What she—What she want from a nigga?
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just want to sing on it
Got me up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
'Cause I told her I was sleep
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
She could be doing the same thing, I suppose

[Chorus]
And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down, she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows

[Refrain]
Well, all right, oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well, all right
Oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well, all right

[Bridge 1]
Niggas say, "Turn up," hoes say, "Turn up"
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Niggas say, "Turn up," hoes say, "Turn up"
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye (Left Eye)
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya
Just as soon as I die (I die)

[Bridge 2]
Got me up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie, uh
I be up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
Got me up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie, uh
I be up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie

[Refrain]
Well, all right, oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well, all right
Oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well, all right

Run away, run away— Back
Run away, run away— Back
Run away, run away— Back
Run away, run away— Back

[Intro]
Okay, I lied

Motherfuckers tryna say I can't come to the hood—true lie
See, I would, but I'm out in Dubai

Fuck hoes out of wedlock, make her bed rock

Pullin' that trigger nigga better be a head shot
Money long like dread locks shit

For a couple G's, send a couple G's
Fuck copping pleas, Met Lock shit (testify)

Came through humble so it's best if I
Explain the newer shit, rockin' jewel shit
Got the full clip, cock and pull shit

My nigga Syience killed this motherfucking beat

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Art of seduction, hoes jump like Vince Carter
Backstage like they a part of production
We talked about her dreams, you gotta start off with something
Her momma went to college but yet her father was hustling
Found it funny 'cause now they daughter is stuck in
A similar predicament, I'm askin' where her nigga went
She said "Your guess is good as mine
Dropped outta school now he run the streets like all the time
Left me alone with this baby I don't hear from the nigga
And to keep hundred with you I don't care for the nigga
Well, movin' on
Funny 'cause I only know a couple of your songs but I love when they come on"
Word?

[Hook]
I'll take it, baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you 'cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind, embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it, do not waste it
Take a shot, you not wasted

[mumbling]
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick
This is superstar dick, girl how could you not taste it?

[Verse 2]
That's a little ego—
Tistic, my amigos be hocking in Toledo
Niggas winning off me, it's all G 'cause he know
Bitches can't get the Michael so they settling for Tito
We know, yeah nigga we know
Hot bitch fell in my lap like cappuccino
Niggas so thirsty it irks me
You keep on putting bitches over money but that ain't my cup of tea though
Nah nigga, the game is to get
A bunch of paper just to change your fucking neighbors and shit
I swear if niggas put half of what they put in chasing ass
Into a craft, by now you'd be famous and rich, huh
But I get it, you rather lay with a bitch
While you play with her pussy, and let her play with your dick, huh
She thinking she got a first round pick, huh
She thinking 'bout all the things she can get, huh
She thinking you got a Range for a whip
And a fly ass cribbo, but it's not that simple 'cause
All you got is a phone full of bitches
And they just like her
Meanwhile I'm stacking paper up, my word
Had more hoes coming than a bus driver
Got a full grown woman wanna fuck my word
Wanna ride my nouns, let her suck my verbs
Aye

[Hook]
I'll take it, baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you 'cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind, embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it, do not waste it
Take a shot, you not wasted

[mumbling]
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick
This is superstar dick, girl how could you not taste it?

[Produced by Christian Rich]

[Hook: Jhené Aiko and  J. Cole]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Baby you deserve the whole enchilada
Gucci and Prada
Toast to the days when I didn't have a dollar
You stuck around even when the world frowned on me
Kicked me when I was down, and so they clowned on me
Down for me, my homie
You better believe, I know your home girl said you should leave a note
Know you was tired like the Michelin man
What if Gina would have listened to Pam?
Now they hate to see us last this long
When they get my album, probably pass this song
Thought they knew me well
Money can't buy you happiness that's true as hell
But happiness can't buy yo' ass this new SL
I love you like the fat kid loves cakes and shit
I love you like the bad kid love breakin' shit
Ride or die chick, fighting insecurities
Want a ring and my last name for securities

[Hook: Jhené Aiko and J. Cole]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I know my style ain't perfect
I know my smile ain't perfect
Nigga ain't perfect, it's true
Funny though I am perfect for you
All the drama seem worth it for you
She put up with the shit like she work at the zoo, true
Now what you crying for?
She says you ain't gon' settle down, what you lyin' for?
She want that old thing back
Things ain't the same, think we both seen that
Love is war, end up on the floor
But baby you only lose when you don't swing back
I say those words hoping that
You fight for a nigga like I fight for you
Like I fight temptations every night for you
And know I slip, only girl in my life is you

[Hook: Jhené Aiko and J. Cole]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too

[Bridge: Jhené Aiko]
Feels as though our world's crashing down
We can’t forget to breathe through this now
We live through the ups and the downs
It’ll get better

[Hook: Jhené Aiko]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly

[Kerney Thomas]
"I'm just thankful
18 years of suffering gone just like that
You've been suffering 18 years yourself
You've been going through pure hell but it can be over just that fast
Well, this is pastor Kerney Thomas and I literally have tens and thousands across this country
That were hurting but God done heal them
And God could work a miracle for them"
"All you gotta do is either log on to our website
Or you can dial the toll-free number
And place your order right there
For the Personal Prayer Package
I want you quickly, to place that order right now
For the Personal Prayer Package
Pick up the telephone right now
I said pick up the phone right now
You're past due a miracle"

[Verse 1]
I knew when I laid my eyes on you
The lights from above seemed to shine on only you
And you made me feel like I was fly
When I made you sparkle in your eyes
We ain’t even 20 baby
I ain’t learned to love you right yet
Good thing I thought I was the shit back then
I sang in your ear cause I wanted you to know
That I had soul baby
I called you all the time
I guess I tried too hard to make you mine
You'd have nothing to do with me baby
Thank God that you changed your mind

[Hook]
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I’m gonna be strong
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay mine

[Verse 2]
Finally convinced you to come over and just say hi
I sang "Forever My Lady" and kissed you for the very first time
After months, holidays, holding hands in the park
Normally I’d be playing basketball or something like that in the park
Then I messed up like boys tend to do
It’d be a year till I got back with you
Thank God that you called me back baby
Cause I’d never be the man that I am today

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Then one night upon the phone
You said you were at home alone
I wasn’t even old enough to drive a car
I saw my only chance to keep it alive
Keep love alive
Good thing for you I stole my daddy’s car
Cause no one’s ever gonna love you baby
Better than I do

[Hook]

[Intro: Snagglepuss]
“Oh, good God in Heaven Almighty, Heavens to Murgatroyd
We've got a cataclysmic situation developing
Somebody get down here now!”

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Come on, come on, baby
Let me show you what I'm talking about
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
You try to be a lady, but you're walking like a sauerkraut
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
Looka— Looka like-a, like-a— Like you wanna get some
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
If you never tell a lie, then you never have to play dumb
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Dirty baby— Time, you're gonna take some
Pretty baby— Love, you're gonna make some
Little lady— Hearts, you're gonna break some
Kinda shady— Tears, you're gonna fake some
Dirty baby, gotta situation
Pretty baby, open invitation
Little lady, what a reputation
Kinda shady, now you're gonna make again

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl
I know you can battle the masses, dear
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl

[Interlude: Snagglepuss]
“Oh, God! Oh, no!
It's getting worse, worse by the minute
We're down here in division of mystery
Someone, send for back up right now!”

[Verse 2]
Every other day, you say you're gonna have to bury 'em
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
Famous last words from the fuckin' Laserium
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
Descendents had a record sayin' somethin' bout Milo
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
You can take the A-train, but you're gonna have to lie low
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl (Yeah!)
I know you can battle the masses, dear
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl

[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Yeah! (Yeah)
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Dirty baby— Time, you're gonna take some
Pretty baby— Love, you're gonna make some
Little lady— Hearts, you're gonna break some
Kinda shady— Tears, you're gonna fake some
Dirty baby, gotta situation
Pretty baby, open invitation
Little lady, what a reputation
Kinda shady, now you're gonna make again

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl (Yeah!)
I know we may never get out of here
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl!
(Ah yeah!)

[Verse 1]
There's a red house over yonder
That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder
Lord, that's where my baby stays
I ain't been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, something's wrong here
The key won't unlock this door
Wait a minute, something's wrong
Lord have mercy, this key won't unlock this door
Somethings goin' on here
I have a bad, bad feeling
That my baby don't live here no more
(That's alright I still got my guitar, look out now!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well I might as well go on over yonder
Way back up on the hill
(I got something to do)
Lord, I might as well go back over yonder
Way back yonder 'cross the hill
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will!
{*sounds of cameras and conversations in background*}

"Whassup with that goddamn camera nigga what's crackin?"
"Aight let Snoop through with the Western Union (bitch though)"
"Damani! Soopafly! Ay Bad Lucc! What's up nigga?"

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
I'd like to welcome the Western Union onto this "Blue Carpet Treatment"
Some playa partners of mine... and we gon' show y'all this new dance we got

[Chorus: Latoiya Williams & Raul Midon + (Snoop Dogg)]
Like this (like this, it's easy to do)
Like this (yeah, it's so easy to do)
Grab a honey, take her to the floor and do it just like this
(You can do it, you can do it just just like this)
You don't have to break it down to the floor (c'mon, yeah)
All you gotta do is keep movin your hands like this
(Like this, you do can do it, you can do it too)
Like this (c'mon, you can do it, you can do it too)
I feel playa when I move and dancin to the song
All I wanna do is get my groove on like this

[Damani]
I throw my hands like Marvin
Sorta like James Brown how I +Get Down+
I'm holdin my chain so it don't swang
I'm slidin my feet, stayin on the beat
I dip low then bring it back slow
If you didn't wanna dance, why you on the flo'?

[Bad Lucc]
Damani's on the go and Mr. Lucc on the catch-up
Soopa Doopa behind, and baby this a set-up
Two-step with me - call your girls
I got two ref's with me, they call the game quickly
Big boy smooth, I'm too cool for the runway
Playa of the year, my gear's set for Sunday

[Soopafly]
Wait right here girl I'm comin back Monday
Slide right in front of me; get our dance on
Fred Astaire, Faye Dunaway; eyes on us
While we move to the clap; I'm nice with the dance
And I'm smooth with the rap; we in the zone with the lights and glamour
Glass full of Patron, the code is grammar

[Damani]
Coat made of panther, excuse me miss
Let me show you how to do it

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Let me holla at you baby, come close, it's
Bigg Snoop Dogg, king of the coast, bitch
Walk with me, stay focused
Put it on me little mama, let me see you stroke this
It seems like, the mo' hits
On a slow drift, bubble like a fo'-fifth
And everybody everybody notice
So to cool cool Calvin Broadus
And every woman is a goddess
And every rapper is a artist
Yeah right, you're dead wrong, just sing along
It's Godzilla for reala my nigga, King Kong
Givin' niggas the blues
As I'm walkin' on these fools in my blue suede tennis shoes
I'm two-steppin' with my weapon close
On the dance flo' loc, cause you never know
Yeah baby girl, she's strapped, but she cool
Cause we ain't come, to act no motherfuckin fool
We just chillin like a villain, got my hands to the ceilin
And I'm feelin the feelin, come feelin like this

[Chorus]

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Check it out
I-I know baby girl I know
See, out here in the West
Nah, we don't do that
We don't do the motorcycle dance
We don't do the snap, uh-uh
We do a lil' somethin like this, c'mere
C'mere, you think you can do that with me baby?
Do it just like this, c'mon
Yeah... 

[fades out]

[Intro: Action Bronson]
Bam Bam
La musica de Harry Fraud

[Hook: Action Bronson]
White leather to the knee, we in the tropics
Left hand is switching speeds
I'm in the cockpit
Straight from Flushing man, we known for using chopsticks
Problems getting dealt with, never pop shit
Hit you with the dropkick, Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with the dropkick, Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with the dropkick, Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with that dropkick, Marty Jannetty

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Rock this Shawn Kemp, kamikaze
Burning cheese, Saganaki (opa)
Greek shit, whole team sick
Hoe bitches from Cleveland on my dick because I rap
Fuck it, make it clap
Throw the money in the air then pick it up
I'll take that back, bitch
Homie hold me down
Homie throw me phony pounds
The scent of dollars like some crispy garlic golden brown
Addicted but ain't nothing prescripted
Baby clams from Montauk, mix it up with the linguistics
Bitch I'm high

[Hook: Action Bronson]
White leather to the knee, we in the tropics
Left hand is switching speeds
I'm in the cockpit
Straight from Flushing man, we known for using chopsticks
Problems getting dealt with, never pop shit
Hit you with the dropkick, Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with the dropkick, Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with the dropkick, Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with that dropkick, Marty Jannetty

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, know I hit you with that hot shit
Straight up off the block, roll up pot shit
Niggas just don't wanna go to school
Act like they are, but they not sick
Money all up in my pocket, putting diamonds in everything
See me out I look rich as fuck, clothes smelling like Mary Jane
Ride coastal been on every plane
Say these guys close, but these guys loco
When they see me they non-vocal
High as fuck I need bifocals
Kush got me moving slo-mo
Steak and eggs in my dojo
It's some Gs in there
Need some weed? I'm there
All these cars I own, ain't no keys in there
Tapping young niggas out, rolling weed out an ounce
Now I got a bigger crib
Repping what I live about
My hair long, my weed strong, so they staring
My weed strong, my money long, I ain't caring

[Hook: Action Bronson]
White leather to the knee, we in the tropics
Left hand is switching speeds
I'm in the cockpit
Straight from Flushing man, we known for using chopsticks
Problems getting dealt with, never pop shit
Hit you with the dropkick, Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with the dropkick, Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with the dropkick, Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with that dropkick, Marty Jannetty

[Spoken Intro: Andy Samberg & Bridget]
Hello?
Hi, this is Bridget, should I come over later?
I'm sorry, I don't know a Bridget
Well, that's not what you said when you hugged me last night
Ha! You think we're an item just because I gave you a hug? Trick, you better think again!

[Intro: Andy & Pharrell]
Come here, give me a hug
Come here, give me a hug
Come here, give me a hug
Come here, give me a hug
We are not gentlemen!

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, & Pharrell]
Yo, I'll hug a girl like it don't mean nothin'
Then turn around and start huggin' her cousin
I don't love 'em, end of the f**kin' discussion
Got 'em tucked between my wings like Thanksgivin' stuffin', hugged!
She want a hug from behind, I did it (did it)
Then her friend jump in, I'm wit' it (wit' it)
I hug 'em tighter than a tube top
After that, it's just a matter of time before the other shoe drop (yeah, yeah)
'Cause I get more hugs than Oprah selling drugs
And the drug was pure X, no marriage, no sex
Just hugs

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Don't get mad, girl, we get mad girls
And we're hugging all over the world
So don't catch feelings, it ain't love
We're just the kings of giving out hugs
And if you wanna settle down
You know you got us all wrong
So we on to the next one, no disrespect, hon
But you can't hug a rolling stone

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, & Pharrell]
You can't hug a rolling stone 'cause it'll crush you
Begging me to hug you again? That's when I shush you
On an airplane, at a Knick game
Feel the same damn thing when I hug them (ha!)
Which is nothing, can't trust them
Lose all respect when I hug them
Now guess who's back in the motherfucking house
With a fat hug for your sweater and your blouse
Hugged so many ladies, arms shaky and shit
Because I'm the Wilt Chamberlain of the upper-body grip (hugs!)
'Cause I get more hugs than a batch of puppy pugs
Sitting on a fluffy rug, getting tickled, touchy-rubbed (oh, shit!)
Real talk, like you chatting with a fisherman
Wrap these chicks up like a motherfucking swisher, man
(Hugs)

[Chorus: Pharrell]
This ain't love girl, 'cause this hug world (world)
Is just a big Game of Thrones
We the king of the castle, got arms like a lasso
But you can't hug a rolling stone

[Verse 3: Pharrell Jorma Taccone, & Andy Samberg]
I be hugging on your mama, especially when your daddy's gone
Wearing his pajamas, I know you thinking that is wrong
I don't care what's under, I'm concentrating on her back
I just wanna hug your mama in her Subaru Hatchback
Put her in a finger fold, yes, I'm a hug gigolo
Now she tells her Tupperware friends to let their sisters know
That I give more hugs than Atlas had shrugs
Rest my head on her shoulder while your man mean mugs
We get hugs

[Chorus: Pharrell]
We had fun, girl, but don't get sprung, girl (oh)
Just because I hugged you raw (I hugged you raw)
We can do a group thing, bring Sarah and Susan (Susan)
And we can have a hug-a-trois (hug-a-trois)
So quit trying to own my hugs
I gave you these arms on loan, so come give me a hug
The waistline and above, when push come to shove (and above, hey)
You can't hug a rolling stone

[Outro: Pharrell]
Come here, give me a hug
Come here, give me a hug
Come here, give me a hug
Come here, give me a hug
Huggy Bear P, bitches

[Andy Samberg]
(Yeah, oh yeah. You got the look.)

[Hugh Jackman]
Girl - you got the look (you got the look!)
You're rolling up in the party with one titty out (one titty out)
Oh, girl, you got the whole damn way shook up (you really got it shook)
The way your booby be breathing
It makes me wanna scream and shout, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Akiva Schaffer]
Damn, girl - you rockin' that thing (ow!)
With no support, just watching it swing (yeah!)
May be a mistake, but now she just owning it;
"Ay caramba!" titty, girl you Matt Groening it (ooh)

[Andy Samberg]
I like to think you been looking in the mirror (yeah)
Said to yourself "something's not right here; (ooh, yeah)
Time to shake things up!" so you shook one out
Your hair wasn't working, so you took one out;
A titty (ooh)

[Hugh Jackman]
You're rocking one solo titty, and that's your right
Now you're running this city with one sassy titty
All damn night

[Akiva Schaffer]
She got legs and she knows how to use 'em

[Andy Samberg]
Also got one titty out - sounds so confusing!

[Akiva Schaffer]
Proving she knows how to get attention;

[Andy Samberg]
One laid-back titty with no pretention

[Both: Andy Samberg and Akiva Schaffer]
A strong choice, or just a mistake?
A strong choice, or just a mistake?
Is fashion really what she's all about?
Intentional, or does she even know it's out?

[Hugh Jackman]
Squirrel, you're the center of attention
Tell me, is that good or bad?
'Cause if it's not on purpose, it would be really sad
Schmurl, strutting on down the catwalk
What will the people say?
I've seen into the future, and the look is here to stay

[Kristen Wiig]
Now wait a second...
Why's it always gotta be the ladies taking things out?

[Hugh Jackman]
Mmm, whatcha had in mind?

[Kristen Wiig]
Something like this, groove:
Boy, you got the look;
Rolling up in the party with one ball out

[Sounds of disgust from Jackman and TLI]

Oh, yeah, that's gross
Sorry
That is not the same thing
Nobody wants to see that
I was wrong
I'm a jerk, sorry everybody

[Hugh Jackman]
I'm humiliated!

[Intro]
Life of a
Life of a, (Ooh!)
Life of a hustler

[Song: Jorma Taccone & Andy Samberg/Akiva Scahaffer]
Well I'm a hustler, (hustler)
That's just what I do. (Ooh!)
I'm always hustling on the avenue (avenue)
I can sell water to a whale (water to a whale)
Or even a shell to a snail

I'm a hustler, (life of a hustler)
That's me
I've been this way since I came out my mama's puss (puss)
I'm always thinking of a scheme (Ooh)
I'm good at what I do
And I know a thing or two about hustling

You have to be born with a certain swag
A je ne sais quoi, that makes hustling your bag
Hey! At eight years old, I got my hood pass
Then at nine, I got my first piece of ass (Hey!), (ass)
Ice to an Eskimo, spaghetti to a wop (wop)
I know that sounds racist, it's just how I talk (ah senór?)
In the crap game, I am the number one (number one)
I wouldn't mess around, you'll get your money taken

(Jumbled)
Never talk on the phone, that’s rule number one
I'll punch you in the spine
So many rhymes on my brain, sometimes I feel insane
I’m in the kitchen, cooking up crack
(Laughing) So anyway, that’s probably uncool, right?

[Intro: Andy Samberg & Jorma Taccone]
Nowadays, everybody's using curse words
Seems to me like it ain't necessary
Yeah, so when I get steamed... (Huh!)
Yo, I tell 'em like this:

[Chorus: Andy Samberg & Jorma Taccone]
I don't give a honk, I don't give a honk
And if you think I do, my friend, then you're wronk
Your crocodile tears can go and got gone-k
You faking the fonk, but we don't give a honk

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg & Jorma Taccone]
I'm a wild child and I'm on the loose
Giving less of a honk than a muzzled goose
Or a broken car horn and its honk was fake
Man if I was Senator, it'd be a honkless state
Yo, I drove past a rally saying "Honk for Peace"
So I took out my gun and shot 'em all in the knees
I don't give a honk! You picked the wrong dude
If a honk was my virginity, consider me prude
I consider it rude to have honk-spectations
Only thing I give a honk is a long vacation
On a long space station, can't hear you scream
And they sure can't hear you honk, yadada mean?

[Chorus: Andy Samberg & Jorma Taccone]
Yo we told you before: we don't give a honk
And saying that we do is just simpoly ridonk
You could try to buy us off with your pesos and francs
But your money means nothing, you can take it to the bonk

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg & Jorma Taccone]
Man, I'm stingy when it comes to my honks! Me too!
I literally stick 'em to my body with glue
Good thinkin', Abe Lincoln, you a real smart cookie
Teach a class about giving a honk? I'm playing hooky
Now what you gonna do with all your honks?
Gonna dive in and swim like Scrooge McDonk
'Cause for a honk, I'd bite a chunk out a Buddhist monk
And at his funeral? Everyone will sing this songk

[Chorus: Andy Samberg & Jorma Taccone]
Yo, we told you before: we don't give a honk
Got a theory that we do? Well, your theory's de-bonked
Save the drama for your mama cause your -itis is bronch-
Our policy is staunch: we don't give a honk

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg & Jorma Taccone]
You know, a honk in some countries is considered a food
And if you don't eat it all, it's considered quite rude
We all know we're born with 100 honks
But people throw 'em away like they were Donkey Konks
And the honks are the barrels, the kings and the pharaohs
They sing about honks like they were Christmas carols
I'll punch you in the jeans, but this ain't Lonely Island
And if I catch you stealing my honks, I'll get violent

[Chorus: Andy Samberg & Jorma Taccone]
Yo we told you before: we don't give a honk
Even if you give us candy like Willy the Wonk
But don't come for my honks, better know your place
Mother-honkers honk around and get honked in the face

[Outro: Jon Hamm sample]
This the not honking around crew
And this not honking around thing is about to go both ways

[Intro]
One, two!
One, two, one, two, three

[Chorus]
We are a crowd and we are loud
We're cheering as a group at our favorite event
We're gonna cheer cause we are here
With all of us together, there is nothing to fear
We are a crowd and we are loud
We're cheering as a group at our favorite event
We're gonna cheer cause we are here
With all of us together, there is nothing to fear

[Verse 1]
Now all of the ladies say, "Woo!" (Woo!)
And all of the fellas say, "Crowd!" (Yeah!)
We're drinking beers and doing cheers
Been crowds like us for millions of years
We are all here, we're not at home
As long as we're together, we can't be alone

[Chorus]
We are a crowd and we are loud
We're cheering as a group at our favorite event
We are not one, we are a ton
There's safety in numbers, so now it is fun

[Verse 2]
We are a crowd, crowd, crowd
Yes, we are a crowd
And so we shout, shout, shout
Because beer is allowed
And there's no doubt, doubt, doubt
That we're helping out
Because without-out us, there would be no crowd
We are a crowd

[Intro: Too $hort]
Ladies, listen up, this song is for you
You know it's hard out there tryna find a dude
But The Lonely Island's got three top-notch brothers
So sit back and listen while they compliment each other

[Verse 1: Andy, Kiv, and Jorma]
My man Kiv is the shit
Dude is thoughtful as fuck, plus his body is ripped
He's a good listener even when he's exhausted
And he's crazy hygienic, always brushing and flossing
But that ain't nothing compared to my main man, Jorm
The most sensitive, caring dude I've ever known
He's got that sweet smile, he's got that slow touch
What's the sweet smell? Oh shit, he cooked you brunch
But hold up, my man Andy's got us both beat
He makes a skinny margarita that's a wonderful treat
Plus caramel eyes that are hella disarming
He ain't no fucking Prince, my man is King Charming
Jor, you're far to kind—and speaking of kindness
My man Kiv's been diagnosed with colorblindness
He loves all people, plus he's got the fat dick
It's like a gold brick, all shiny and thick

[Interlude: Too $hort]
When they pitched me this song, they were kinda vague
But I said "fuck it, I'm in" 'cause they said I'd get paid
One thing's for sure, these dudes are weird motherfuckers
So kick back and listen while they compliment each other

[Verse 2: Andy, Kiv, and Jorma]
My man Jorm fucks all night
Call him Super Mario, 'cause he be laying the pipe
He got the eye contact like only you in the room
A modern-thinking man, he ain't afraid of a broom
Yo, you talking feminism? Andy loves that shit
Plus the femme fatales love him cause he's got good dick
And he's a giver: donates hella money to charity
He's also got a great sense of humor—that's personality
I hate to interrupt, but I gotta interject
Kiv grinds his own espresso, has his own panini press
Kiv, so loyal when he makes his pick
That he'll only think of you when he's jacking his dick
He's a shoulder to cry on when you're down in the dumps
He's an outfit to try on when you need a slam dunk
He's an extra stirring hand when you're making a soup
Take a ride in his coupe, he makes you wanna shoop

[Outro: Too $hort]
I'm starting to suspect that these dudes are gay
It's none of my business, they just born this way
I mean, how many times you gon' mention your homie's dick
But still tryin' act like this song is for chicks?
So ladies be warned before you hop under the covers
They might be fucking you but they'll be thinking 'bout each other
The Compliments, bitch!

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Wake up in the morning same shirt same jeans
Wishing of the rich life, I roll when I lean
Not knowing what that life or that day bring
Wonder what if the light shines bright what if i can't see
If I do what I do to get through, then that's what I'mma do
Pure focus when I spew, having been in a pew for some time now
But that don't necessarily mean I'm hell bound
Stuck in my ways, hoping better days come through the cracks
Every day same thing: eat, sleep, shit, rap
Then shake it, mice running round my damn sticky trap
Ants on the plates and food, rapping the only thing cool
My mood chilling in my staring up at the ceiling
Nigga my life day to day is lord willing
The dry wall pillars metaphors for my feelings
Yeah, starting a new life no more drug dealing nigga

[Chorus]
Let me shed a little light for my niggas in the dark
Let me shed a little light for my niggas
All my niggas on that day to day grind tryna' to live they dreams
Just trying to get this cream
Let me shed a little light for my niggas in the dark
Let me shed a little light for my niggas
All my niggas on that day to day grind tryna' to live they dreams
Just trying to get this cream

[Verse 2]
When I was younger I told myself I wouldn't smoke
That was the biggest joke
I'm addicted to these ports like they're pure coke
I'm selling this journey out with no real route
World thought I wanna go, all I really know is that I'm making moves
Whether it's robbing fools or making people groove my nigga
You know I'm choosing something
I remeber getting older and not caring 'bout nothing
All I knew was that I had a destiny; that was my sixth sense
I grind with six cents, and spent six years of rap
I'm hungry, Chris just made it happen
You know Mescudi, I was tired of being
Picture this; two bedrooms and four siblings
I slept on the couch for 14 years of my life
Finally copped him a bed in the living room it's alright
Let me shed a little light, I'mma crawl out the dark
And I'mma grind till the end till my life's cut off nigga

[Chorus]
Let me shed a little light for my niggas in the dark
Let me shed a little light for my niggas
All my niggas on that day to day grind tryna' to live they dreams
Just trying to get this cream
Let me shed a little light for my niggas in the dark
Let me shed a little light for my niggas
All my niggas on that day to day grind tryna' to live they dreams
Just trying to get this cream

[Intro: Starz]
Uh, what? Starz, Starz
Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey
Sing it to me, sing it to me

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
You're so easy to love
You make me cuckoo like a turtle dove
So hot that I can't get enough, enough of you
Hit me and it felt like a kiss
You know it hurts so good, when you do me like this
So sad when I hear the girls talk
When I walk by, I start to cry-y-y

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey and Starz]
(Sing it to me baby)
Cause you're a beautiful player
You're a beautiful player, baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah
(Sing it to me, doll)

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Sunset on a Saturday night
Having a drop-top 'bach ride, time of our lives
He's selling souls on the boulevard of broken dreams
And faded queens
Live young like we oughta die fast
Cause he's been breaking the law and he's not goin' back (goin' back)
I love him violently all through the night
And yes it's true, I live for you-oo-oo

[Chorus - Variation: Lana Del Rey and Starz]
(Sing it to me baby)
Cause you're my beautiful player
(Sing it to me)
You're my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey]
L is for your love that you gave and took away
O is for the only one I wanted to stay
V is for my valiant Valium baby
E is for the X that we took with champagne

[Verse 3: Starz]
I don’t wanna leave, I just wanna breathe
I drive 'em crazy, baby girl, just being me
I’m not selfish, I can’t help it
I was playing the cards I was dealt-ed
The name Starz got a lot of love to give
Riding down Broke Dream Boulevard in the Benz
How you love that? I think too much
A thin line between insanity and true love

[Verse 4: Lana Del Rey]
Hit me and it felt like kiss
Baby if it don't hurt, then I'll have to insist
We have just one life to live
But true love's more than he can give

[Chorus - Variation: Lana Del Rey and Starz]
(Sing it to me baby)
Cause he’s my beautiful player
He’s my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah

[Chorus - Variation: Lana Del Rey and Starz]
(Sing it to me baby)
Cause he’s my beautiful player
(Sing it to me)
He’s my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
You're breaking my heart tonight

Take me for a ride boy
Don't leave me on the side boy

[Verse 1]
Hey guy, whatcha doing, I like you a lot
I been watchin' you, you watchin' me

Gold hoops, cherry pie, I'm the apple of his eye
Jean Paul Gaultier, Versace and yayo

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus - Variation]
You're breaking my heart tonight
Take me for a ride boy, don't leave me on the side boy

[Bridge]
I know we fight, we go out every night
But what do you expect from a Hollywood lifestyle?
He says it's wrong, no baby boy, it's right
Passion is a thing you can't buy, it's hard to find

[Chorus]
You're breaking my heart tonight
Kissing me hard, see Valentina stars delight
I just wanna party tonight
We're breaking all the rules
But baby, it all feels so right
You're breaking my heart tonight
Take me for a ride boy
Don't leave me on the side boy
You're breaking my heart tonight
Kissing me hard, see Valentina stars delight
I just wanna party tonight
We're breaking all the rules
But baby, it all feels so right
You're breaking my heart tonight
Take me for a ride boy
Don't leave me on the side boy

[Verse 1: Shawn]
I probably should have told her the sky was falling
Or maybe that my car ran out of gas
My grandma was sick and I had to leave town right away
Not okay

[Nate]
Tell one more to fix the last one
But I never get back to the truth
Thinking to myself she’ll never find out
That’s what we do (That’s what we do)
That’s how we do (That’s how we do)

[Bridge 1: Wanya]
I wonder what she really thinks of me
Shouldn’t really told her everything
But it’s too late
Can’t take it back
She’ll never look at me the same way again
Noooooo

[Hook]
(I shoulda lied) Cause the truth made her set me free
(And now goodbye) Is more than just a word
My honesty just became my enemy
Maybe a lie would have made things right this time
Shoulda lied
Shoulda lied

[Verse 2: Nate]
Shoulda said it was the end of the world
But sadly it’s my reality

[Shawn]
Would she stay if I said I only had one day left
Stay with me (Stay with me)
Please don’t leave (Please don’t leave)

[Bridge 2 – Wanya]
I wonder what she really thinks of me
I wish I would have never said a thing
But it’s too late for that
I don’t think she’s coming back
And I’ll never look at truth the same again

[Hook]
(I shoulda lied) Cause the truth made her set me free
(And now goodbye) Is more than just a word
My honesty just became my enemy
Maybe a lie would have made things right this time
Shoulda lied
Shoulda lied

[Bridge 2 - Wanya]
Now I’m trying hard to convince my heart
That everything would be ok
She said she’ll never leave
And I just can’t believe she’s gone
And now I know

[Hook]
(I shoulda lied) Cause the truth made her set me free
(And now goodbye) Is more than just a word
My honesty just became my enemy
Maybe a lie would have made things right this time
I Shoulda lied
And now goodbye

Promise myself next time I won’t tell the truth
Cuz If I knew what I knew right now I’ll still be with you
I shoulda lied
Shoulda lied
I shoulda lied
Shoulda lied

[Intro]
I love you
I love you
I love you

[Verse 1]
Baby, I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments were incomplete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation, in connection to the sun
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you, and God, who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world

[Chorus]
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave, just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave, just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me

[Verse 2]
And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am
Baby, you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny, I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife, and I see my whole future in your eyes
The thought of all my love for you sometimes makes me wanna cry
I realize all my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side

[Chorus]
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave, just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave, just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me

[Bridge]
Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time, it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love, to hold, to feel, to breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love

[Chorus]
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave, just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave, just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me

[Intro]
Hey, what a great day for a swim
Yeah
Why are you wearing a shirt?
Too many hickeys on my neck
Oh. The girl I was with last night scratched my back
So you've also been having sex
Yeah

[Chorus]
We need love, not meaningless sex
You've got a round butt? We're not impressed
So many girls wanna get in our pants
But we're not whores. We need romance

[Verse 1]
Hey girl (Girl), you look good (Good)
I want you to know that I would - do you
Frequently. Like riding my hog, it's nothing to me
You're wearing a bra, but soon you won't
Call me the magic man: now you see it, now you don't
When it comes to foreplay, I can take for hours
Say "Do I make you horny, baby?" - Austin Powers
My ocean's got motion, but also girth;
The closest thing you'll feel to giving birth

I'm a butt man
And I like boobs
Put them together, and we like you
I don't care that you're overweight
I see your soul, and you look great
We love all colors, shapes, and sizes
Except Steve's new girlfriend, who's a fucking slut!

[Chorus]
We need love, not meaningless sex
You've got a round butt? We're not impressed
Just two Don Juans looking for amour;
It could be you if you're not a whore

[Verse 2]
I'm Guy #1, I'll massage your back
Or if you prefer, I'll squeeze your rack
If it's your time of the month, I'll call it a night
I'm Guy #2, I don't run red lights
If I was with you, I'd need at least 10 rubbers
Your poo-tang stank, I don't need another lover
I wear condoms too, but when they break, it's bad
Take you to the clinic, I can't be no dad

[Interlude]
'Cause we're the freaks of the industry
You a freak, Guy 1?
Oh you got that, G. What about you, Guy 2?
Yes. Me. Too

[Verse 3]
I always get consent before I screw
I'm not a guy who's gonna rape you
Champagne, waterbed, satin covers;
There you have it - another satisfied lover
There you have it - another satisfied lover
There you have it - another satisfied lover
There you have it - another satisfied lover
There you have it - another satisfied lover

[Chorus]
We need love, not meaningless sex
You got a round butt? We're not impressed
We're two Casanovas, not pieces of meat
But pull down our pants, you'll like what you see

[Intro: Nina Simone]
Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

[Verse 1]
I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah, I told you to wait
So I'ma need a little more time now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me (Black bodies)
All want something out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you naughty
So let's get on with it

[Chorus 1]
We could've been somebody
'stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happenin'

[Chorus 2]
You could've been somebody
We could've, ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia

[Bridge]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
I ride with my niggas, I'd die for my...

[Verse 2]
To all my second-string bitches, tryin' get a baby
Tryin' get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to JAY-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyoncé, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she pregnant-ated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz, you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table, you can't snort that
That go into that, all that money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh
Yeah-yeah, she got you, homie, yeah
'Til death, but do your part, uh
Unholy matrimony

[Outro]
That summer night holdin' long and long, 'din long
Now waiting for the summer rose and (Breeze)
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And live and learn
And live and learn
And livin' and livin' like I’m lonely
Lonely, lonely
And livin' all I have
And livin' all
And live
And live

Blazin', mi don't want dem
Mi need dem
Blazin
Suh mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
And now she find out what life is really worth

Yo mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt

I am a God
I am a God
I am a God

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I am a God
Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn ménage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
I am a God
Even though I'm a man of God
My whole life in the hand of God
So y'all better quit playin' with God

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch to give Saint the garment
Until the day I get struck by lightning

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I am a God
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a God
I am a God
I am a God

[Refrain: Kanye West]
Ahh!
Ahh!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I just talked to Jesus
He said, "What up, Yeezus?"
I said, "Shit—I'm chillin'
Tryna stack these millions"
I know he the most high
But I am a close high
Mi casa, su casa
That's our cosa nostra
I am a God
I am a God
I am a God

[Refrain: Kanye West]
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!

[Outro: Justin Vernon]
Ain't no way I'm givin' up, I'm a God
I'd like to thank everybody who came out tonight to rock with me. You could have been anywhere in the world. You could have been anywhere in the world...

This is the part of the show where I start complaining about shit, justifying shit, but you know how it is. I'm just happy to be making music and happy to be able to perform this shit for you all. You know with this album, we didn't drop no single for radio; we ain't have no big NBA campaign or nothing like that, we ain't even got no cover. We just made some real music

Back when I used to make albums and shit like a couple years ago, 3 years ago, like 4 years ago, we'd go away and work on an album for like 5 months or something, we'd always have to hold the album 'til like August or September for the perfect moment or some shit. Because it means that you're probably gonna sell more, get more audience and radio and shit

But, honestly, at this point, when I listen to radio, that ain't where I wanna be no more. And, honestly, at this point, I could give a fuck about selling a million records as long as I can put out an album this summer that you guys can rock to all motherfucking summer. Y'all don't tell me I'm gonna sell more records. Because at this point, I don't really give a fuck about outside opinions. All I give a fuck about is my clique-clique-clique....

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Won't somebody come along and teach me how to keep it alive to survive?
Come along and show me something that I never knew in your eyes
Take away the tourniquet

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
I used to be so full of my confidence
I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go
More than ever I could use a coincidence
But, now I walk alone and talk about it when I know

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?

[Guitar Solo (1/3): John Frusciante]

[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
I don't wanna have to, but I will, if that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill, but that's what I'm about to do

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Let it on, I'll cut you off when you're screaming into the phone
Hard to own
Anyway, I wanna let you know that everything is on hold
What you gonna do to me?

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
You used to be so warm and affectionate
All the little things I used to hear my fairy say
But, now you're quick to get into your regret
I'll take the fall and now you got to give it all away

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?

[Guitar Solo (2/3): John Frusciante]

[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
I don't wanna have to, but I will, if that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill, but that's what I'm about to do
I don't wanna have to, but I will, if that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill, but that's what I'm about to do

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante, Both]
(Hey) Hey, what would you say if I stayed?
Stayed for a while, if I may (Oh)
Say it again and I'll come around, but not for the last time
(Hey) Hey, what would you say if I changed?
I'll change everything but my name (Oh)
Play it again and I'll come around, come around
But not for the last time, not for the last time

[Guitar Solo (3/3): John Frusciante]

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
You used to be so warm and affectionate
I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go
And now you're quick to get into your regret
And now I walk alone and talk about it when I know

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess you gotta walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess you gotta get away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can, but

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm lying my way from

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
You (No, no turning back, now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back, now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back, now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back, now)
The very worst part of you is me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And now, you think this person really is me
And I'm trying to bend the truth
But the more I push, the more I'm pulling away
'Cause I'm lying my way from

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
You (No, no turning back, now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back, now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back, now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back, now)
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me like this
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me like this
(This) This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me like this
(This) This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me like this

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
You (No, no turning back, now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back, now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back, now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back, now)
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is me
Microphone check, I still don't hear my...
Oh yeah I do, yeah I do
Who the fuck is Stevie J?

[Hook 1: Lil Wayne]
Don't be lookin' for no donations
You get dick, then reservations
I get pussy then hibernation
I start humpin' soon as I wake up
I woke up in some new punani
He woke up bleedin' like "who shot me?"
I kept shootin'; Boo said "you got 'em"
Now, all we gotta do is get rid of the body
But anyway I woke up in some new punani

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I was drunk as a bitch, drunk as a bitch
But not drunk as that bitch
I got in that shit acted donkey in it
Junk in her trunk, hope my trunk key can fit
Then she jumped on my dick like a monkey and shit
Monkey see monkey do, banana clips
Shoot at them niggas, no camera glitch
Wax that ass, no candle stick
And I run with some killers I eat with the mob
Got some shit built up I keep it inside
Red in my eyes, Mount Everest high
Look dead in my eyes, see death in my eyes
The TEC on my thigh and my aim so good
I could shoot a fly or a bull in the eye
Hold up, all bullshit aside
A nigga almost died but I'm outchea
Fuck around with a real nigga get murked
I been paid my dues will I get reimbursed?
Love it when she make faces
Pussy feel like vacation
Eat it like I'm dyin' of starvation
I'm at the finish line, her heart racin'
Give her to Fuke if she Caucasian
My niggas wild as Jumanji
You can call me an S.O.B
Cause its skateboards over bugattis
I used to be at them Heat games
With better seats than Pat Riley
Don't stop, pop that don't stop
Pop that Ollie, Tunechi

[Verse 2: Boo]
Sippin' on dumb, puffin' a J
Met her tonight, fuck her today
You tuck her away, I'm fuckin' her face
Wine head, she's guzzling grapes
Back shots, I'm holding her waist
Freaky, I always freak...
You know Tune my bro, but he ain't tryna meet ya
Just bring your friend, both of us'll eat her
Hater niggas be hungry
Got a hundred shots to feed 'em
Her panties are down, her legs is up
We finally fucked, she starved for months
Don't give a fuck, still I'll hit
Never no feelings, no love for these hoes
No flowers, we're simple, we fucked in the Rolls
No flowers, we're simple, we fucked in the Rolls
Royce - trick!
Now they mad, I told they was
Bitches'll be lying, I did the same
Far from a square, don't mistake me for lame
She's suckin' me off, I'm pokin' her brain
She tell me keep goin', I'm doin' my thing
That pussy so wet, I'm calling it rain
I'm giving her hundreds, she's keeping my change
I keep it a hundred, you do the same
Most women front, but who do you blame?
I gave you dick, you gave me pussy
It's safe to say it's an even exchange...
Bitch!

[Hook 2: Lil Wayne]
Don't be givin' out information
You know niggas still on probation
I get higher than expectations
You know this is the Dedication
I'm on that kush she on that molly
I turn that pussy to Dasani
Shout out my nigga Luca Brasi
I don't know this ho
So I must dash, no disguises
Tunechi, I had to Dedication 5 it

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
There are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me
Wondering what I think of you and I protect you out of courtesy
Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind, afraid to say what I need to say
Too many things that you've said about me when I'm not around
You think having the upper hand means you gotta keep puttin' me down
But I've had too many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand
So I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, watch it drop
Making your heart stop
Just before you hit the floor
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, missed your shot
Making your heart stop
You think you won, and then it's all gone

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
So many people like me put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on
There are so many things you say that make me feel you crossed the line
What goes up will surely fall, and I'm counting down the time
'Cause I've had so many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand
So I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, watch it drop
Making your heart stop
Just before you hit the floor
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, missed your shot
Making your heart stop
You think you won

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
Now it's all gone

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I know I'll never trust a single thing you say
You knew your lies would divide us, but you lied anyway
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
But what goes up has got to fall

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, watch it drop
Making your heart stop
Just before you hit the floor
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, missed your shot
Making your heart stop
You think you won

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
Now it's all gone

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Something has been taken from deep inside of me
A secret I've kept locked away, no one can ever see
Wounds so deep they never show, they never go away
Like moving pictures in my head, for years and years they've played

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes, I remember the darkness of my past
Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have
Sometimes, I think of letting go and never looking back
And never moving forward so there'd never be a past

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Just washing it aside
All of my helplessness inside
Pretending I don't feel misplaced
Is so much simpler than change

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
It's easier to run
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made
It's easier to go
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Nothin' ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them
Sometimes, I wonder why this is happenin'
It's like nothin' I could do will distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
'Cause from the infinite words I could say
I put all the pain you gave to me on display
But didn't realize, instead of settin' it free
I took what I hated and made it a part of me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
It never goes away
It never goes away
And now...

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You've become a part of me (You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me (You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate (Myself from what I've done)
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Hearin' your name, the memories come back again
I remember when it started happenin'
I'd see you in every thought I had, and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away
I was committin' myself to 'em, and every day
I regret sayin' those things, 'cause now I see that I
Took what I hated and made it a part of me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
It never goes away
It never goes away
And now...

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You've become a part of me (You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me (You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate (Myself from what I've done)
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington, & Both]
Never goes away, never goes away
It never goes away, it never goes away
(Get away from me!)
Gimme my space back, you gotta just (Go!)
Everything comes down to memories of (You!)
I've kept it in, but now I'm lettin' you (Know!)
I've let you go, so get away from me
Gimme my space back, you gotta just (Go!)
Everything comes down to memories of (You!)
I've kept it in, but now I'm lettin' you (Know!)
I've let you go (And now)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You've become a part of me (You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me (You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate (Myself from what I've done)
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I've let myself become you
I've let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I don't know who to trust, no surprise
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Trying not to break, but I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
(I) All I ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Tension is building inside, steadily
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Trying not to break, but I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
(I) All I ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I won't waste myself on you, you, you
Waste myself on you, you, you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'll take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
Everything from the inside
And just throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you, you, you

[Verse 1]
Is this the end of the beginning?
Or the beginning of the end?
Losing control or are you winning?
Is your life real or just pretend?
Reanimation of the sequence
Rewinds the future to the past
To find the source of the solution
The system has to be recast

[Verse 2]
Release your mind
Fast forward to the secrets of your soul
Your life's on overload
Delete or save
The units that make you an entity
That's your identity
If you don't know which way to go
You might be lost and confused
A second chance no time to lose
Regeneration of your cyber sonic soul
Transforming time and space beyond control
Rise up, resist, and be the master of your fate
Don't look badly for today, tomorrow is too late

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Verse 3]
You don't wanna be a robot ghost
Occupied inside the human host
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly
Synthesized until they set you free
Alright, okay, alright
'Til they set you free
Alright, okay
'Til they set you free

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Outro]
I don't wanna see you, yeah
I don't wanna see you, yeah

[Verse 1]
He's just a loner, he never says hello
A friend to no one, he's got no place to go
He don't look happy, he looks through furtive eyes
He ain't got nothing, no one to sympathize
Alright now

He hides himself away, his secrets not revealed
As life just passes by, he keeps himself concealed
A solitary man, an enigmatic child
A riddle never solved, a prisoner exiled
Alright now

[Chorus]
I wonder if the loner can assimilate
A lifeless lived alone plays devil's advocate
Come on now

[Bridge]
Has he ever tried to be happy? Reached out from inside
Someone on who he can depend
It's getting too late to recover, he won't stand a chance
And into his own hell, he'll descend
Don't descend
Don't descend
Don't descend
Don't descend

[Verse 2]
No understanding of things we already know
He has to live his life and just learn how to let go
Alright, yeah

[Chorus]
Communication's an impossibility
His own best friend, but he's his own worst enemy
The secrets of his past locked deep inside his head
I wonder if he will be happy when he's dead
Come on, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Intro: Laughter]

[Verse 1]
Astral engines in reverse
I'm falling through the universe again
Down among a dead man's vision
Faded dreams and nuclear fission span

[Chorus 1]
The strings of theory are holding up the race
The puppets falling to the ground
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space
Lost in time I wonder, "will my ship be found?"

[Verse 2]
On this sinking ship I travel
Faster than the speed of light
Not so supernova burns
The black holes turn and fade from sight

[Chorus 2]
The strings of theory hide in the human race
The answers buried underground
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space
Lost in time I wonder, "will my ship be found?"

[Outro]
And very soon
The bomber's moon
Will show us light
And as we crash
We'll pray and kiss
And say goodnight
Goodnight
Just before you die
They say you'll see your life go flashing by
Cold dark endless nights
To burn in hell or bathe in heaven's light

Well I don't wanna live forever
But I don't want to die...
I may be dreaming but whatever
I live inside a lie!

Days pass by too soon
Waiting for the rising of the moon
No escape from here
Facing death but is your conscience clear?

I may be dreaming or whatever
Watching my life go by
And I don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die!

[Solo]
Well, I don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die
I may be dreaming but whatever
I live inside a lie

Don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die
Don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die

[Intro: Beenie Man]
Relivin' the past?
Your loss!

[Verse 1: King Louie]
Rockstar, bitch, call me Elvis
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killin', while I'm drillin'
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night, my bitches came in twos
And they both sucked like they came to lose
Dropped out first day of school
'Cause niggas got cocaine to move
I be goin' hard, I got a name to prove
Killin' 'em, honey how I make the pain improve

[Chorus: King Louie]
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This the cray-ist shit in the club
Since "In Da Club"
It's so packed, I might ride around on my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club
She say, "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I say, "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evenin' end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin' close to him
Yeezus just rose again

[Chorus: King Louie]
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down

[Outro: Beenie Man]
Memories don't leave like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have
Memories don't leave like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Here we are
Just us
I know you want from the first time you seen me in the movie
Hanging on the shoulder of a villain
She could flatten a village
You know I'm usually chilling out with Bruce Willis
Somehow, you and my man met first
I was still stealing the money outta my gram-gram's purse
But you were
Running the streets, letting the blam-blam work
Back then we smoked nickels of dirt
Nowadays it ain't shit to drop a grip on dessert
And you wanna tell the feds about some shit and it hurts
Fuck it, so be it, you 'bout to know Jesus
Turn this motherfucker back into a fetus
Phone's tapped so speak Swedish when you call the crib
Rich forever motherfucker I was born to live
Die happy, knowing that my family's straight
I hope they didn't see the numbers on that Camry plate
I been a grown man since I had a baby dick
These motherfuckers ain't saying shit
Close my eyes, spray the whip, hit your rib twice
Now your kids gotta deal with this shit 'cause this is life

[Outro: Big Body Bes]
Yeah, and I'm fucking here now
It's fucking Body
What the fuck I'm doing?
Whole bunch a shit
I'm out there wilding
Got a fucking 50-year-old Puerto Rican with me
He don't even know my name
But he gon' stab something for me
He know what time it is
No watch on the wrist
Fuck outta here man
Smack the shit outta you then slap your son five
Your own family loves me more than you
Salute me every time
Every time I come to your fucking crib, it better be a plate wrapped up on the stove motherfucker
'Cause you know I'm coming to eat
Fuck that I don't even want firsts, I want my seconds first
That's right, I eat right out the motherfucking pot
Fuck a spoon, I been eating hand to hand my whole life
I motivate myself motherfucker
Anytime I need to think about some shit man
I just go back and close my motherfucking eyes man
And go back to the sorrow
Fuck outta here man
My whole life is a fucking discography, B
You stupid? Quadruple platinum
Oops, what's that? Another one

You know I'm mobbin' with the D-oh-double-G

[Verse 2]
Straight off the killer streets of CPT
King of the beats, you ride to 'em in your fleet wood (Fleet wood)
Or Coupe DeVille rollin' on dubs
How you feel? Whoopty-whoop, what?
Dre and Snoop gettin' 

[?] in the 'Lac (In the 'Lac)
With Doc in the back, sippin' on 'gnac
Clippin' on the strap, dippin' through hoods
(What hoods?) Compton, Long Beach, Inglewood
South Central out to the Westside (Westside)
It's California love, this California bud got your boy a 

[?] of pub
I'm on one, I might bail up in the Century Club
With my jeans on and my team's strong
Get my drink on and my smoke on
Then go home with somethin' to poke on (What's up, Dre?)
Loc', it's on for the two-triple-oh
Comin' real, it's the next episode

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Peel the top off the can of Pellegrino
Lost my money at the tables, but I got it back in Cee-lo
I'm trying to have the bank account with all the Zero's
Rolling Camaros, Jose Canseco was my hero
Swing the bat like I swing the 'Lac
Snap my fingers and they bring the crab
Wave my hand and they bring the bag
For your body motherfucker cause you old news
And then you see me fucking skip away in boat shoes
Ri-ri-ri-ri-ri-ri-ri-ri-ri- rip your dick off
Ahh uhhh! Motherfucker I'm a sicko
Fucko, amethyst on the knuckle
On the arm, something Spanish with a bubble

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Uh, it's big trouble in Little China
All of the china hidden inside of a big vergina
Uh, I'll pile drive her through the bed
Hit the strip, get my motherfucking bread, don't you say a word, bitch
I need the gators just to match the vest
Have my apprentice put the stainless to a bastard's chest
Come out the sweatsuit
Do a triple back flip into the red coupe
Skrrrt, we out

[Verse 2]
Come...hold my dick while I take a piss
Shake it off, put it back in my boxer shorts
Ride in the drop top lobster Porsche
Inside the joint I got some pasta sauce
Uh, stalking the street, just to put the fork in the beef
Coffins are cheap, seats are very soft in the Jeep
The lights hit me at the club, my skin was like a chicken
And now my leather to the ankle by my Pippen
This feels crazy and I hoping I don't blow it
That goes to show I'm still a human under all this glow
Needless to say I'm exceeding while you pussies bleeding
I guess your weight was not in season
Breezing

[Hook]

[Intro]
It's always me, yeah, uh!
Yeah, beautiful, magnifique, straight up, ah-ha

[Chorus]
No time for struggle 'cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away
No time for struggle 'cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away

[Bridge]
It's a proven fact money make the world go round
And a couple sweet words'll make your girl go down
On the whole team 'cause you weren't taking care of business
See me in a Bimmer, see you in a Civic, uh

[Chorus]
No time for struggle 'cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away
No time for struggle 'cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away

[Verse 1]
When I step up in the party, yes I'm letting my nuts hang
Tryna fuck a groupie bitch right on the hood of the Mustang
From a place where they bust things, hailing from Flushing
Peace to Bloodstain, Beamer custame
On a California king where the thug lay (that's word to me man)
The joint longer than Mutombo finger, my features etch
Shorty sniffin' lines like a sketch
Tell her that I need my slippers fetched
I need a wifey tongue longer than Kakey
Shoot the gun right when I whistle, plus she never will snake me
Do a split on my dick
If I'm sick she'll even clean me if I shit in my pants
So I'm taking her to France with me

[Chorus]
No time for struggle 'cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away
No time for struggle 'cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away

[Verse 2]
Doing math like an Asian student
I've been a truant, three language fluent
Blueish on the Buick
Reddish on the hue of the cheeks on my booby
Her body smoking like a dooby
The joint rolled like a croissant, mad butter
Golden brown
If I end up in the can then who gon' hold me down?
Probably no one
They like it when you hot, when you not
They tell you eat a cock off the springboard I dive into the drop
Gold watch, like I just retired
No socks in the loafer cause it's tacky
At least I'm not up in Pataki's
You catch me higher than a Shaq knee
See me swerving side to side like Mutombo finger
The bundle bringer, guns are subtle
Hear them clapping like the end of the huddle
I might be big as a bear, but nothing to cuddle
Hop in the shuttle, land in Russia, yo

[Chorus]
No time for struggle 'cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away
No time for struggle 'cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away

[Bridge]
It's a proven fact money make the world go round
And a couple sweet words'll make your girl go down
On the whole team 'cause you weren't taking care of business
See me in a Bimmer, see you in a Civic

[Chorus]
No time for struggle 'cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away
No time for struggle 'cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away

[Outro: Action Bronson & Big Body Bes]
Oh man, would you tell these motherfuckers what it is please?
I gotta tell them what it is?
Yeah, I'm asking you to do me that favor
Wilding the street that's what I'm about
What kind of bitch you like?
Man, a bitch with a case on her record..
Okay
I need a bitch that's nice with knives..
Hahaa!
I need a fucking -- Yo..
Yo
.. yo man, on some real, put that weed back
How many dope fiends you've been locked up with, son?
Yo put that put that back put that back
How many dope fiends you've been locked up with?
Put that back, put it back, put it back, I mean it
How many dope fiends have you been locked up with?
I've been locked up with the most wildest bucking dopeheads, wild enough, don't even know they do dope
"Hello I Love Bass Music and everyone who is talking about this photo... so. here is how and why this happened. Capital FM made us do this show with a backing track playing but allowed the vocalists to sing. They said that they had to trigger the tracks themselves to sync visuals. We pleaded with them for weeks and weeks to let us play fully live or at least let us mix but they just weren't having it. You will also notice this was the same for a lot of the dance acts playing that day (i.e. the duke dumont pic you posted)

Notice also that we didn't try and make it look like we were mixing. We left the fucking plug on the floor on purpose, didn't even plug phono leads into the master out, turned all the EQs fully down and the master out AND DIDNT EVEN TAKE HEADPHONES for god sake!! LOL if at any point we touched the mixer it was...well, you try standing infront of 80,000 people and not touching the mixer... go on... its really hard hahaha!

I would also like to point out that people like David Guetta ect who have also been accused of pretending to mix, actually try and cover it up and pretend to blend tracks into one another and hide it... but with us, we played three songs with vocalists b2b with gaps in between, so even if we had been mixing, there would have been no beat matching involved anyway + we didn't try and hide it at all!!

But yeah it was a very strange experience and one we will not be going through again. Capital have been amazing to us and they play our songs roughly 400 times a week across their various networks and we wanted to thank them for all the support.

Guy x"

[Hook]
Baby my ride so clean, I ride so dirty
I'm about to buy an alligator for my birthday
My girl asking me, "Where you been?", don't worry
She said, "Baby I crashed the Benz", don't worry
I ride so clean, my ride so dirty
I'm about to buy a fucking Lion for my birthday
My girl asking me, "Where I been?" don't worry
She said, "Baby, I crashed the Benz", don't worry

[Verse 1]
Dropkicks out the drop-top 6
Don't make your fucking kid become a hostage, I got this
Stay in the water like the Loch Ness
Shirtless rocking a locket
Drugs in my pocket
It's all for a profit
Aim it and pop it, drive in a range in my boxers
Lay in the tropics, my girl pussy red like a lobster
Orgies at Hofstra
My bank account is like a Polish doctor
My heart is cold, I sing a soldiers opera
My drugs as strong as Arnold
They found her dead in the gold Impala
Hanging backwards out the chopper
The room smell like Nag Champa
Most my crew a bunch of armed robbers

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I rhyme sick like I play with shit
I've driven every flavored whip there is to get
Feel like I dip that cigarette in wet stuff
I should be on that Sped Ed bus, layin' on the bed with a red head slut
These mother fuckers praying that I don't make it
I'm on the balcony stoned and naked playing Sega
Prince of Albania
No money, nothing to say to ya
I push the limo to the stadium
Game 7, Knicks-Heat
Me and Spike had to switch seats
Cause he kept spilling Henny all on my bitch feet
Expensive bracelets where my forearms and my fists meet
Down in Mexico eating chilis

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
No emotions, lotions on the bed sheets
I saw her walking cause I'm stalking on the dead streets
Trying to purchase where the shoulders and the head meet
She had a tight pink dress, her pussy was a weapon
Said she was a daughter of a Reverend
Well, thank god I don't believe in heaven
Butt cheeks sculpted like a horse's hind
Shit man, I think that I just crossed the line
Annual abortion time
Yeah, she got the tat straight from West 4th
Hereditary cancer almost took her breast off
And over 6 months she said she had a chest cough
Well I'm not a doctor, but I know that's not a good sign
Matter of time 'til she placed and laced in a wood pine
For years she was the hood slime
Now no longer having a good time
Under earth, she burst into a sudden birth
Oh shit, the facial of my cousin Murph
Strange occurrences, alignment with the sun and earth, yeah
As baby turtles break the sand just to figure out the meaning
Instinctively they heading towards the water cause they need it
Forever cycles stay the same, they feel it like a fiend's wrist
Mustard straight from Russia that they brought in on a steam ship
My mustache like a Colonel
Take a haters facial and I treat it like a urinal
A bit disturbed, confessions in a journal
I'm sickened by my thoughts so it's tossed in the inferno

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Uh-huh, yeah, yo
Cash in a brief case, trying to play it smart
Love is a privilege and you better play your part
Don't wanna leave it to the lawyers breath
Snap my fingers, you'll be laying on the foyer steps
Wishing you were a boy again
Late night stand on the roof, smoke a newp
Reminiscing when I had the broken tooth, we were loose
Three different colors on the goose with the boots
Maryland College basketball suits
I drive the 525 made in '95
Shawn Kemps on the pedal, I'm a kamikaze
Right arm hang out the window while I steer left
Near death, slam into a deer's chest
Lights out for a second, but I'm back
Hopped up like a karate master
Still I blast the shottie faster on you bastards, make you backspin
Come out the closet you've been trapped in, that's it
Queens

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Yeah, nigga you know I put the work in
Head shots real precise like a surgeon
I see your heart beating through your shirt, nervous
Nigga shaking in his J's, his legs gave in
Wow, and I ain't even pull the gun off my waist yet
This nigga done got so scared he took a shit
Then I swerved in some low key wheels
And go about my business like it never happened, chill
For reals, pop a couple pills
Cup a drink, come to think about it I feels
Like turning up the rap, ignorant, loud
Like this weed that I smoke, make a thick, yellow cloud
Perpetual payday, my money don't vacay
I'm out seeing the world, my life is so crazy
You could only imagine
But you could never fathom my intelligence, I get at em

[Interlude: Raekwon]
Oh shit, it's real like that, right y'all?
Word up man, pledge allegiance man

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
I Patrick Ewing niggas, long shotties I be 'suing niggas
You gon' pay, face the camera ruin niggas
And my money, I'm collecting and I'm stepping
Might slap the shit out your man and take his weapon
Hungry and angry and I'm savagery, but still
More your majesty, wipe out the cool t-shirt, vacuum it
And I'm gon' keep you rich, so chill
Or you can live with them faggots and stay away from real deal abbots
Death is our game plan, new playing bullets
Come in spray cans, write graffiti all on your vest
Lester, cousin Eve sleeve all greasy
He the best of it, put it right there, you get a check
Slang prostitution, it's prohibition
When we move shit, this is what some niggas suggest
I suggest war, and clout the fake niggas
They could move out, take no chance, you never know, ya'll

[Outro: Raekwon]
For real man, cause we ain't playing no games no more, no more homies
You sit around this, you sit around the best
With gold forks and all that, word up
Y'all niggas that come shine, come through come through come shine, come
You know what it is man, it's automatic

[Intro]
Ahem

Didn't I tell you;

Didn't I tell you? Didn't I say that?
Didn't I tell you;

[Verse]
So, I'm the fool, you could make it
Don't wanna be alone and naked
Be a shame with this own, or wasted
Ooh

[Chorus 3]
High up on high, high up on climax
High up on you, high up on you-should-spend-the-night
I'mma go to bed, high up on—high up on we
High up on—high up on—high up on—

'Kay, bye

[Intro]
High, hi-high
High, hi-high, oh
High, hi-high
High, hi-high, oh
(Can't get this shit open)

[Verse 1]
Pain reliever, fever reducer
Ten to the head, does that make me a loser?
I took nine shots of that fifth
Gone, gone, gone
Eight hits of that spliff
Gone, I got
Seven reasons why I'm not sure of six things
On my mind and I'm comin' off this high five
Comin' off this high-igh-igh five

[Chorus]
Feel me for nothing
Don't even love me for me
Love me for nothing
Don't even love me for free

[Verse 2]
Second verse, on my third beer
Kill all these voices that I feel I hear
Mob to the bride, I'm (keep, keep, keep)
Keeping the faith
I'm holding the fight, a hell of a night
It's a hell of a night

[Chorus]
Feel me for nothing
Don't even love me for me
Love me for nothing
Don't even love me for free

[Verse 3]
Only when I'm alone
Only when I was on one, one
(One, one, one, one)
Live like I'm living today, live like today was my last one, one
(One, one, one, one)

[Bridge]
Falling from this high-igh-igh five
(Falling falling, falling falling)
From this high-igh-igh-igh
(One, one, one, one) oh

[Chorus]
Feel me for nothing
Don't even love me for me
Love me for nothing
Don't even love me for free

[Outro]
All that I pray
I pray when I die, I die real
All that I pray
I pray when I die, I die real
(I know, But I prefer my eyes low)

[INTRO]
"From now on, that'll be, like, our little thing, like you're, like, a little version of me. I'm carrying you around like-- like in a papoose. It would be amazing."

[Hook]
I’m so official, all I need is a whistle
I’m so official, all I need is a whistle
I’m so official, all I need is a whistle
All I need is a whistle
All I need is a whistle


Said I’m so official, all I need is a whistle
I stole that line from Wheezy and Lil’ Drizzle
And yes, it’s the nigga with the Care Bear kizzles
And fuck what’chu heard, I don’t even care a little
It’s the B to the izzle, niggas can’t see me
Fresh like a baby
Sick like a preemie
Girls double team me - blow me in the parking lot
I used to get fucked over and now I only fuck a lot
I love being nerdy, these niggas shop at Wal-Mart
I shop so I mall cop, call a nigga Paul Blart
I’ma have a drug fart, meaning that my shit’s dope
Nigga in a bow-tie - that’s my fuckin’ kinfolk
Girls used to say, “Nope!” - like they watch P&R
Now they say yes because I’m on before P&R
Yes, my European car speaks for itself
I don’t wear that fuckin’ jewelry, it’s bad for your health
See, where I come from, they would hit you where you’re walkin’
Rip your fuckin’ chain off, leave you in a coffin
Stay Stone Mountain
Nigga, where my hood at?
Niggas say, “You it!” when you drinkin’ with a hoodrat
Boy, the beat’s so sick, thank you mc DJ!
Chillin’ on my sofa watchin’ Venture Bros. Blu-rays
Niggas gettin’ mad because I’m flyer than a Blue Jay
Rappin’ and on tv like a nigga LL Cool J
Call you on a Tuesday, fuck you like it’s Friday
I don’t run no drains, bitch, call my shit the highway
Blacker than Mugabe, Whiter than the album
I guess I’m in the middle, so call a nigga Malcolm
You don’t need to help him
DIY - do it yourself, nigga don’t try
“Please, just do it!” The girl sound Nike
Guess that’s the reason why these niggas don’t like me
Girls I don’t know give my penis oral hygiene
My dick plays the field like my dick won a Heisman
Niggas talkin’ shit and that shit don’t surprise me
And I’m so official, got a badge and a nightstick

["Only one question remains, Eric. Why'd you do it?
- I'll bet you he gets his kicks giving old ladies the heebie-jeebies
- Hell, no. I wanted to see if it felt like pussy!"]

[Hook]

Said I’m so official, all I need is a whistle
Nigga blew up and he didn’t need a missile
“He tryin’ too hard.” Homie, this my hobby!
I do this on vacation, rappin’ is my golfin’
Young Young Hova, lil’ Lil’ Wheezy
Dress the turd up slutty, make the shit look easy, uh
I’m the choreographer -
‘cause I’m making moves and you niggas just follow ‘em, uh!
Elroy made a funny on you slow ones
Yes, my name is Childish, but you guys are children
How’s it fucking feel man, being so on fire?
Stepping on these short guys like I’m in The Shire
I am slow Orlando, oops, late bloomer
Money comes quick, but the girls come sooner
Opposite gay victim, meaning straight shooter
I’m fuckin’ in yo redneck, I’m diggin’ in your cooter, yes
Who told them I was so dope?
Rapping’s a religion, and nigga I’m the provost
I don’t even know those other guys telling me they know my little cousin Lindsay
Nigga, I’m busy
Um, that’s it though, angry like a pitbull
Talkin’ like it’s hard work. Nigga, this is simple
Shout out to black nerds, shout out to white ones
Shout out to Asians, keep playin’ Street Fighter
Shout out to nerd chicks in glasses, sweeter than cinnamon
Me and Sick Boi are synonyms
People hear my voice and say, “What happened to Eminem?!
This shit is absurd! He’s saying the n-word!”
Naw, it’s just Bam-B. The nigga that’s crazy for giving shit free
And fuck iTunes, I’m doin’ it OG
And girls love my dick like a song that’s on Glee
Nigga, call me Elroy - because I’m so high
That you cannot measure, I’m losing cabin pressure
Got drive like a brand new Volvo
I’m so official, I’m the Foot Locker logo, nigga
If you ever see somebody next to me, know that they're better than me at something

So -- bars. Bars

So it's really good to have this event tonight which we decided instantaneously, the way we put this shit together, y'all comin' out here tonight vibin' with us. In the way this whole albums put together. The amount of producers that came together for it and the way we worked on this shit really collectively, collaboratively. We didn't give a fuck about what nobody else said outside lookin' in, anything. We just wanted to make the best product possible. And this is just the beginning of an entirely new mentality of how to make music directed for the people. What I said last night is like, we drop this shit June 18th. This ain't about waitin' until August and havin' some big this and that. It's about deliverin' some shit for y'all to go to work to, ride to, listen to while y'all workin' out and shit. Whatever y'all doin' to provide a soundtrack for this shit that's gon' come out. We gon' keep on doin' this shit over and over and over. Makin' shit for my core, my cut

With the creative director Matt Williams and Virgil Abloh, the whole team, Don C, Ibn, all the Been Trill family, and the combination of all the people we brought together from Daft Punk workin' like 3-4 joints on the album. The first joint "Onsite", "I Am A God", bless me, and Mike Dean. Travis Scott workin' on the album, Hudson Mohawke, Arca. And of course, at the end, last -- wait a second, am I forgettin' some people and shit?

Last, but not last, that came and helped bring this whole shit together, the executive producer of this LP and the family, is Rick Rubin comin' in and finishing up the whole shit for us. Which is legendary because everything we did on this project, everything I get like when we release 'Numbers on the Boards", from the video to the "NO ARTWORK" to the sound of the song and everything. I was like, "What would Rick Rubin do? What was his Def Jam shit that they were doing?" Because I remember like Ricky would say, "When we did Def Jam, we wasn't really feelin' like we was in competition with nobody, cause this shit was so direct." Where we at right now? We in the middle of the city right now, over into the motherfuckin' streets and nobody shuttin' down shit while we makin' real music and yall vibin out to this shit.. So it's good for me to go to the God, Rick Rubin, and play him my shit. Ask him questions and allow him to take this project to an entirely new level and he made a lot of great decisions at the end and brought it to a whole new level. And I wanted to explain something about the title Yeezus

Simply put: West was my slave name and Yeezus is my god name

[JC] When your debut album,  “The College Dropout” came out, the thing that people began to associate with you besides music was: Here’s someone who’s going to argue for his place in history; like, “Why am I not getting five stars?”

[KW] I think you got to make your case. Seventh grade, I wanted to be on the basketball team. I didn’t get on the team, so that summer I practiced. I was on the summer league. My team won the championship; I was the point guard. And then when I went for eighth grade, I practiced and I hit every free throw, every layup, and the next day I looked on this chart, and my name wasn’t on it. I asked the coach what’s up, and they were like, “You’re just not on it.” I was like, “But I hit every shot.” The next year — I was on the junior team when I was a freshman, that’s how good I was. But I wasn’t on my eighth-grade team, because some coach — some Grammy, some reviewer, some fashion person, some blah blah blah — they’re all the same as that coach. Where I didn’t feel that I had a position in eighth grade to scream and say, “Because I hit every one of my shots, I deserve to be on this team!” I’m letting it out on everybody who doesn’t want to give me my credit.

[JC] And you know you hit your shots.

[KW] Yeah — you put me on the team. So I’m going to use my platform to tell people that they’re not being fair. Anytime I’ve had a big thing that’s ever pierced and cut across the Internet, it was a fight for justice. Justice. And when you say justice, it doesn’t have to be war. Justice could just be clearing a path for people to dream properly. It could be clearing a path to make it fair within the arena that I play. You know, if Michael Jordan can scream at the refs, me as Kanye West, as the Michael Jordan of music, can go and say, “This is wrong.”

[JC] You’ve won a lot of Grammys.

[KW]“

[My Beautiful] Dark 

[Twisted] Fantasy” and “Watch the Throne”: neither was nominated for Album of the Year, and I made both of those in one year. I don’t know if this is statistically right, but I’m assuming I have the most Grammys of anyone my age, but I haven’t won one against a white person.

But the thing is, I don’t care about the Grammys; I just would like for the statistics to be more accurate.

[JC] You want the historical record to be right.

[KW] Yeah, I don’t want them to rewrite history right in front of us. At least, not on my clock. I really appreciate the moments that I was able to win rap album of the year or whatever. But after a while, it’s like: “Wait a second; this isn’t fair. This is a setup.” I remember when both Gnarls Barkley and Justin 

[Timberlake] lost for Album of the Year, and I looked at Justin, and I was like: “Do you want me to go onstage for you? You know, do you want me to fight” —

[JC] For you.

[KW] For what’s right. I am so credible and so influential and so relevant that I will change things. So when the next little girl that wants to be, you know, a musician and give up her anonymity and her voice to express her talent and bring something special to the world, and it’s time for us to roll out and say, “Did this person have the biggest thing of the year?” — that thing is more fair because I was there.

[JC] But has that instinct led you astray? Like the Taylor Swift interruption at the MTV Video Music Awards, things like that.

[KW] It’s only led me to complete awesomeness at all times. It’s only led me to awesome truth and awesomeness. Beauty, truth, awesomeness. That’s all it is.

[JC] So no regrets?

[KW] I don’t have one regret.

[JC] Do you believe in the concept of regret?

[KW] If anyone’s reading this waiting for some type of full-on, flat apology for anything, they should just stop reading right now.

[JC] But that is something that you apologized for.

[KW] Yeah, I think that I have like, faltered, you know, as a human. My message isn’t perfectly defined. I have, as a human being, fallen to peer pressure.

...

[JC] That’s fascinating, to look at that record through that lens.

[KW] I don’t have some type of romantic relationship with the public. I’m like, the anti-celebrity, and my music comes from a place of being anti. That was the album where I gave people what they wanted. I don’t think that at that point, with my relationship with the public and with skeptical buyers, that I could’ve done “Black Skinhead” 

[from “Yeezus]

[JC] Does that make “Dark Fantasy” a dishonest album in some way?

[KW] It’s always going to be 80 percent, at least, what I want to give, and 20 percent fulfilling a perception. If you walk into an old man’s house, they’re not giving nothing. They’re at 100 percent exactly what they want to do. I would hear stories about Steve Jobs and feel like he was at 100 percent exactly what he wanted to do, but I’m sure even a Steve Jobs has compromised. Even a Rick Owens has compromised. You know, even a Kanye West has compromised. Sometimes you don’t even know when you’re being compromised till after the fact, and that’s what you regret.
I don’t want to come off dissing “Dark Fantasy.” It’s me never being satisfied and then me coming and admitting and saying the truth. As much as I can air things out for other people, to air things out for myself, to say, “I feel like this could’ve been stronger.”

...

[JC] Even though you had always wanted to be out in front, was there ever a point where you valued your anonymity?

[KW] Yeah, I held on to the last moments of it. I knew when I wrote the line “light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson” 

[from the song “Slow Jamz"] I was going to be a big star. At the time, they used to have the Virgin music 

[stores], and I would go there and just go up the escalator and say to myself, “I’m soaking in these last moments of anonymity.” I knew I was going to make it this far; I knew that this was going to happen.

[JC] But producting happened for you first, especially after Jay-Z used you so heavily on “The Blueprint.”

[KW] I used to have tracks that sounded like Timbaland; I had tracks that sounded like 

[DJ Premier]. But Jay-Z was an amazing communicator that made the soul sound extremely popular. And because I could make the soul sound in my sleep, it finally gave me a platform to put the message that my parents put inside of me and that Dead Prez helped to get out of me and Mos Def and 

[Talib] Kweli, they helped to get out of me: I was able to put it, sloppily rap it, on top of the platform that Jay-Z had created for me.

Before, when I wanted to rap, my raps sounded like a bit like Cam’ron; they sounded a bit like Mase; they sounded a bit like Jay-Z or whoever. And it wasn’t until I hung out with Dead Prez and understood how to make, you know, raps with a message sound cool that I was able to just write “All Falls Down” in 15 minutes.

[JC] Is that true?

[KW] Yeah, that’s how I discovered my style. I was just hanging out with them all the time in New York. I would produce for them. You know, I was able to slip past everything with a pink polo, but I am Dead Prez. And now, because I was able to slip past, I have a responsibility at all times.

[JC] What were the things that you were trying to do on “Late Registration” that you either did not or could not yet do on “Dropout”?

[KW] I was trying to do different things with orchestras. It was just a vibe that I was trying to get at, a sound I was trying to mix with hip-hop to try to see how far I could expand it. I guess that was a Chicago thing, like Quincy Jones.

[JC] But you came here, you worked with Jon Brion 

[the Fiona Apple producer].

[KW] I really liked the sound of some projects that Jon Brion had worked on. I was always considered this crazy hothead kid, but I would always just go and just really break bread with someone who I respected. I will completely bow to anybody I respect.

[JC] That era also includes what I find probably the most moving thing that you’ve ever done, which is calling out President Bush at the Hurricane Katrina telethon. To me, that moment is actually the peak of putting a message in a pop format, even though it’s not a song.

[KW] Yeah. I guess it’s a very pop moment of a lifetime or generation. I mean, my dad’s generation is a generation of messaging, you know? But that’s just a piece of me being the opinionated individual that I am.

[JC] Were you conscious that that’s what you were doing, or was it totally just instinct?

[KW] Yeah, it was pretty bugged out. When you think about it, I was wearing like, a Juicy Couture men’s polo shirt. We weren’t there, like, ready for war.

...

[JC] You look at Jay or Diddy, and I’d say like, 90 percent of the time, you think they’re having a good time. With you, I would say, I don’t know, 50-50 maybe? Or 30-70?

[KW] Maybe 90 percent of the time it looks like I’m not having a good time.

[JC] But you’re in a very public relationship, a seemingly long and satisfying relationship: you’re about to have a child.

[KW] Any woman that you’re in love with or that loves you is going to command a certain amount of, you know, energy. It’s actually easier to focus, in some ways.

[JC] When you’re uncertain about love, it can be such a distraction. It infects all the other areas.

[KW] Yeah, that’s what I mean when I say like, “Yo, I’m going to be super Zenned out like, five years from now.” I’m the type of rock star that likes to have a girlfriend, you know? I’m the type of soul that likes to be in love and likes to be able to focus. And that inspires me.

[JC] On “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” there’s a really affectionate scene where you go and help Kim sort through her clothes.

[KW] That was from a place of love. It’s hard when people read things in a lot of different ways. You know, the amount of backlash I got from it is when I decided to not be on the show anymore. And it’s not that I have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the amount of backlash that I get. Because I just see like, an amazing person that I’m in love with that I want to help.

...

[JC] One of the things I thought when I heard the new record was, “This is the anti-'College Dropout.’ ” It feels like you’re shedding skin. Back then, you were like: “I want more sounds. I want more complicated raps. I want all the things.” At what point did that change?

[KW] Architecture — you know, this one Corbusier lamp was like, my greatest inspiration. I lived in Paris in this loft space and recorded in my living room, and it just had the worst acoustics possible, but also the songs had to be super simple, because if you turned up some complicated sound and a track with too much bass, it’s not going to work in that space. This is earlier this year. I would go to museums and just like, the Louvre would have a furniture exhibit, and I visited it like, five times, even privately. And I would go see actual Corbusier homes in real life and just talk about, you know, why did they design it? They did like, the biggest glass panes that had ever been done. Like I say, I’m a minimalist in a rapper’s body. It’s cool to bring all those vibes and then eventually come back to Rick 

[Rubin], because I would always think about Def Jam.

[JC] His records did used to say “reduced by Rick Rubin.”

[KW] For him, it’s really just inside of him. I’m still just a kid learning about minimalism, and he’s a master of it. It’s just really such a blessing, to be able to work with him. I want to say that after working with Rick, it humbled me to realize why I hadn’t — even though I produced “Watch the Throne”; even though I produced “Dark Fantasy” — why I hadn’t won Album of the Year yet.

This album is moments that I haven’t done before, like just my voice and drums. What people call a rant — but put it next to just a drumbeat, and it cuts to the level of, like, Run-D.M.C. or KRS-One. The last record I can remember — and I’m going to name records that you’ll think are cheesy — but like, J-Kwon, “Tipsy.” People would think that’s like a lower-quality, less intellectual form of hip-hop, but that’s always my No. 1. There’s no opera sounds on this new album, you know what I mean? It’s just like, super low-bit. I’m still, like, slightly a snob, but I completely removed my snob heaven songs; I just removed them altogether.

[Intro]
I mean it's pain, for real
I mean, I fuck up some times, you fuck up some times
The problem with these niggas is they too busy tryna make it go down

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Uh, ridin' in the whip 'cause a nigga 'bout to come in your crib

Know you like that, you ain't wanna fight back
Wanna do a Mike Jack, wanna do it

Girl, when I land, time span, we'll be right to it
It ain't no need for time wastin'
We both got needs and I'm waitin' (For what we both want)
Everything's been up and down, it's up and down
And every time I come around, we fuck around
Shit, are we in fuckin' love or fucked around?
'Cause I just need to know
Every time a nigga in it for the minute, mama get up in it
Now I'm tryna hit it for the moment, now I got this Henny, sippin'
And I'm zonin', and I'm tryna smoke another one
Is you tryna go another one?
'Nother round wit' it
Real shit, I'm down wit' it if you down wit' it
Tryna take it from the ceilin' to the ground wit' it, uh
Baby girl, I'm a dog wit' it, you can tell it all when I'm in it

[Chorus]
I'm tryna go up all night
'Cause the way your body dancin'
Got a nigga tryna leave it up to us all night
When we grindin' it, when your body lookin' fine in it
Every time I get all in your walls tonight
I ain't tryna hear excuses, love, this that super love
Let's take the world
Let's take the world
Since I fell in love wit' your body
I've been all on it, girl, and I want it
Since I fell in love wit' your body
I've been all on it, girl, and I want it
Since I fell in love wit' your body
I've been all on it, girl, and I want it

[Intro: Jorma]
Yeah, this beat reminds me of back in the day
Sunshine chillin'
Man, tell 'em about your perfect Saturday

[Verse 1: Jorm, Kiva, and (Ned)]
Woke up at 10, no worries at all
Another sunny day in LA, that’s how we ball
Hit my homie J cuz he rolls the blunts tight
Head’s still spinnin' from the freaks last night
Yeah man, you know I got the sticky for sho'
And five females coming over at 4
I’ma hop in the shower, clean my nuts
Throw on the Polo Sport to impress the stunts
Rolling up in the Charger with the suicide doors
Top down cruising as I head to the store
Jim hats, some brews, everything that we need
Then back to the crib smoking Indo weed
It’s the perfect Saturday, there’s knock on the door
Man, these girls are here early, it’s a quarter to 4
Man, which of these freaks I’ma see in my bed?
Open the door and see my homie Ned
(Oh, hey guys, how’s it going?) What up, Ned?
(I got 911, need to use your head)
That’s a no can do, ooh your breath is all hit
(Yeah, I know, now move, I gotta take a shit)
Now, normally Ned, the bathroom was yours
But we got these fine freaks coming over at 4
(Fine freaks? Okay, new plan
I’ll just hold it and let out small farts for the rest of the night)

[Interlude: Jorm, Kiva, and (Ned)]
Okay, Ned, thanks for stopping by
(You’re welcome)
Seriously, Ned, it was good to see you
(I know)
*Ned's fart noises*
Listen, the freaks are gonna be here any minute
We gotta get rid of this guy
Hey dude, he’s your friend, you should ask him to leave
Listen, if the freaks come here, he cannot be here
(Oh, God)
*Doorbell buzzes, Ned's fart noises continue*
Shit! Ah, one second
What time is it?
It’s 4, it’s them
Who? The freaks?
Yes, get Ned out!

[Verse 2: Jorm, Kiva, and (Ned)]
Ned, you gotta hop out the window
(But we’re on the 5th floor!) Yes, smooth like Indo
(I’m not doing that!) Then hit the bathroom on the double
(The dump's in my butt and your toilets are trouble)
*Doorbell buzzes again, Ned's fart noises continue*

[Interlude: Jorm, Kiva, (Ned), and girls]
(Look, seriously I’ll hold it
I’ve been in this situation literally hundreds of times)
*Large fart noise*
Oh, what the fuck? Oh, no
I’m gonna need to borrow some pants
*Door opens*
Jeremy, we were buzzing, why didn't you...
Oh, hey ladies
Oh, my God, it smells like fucking death in here!
Hey, freaks!
This place smells like shit!
It was them!
We're out of here
Becca, wait!
Oh, you guys blew it

[Verse 2: Jorm and Ned]
Well, that’s too bad but we ain’t mad (You're not?)
No, in fact, we got something to show you
It’s down this hallway, and open up the storeroom
(A surprise?) Yeah, man, something like that
So walk out front and don’t look back
(What’s all this plastic? Were you painting last night?)
Don’t worry about it, just walk towards the light
(It sure is pretty) Yeah sure is
Close your eyes, Ned. (You’re my only friends)
*Ned farts again, a gunshot is heard*

[Outro: Kiva]
Yeah, motherfuckers
You didn't think you were gonna get out of this without a fart joke, did you?
You wack motherfuckers
You pussy motherfuckers
The fuck y'all thinking?
This is Lonely Island!
Oh, cause we got a little paper now
And you see us on the TV
You think we don’t do fart jokes no more?
We were doing fart jokes when you were suckin' your mama’s tit
You fart motherfuckers, fuck y'all
*Fart noise*

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
There's a trap in every hood and all the j's want that good dope
Gucci got that clean cause all the snorters want that real coke
Multimillionaire the real La Flare but I feel broke
10 Million dollar mane but I can't hang with these rich folks
My little boy was only 2 he asked me, "papa, what a roo-poo?"
5 years old closet full of jays; fruit loops
They say Gucci Mane the god of making music people trap to
Drumma Boy the god of making music Gucci snap to
Section 8 apartment and them babies need some fruit loops
Pampers and a bath cause they mamma smoking crack too
How you gone critique me, you industry
I'm in the streets, you out the streets
I murk the streets and murk the beat
I'm Hercules, no murkin' me
Gucci back home making music niggas clap to
He don't never come to the hood unless he have to
Rappin' ass niggas I'mma make my niggas rap you
Its big Gucci, not Bobby V, so ain't no way you jackin' me

[Hook:Gucci Mane]
I ain't really scared of nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
I ain't backin' down for nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
You got teardrops on your face with no bodies

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Red cars with tint on them so niggas looking but can't see
Paved the way for making trap music so street niggas should thank me
Ain't no way you'll out think me
Ain't no way that you could jank me
And all I sending is head shots cause I don't shoot at niggas feet
Niggas better retreat when they see me
On G.P. shoot up the BP
Nigga died with his gun, couldn'a been me
One deep on the street with a street sweep?
Gucci Man, I'mma shoot you in your pee pee
Get you fucked in jail like a fefe
Niggas know about Flocka & Gucci
Naw we ain't beef he sissy
I'm the type to shoot out Peachtree
You the type that wanna' be me
Bullets just fly right by me
These fuck niggas tried to hit me
You scouts don't get no brownies
One shot just hit my Bentley
Another hit my Charger, but it didn't hurt my hemi

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Pariah from society
Addicted to sobriety
A product of a virgin birth
Another god on earth
Yes that's your fantasy

[Verse 2]
You say that you can read my mind
Be careful of what you might find
You think that you can be like me
And see what my eyes see
But you're no friend of mine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Do you believe every word I say?
Make your own truth and get out of my way

[Chorus]
I'm your pariah
For your desire
Ain't no messiah
Just your pariah

[Verse 3]
An angel or the Antichrist
A symbol of your own device
Pathetic in your own sad way
You're just one pill away
From taking my advice

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do you believe every word I say?
Make up your mind and get out of my way

[Chorus]
I'm your pariah
For your desire
Ain't no messiah
Just your pariah

[Bridge]
Do you believe that I'm from Heaven?
That I descended from the sky?
The graven image of a pseudo icon
To worship me on high?

I'm not your savior
I got no wings to fly
Just your pariah
Don't look to me when your life is over

[Chorus]
I'm your pariah
For your desire
Ain't no messiah
Just your pariah

[Outro]
Ain't no messiah
Just your pariah

[Verse 1]
Do you hear the thunder
Raging in the sky?
Premonition of a shattered world
That's gonna die
In the age of reason
How do we survive?
The protocols of evil ravaging
So many lives
So many lives
So many lives

[Verse 2]
Mystifying silence
Talking peace on Earth
We should judge each other for ourselves
Not what we're worth
Sustainable extinction
A fractured human race
A jaded revolution disappears
Without a trace
Without a trace
Without a trace
Alright yeah!

[Bridge]
Always felt that there'd be trouble
Mass distraction hides the truth
Prozac days and sleepless hours
Seeds of change that don’t bear fruit

[Outro]
Oh yeah

These times are heavy
And you're all alone
The battle's over, but the war goes on
Politics, religion, love of money too
It's what the world was built for
But not for me and you, oh yeah
Born in a graveyard adopted by sin
I cultivate evil that’s living within
A preacher tried saving my black damaged soul
Possessed by a demon that had full control

The time it is coming when all life will end
With doomsday approaching to hell we’ll descend
Religion won’t save me, the damage is done
The future has ended before it’s begun

Death’s hand and the crazy, I can’t stand the light of day
Watching all the victims on their knees as they pray
God of the almighty never answers their call
Satan is just waiting for the righteous to fall to him

I don’t mind dying cause I’m already dead
Pray not for the living I’ll live in your head
Dying is easy it’s living that’s hard
I’m losing the battle between Satan and God

[Verse 1]
A childhood innocence was drowned in your tears
The demons that you fought are feeding your fears
The poisoned secrets of your life stand revealed
The truth destroys you it's no longer concealed

[Chorus 1]
Dear Father, forsaken
You knew what you were doing
In silence, your violence
Has left my life in ruin, yeah

[Post-Chorus 1]
In ruin, yeah

[Verse 2]
You preyed upon my flesh then prayed for my soul
Belief betrayed by lust, the faith that you stole
Indoctrination by a twisted desire
The catechism of an evil messiah

[Chorus 2]
Dear Father, forgive me
I know just what I'm doing
In silence, this violence
Will leave your life in ruin, yeah

[Post-Chorus 1]
In ruin, yeah

[Bridge]
Preacher of theocracy
Hiding your hypocrisy
Under a false sanctity
Holy phony empathy
You have taken my life
Now it's your turn to die

Can you sleep at night?
When you close your eyes
Do you think of all the pain from your lies?
Or do you deny, you're responsible
For the victims of the sins you devised?
What you gonna tell them, when they ask you well then?
Is your conscience pure in your heart?
There is no exemption when you seek redemption
For all the lives that you've torn apart!

[Verse 3]
Your molestations of the cross you defiled
A man once holy, now despised and reviled
You took possession while confessing my sins
And now you have to face whatever death brings, yeah!

[Chorus 1]
Dear Father, forsaken
You knew what you were doing
In silence, your violence
Has left my life in ruin, yeah

[Post-Chorus 2]
In ruin, yeah, yeah, yeah
In ruin, yeah

[Outro: Rain and Bells Chiming]

[Verse 1]
The epidemic from a crystal lie
Puts you in super over drive
The methademic that is so hard to hide
Insanely staring with wide eyes

[Verse 2]
Hallucinating in a chemical Hell
Ain't my idea of having fun
Synthetic overload, you're under its spell
Your super nightmare's just begun

[Chorus 1]
You try to stop, but it controls you
Your love affair with it won't last
You're on a suicidal ride of self-destruction
And in the end you're gonna crash

[Post-Chorus]
You live too fast
You live too fast

[Bridge]
You look just like a dead man alive
Losing the fight for survival
You sit and wait at Hell's fiery gate
Waiting the Devil's arrival, hahaha

[Chorus 2]
You live so fast, you need more methademic crystal
You never sleep, you just keep goin'
Just push the trigger on your hypodermic pistol
Each time you're dying without knowing

[Post-Chorus]
You live too fast
You live too fast

[Outro]
What's the point, it's killing you without you even knowing
I can tell you've sold your soul and Hell is where you're going
Hahaha
I'll see you there
I wish somebody would empty my head
I am so sorry for the things that I've said
This hopeless feeling that's living inside
I'm just a lonely soul who's trying to find
Some peace of mind

I ain't no hero who's gonna save you
I just say "hi" as I'm passing right through
I ain't that crazy, I'm only here for the ride
So please forgive me while I'm trying to find
Some peace of mind

Read in between the lines
Truth that is neither black nor white
Black nor white
Just give me something real
Broken man still searching for the light
In the night

Caught In the middle as the front line falls
It looks like I don't stand a chance
If only I could turn my life around
Or is this just the circumstance

[Intro: Andy & Jorma]
Ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of New York
Good morning
It's been brought to my attention that many rap artists claim they run New York
But this is not the case
In fact, I wrote my own song about what it's really like
Please excuse the profanity in advance
Hit it
I run New York!

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & (Andy)]
New York, big city of dreams
And you know that I run this town (I run it!)
The king of the streets, dressed in concrete
Skyscrapers on my crown (I'm the king!)
So if you want this Big Apple
Come try to take a bite (C'mon!)
Cause I run this motherfucking city
And I won't give it up without a fight

[Verse 1: Andy]
Yo, I run New York, it's a pain in the ass
The city's crowded as fuck and it's covered in trash
And the sanitation chief just shoveled shit in my face
Another transit strike? Aw, fucking great
I can't wait
To have another meeting with the labor union
So the mob can bend me over
And then shove their fucking shoe in
But I do it
So you can sip your pumpkin latté
I literally run New York and it's exhausting

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & (Andy)]
I run New York, it's a fuckin' headache
It really wears you down (It sucks!)
In this lake of bureaucratic bullshit
It's a miracle I don't drown

[Verse 2: Andy]
Yo, I double literally run New York: I run the marathon
Plus I organize it, so I double run the marathon
But no one seems to give a fuck that I'm a paragon
Instead, they Photoshop me so it's looking like I wear a thong
And laugh at it in my own office when I'm gone
I went to the Knicks game and they booed me on the Jumbotron
Excuse me for trying to help you
They won't be satisfied 'til I'm locked up in Bellevue
I guess they don't tell you, this job sucks dick
I run New York and it feels like shit

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & (Andy)]
The Chief of Police is a major bully
He laughs at my ideas (He's a jerk!)
He made fun of my tie last week
And I had to fight back tears

[Verse 3: Andy]
Now on the surface, it probably seems like I should quit
'Cause I spend every day getting punched in the dick
But at night, I travel down into the subway
Wearing chainmail, locked and loaded for gunplay
And battle the gigantic fire-breathing mutant rats
If I fucking quit, who the fuck would do that?
I'll give you a hint: the answer is no one
That's why I'm in the sewer dressed up like a shogun
'Cause on the equinox, a Hell Gate springs
Releasing hounds wreathed in the blood of kings
And no one even knows, they just think I'm a dork
But I still kill those fucking dogs, cause I run New York

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & (Andy)]
I run New York, it's a shitty gig
No overtime in my pay (Bullshit!)
I asked this city for a fuckin' bonus
And they said "no fuckin' way" (Unreal!)
So rotten is this Big Apple
It's crawling with worms inside (Come on!)
But I run this motherfucking shithole city
And it makes me wanna die

[Outro: Andy]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I run New York!
Thank you

[Intro]
Is there a prince in this fable
For a small town girl like me?
The good ones are gone or not able
And Matt Damon's not meant for me
Damon's not meant for me

[Verse 1]
I got to say; California
Is a place that I respect
Come on LA, take advantage
Give me a night that I won't forget
I went to look
From the Sky Bar to the Standard, nothing took
These boys don't care
Got a handful with their projects and with their looks

[Chorus]
Where are all the men in this town?
And what's a girl supposed to do?
Did they all run off when they knew
That I was coming 'round, coming 'round?
Where are all the men in this town?
And what's a girl supposed to do?
Did they all run off when they knew
That I was coming 'round, coming 'round?

[Post-Chorus]
Fresh
I'm so fresh, I'm so clean
Got the lips and got the skin
Got the skin, got that thing
I'm so fresh and I'm so-

[Verse 2]
Is there a prince in this fable
For a small town girl like me?
The good ones are gone or not able
And Matt Damon's not meant for me

[Bridge]
I never dreamed that I'd come here to become the next Jolie
But I sure know there is someone
Around somewhere who's meant to be

[Chorus]
Where are all the men in this town?
And what's a girl supposed to do?
Did they all run off when they knew
That I was coming 'round, coming 'round?
Where are all the men in this town?
And what's a girl supposed to do?
Did they all run off when they knew
That I was coming 'round, coming round?

[Post-Chorus]
Fresh
I'm so fresh, I'm so clean
Got the lips and got the skin
Got the skin, got that thing
I'm so fresh and I'm so
Fresh
I'm so fresh, I'm so clean
Got the lips and got the skin
Got the skin, got that thing
I'm so fresh and I'm so-

[Outro]
So they say
It's a suicide, waiting, others say
It's a suicide, waiting, yo no se
It's a suicide waiting, another day
It's a suicide, waiting
So decide, it's a suicide waiting, all this time
It's a suicide waiting, ¿dónde estás?
It's a suicide waiting, so decide
It's a suicide, waiting

[Intro]
Ain't gonna miss you when you're gone
When I did you right, you did me wrong
Ain't gonna miss you when you're gone
Only thing I'm leaving you: alone

By my critique, something's changed
Every time you speak, it sounds deranged
Blessed are the meek
You used to be my girl
Now you're just a freak
That's going back in the world
Ain't gonna miss you when you're gone
Only thing I'm leaving you: alone

Stacking the weeks
Sitting, counting the years
Never been scared of nothing
But you I fear
No more curse, cause you're away
Nothing's worse than talking talk on holy days
Ain't gonna miss you when you're gone

[Interlude]
Ain't gonna miss you when you're gone
Ain't gonna miss you when you're gone

Ain't gonna miss you, never would
I bet you think this song is about you
I give her credit when credit's due
But if it wasn't for me
You'd be a who
Ain't gonna miss you when you're gone
Ain't gonna miss you when you're gone

Last time I checked
Every man is free
Free of each other now
You and me
Speak my name
It's in my soul
Just don't ask you to miss you
When you're gone

[Interlude]

[Rap Break]
Never gonna miss you
Don't you look for me to hit you
Only thing I'm leavin' with you is alone
Nobody wanna kiss you
Where the sun'll never hit you
Better take your Gucci up and be gone
Ain't gonna miss you when you're
Ain't gonna miss you
Never, boo
It really don't matter
Whatever you do
Ain't gonna miss you
Nevermore
Go ?
And your rubber tatas

I'm not, I'm not
Ain't gonna miss you
Ain't gonna miss you when you're gone
When you're gone
Get gone
I don't think you heard me
Gone
Ain't gonna miss you

[Rap Break]

[Outro]
Ain't gonna miss you when you're gone

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress
A marathon grind like I'm runnin' from rest
It's (Five o'clock in the morning)
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death (Uh)
And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress (Yeah)
But I'm goin' hard 'til there's nothin' left under my chest (Haha)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
The streets empty 'round five o'clock (Uh-huh)
Driving by the cops (Chyeah)
Low key microscopic to the eyes that watch (Uh-huh)
Everything a hustle when you trying come buy some guap
I'ma keep grinding 'till I'm shining like a diamond watch (Uh-huh)
Me and Bo-head bringin' you the truth (Truth)
With all night sessions we just living in the booth (Yep)
Strong bars like we spittin' out hundred-fifty proof
Take shots, get loose (Oh), 'til you spittin' up yo' food (Oh), like, "Oh"
You see that? I'ma need a recap
Grab a weed sack, chief that 'til my feet flat
I got this covered like a Pro Bowl D-back
Breathe rap and I been known to make the beat clap (Haha)
Need cash so I'm tryin' move some trees fast
Tell you where the meat at, ask you where the cheese at (Yo)
People 'round the city see the youngin and respect the grind (Oh)
Puttin' in the extra time (Oh), guaranteed next to shine

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress
A marathon grind like I'm runnin' from rest
It's (Five o'clock in the morning)
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress
But I'm goin' hard 'til there's nothin' left under my chest

[Verse 2: Boaz]
I rise before the sun come up and get my day started (Chyeah)
Pray to the most high, I roll up my haze and spark it
And then my paper starts to roll in
Money in paper bags, hammers with laser tags
We grown men
Out on the corner 'till the early morn'
The blood of a hustler getting mines before I was born
You get scorned by these hot-ass bars
From me and Easy Mac
Crusin' in the 'Lac smoking weed with no seeds in that (No seeds)
There ain't no reason that these other rappers hatin' on us (Why?)
Except these labels anticipating and waiting on us
They get the BBS's, radios play us
Then we blaze in the Benz's
And sit this off on BBS's
And from P.A. to Texas
These niggas know about me
International hustler can't move no snow without me
Or get no dough without me
Niggas gettin' they stacking on
Early bird get the worm
I'm out here at the crack of dawn

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress
A marathon grind like I'm runnin' from rest
It's (Five o'clock in the morning)
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress
But I'm goin' hard 'til there's nothin' left under my chest

[Intro]
Killer cars, cars
Killer cars

[Verse 1]
Too hard on the brakes again
What if these brakes just give in?
What if they don't get out of the way?
What if there's someone overtaking?
I'm going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
There could be an idiot on the road
The only kick in life is pumping his steel

[Chorus]
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind and drunk
They won't ever take me alive
'Cause they all drive

[Verse 2]
Don't die on the motorway
The moon would freeze, the plants would die
I couldn't cope if you crashed today
All the things I forgot to say
I'm going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
What if the car loses control?
What if there's someone overtaking?

[Chorus]
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind and drunk
They won't ever take me alive
'Cause they all drive killer cars

[Bridge]
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars

[Chorus]
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind and drunk
No they won't ever take me alive
'Cause they all drive killer cars
They all drive killer cars
They all drive killer cars

[Outro]
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Well I’ve been sitting on this couch
Feeling kinda bored and uninspired

Writing thinly veiled fiction for the soul
And feeling like a liar

I’ve been thinking about you, Laura
And thinking about the songs that you sing

And how you sang with such conviction
I almost forgot they weren’t for me

And I know you’re from another planet
And you’re crazy as a loon
But it’s too cold down here on Earth
To go up on the roof

But I’ll feel a little less alone
When I’m sitting in my room

Writing songs about you
Well I’ve been lying in this bed
Trying once again to find my muse

But if we’re only gonna die
Or worse get middle aged
Then what’s the use?

Still I remember what you said
How it’d be when you were dead and gone

And you are and here I am
Living proof that someone’s world had carried on

And I know you’re from another planet
And you’re crazy as a loon
But it’s too cold down here on Earth
To go up on the roof

But I’ll feel a little less alone
When I’m sitting in my room
Writing songs about you

[Intro]
The wind in the sky
Please gather the clouds
And close the way of the wind
I need to make the beautiful dancer
Like a muse, so I can keep looking at her
Too bad if you forget about me
I have to live with it
We swear by God we will be together forever
Now I'm worried God will take your soul
Because you broke your promise
Like the fire which guards light up to search things
Burns up in the night
And fades into the daylight
Just as my love and thoughts of you
Burn in the night and fade into the sun

[Verse 1]
I know you want your money, girl
'Cause you do this every day, okay
The way you doubt your feelings
And look the other way
Well, it's something I relate to
Your gift of nonchalance
But nobody's ever made me fall in love
With this amount of touch, well

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a fool
I just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)
I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless too
But you taught me how to feel
When nobody ever would
And you taught me how to love
When nobody ever could

[Chorus]
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world
You belong to the world

[Verse 2]
And I know that I'm saying too much
Even though I'd rather hold my tongue, yeah
And I'll pull you closer holding on to
Every moment 'til my time is done, yeah
And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile
In so long, I've succumbed to what I've become, oh baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a fool (I'm not a fool)
I just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)
I'm not a fool, (Oh no) I'm just lifeless too (I'm just lifeless too)
But you taught me how to feel (You taught me how to feel)
When nobody ever would (When nobody ever would)
And you taught me how to love (You taught me how to love)
When nobody ever could (Oh babe, oh babe)

[Chorus]
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you (I know I should leave you)
And learn to mistreat you (And learn to mistreat you)
'Cause you belong to the world (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you (Oh babe, I wanna embrace you)
Domesticate you (Domesticate you)
But you belong to the world (Oh baby)

[Bridge]
You belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the loneliness of filling every need
Oh no, you belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the temporary moments of a dream

[Chorus]
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world, ooh yeah
And ooh girl, I want to embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world

[Outro]
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
R KELLY LYRICS
Send "U Saved Me" Ringtone to your Cell
"U Saved Me"
I was riding in my car one day
In the express lane rollin on the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings then I
Reached down beside me then i look
On the floor felt on the backseat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before i knew it
Here comes this truck now
Doctor said don't think he gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said told me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
Now for ten years i've been straight
You saved me 

[4x]
Gave me a second chance
You saved me 

[3x]
You saved me

Now i've been sitting in this chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone will call
Me with a job opening
Cause it's been so hard for me
Month to month struggling to eat
But still there was no answer
I stop believing in his word and
Got so mad at him and
When somebody said God's good
I just laugh at 'em

But in the nick of time his blessing
Rain on me
By his grace the phone ring
A lady said were hiring and
That's when I knew

You saved me 

[4x]

Now i was 18 out there on the block
Selling drugs
With a gun at my waist
And for people I had no love
See the streets was my home
Family and friends were all gone
Had no one to trust
And deep inside i was all alone
And a deal went bad one day
And it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before i
Knew it I was on my knees
Blood pushin out my body
My heart's beating faster don't know what I'm gonna do
I don't think I'm gonna last then
I begain to flash back on the things
I done in my past
Then I heard a small voice that said
I'll give you peace if you believe
I accepted Christ that day
Halilujah now I'm free

You saved me 

[4x]

I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering
Where did it come from (I got tested)
And the results came back
And the doctor said I'm sorry but u got cancer
I could not beleive it so
I call my mama to calm my nerves

(mama) she got down on her knees
(mama) she said a prayer for me
(mama) just keep on thanking Jesus
(mama) he'll give you what you need
(thank you Jesus)
Now that was five years ago
I don't have that pain no more
Doc said you can go home
Cause all your cancer's gone
You saved me 

[4x]

You saved me (said you saved me)
You saved me (but you saved me)
You saved me saaaved me
Gave me a second chance (second chance)
Halilujah saved me
Saved me saved me
Wooooooh You saved me

You gave me it was by grace You saved me
I'm so thankful that You looked down on me
Saw me standing there
I was at the end of my rope no where to go
And you gave me

No where to go (and you saved me)
I was down and out 2
I was doing drugs 2
I was running the streets 2
Never felt love
I was wilding out
You saved me

[Intro: Justin Vernon]
I can hold my liquor
But this man can’t handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm onto Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

[Refrain: Chief Keef]
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas, they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

[Verse: Kanye West]
Bitch, I'm back out my coma, wakin' up on your sofa
When I parked my Range Rover, slightly scratched your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hangin' on a hangover, five years we been over
Ask me why I came over, one more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya, one cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin', feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead, might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on your sofa, these the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners, you love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover, even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over, skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus, bitch, you don't even know us
"Baby girl, he's a loner, baby girl, he's a loner"
Late-night organ donor, after that, he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless, soul mates become soulless
"When it's over it's over," and, bitch, I'm back out my coma

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh, I wanna phone home

[Refrain: Chief Keef]
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas, they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Vernon & Kanye West]
I heard you need a new fad (A new girl, a new girl)
I heard you need a new stack (A new girl, a new girl)
I heard you need a new phone (A new girl, a new girl)
I know your 'rents ain't be home (A new girl, a new girl)

[Outro: Justin Vernon & Kanye West]
Callin' up your uncle's place (A new girl, a new girl)
Shit's all over the place (A new girl, a new girl)
I don't hear your phone (A new girl, a new girl)
Oh, I wanna phone home (A new girl, a new girl)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Damn, your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bathwater on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

[Bridge: Assassin]
That's all dem can do (Say wah? Say wah? Say wah? Say wah?)
That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting
Just a badman ting a-dat man do
Action ting, yo, a badman ting

[Verse 2: Assassin]
I'm a badman if you know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way José
Try that 'pon February the 30th
That's right, couldn't try that no day
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel seh we won't spray, like a aerosol can
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel seh we won't spray, like an aerosol can
We a gon' smile 'pon court day
Becuh we beat murder charge like O.J

[Chorus: Kanye West and Justin Vernon]
That’s right, I’m in it
(Should’ve known I would fall)
I’m in it
(Steppin' on cracks on the floor)
That’s right
(And your boys at your door)
That’s right, I’m in it
(Well, you need to fight for your own)
That’s right, I’m in it
(Then don’t let me at your table)
I’m in it
(If you just gonna lay there)
Damn right
(Fist jumps in the air, you love flame wars)
(I'll be gone long, grab that ass, shed your clothes)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Uh, picked up where we left off
Uh, I need you home when I get off
Uh, you know I need that wet mouth
Uh, I know you need that reptile
Uh, she cut from a different textile
Uh, she love different kinds of sex now
Uh, black girl sippin' white wine
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it 'til the right time
Then she came like AAAAAHHH!

[Chorus 2: Assassin, Kanye West, and Justin Vernon]
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
That's all dem can do (Say wah? Say wah? Say wah? Say wah?)
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
(That's all dem can do)
That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting
Just a badman ting a-dat man do
That's right I'm in it
I'll be gone long, grab that ass, shed your clothes

[Bridge: Justin Vernon]
Say you long for me, for you
Lay it off with all your rules
Star fucker
Star fucker
Star fucker
Who, where?

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Time to take it too far now
Uh, Michael Douglas out the car now
Uh, got the kids-and-the-wife life
Uh, but can't wake up from the nightlife
Uh, I'm so scared of my demons
Uh, I go to sleep with a nightlight
Uh, my mind move like a Tron bike
Uh, pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist
Uh, I'm finna start a new movement
Uh, being led by the drums
Uh, I'm a rap-lic priest
Uh, gettin' head by the nuns
Uh, they don't play what I'm playin'
Uh, they don't see what I'm sayin'
Uh, they be ballin' in the D-League
Uh, I be speakin' Swaghili

[Intro: Kanye West]
I need to call it off
I need to, I need to make it known
'Nother one, something gone
Capricorn
Dancing out on the lawn
Fancy like the things she likes
She lives her life
I'm living mine

[Chorus: Popcaan]
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, sof-sof-softer sof-softer
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan

[Verse: Kanye West]
Maybe it's 'cause she into Leos and I was into trios
Plus all the trips to Rio couldn't have helped
It's gettin' cold, better bring your ski clothes
Peekin' through the keyhole, the door locked by myself
And I'm feelin' it right now
'Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
Blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa
On to the next saga
Focus on the future and let the crew knock her
Star Wars fur, yeah, I'm rockin' Chewbacca
The one Chief Rocka, number-one Chief Rocka

[Chorus: Popcaan]
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan

None ah dem have the guts to rise it and spray

Ohh, ohh, ohh
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, hmm
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
Let me go, let me go, hmm

[​Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
It's another tequila sunrise
Starin' slowly 'cross the sky, said goodbye
He was just a hired hand
Workin' on the dreams he planned to try
The days go by

[Bridge]
Every night when the sun goes down
Just another lonely boy in town
And she's out runnin' 'round

[Verse 2]
She wasn't just another woman
And I couldn't keep from comin' on
It's been so long
Oh, and it's a hollow feelin' when
It comes down to dealin' friends
It never ends

[Instrumental Interlude]​

[Verse 3]
Take another shot of courage
Wonder why the right words never come
You just get numb
It's another tequila sunrise, this old world
Still looks the same
Another frame, mmm

[Verse 1]
Tell us what you're gonna do tonight to mama
There must be someplace you can go
In the middle of the tall drinks and the drama
There must be someone you know
God knows you're looking good enough
But you're so smooth and the world's so rough
You might have something to lose
Oh no, pretty mama
What you gonna do in those shoes?

[Verse 2]
Got those pretty little straps around your ankles
Got those shiny little chains around your heart
You go to have your independence
But you don't know just where to start
Desperation in the singles bars
An' all those jerkoffs in their fancy cars
You can't believe your reviews
Oh no, you can't do that
Once you started wearing those shoes
{Guitar Solo}

[Bridge]
They're looking at you, leaning on you
Tell you anything you wanna hear
They give you tablets of love
They're waiting for you
Got to score you
Handy with a shovel and so sincere
Ooh, they got the kid glove

You just want someone to talk to
They just wanna get their hands on you
You get whatever you choose
Oh, no, you can't do that
Once you started wearing those shoes

Oh, no, you can't do that
Once you started wearing those shoes

(Shoes)

[Verse 1]
Why do people smile when no one's smiling?
It's cause they're thinking of someone they're loving
Keep on believing we are meant to be and
Nothing's stopping you and me from going to heaven

Sweetest love

[Hook]
I got the sweetest love, there ain't nothing sweeter
I got the sweetest love, can't nothing beat it
There ain't nothing sweeter

[Verse 2]
Now I'm a climber, this mountain is just one ladder
It gets better every second we're together
Oooh baby it feels so right
A new beginning starts tonight
The reason for when it's on
Is because of you and me and

[Pre-Hook 1]
Sweetest love
Finally I can't believe
Cause you and me, you're my sweetest love

[Hook x2]

[Bridge]
Now I got that feeling in my gut
Now I need your fire in my life
Now I wanna give you love so much
And I keep on feeling my sweet, my sweet
Sweetest love

[Pre-Hook 2]
I can't believe that you and me, we gotta be
You're my sweetest love

[Hook x3]

[Pre-Hook 2]

[Verse 1]
Nothing can make you high
Or put fire in your eyes
Or give you a chance to fly
When you need the wings
When all that you've got is doubt
And nothing can stop you from feeling down

[Pre-Chorus]
But oh, I know
I know exactly how you feel

[Chorus]
But can you believe now
When you're on your knees now
Begging and pleading now
Can you believe
When all that you've got is doubt
And no one to pull you out
When your heart is slowing down
Can you believe? Oh

[Verse 2]
See, the person I love the most
Is so far away tonight
And no other medicine or promise is
Gonna heal me up right
But I got to believe
That her and me
Will be together
'Cause that's all I got

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, I know
When you're down at the bottom, can you believe?

[Chorus]
Can you believe now
When you're on your knees now
Begging and pleading now
Can you believe
When all that you've got is doubt
And no one to pull you out
When your heart is slowing down
Can you believe?

[Bridge]
Can you believe when all hope seems gone
When your mother and father can't keep you safe from harm
Can you forgive in your heart?
Can you ask for forgiveness
When nobody else believes, can you believe?
Can you believe in yourself?
Woo, oh

[Chorus]
Can you believe now
When all that you've got is doubt
And no one to pull you out
When your heart is slowing down
Can you believe?

[Bridge]
Oh, yeah
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, if nobody's watching, you will never know
If somebody's watching, you will never know
If nobody's watching, you will never know
If somebody's watching, you will never know
If nobody's watching, you will never know
If somebody's watching, you will never know
Ooh, woo

[Outro]
Can you believe now
When you're on your knees now
Begging and pleading now
Can you believe?

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I got 50 goons with me but I'm still a good dude
M-M-Mean muggin' but I'm in a good mood
Ha, work it out, what that shit do
No hands, popsicle, call it Bluetooth
Ho-Ho-Hot damn, I'm on my grind right
My money stupid, better get your mind right
Me without no paper, that don’t sound right
But me fucking you later, yeah, that sound right

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin Cossom]

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
A nigga got a present for you right here undercovers
I don’t care what you cuffin', I just want you undercover
Gold ticket right here, yeah, baby, that's the rubber
And even the side bitch get the dick like I love her
Oh yeah, I’m sorry if I get to bragging
In my room, you know it's 'bout to happen
Soon as we’re done, you'll be napping
Girl got a donk, that's my access

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin Cossom]
And when I put that thing on her, she go night, night
Got your girl sleeping all on me
She passed out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out (Ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1]
He's bitter and twisted
He knows what he wants
He wants to be loved and
He wants to belong
He wants us to listen
He wants us to weep
And he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak

[Chorus]
But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?

[Verse 2]
He lives with his mother
But we show him respect
He's a dangerous bigot
But we always forget
And he's just like his daddy
'Cause he cheats on his friends
And he steals and he bullies anyway that he can

[Chorus]
But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?

[Verse 1]
In pitch dark
I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches
Trip me as I speak

[Chorus]
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there

[Verse 2]
There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Steer away from these rocks
We'd be a walking disaster
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)

[Chorus]
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)

[Interlude]
There, there

[Bridge 1]
Why so green and lonely?
Lonely, lonely
Heaven sent you to me
To me, to me

[Bridge 2]
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen

[Intro]
Cold fire, you've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place
Near you

[Verse 1]
So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart
In pieces

[Chorus]
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star

[Verse 2]
One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star

[Chorus]
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star

[Verse 2]
One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star

[Guitar Solo]

[Intro]
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no

[Verse 1]
I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you
I was there, it wasn't like that
You've come here just to start a fight

[Chorus 1]
You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punch-up at a wedding, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hypocrite, opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn 'round, you stay frozen to the spot

[Chorus 2]
The pointless snide remarks
Of hammerheaded sharks
The pot will call the kettle black
It's a drunken punch-up at a wedding, yeah

[Outro]
No no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no

[Verse 1]
The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his newfound friends
He said, I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now

[Chorus]
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied

[Verse 2]
I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

[Chorus]
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied
Don't know why I
Feel so skinned alive

[Verse 3]
My thoughts are misguided and a little naïve
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
Yeah, no one likes a smartass, but we all like stars
Wait, that wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up, strangled, beaten up
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis

[Chorus]
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied

[Verse 1]
I'm walking out in a force ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rapping on my windowsill

[Verse 2]
Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind
Yesterday's people end up scatterbrain there
Any fool can easy pick a hole, I only wish I could fall in
A moving target in a firing range

[Outro]
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Lightning fuse, powercut
Scatterbrain

[Verse 1]
Once again, I'm in trouble with my only friend
She is papering the windowpanes
She is putting on a smile
Living in a glasshouse

[Verse 2]
And once again, packed like frozen food and battery hens
Think of all the starving millions
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones
Your royal highnesses

[Chorus]
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
But someone's listening in

[Verse 3]
Once again we are hungry for a lynching
That's a strange mistake to make
You should turn the other cheek
Living in a glasshouse

[Chorus]
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Only only only only only only only only only only...
There's someone listening in

[Verse 1]
Hollywood and New York, mister major
Then there's me, little queen of the stage, yeah
He's a god, one the stars call creator
Hail the king of the industry players

[Pre-Chorus]
Take off your business suit
Sittin' in your lap for my interview

[Chorus]
Hit it and run
Let's hit it and run
Hit it and run the world
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world

[Verse 2]
Pick me up in your white Lamborghini
London town, you'll watch out while I'm singing
Glamorous on the stage, boy, believe me
Keep your girl back, no competing

[Pre-Chorus]
Eyein' you from across the room
Watchin' me, wa-watchin' you

[Chorus]
Hit it and run
Let's hit it and run
Hit it and run the world
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world

[Post-Chorus]
You and me on a spree taking over
L. Del Rey (yay, w!)anna be your soldier
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world

[Bridge]
Oh oh
Oh oh
You know this world is mean
Nothing's for free
It's money and technology
Together we'd be deadly
You know this world is mean
Nothing's for free
It's money and technology
Together we'd be deadly, deadly, deadly

[Chorus]
Hit it and run
Let's hit it and run
Hit it and run the world
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world

[Post-Chorus]
You and me on a spree taking over
L. Del Rey (yay, w!)anna be your soldier
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world

[Intro]
Woop ! (Turn the lights on)
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (x2)

[Verse 1] J. Cole
Now I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet, but that’s how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter, probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rocking with the best mane, dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed mane, let you play with the stick - Ovechkin
She calling, she texting, she’s falling, but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate girl cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming offa my last name cause I really can’t take no stressing
'bout where I done been, who I done hit, your homegirl saying, “He a bad boy”
But I’m signed to the Roc, no time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids

[Hook]
Into deep can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Never knew love)
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 2]
We share something so common, but still so rare
And I’m in awe, never been here before
So high, we’re still climbing
Even here inside these walls, breaking each others hearts
And we don’t care cause we’re so

[Hook]
Into deep can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Never knew love)
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 3] Ludacris
And I'm not from Texas but I hold 'em, rope 'em, and I yoke they neck
You gon make a player choose, show me what that thang'll do
Class is in session, let me show you a thang or two
I'll strip ya, I'll strip ya down to your bare minimums
And I'll, I'll lick ya, I'll lick ya down, you taste like cinnamon
And I'll grab a little bit of that whip cream
Then I'll put her on the back, get mean
Then I'll get her in a matrix, cut her like lasik
Basically make her scream
At the top f her lungs, give her shortness of breath
How many times can you cum before I poke you to death
Someone call in the ref', Ludacris is tired of playin
In the middle of the stage with an ass like that, you got everybody sayin

[Hook]
Into deep can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Never knew love)
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 4]
All the times when I know I should be smiling
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still surviving
Cause I'm slowly breaking down even when I hold you close
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even tho' I fell way

[Hook]
Into deep can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Never knew love)
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 5]
And it hurts, cause I wanna leave
And you wanna leave, but the love keeps us together
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even tho' I fell way

[Hook]
Into deep can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Never knew love)
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse]
Tires type black
Where the blacktop cracks
Weeds spark through
Dark green enough to be blue

When the mysteries we believe in
Aren't dreamed enough to be true
Some side with the leaves
Some side with the seeds

The treetops nod
The rain applauds
The park grows dark
And the swings all slowly die

But you and I will be undefeated
By agreeing to disagree
No one wins but the thieves
So why side with anything
The streetlights glow
Comes and goes
When the sun comes back
As we all can plainly see

Embracing the situation
Is our only chance to be free
I'll side with you
If you side with me

[Intro]
Good morning, America (Ahh)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
The saga continues
Good morning, America (Ahh)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
'Cause as the gold Daytons spin
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
A new revelation
Good morning, America (Ahh)

[Verse 1]
Good morning, America
A new day, we gotta hit the schedule ahead of us
The letter K, D-O-T, add a space like a Microsoft keypad
You can't see me, invisible ski mask
Poke the eyes out my beanie
Ghetto Zorro on the headlines, I leave
Feces, shit on niggas, nigga
My flow come in plural
Multiple of it, majority love it
I got the masses, meaning societies, public
Low Dickie shorts, L.A. fashion still holding grudges
Ain't forgot y'all killed Pac, niggas
Ain't forgot y'all left the West Coast for dead
Tried to play it off like the paramedics was coming
Instead, we dusted off, pulled the bullet out our heads
Left a permanent scar for the whole world to recognize
California, economics, pay your taxes bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a new day
New chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
New Snoop, new 2Pac, new Doc Dre
A new West Coast to wake up to, Nate

[Chorus]
Good morning, America
As a new day begins, the saga continues
A new breeze stepping in
I hope that you're ready
'Cause as the gold Daytons spin, brings forth new life
A new revelation (The second coming is here)
Show you right

[Verse 2]
Oh, you done fucked up, baby
Young Kendrick, the grown up baby
On enough to acknowledge your fuck ups
Maybe I spare your life, maybe I won't
Maybe I give you the funk
Geroge Clinton, bring my sentence like I got a English major in it
This is higher academics, pay attention, students
Niggas, what was you foolin' with a handgun?
Might as well have a harpoon, then
I carry two or more with me like I'm carpoolin'
We mobb deep when it's beef
I don't say "get 'em," I say "move in"
S.W.A.T team so aggressive, turn a minor problem extreme
Kool-Aid red beam on top of my weapon
Notice my professionalism, I'm perfecting my craft
You niggas is half doin' your job, insubordination
I'mma have the boss get you fired
Oh, I am the boss
Get terminated, bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a new day
New chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
New Snoop, new 2Pac, new Doc Dre
A new West Coast, don't wake up too late

[Chorus]
Good morning, America
As a new day begins, the saga continues
A new breeze stepping in
I hope that you're ready
'Cause as the gold Daytons spin, brings forth new life
A new revelation (The second coming is here)
Show you right

[Verse 3]
The moral is try your best to not collide with the best of 'em
I ain't talkin' 'bout you, I talk about Jay, Nas, and Em
Crème de la crème, homie
Pockets fat, hand boney
How is that?
Kinda ironic, the West Coast, I underline it
Make him my priority, in orderly fashion, I ain't livin' in
Nobody lasted in time, nobody closing your blinds
The sun is shining, bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a new day
New chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
New Snoop, new 2Pac, new Doc Dre
A new West Coast, don't wake up too late

[Chorus]
Good morning, America
As a new day begins, the saga continues
A new breeze stepping in
I hope that you're ready
'Cause as the gold Daytons spin, brings forth new life
A new revelation (The second coming is here)
Show you right

[Outro]
My nigga, hahahaha
Roll your window down, start there
Ahahaha
See, you gotta hear the street
You gotta be snortin', you know
You gotta taste that shit, feel that
Learn that shit, brotha
Learn that shit, that shit will get you killed
These mothafuckas plottin' all kinds of shit behind your back
Shit

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Man I'm riding round 1 deep, yup, yup , yup, yup
With that choppa on the back seat
Ball, ball, ball, ball
And I ain't worry bout you fuck niggas, squad, hahaha squad!
Man I ain't worry bout you fuck niggas, you know!
Bow, bow, bow, bow
I said I'm riding round 1 deep, you know
With that choppa on the back seat, you know! yeah!
So I ain't worry bout you fuck niggas, nah yeah!
So I ain't worry bout you fuck niggas, Nah Bow, bow

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got a AR-15 on the back of the seat
Knock your head out clean to the back of the Jeep
And since I'm Gucci baby giving me the 3rd degree
Bitch I ain't nothing these rappers serve more Junies than me
So much today's hottest stars ain't got more money than me
They told me Gucci step up your bars
I told 'em step up this CHEESE!
I'm bout to really go sheae just like drew breeze my nigg
And everytime I do a feature, 50 pounds of meat
Me and flocka twin choppas, we pop bottles and lick
I see your contract my nigga, that ain't no money to live
Got me fucked up, down to sleep and under the bridge
I'm eating good, fuck food, 60 bricks in the fridge, it's Gucci!!!

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
One deep in the gold just weed and a choppa
Make your frame came you that's the power of the dollar
Your niggas wild, but my niggas wilder
Got an army of killers, no coing power
Extendos in my handguns, 100 rounds spent now 1
Shooting best friends and loved ones
We shooting nigga, no feel ones
Point a nigga out, we fill one
Can't walk a mile in my air ones
Hunned goons, I wish one
Put 50 bands in your grand son
Send a picture back with a ransom
I need a million dollars shawty and some
I'm the wrong nigga to put hands on
Down industry we hands on
I'm from clayton county, riverdale
Black ski mask, no clientelle
This Jurrasic Park, welcome to hell
You seen the threats we ring the bells
Front door, service, make 100 goons feel like no help
2 possy Glocks till the barrel melt
Make your son feel the same pain I felt, bastard!

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
Got green like churanchulas
You don't want my cancer bra
I smoke you but I don't know you bra
Bout to get your benzes up
I'm manning up, banding up
Dummy don't get damaged up
I done did all kind of stuff
Selling dope, robbing stuff
Tek under my seat
Wish a fuck nigga try me
Room full of killers move by me
And they move in silence
Getting head from a bitch that's Chinese
Couple killers behind me
All my niggas grimey
And you know where to find me, Bitch I'm

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 1]
Open your mouth wide
A universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
So why does this still hurt?
Don't blow your mind with whys

[Verse 2]
I'm moving out of orbit
(Turning in somersaults)
Turning in somersaults
(A giant turtle's eyes)
A giant turtle's eyes
(As jellyfish float by)
Jellyfish float by

[Outro]
It's what keeps me alive

[Verse 1]
Don't turn nasty now
The dusts of hell
A pillar of my salt
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the spell

[Chorus 1]
Little by little, by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt
Once you've been 'round you've been around enough
Ooh
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I'm no idiot, I should look
Ooh

[Verse 2]
The glue won't hold
The thread unpulls
Uncurling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the seal

[Bridge]
Obligations
Complications
Routines and schedules
The drug that will kill you
Kill you
Oh, you

[Chorus 2]
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I'm no idiot, I should look
Little by little, by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt

[Verse 1]
Sleight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fantasized
No one gets hurt
You've done nothing wrong

[Verse 2]
Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water's clear
And innocent
The water's clear
And innocent

[Intro]
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me

[Verse 1]
Gather up the lost and their souls (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Gather up the pitiful (Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)

[Verse 2]
(Into your arms)
What seems impossible (Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms
I think I have had my fill (Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
I think I should give up the ghost
(Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)

[Outro]
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)

[Chorus]
It's like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
The sweetest flowered fruits were hanging from the trees
Falling off the giant bird that's been carrying me
It's like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream

[Verse 1]
Just exactly as I remember
Every word, every gesture
I've my heart
In my mouth

[Chorus]
Like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

[Verse 2]
And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now out of water
Fallen off a giant bird that's been carrying me
(Did so much, did so much)

[Verse 3]
I fell open, I lay under
At the tip off I lost your number
I wanna slip over
And get back under

[Bridge]
And if you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over (Wake me up)
Then you're wrong  (Wake me up)
If you think this is over (Wake me up)
Then you're wrong (Wake me up)

[Chorus]
Like I've fallen out of bed (Wake me up)
From a long and vivid dream (Wake me up)
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying (Wake me up, wake me up)

[Outro]
When at last, you give in
When at last, you give in
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?

[Verse 1]
The Moonies are up on the mountain
The lunatics have taken over the asylum
Waiting on the rapture
Singing, "We're here
To keep your prices down
Feed you to the hounds
To the Daily Mail”
Together, together

[Verse 2]
You made a pig's ear
You made a rude mistake
Paid off security
And got through the gate
You got away with it
But we lie in wait
Hey hey, hey hey hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey

[Verse 3]
Where's the truth, what's the use
In hanging around, lost and found
With your head in the sand
Fat chance, no plan
No regard for human life
Keep trying, you’ve no right
Fast and loose, win or lose
Jumped the queue, go back again
President for life
Lord of all that flies in the sky
The beasts of the earth, the fish in the sea
You’ve lost command
Hey hey, hey hey hey
Uh uh, uh uh uh
Uh uh uh

[Verse 1]
Funny day, looking for laughter and finding it there
Sunny day, braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hair
Picked up a pencil and wrote "I love you" in my finest hand
Wanted to send it, but I don't know where I stand

[Verse 2]
Telephone, even the sound of your voice is still new
All alone in California and talking to you
And feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that I had planned
I guess it's too early, 'cause I don't know where I stand

[Verse 3]
Crickets call, courting their ladies in star-dappled green
Thickets tall until the morning comes up like a dream
All muted and misty, so drowsy now I'll take what sleep I can
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand

[Verse 1]
Game on lock, she ain't stepping on this bus if she ain't gon pop
I ain't walking in the jeweler if i ain't gon cop
Stole Mase flow just to say i ain't gon stop,
Who made the beats hot? CL or Pete Rock
Shit or was it a perfect marriage
Me I'm both in one my beats got me the chain
My raps bought me this Range, my diamond chain the clearest
Funny how a youngin, I never liked carrots
But now I'm older and I'm eating better, which means
Less beef and more cheddar, more bread, more lettuce
Was always fucking dimes but nowadays more let us
From a world where love was just four letters, a go getta
My shows better, my flows better
A go getta rarely do i do better
I'm too set in my ways I'm too gutter to change
Should have known that I'm the coldest I'm two letters away
Nigga who better than Jay? From the the the Roc
Not HOV though its Cole yo
Niggas taking pictures every time I'm in the store yo
When I hit the club they be snapping on the low yo
Niggas snapping pictures every fucking where i go yo
Sometimes i be mad as shit
Then I say stupid motherfucker boy you asked for this
Oh yeah I did, didn't I, did it big, didn't I
Made my album sell like it did a bid, didn't I
Check the album credits that's produced and written by
None other then yours truly
I'm bored sue me, I'm all on the Billboards I'm tryna make Forbes sue me
Audio visual nigga, I could score a movie
You couldn't score a bucket, I'm aiming at Warren Buffett
And painting my poorest fuck it, it rains and it pours
I'm covered out on these tours, running a train on your whore
Take her home in a Ford, ironic 'cause I explore
Nigga I explore!

[Verse 2]
Prophecys fulfilled, as i proceed to kneel
Dodging greed of niggas who cock and squeeze to steal
I do this for my niggas that got degrees and still broke as fuck
Fuck your flag, democracy has failed
I'm in the realest state with no properties for sale
Probably could build with Socrates himself
No soccer moms to throw us on soccer teams but still
Kick shit so cold boy, I can freeze in hell
Now do tell exactly how does it feel
Tryna save a generation knowing that you never will
Tryna do rap without some nigga tryna pay your bills
Cause you black and rap you'll never do no numbers like Adele
Oh well Momma already been through hell
I could turn this into heaven if my records even sell
I'm a firm believer if you never quit you never fail
If I slip I grab the rail, I'll get a grip and never fail

[Verse 3]
Falling victim to this society, wheres hoes gaining notoriety
And if I ain't rocking chains these kids won't admire me
Niggas try extorting me to get a verse up out of me
Nigga eat dick your street shit don't apply to me
I walk around dolo no security YOLO
So if a nigga plan to put a bullet through my polo
Cause i wouldn't help his promo so be it
Kill you niggas without licking a shot, this cold war, Soviet
No Vietnam, back in Fayettenam. no stay at home moms
We was far from street niggas but we played along
Walk around with our mean mugs painted on
Rest in peace to all the teen thugs
May the lord bless your soul
Cross the crossings this must be called life
Momma stressed she been stressing all night
But momma your little bundle of joy
Is clever enough to avoid the pitfalls of this world they destroyed
This is clever nigga i never seen another nigga

[Verse 1]
You're just a little girl with grey eyes
Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries
Oh, wait until the crowd cries
You're just a little girl with grey eyes

[Chorus]
So deep in your room
You never leave your room
Something deep inside of me
Yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can you do?
What in the world can you do?
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

[Verse 2]
I'm just a little bit afraid of you
'Cause love won't make you cry
But wait until the crowd goes
Oh, wait until the crowd goes
I'm just a little bit afraid of you

[Chorus]
So deep in your room
You never leave your room
Something deep inside of me
Yearning deep inside of me
Is talking through the gloom
What in the world can I do?
What in the world can I do?
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love

[Outro]
Oh, what you going to say?
Oh, what you going to do?
Ah, what you going to be?
To the real me
To the real me

[Intro: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
You say you're not gonna fight
'Cause no one will fight for you
And you think there's not enough love
And no one to give it to
And you're sure you've hurt for so long
You've got nothing left to lose
So, you say you're not gonna fight
'Cause no one will fight for you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
You say the weight of the world
Has kept you from letting go
And you think compassion's a flaw
And you'll never let it show
And you're sure you've hurt in a way
That no one will ever know
But someday, the weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Whoa-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh
Da-yeah-nah, no-ooh-oh
No, no

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
Hold on, the weight of the world (Na, no, no, no, no oh)
(Oh-ho, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Will give you the strength to go (Yeah, yeah, aah)
(Yeah, no)
So hold on, the weight of the world (Yeah-aah, yeah, yeah)
Will give you the strength to go (Nah, ha, ha, ha) (No-oh, no-oh)
(Ha ha ha ha, yah, yah, yah) (No-oh, no-oh)
(No-oh)
So hold on, the weight of the world (Ah, yeah)
Will give you the strength to go (Mah, mah, mah)

[Outro: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
(Hold on, hold on, hold on)
Just hold on, the weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go

[Verse 1]
Every chance, every chance that I take
I take it on the road
Those kilometers and the red lights
I was always looking left and right

[Chorus]
Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car

[Verse 2]
Jasmine, I saw you peeping
As I pushed my foot down to the floor
I was going round and round the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to 94

[Chorus]
Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place

[Chorus]
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife

[Verse]
Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place

[Chorus]
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife

[Outro]
Sometimes you get so lonely

[Intro: Aaliyah & Chris Brown]
I don't think they know the truth
A-A to the L-I-Y-A-H
Say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?
I don't think they know the truth
It's Breezy
Say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Don't let 'em tell you any different
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)
I owe it all to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)
And as much as I messed up, always give me your best love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)
Sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
They gon' talk about it, gon' talk about it
Gon' try to change your mind about it
Gon' tell you things you don't wanna hear, but we good
D-D-Don't worry 'bout it
So when they talk about, they talk about it
Just let 'em know we already got it
Just tell 'em that we gon' work at it, we good
D-D-Don't worry 'bout it

[Chorus: Aaliyah, Chris Brown & Both]
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Aaliyah]
Don't listen to, how could they know?
What people say, how could they know?
They don't know about, how could they know?
'Bout you and me, how could they know?

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
At my best you love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)
Even or at my worst
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)
And I know that it's different, feels like we're best friends, we connected
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)
What did I do to deserve you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
They gon' talk about it, gon' talk about it
Gon' try to change your mind about it
Gon' tell you things you don't wanna hear, but we good
D-D-Don't worry 'bout it
So when they talk about, they talk about it
Just let 'em know we already got it
Just tell 'em that we gon' work at it, we good
D-D-Don't worry 'bout it

[Chorus: Aaliyah, Chris Brown & Both]
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know? (I don't think they—)
I don't think they know the truth (Say it ain't so), say it ain't so
I don't think they know (I don't think they—), how could they know?

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Aaliyah]
Don't listen to, how could they know?
What people say, how could they know?
They don't know about, how could they know?
'Bout you and me, how could they know?

[Bridge: Aaliyah & Chris Brown]
How could they know?
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
How could they know?
Damn
How could they know? (Hahaha)
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
How could they know?

[Verse 3: Aaliyah & Chris Brown]
I thank you for the autographs and the cheers over the years
You stood by me, you didn't doubt me (Yeah)
I think you want some more (Oh)
I do more than sing
I model now, acting now (Ooh, yeah)
Plus I got my own movie now
After all the awards that they gave me, you stood by me
You didn't play me, you didn't doubt me
I think you want some more (Need some more, babe)
I truly believe that if it wasn't all for you
I don't know what I would do (Ooh, whoa)
Oh-whoa

[Chorus: Aaliyah, Chris Brown & Both]
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?
I don't think they know the truth (They don't know), say it ain't so (They don't know)
I don't think they know, how could they know? (Yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Aaliyah]
Don't listen to (Ooh-ooh), how could they know? (Yeah, yeah)
What people say (Ooh-ooh), how could they know?
They don't know about (They don't know about us, babe), how could they know?
'Bout you and me, how could they know?

[Verse 1]
Weaving down a byroad
Singing the song
That's my kind of highroad
Gone wrong

[Chorus]
My-my, smile at least
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast

[Verse 2]
Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong but darling
Something's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside me
Someone could get skinned, how?

[Chorus]
My-my, someone fetch a priest
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast, darling

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
My-my
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
My-my
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast

[Bridge]
I wanted to believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should, my-my

[Verse 3]
Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank God heaven left us
Standing on our feet

[Chorus]
My-my, Beauty and the Beast, my-my
Just Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast, darling
My-my, my-my

[Chorus]
Joe the lion went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he said
"Tell you who you are if you nail me to my car"

[Verse 1]
Boy, thanks for hesitating
This is the kiss off
Boy, thanks for hesitating
You'll never know the real story
Just a couple of dreams
You get up and sleep
You can buy God
It's Monday
Slither down the greasy pipe
So far so good no one saw you
Hobble over any freeway
You will be like your dreams tonight
You get up and sleep
You get up and sleep
Joe the lion
Made of iron

[Chorus]
Joe the lion went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he was a fortune teller
He said, "nail me to my car and I'll tell you who you are"
Joe the lion, yeah, yeah
Went to the bar, yeah, yeah
A couple of dreams and he was a fortune teller
He said, "nail me to my car, tell you who you are"

[Verse 2]
You get up and sleep
The wind blows on your cheek
The day laughs in your face
I guess you'll buy a gun
You'll buy it secondhand
And you'll get up and sleep

[Outro]
Joe the lion
Made of iron
Joe the lion, made of iron
Joe the lion
Made of iron
Joe the lion
Made of iron

[Verse 1]
Sons of the silent age
Stand on platforms blank looks and notebooks
Sit in the back rows of city limits
Lay in bed coming and going on easy terms
Sons of the silent age
Pace their rooms like a cell's dimension
Rise for a year or two then make war
Search through their one inch thoughts
Then decide it couldn't be done

[Chorus]
Baby, I'll never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down
(Sons of sound, and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, I'll never let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's find another way in
(Sons of sound, and sons of sound)

[Verse 2]
Sons of the silent age
Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy and King Dice
Sons of the silent age
They pick up in bars and cry only once
Sons of the silent age
Make love only once but dream and dream
They don't walk, they just glide in and out of life
They never die, they just go to sleep one day

[Chorus]
Baby, I will never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down
(Sons of sound, and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, baby, I won't ever let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's find another way in
(Sons of sound, and sons of sound)

[Outro]
(Sons of sound, and sons of sound) Baby, baby, baby
Find another way

Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Wha, wha, why?

You tell me that you need me, but then you wanna leave me
And never make your way to the door
I tell you that you're too much and that I'll miss you too much
Don't even know what we're fighting for

You keep my car, girl, and then you go get it fixed
I talk all them other chicks just to make you jealous
How can we make it right when we both put up a fit?
You make me so mad it's kind of hard to forgive

But when I look into your pretty eyes
My heart just drops
Girl, you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Wha, wha, why?

You always talking reckless sending a text message
Telling me to pack and get goin'
And then I get a call a minute you sounded so innocent
Saying that you can't sleep alone

I'll go find every receipt to show how you spend all my dough
You wanna go inside my room and burn all of my clothes
How can we make it right when we put up a fit
You make me so mad it's kind of hard to forgive

But when I look into your pretty eyes
My heart just drops


Girl, you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Wha, wha, why?

Calling it quits just ain't what we were built for
I'd rather love you than to hate you, girl
I, I want you to know

You're my, you're my(ay)
You're my shawty
Say you're my, you're my
You're my shawty

Girl, you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

Born to do it
Even though my friends looking at me like who knew it
Run to it
The hoods just picked thy new nigga
Feel cats talking like who nigga
Is he
Where did he come from: CL
My mom prayed for me on my journey
Treat me like an alien something like Sigourney
Live through the game for the fame and the gurney
Tried to put me on the pedestal
Hoes treated me like who are you
Now I get to choose like you and her too
I just like girls not whores
But I have a chill time, make s'mores
But if I wanna plow something like a snowblower
I can work that ass like a workout plan
And then I holla at fam
Talkin bout Ye Don C Jigga man
Been represent since I met Quince and I get style tips from my homeboy Vin and
Com is the homie
Really doe is the homie
GLC is the homie
And Big Sean what up Gwan
I go monkeypaw on the record and they think I'm cuckoo
Niggas is sounding dated like they recorded in FUBU
Most niggas will quote you play scrabble with your words, man
'Til you see them at your shows is my dick that they blow, man
I would sit up some nights and think about my own place
Probably cause I took so many blunts of kush to the face
My bad thoughts I can't erase
Or eat what's on the devil's plate
I just tell the devil wait
Cause murder will not be the case
In London with Hudson
And them girls want some cutting
I'm with him so I'm cool
Plus my face on the telly
But I'm pissed at the moment
I got charged for some roaming
AT&T is on bullshit man I wish they'd stop fronting
But when I roll back to Brooklyn
Hit the store for a dutchie
They say homie keep rappin'
I say homie it's nothing
Now when I roll back to Cleveland
Hit the store for a philly
Niggas tell me keep rappin'
Cause them young niggas feel me
When I roll out to Cali
Hit the store for a Swisher
Niggas tell me keep rappin'
I say homie I get ya
Cudder

"I didn't step on the flag on purpose! It's a scene in a video where the flag drops behind me and after it drop it's just there as I perform"


"It was never my intention to desecrate the flag of the United States of America. I was shooting a video for a song off my album entitled "God Bless Amerika". The clip that surfaced on the Internet was a camera trick clip that revealed that behind the American Flag was the Hoods of America. In the final edit of the video you will see the flag fall to reveal what is behind it but will never see it on the ground. In most people eyes including my own who were raised in that environment, the Hood is the only America they know and the only America I knew growing up. I was fortunate from my God given talents to escape the Hood and see the other beautiful places this country has to offer but most people who are born in that environment don't get that chance. That's their view of their America. That was Dwayne M Carter from Hollygrove New Orleans view of America. That's who I'm speaking for in this song".

[Verse 1]
Sitting in a park in Paris, France
Reading the news and it sure looks bad
They won't give peace a chance
That was just a dream some of us had
Still a lot of lands to see
But I wouldn't wanna stay here
It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here

[Chorus 1]
Oh, but California
California, I'm coming home
I'm going to see the folks I dig
I'll even kiss a Sunset pig
California, I'm coming home

[Verse 2]
I met a redneck on a Grecian isle
Who did the goat dance very well
He gave me back my smile
But he kept my camera to sell
Oh, the rogue, the red red rogue
He cooked good omelets and stews
And I might have stayed on with him there
But my heart cried out for you

[Chorus 2]
California
Oh, California, I'm coming home
Oh, make me feel good rock 'n roll band
I'm your biggest fan
California, I'm coming home

[Bridge 1]
Oh, it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
Just gives you the blues
Just gives you the blues

[Verse 3]
So I bought me a ticket
I got on a plane to Spain
Went to a party down a red dirt road
There were lots of pretty people there
Reading Rolling Stone, reading Vogue
They said, "How long can you hang around?"
I said a week, maybe two
Just until my skin turns brown, the I'm going home

[Chorus 3]
To California
California, I'm coming home
Oh, will you take me as I am?
Strung out on another man
California, I'm coming home

[Bridge 2]
Oh, it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
More about the war
And the bloody changes

[Outro]
Oh, will you take me as I am?
Will you take me as I am?
Will you?
Will you take me as I am?
Hmmm mmmmm
Take me as I am

[Verse 1]
The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68
And he told me, "All romantics meet the same fate someday
Cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark café
"You laugh," he said, "you think you're immune
Go look at your eyes, they're full of moon
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
All those pretty lies, pretty lies
When you gonna realize they're only pretty lies?
Only pretty lies, just pretty lies"

[Verse 2]
He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer
And he pushed three buttons and the thing began to whirr
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie
And she said "Drink up now, it's gettin' on time to close."
"Richard, you haven't really changed," I said, it's just that
Now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
You got tombs in your eyes, but the songs you punched are dreamy
Listen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet?
Oh and love can be so sweet, love so sweet

[Verse 3]
Richard got married to a figure skater
And he bought her a dishwasher and a coffee percolator
And he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on
And all the house lights left up bright
I'm gonna blow this damn candle out
I don't want nobody comin' over to my table
I got nothing to talk to anybody about
All good dreamers pass this way someday
Hidin' behind bottles in dark cafés
Dark cafés, only a dark cocoon
Before I get my gorgeous wings and fly away
Only a phase, these dark café days

[Intro: God]
There once was a little girl
Who had a crush on a bad, bad boy
But when that bad boy got out of prison
That little girl's ass was in big, big trouble

[Hook: Yo-Landi Visser]
Daai bra Anies, hy's 'n fokken gam bra
Haai! Daai Anies, hy lam innie mang, ja
"Ken sy my nommer?" Xha! Boy, what's your number?
Twee ses? Twee sewe? Of is jy n ag bra?

[Verse 1: Yo-Landi Visser]
Throw them devilish gang signs in the air
Start giving it up for little evil me
My fingers are green 'cause I'm a mean dope fiend
I'm wicked like a mad D.O.G
Fresh like a little dark G.O.D
Yo-Landi Vi$$er got the hypest flow
Start talking in tongues whenever I get stoned
Motherfucking minds get blown
Every time I rap into the microphone
My zef accent is very foreign
When I speak overseas they go "I beg your pardon?"
You can't get me, like Eric Cartman
Naughty little kitty go "meow"
Yes daddy, I'm a big girl now
Jas little devil make your dick go "wow!"
Yeah, boy, Yo-Landi Vi$$er is hot stuff

[Hook: Yo-Landi Visser]
Daai bra Anies, hy's 'n fokken gangsta
Haai, daai Anies, hy lam innie mang, ja
"Ken sy my nommer?" Xha! Boy, what's your number?
Twee ses? Twee sewe? Of is jy 'n ag bra?
Daai bra Anies, hy droom innie mang, ja
Van my punani, ja, jy's lekker jas, bra
Vinger in jou hol in, nxa! Haal uit die ganja
Ja pakkie zol in! Klap dit soos 'n rasta

[Verse 2: Yo-Landi Visser]
I rhyme tight! Tight, tight, tight!
Spark mosh-pit shit 'cause I rhyme so hype
Put me in front of someone I don't like
I go punch! Kick! Bite! Fight!
I'm cray-cray like O.D.B
Yo-Landi down with O.P.P
I smell lovely 'cause I don't eat meat
Too much bubbly then I go pee-pee
Look out here I come, little evil me
I got a itchy little need for speed
Rap on the beat like a high-speed chase on
I gooi rooi! No motherfucking brakes on
All these pop songs sound like the same song
I burn them! Ja motherfucker, flame on!
Bow down to her motherfucking majesty
No rapper out there as bad as me

[Bridge: Yo-Landi Visser]
Sny jou koekie!
Sny-sny jou snoekie koekie!
Cut it-cut it, hey kitty kitty kitty!
Cut it-cut it, hey kitty kitty kitty!
Sny jou koekie!
Sny-sny jou snoekie koekie!
Cut it-cut it, hey kitty kitty kitty!
Cut it-cut it, hey kitty kitty kitty!

[Hook: Yo-Landi Visser]
Daai bra Anies hy's 'n fokken gangsta

Maar yoh! Daai Anies hy hou van my boude!

[Intro: Funkmaster Flex]
We out here moving, J. Cole is here
This has happened before
When the mics are set up like this
You know something's gonna happen

[Break: J. Cole]
Is it on me?
Is it on me?
Hmmmmm, hmmmmmm
Hmmmm, hmmmm
NYC, Cole World

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Look, they say I'm something like a teacher
I guess they right, I'm with your bitch on her
How to play FIFA, kick game Messi
Switch lanes while I get brains, bet me
I don't whiff stain anything these pricks aim at me
I am hater proof, the straight up truth
Went and got my weight up God
Now I'm straight-up Zeus
Silly little rappers rhyming 'bout their made-up coupes
That you ain't ever gonna drive, jets you will never step inside
So just step aside, rather look up at the sky
Don't you see this middle finger from my big ol' G5, I
Chartered planes, ballin' blowin' money fast though it's all in vain
You only live once, so fuck the cops
Who'd rather see us all in ball-and-chains
My aim is to stretch my name in your Hall of Fame
Next to Elvis, paint a vivid picture of where hell is
And crawled out, heart froze and it never thawed out
So I balled out, with my balls out
Screamin' live for the moment, make sense don't it
My mama need a crib I'm gon' cop it and she'll own it
We gon' toast to the days when they foreclose our shit
Now we livin' better thanks to the flows I spit
And I'll make sure she paid like she wrote my shit
That's a Wayne line, no time to count this dough I get
All this gear I don't wear, I need four closets (damn)
Go figure, my pockets got bigger
Now all those I don't fuck with say "That's my nigga"
"That's my nigga"

[Interlude: Funkmaster Flex]
You see us, baby
Funk Flex, J. Cole
Who you mad at, me or yourself

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
Look
They give props to the others but them niggas ain't help
Take a look around, girl I built this shit up myself
At a time when niggas cry 'bout how they sit on the shelf
I gave the world 2 classics to put on my belt
Way before "Work Out" I did them sit-ups myself
Too many hands in my pockets, niggas hit at my wealth
I gotta, re-maneuver these deals, they need improving drastically
Cause homie if you asking me
I'm supposed to be the richest nigga since Master P
If not, at least half, my nigga at least half
Afraid of 30, still looking twenty, like he's Fab
Subtle shit, throwing these jabs like he's Zab
I seen, Mac Miller, that nigga got mad millers
The rap Brad Miller and even a tad iller
You see me, salute me, it's crazy the way they do me
You would feel me if you niggas knew me, let's make a movie
Out this shit, cause these hoes getting choosy out this bitch
Playing "Juicy" in jacuzzis, getting woozy I could sip
Champagne and hopefully forget the whole damn thing
We pullin' hoes like a ol' hamstring
Cole so damn mean, and high as fuck nigga no landing
Long as I'm alive, no man king
And nigga that was the hook

[Interlude: Funkmaster Flex]
HOT 97, baby!!!

[Verse 3: J.Cole]
Look
This music's my weapon so anyone that's interrupting
Get a Colin Kaepernick bullet straight to the chest
Tryna make an impression, so if I aim to the left
And you can't make the reception, ya man'll catch a great interception
I'm nice nigga, could've dropped the album like twice nigga
So nigga fuck your advice nigga
Started off friendly, now all these niggas my enemies
What could you say to offend me?

[Break: J. Cole]
I could go forever, Flex, I could go forever
Born Sinner, TOMORROW, June 18th
I could go on forever

[Intro]
Jimmy gone M.I.A
Come back Jimmy

[Verse 1]
When you go Rwanda, Congo
Take me on your genocide tour
Take me on a truck to Darfur
Take me where you would go
Got static on the satellite phone
Got to get you safe at home
Gonna get you somewhere warm
So you get me all alone

[Chorus]
Jimmy, aaja
Jimmy, aaja
Jimmy, aaja
Jimmy, aaja

[Verse 2]
Time and time and time and time again
You keep pushing that button but I don't know what you're saying
Hit me on AIM, tryna flip me on some game
Are you coming, are you going, are you leaving, are you staying?

[Bridge]
You tell me that you're busy
Your loving gets me crazy
I know that you hear me
Start acting like you want me
You told me that you're busy (Jimmy)
Your loving gets me crazy (Aaja)
I know that you hear me (Jimmy)
Start acting like you want me (Aaja)

[Verse 3]
Time and time and time again
You keep pushing me, what are you saying?
Ya hit me on AIM and flip me some game
And I still don't know what you're saying

[Bridge]
You told me that you're busy
Your loving gets me crazy
I know that you hear me
Start acting like you want me
You told me that you're busy (Jimmy)
Your loving gets me crazy (Aaja)
I know that you hear me (Jimmy)
Start acting like you want me (Aaja)

[Chorus]
Jimmy, aaja
Jimmy, aaja
Jimmy, aaja
Jimmy, aaja

[Outro]
Jimmy, I love you
Hear me sing

[Intro]
Hey baby, that's alright people
I know that's alright
Everyday, that's alright
Oh, when we love each other

[Verse 1]
I know that's alright
Oh just feel it, feel it
Oh everybody feel it
God know that's alright, yes

[Verse 2]
Some of us were born with money to spend
Some of us were born for races to win
Some of us are aware that it's good for us to care
Some of us feel the icy wind of poverty blowing in the air

[Verse 3]
For those of us who simply like to socialize
For those of us who tend the sick
And heed the people's cries
Let me say to you, right on

[Bridge]
Turn on, on, feel it, feel
Yeah, oh, oh, oh Lord, Lord, people
And I say, right on
Honey, right on

[Verse 4]
For those of us who live where peace is craved
For those of us who live, where hatred is enslaved, alright
For those of us who live a life, yeah
Surrounded by good fortune and wealth, talk about it

[Verse 5]
For those of us who live a life, hey, hey, hey enjoying ourselves
For those of us who got drowned in the sea of happiness
For the soul that takes pride in his God
And himself and everything else

[Verse 6]
Love, love, sweet love, love, wonderful love
Ah, true love, love, love for your brother
And love, love for God
Love, pure love

[Verse 7]
Ah true love can conquer hate every time
Give out some love and you'll find peace sublime
And my darling, one more thing
If you let me, I will take you to live where love is king
Ah, baby

[Verse 1]
Paper doll, come try it on
Step out of that black chiffon
Here’s a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you

[Verse 2]
This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for Spring
My love didn't cost a thing

[Chorus]
You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll

[Verse 3]
Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
Tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda' kept my undershirt

[Chorus]
You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Cut the cord and pull some strings
Make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings don’t fly
Someone’s going to paint you another sky

[Chorus/Outro]
'Cause you’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall?
Was it just too far to fall?

Lonely Island!
We got the whole family here
Time to meet the crew, Y'all!

My name is Jorm
You can call me J-orgus
Ride around town bumpin' Fugees in a Taurus

Yo, I'm Artemis Prime
Also known as Young Sandwich
The Lonely Island got amigos like my man John Landis

Kiv in the house
But you can call me Young Dad
Rockin' pink Adidas, never wear plaid

I'm little Tony
I'm always playin' pranks
Make you run out the room cause my booty stanks

I'm the fat one
They call me Fat Bob
I get all the ladies even though I'm a slob
I'm Piccolo Pete
And a part of the crew
You'll know that it's me from the sound of my flute

Hell, I'm Sick Eric
I'm always sick
You can catch me on the corner taking antibiotics

They call me Smooth Guy
Cause I be drinkin' mad smoothies
You think I got my name from my voice?
That just ain't true, G

They call me Creepy Zeek
You know I do my own thing
My rhymes ain't good but I'm fun in small doses

They call me Boring Steven
I don't know why
My rhymes are dope and my whip is fly (it's fucking bullshit)

I'm a rich guy
I'm doing this as a lark
My sense of humor is extremely dark

Well I'm new to the crew
And no one trusts me at all
If they'd get to know me they'd see I'm a ball
People call me Tiny
My name is ironic
I'm 12 feet tall. My life is hard

I'm a little lost
Is this the right studio?
I work for Rod Stewart, you know what? I'm gonna go

I wear stripes that match the wallpaper
I'm hiding now but I'll surprise you later

Well, my name is Greg
And I'm on the phone
It was my mom's birthday so I had to fly home

We're the Buddha Twins, all we smoke is Buddha Bless
Never puff sess, Buddha Bless is the best

Hey, I'm Rod Stewart
I'm looking for my tech
He's always wandering off, what a pain in the neck!

So there it is
One third of the crew...
The rest couldn't be here or phone in...
But best believe they are missed
Lonely Island, we out

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Telling me to go
But hands beg me to stay
Your lips say that you love
Your eyes say that you hate

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
There's truth in your lies, doubt in your faith
What you build, you lay to waste
There's truth in your lies, doubt in your faith
All I've got's what you didn't take

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So I, I won't be the one
Be the one to leave this in pieces
And you, you will be alone
Alone with all your secrets and regrets
Don't lie

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You promise me the sky
Then toss me like a stone
You wrap me in your arms
Then chill me to the bone

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
There's truth in your lies, doubt in your faith
All I've got's what you didn't take

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So I, I won't be the one
Be the one to leave this in pieces
And you, you will be alone
Alone with all your secrets and regrets
Don't lie

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So I, I won't be the one
Be the one to leave this in pieces
And you, you will be alone
Alone with all your secrets and regrets
Don't lie

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
I'm hot, you're cold
You go around like you know
Who I am, but you don't
You've got me on my toes

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby
Come on, girl

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I fell (I fell) so fast (So fast)
Can't hold myself back
High heels (High heels), red dress (Red dress)
All by yourself, gotta catch my breath

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Walk in the room, all I can see is you, oh
Staring me down, I know you feel it, too

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby
Slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

[Verse 3: Big Rob & (Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas)]
Yo, we're burning up in this place tonight
Your Brothers sing it loud (And we're feeling right)
Get up and dance (Don't try and fight it)
Big Rob's for real (And that's no lie)
Stop, drop and roll (And touch the floor)
(It keeps on burnin' up) more and more
I got JB with me (Laying it down)
Come on boys, let’s bring the chorus around

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Big Rob]
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under (Yeah)
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter? (Come on, man)
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

[Outro: Nick Jonas & Big Rob]
Burnin' up (Sup?), burnin' up for you, baby

[Intro: T.I.]
Yeah, hey
Yeah, hey
Hey
I say now check this, dig that
Dig that
Dig that
Hey

[Chorus: T.I.]
Check this, dig that
You know I be gettin' that money in them big stacks
You broke I can fix that, yeah
You broke I can fix that, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
I say now check this, dig that
You know I be gettin' that money in them big stacks
You broke I can fix that, yeah
Hey, come and see me, I can fix that, yeah
Hey, hey, gettin' money, nigga

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm gettin' my hustle on and I'm rollin', got whatever gettin' that paper
Fresh out of prison, I'm glowin', middle finger raised to them haters
Get your chick before she gets stolen, one of my partner surely may take her
Send her back to you, pussy swollen, so it's messed up just like her make up
Got an elephant memory, it's flawless, I remember all of y'all who was talkin'
Got a good mind to run in your office, whoop your ass in front of your bosses
My partner died in my honor, I'm responsible for his mama
His daughter too, bet you she can go whatever college she wanna
Still wrap rubberbands in my bank roll, broke is somethin' I can't go
Bitches yellin' out I'm the shit, I'm like tell me somethin' I ain't know
My broker called said my stocks is up 20% so my profits increasin' even in my absence so my attitude is obnoxious
Contract almost expired, they get one more album off it
Better go tell Edgar Bronfman make my contract big as Bosh's
Got bitches on my side shit, and feds already watchin'
Just one more year of paper and I'm back to blowin' broccoli, ayy

[Chorus: T.I.]
Check this, dig that
You know I be gettin' that money in them big stacks
You broke I can fix that, yeah
You broke I can fix that, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
I say now check this, dig that
You know I be gettin' that money in them big stacks
You broke I can fix that, yeah
Hey, come and see me, I can fix that, yeah
Hey, hey, gettin' money, nigga

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I'm the king of Texas, I put on
On the block tryna' put the whole hood on
Stay stiff when them other niggas stood wrong
Street shit only thing a nigga stood on
My niggas on Death Row, same shit like Suge
Attitude fucked, then shit been good
Tell 'em I got a million, ain't never gotta worry 'bout a thing
I represent it the best I could
Yeah, I get paid when I rap
Shit get flipped then I'm back to the trap
Trunk locked up with somethin' that clap
If you don't get that, then bitch'll get slapped
Bitch, I pop her
Get this whopper
Find me in the hood, same place I got shot up
I won't be stopped, probably why you niggas hate
Money gettin' big like look what I got up
You ain't seen that Maybach fella with that drop?
Chain stay icy, bitch, I stay hot
Yeah, I'm Truth, that's what you not
It's my time, fuck your plot
I got my team strong and my guns loaded
City mine, the whole hood voted
This murda bidness, they know I showed it
Suicide, both doors floated
Me and Tip, G-D-O-D
Got that work, C-O-D
You've been livin' free, you got a P-F-E
That talkin' cool but ain't shit to me
Broke, I'll be damned if I go back
This Hustle Gang and you know that
We earned respect so you owe that
With the middle finger like hold that

[Chorus: T.I.]
Check this, dig that
You know I be gettin' that money in them big stacks
You broke I can fix that, yeah
You broke I can fix that, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
I say now check this, dig that
You know I be gettin' that money in them big stacks
You broke I can fix that, yeah
Hey, come and see me, I can fix that, yeah
Hey, hey, gettin' money, nigga

[Verse 3: T.I.]
So many lanes with so much to say
But that's another topic for another day
They know face to face I clown nigga
Why you ain't talk shit now nigga?
Don't try to dap me up, you ain't down wit' us
Am I angry? Bitch, don't I sound bitter?
'Cause I'm so sincere
It's so severe that you know through all that I persevere
I die tomorrow, my hopes up there will be on some other level, my ghost'll fear
I got no compassion, no understandin' like y'all bitch asses, so underhanded
My rationale is all reprimanded, just smash the gas, take full advantage
My patience short and my temper bad
So you'll find me everywhere you ain't at
The best you got, you better bring that
You wanna take me out? You can't fake me out
When they let me out, you wanna help me out
Nigga did these moves, come check me out
Me and Doug in the drop-top Bent' we are headed to the bank with a check we got
One thing, ain't no question 'bout it
If not more, I'm just as hot
Okay, scratch that, I'm spazzin' out
Big bank rolls I'm passin' out
I hug your hoe, she passin' out
Before she hit the ground, I'm mashin' out
I'm bossin' up and I'm stayin' down
Got racks on racks just layin' round
Big bank, nigga, ain't no playin' 'round
You wasn't checkin' me then, I bet ya did now

[Chorus: T.I.]
Hey, check this, dig that
You know I be gettin' that money in them big stacks
You broke I can fix that, yeah
You broke I can fix that, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
I say now check this, dig that
You know I be gettin' that money in them big stacks
You broke I can fix that, yeah
Hey, come and see me, I can fix that, yeah
Hey, hey, gettin' money, nigga

[Intro: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
If the heart is always searching
Can you ever find a home?
I've been looking for that someone
I'll never make it on my own
Dreams can't take the place of loving you
There's gotta be a million reasons why it's true

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
How long will I be waiting
To be with you again?
I'm gonna tell you that I love you
In the best way that I can
I can't take a day without you here
You're the light that makes my darkness disappear

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

[Bridge: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
More and more, I start to realize
I can reach my tomorrow
I can hold my head up high
And it's all because you're by my side

[Breakdown: Nick Jonas]
When you look me in the eyes
You tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When I hold you in my arms
I know that it's forever
I just gotta let you know
I never wanna let you go

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
When you look me in the eyes (Yeah)
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright (It's alright)
When you're right here by my side (By my side)
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
Oh, I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Oh, yeah
Oh, whoa, yeah
You, you're like driving on a Sunday
You, you're like taking off on Monday
You, you're like a dream
Dream come true

I, I'm just a face you never notice
And I, I'm just trying to be honest with myself
With you, with the world

You might think that I'm a fool for falling over you
So tell me what can I do to prove to you
That it's not so hard to do
Give love a try, one more time
Cause you know that I'm on your side
Give love a try, one more time
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Told you I made dinner plans
For you and me and no one else
That don't include your crazy friends
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With awkward situations, empty conversations

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
So, this is where the story ends
A conversation on I.M
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With texting sorry for the miscommunication

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Next time I see you
I'm giving you a high five
'Cause hugs are overrated, just FYI

[Breakdown: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two, yeah

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Call I'll never get
Call I'll never get

[Intro: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
We're the kids, we're the kids
We're the kids of the future
We're the kids, we're the kids
We're the kids of the future

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
Standing on a dirty, old rooftop
Down below, the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why
Come on, Lewis, keep moving forward
Hold your head up high
There's no time for looking down
You will not believe where we're going now

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick Jonas]
Here we go, let me remind you
Look ahead, the past is behind you

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
We're the kids of the future, whoa-oh
We're the kids of the future, whoa-oh
Everybody live 'cause the future is now

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Bright lights, boy, look around you
Your imagination is working overtime
The world that you dreamt of has now arrived
Hot shot, the greatest adventure
Is where the family you've searched for comes alive
So, come meet the Robinson's

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick Jonas]
Looking for a place you belong to
Looking for a family that wants you

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
We're the kids of the future, whoa-oh
We're the kids of the future, whoa-oh
Everybody live 'cause the future is now
Na, na, na, na-na-na
Na, na, na, na-na-na
Na, na, na, na-na-na, sing
Na, na, na, na-na-na

[Verse 3: Joe Jonas]
Everyday we have fun, me and Wilbur
So happy to be here with the Robinson's
I finally feel I can be someone
Outside, a new day is dawning
Outside, todayland is sprawling everywhere
I know that it's right because

[Breakdown: Nick Jonas]
We'll save the future together
This family's forever

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
We're the kids of the future, whoa-oh
We're the kids of the future, whoa-oh
Everybody live 'cause the future is now
Na, na, na, na-na-na
Na, na, na, na-na-na
Na, na, na, na-na-na, sing
Na, na, na, na-na-na

[Outro: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
We're the kids, we're the kids
We're the kids of the future
We're the kids, we're the kids
We're the kids of the future
We're the kids, we're the kids
We're the kids of the future
We're the kids, we're the kids
We're the kids of the future

[Verse 1]
Stone love - she kneels before the grave
A brave son - who gave his life
To save the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love - a boy and girl are talking
New words - that only they can share in
New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning

[Chorus]
Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love - and how my God on high is
All love - though reaching up my loneliness
Evolves, by the blindness that surrounds him

[Chorus]
Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving

[Outro]

[Intro]
Ay Mane
I'm popping shit, man
Tell them niggas, if they tryin' to see me
504 the area code
70118 the zip code
That's right
One more thing
Don't touch my shit, nigga
Old South speakin' to you
That's right

[Hook]
Hey, when the pistol's in your rib, nigga
Drop it like it's hot (3x)
When I put one up in your wig, better
Drop it like it's hot
Hey, when I run up in your crib, nigga
Drop it like it's hot
Shit, nah, this here is not the remix
Just lil' old me, singing my shit, shit

[Verse 1]
I'm a Hot Boy. I drive a hot car
The type of nigga get brain in a cop car
Oh, that's your girlfriend
We call her slop jaw
Because she drink from a cock straw
I had relationships with a few pop stars
Wasn't serious, I was aiming for the pop charts
Now the young nigga livin' like a rock star
Only live 5 star, one bed, five whores
I'm a D-boy, but y'all know that
So when you see me, you ask me where the dope at
You wanna see me
Hey, you gon' need some more cash
I can't even hold a conversation with your broke ass
You ain't got more money than me
Think about it
Let's just say someone gave me a check
And took the ink up out it
Now all I can do is go to the bank about it

[Hook 2]
Hey, after you back it up then stop
Drop it like it's hot
Hey mama, pop that pussy then shake that ass
Drop it like it's hot
You gotta wobble-de-wobble and then
Drop it like it's hot
Shit, nah, this here is not the remix
Just lil' old me, singing my shit, shit

[Verse 2]
I got a sense of humor
But ain't shit funny
I see 'em get mad
But I just get money
My AK a bit runny
So you should either sniff or get hit from it
You get hit runnin'
Hate that I did something
If I did, let me know
I could get a lot of bitches
But my bitch could get me more
Different hoes, got 'em walking on their tippy toes
Talkin' with they pussy holes
Conversation, rule the nation
Here we go, I'm in Bal Harbour
Like give me those
Little man, I ball harder
My car's larger
I'm going farther than y'all could ever pardon
Sharpen my toothbrush, rush the fucking warden
Yeah, I'm part of a mobb daddy
And dyin' behind the sign
Is part of my job, mama
I'm hard as a rock
I'mma fuck me a thick bitch
Throw a CD at her
She drop it, dismissed, you got me

[Hook 2]

[Verse 3]
I go by Young Carter, father of one daughter
Bought her a cellphone, I call her every morning
I got my first check, I went and bought a V
Bought everybody's with my second
Call me Mr. Deeds
Hey Marley, twist the weed
Lauren, hold the pistol, please
Promethazine got me leaning like 6 degrees
I look Japanese, my bitch Blackanese
You see the guns I got
You know the cops ain't packin' these
They call me Weezy Baby
Please say the "Baby," baby
9-27-82, I'm an eighties baby
Y'all know the Birdman
I know the 80s, baby
So if you trippin'
I'mma take it back to 80, baby
You call me crazy, but
I call it brazy, baby
I'm from the dirty, we could dance
Patrick Swayze, baby
I rock a red flag, representing uptown
Only on the right side
Fuckin' with them Bloods now

[Hook 2]

[Outro]
When I heard this song, I got a little upset
But then I thought to myself
What haven't I done yet, fuck
Young Money motherfucker
Young Mane, Hot Spitta in the building
We got Lil Boo ridin' with us this time, nigga
Ay Mane
Nah, I ain't a hater, don't get me wrong
I made it a hot line, you made it a hot song
Peace

[Verse 1]
I'm an alligator
I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader
I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut
You're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Don't fake it, baby
Lay the real thing on me
The church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Make me, baby
Make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh-
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
(Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe)
('Lectric eye on me babe)
Put your ray gun to my head
(Put your ray gun to my head)
(Ray gun to my head)
Press your space face close to mine, love
(Press your space face close to mine, love)
(Press your space face close to mine, love)
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
(Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah)
(Freak out in a moonage daydream
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah...)

[Outro]
Freak out (Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out...)
Far out (Far out, far out, far out, far out...)
In out (In out, in out, in out, in out...)

[Verse 1]
When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating round

[Chorus]
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

[Verse 2]
Well, all the people have got their problems
That ain't nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again

[Chorus]
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

[Verse 3]
Satisfaction, satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a Hoochie Koochie woman
She calling from inside
She's a-calling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants
You can give her something too

[Chorus]
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Don't start with the ugly part
Don't end with the things that'll make them want to walk away
Tune in at the din again, another price ain't cheap
But somebody's gonna have to pay

Oh yes, you can only guess what it is, what it was
Don't remember what I had in mind
Shotgunning on a joy ride, coming down the block
Half-cocked nearly half the time

Give it back, give it back
Give it back, g-g-give it back, sing it

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
One time for the words divine
And two times for the things that you hope you never have to say
Three scenes in a dead man's dream, and the girls tell the boys
That they better fucking run away

Live it up or g-g-give it up, turn it up, tune it out
Let it rhyme with the other line
Shotgunning on a joy ride, coming down the block
Half-cocked nearly all the time
Give it back, give it back
Give it back, g-g-give it back, sing it

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Save me now
From this mess that I've created
All the souls have gone
And I'm stranded here with doubt and fear alone

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Tell me how
I'm in fault for all this madness
I don't know what's wrong
But I cannot help but try to push it

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
So far away
(In so deep and inside of me)
So hard to say
(I don't want to say it, anyway)

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
Save me now
I'm the mess I have created
And my soul has gone
For some reason, all I do is push it

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
So far away
(In so deep and inside of me)
So hard to say
(I don't want to say it, anyway)
So far away

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
It's so far away
(In so deep and inside of me)
So hard to say
(I don't want to say it, anyway)
So far away
(In so deep and inside of me)
So hard to say
(I don't want to say it, anyway)

[Verse: Mike Shinoda]
Listen, my blood feels like it's sitting still in my veins
My motivation was gone before it even came
Today and yesterday, they both seem the same
And no matter how I try, I just can't change

Give me one reason I should go outside
Everything'll be the same no matter what I try
Some people'll live and some people'll die
Some people'll build their whole life on a lie

I used to blame you for the things that I thought you'd say
So now, I can't blame you for going away
'Cause these memories are the blood beating under my skin
Repeating the same thoughts again and again

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Again and again
You said we couldn't last long enough
Or be strong enough
Again and again
You said our voices weren't loud enough
But we've had enough because
We want our future back
We want our own mistakes
To take our own path
We wanna do it again

[Instrumental Verse]

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Again and again
You said we couldn't last long enough
Or be strong enough
Again and again
You said our voices weren't loud enough
But we've had enough because

We want our future back
We want our own mistakes
To take our own path
We wanna do it again

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Again and again
You said we couldn't last long enough
Or be strong enough
Again and again
You said our voices weren't loud enough
But we've had enough because
We want our future back
We want our own mistakes
To take our own path
We wanna do it again and again

You said we couldn't last long enough
Or be strong enough
Again and again
You said our voices weren't loud enough
But we've had enough because

We want our future back
We want our own mistakes
To take our own path
We wanna do it again

[Intro]
Eee-eee!
Watch this, y'all
Comprende

[Gibberish]
Mama, uh, you understand that? (No)
Well, uh, like, huh, I don't understand how you can't
'Cause, like, I've been to, you know, Paris, Perú
You know, I mean, Iraq, Iran, Eucroatia, you know
I speak very, very, um, fluent Spanish
Uh, todo 'stá bien chévere
(Todo 'stá bien chévere)
Chévere? (bien) chévere
Is that right, mama?
Cause I got my shakin' 

[unintelligible]

[Verse 1]
Everybody's got a thing
But some don't know how to handle it
Always reaching out in vain
Just taking the things not worth having but

[Chorus 1]
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out

[Verse 2]
They say your style of life's a drag
And that you must go other places
But just don't you feel too bad
When you get fooled by smiling faces

[Chorus 2]
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out
When you get off your trip

[Bridge]
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing

[Chorus 2]
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing in the side
When you check it out
When you get off your trip

[Verse 3]
Everybody needs a change
A chance to check out the new
But you're the only one to see
The changes you take yourself through

[Chorus 3]
But don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, pretty mama
'Cause I'll be standing in the wings
When you check it out

[Outro]
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(Todo 'stá bien chévere)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(Todo 'stá bien chévere)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(Todo 'stá bien chévere)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Yeah
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, sugar
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
Don't you worry 'bout a thing hey
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, sugar
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Todo 'stá bien chévere

[Verse 1]
People keep on learning
Soldiers keep on warring
World keep on turning
'Cause it won't be too long

[Verse 2]
Powers keep on lying
While your people keep on dying
World keep on turning
'Cause it won't be too long

[Chorus]
I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
Because my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Going to keep on trying
'Til I reach my highest ground

[Verse 3]
Teachers keep on teaching
Preachers keep on preaching
World keep on turning
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh no

[Verse 4]
Lovers keep on loving
Believers keep on believing
Sleepers just stop sleeping
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh no

[Chorus]
I'm so glad that he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Going to keep on trying
'Til I reach my highest ground
Woo

[Outro]
'Til I reach my highest ground
No one's going to bring me down
Oh no
'Til I reach my highest ground
Don't you let nobody bring you down (They'll sho 'nuff try)
God is gonna show you highest ground
He's the only friend you'll have around
'Cause the rest of the world will bring you down

[Verse 1]
People hand in hand
Have I lived to see the milk and honey land?
Where hate's a dream and love forever stands
Or is this a vision in my mind?

[Verse 2]
The law was never passed
But somehow all men feel they're truly free at last
Have we really gone this far through space and time
Or is this a vision in my mind?

[Chorus 1]
I'm not one who make believes
I know that leaves are green
They only turn to brown
When autumn comes around
I know just what I say
Today's not yesterday
And all things have an ending

[Verse 3]
But what I'd like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful
Or do we have to find our wings and fly away
To the vision in our mind?

[Chorus 1]
I'm not one who make believes
I know that leaves are green
They only change to brown when autumn comes around
I know just what I say
Today's not yesterday
And all things have an ending

[Verse 3]
But what I'd like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful
Or do we have to take our wings and fly away
To the visions in our minds?
(Chorus)
This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
‘Cause sunshine due is just a cloud away way way way way way
Way way way way way way (hey baby!)

(Verse)
So what you blown a fuse (you blown a fuse)
Well that happens to us all (that
Happens to us all)
When I come with great news (I come with great news)
The day could change (change) change (change) change (change) change (change)

(Verse)
We all, of course, been there before
Been there cryin, fightin' the dark
But all that good energy be your strong
Won’t get away way way way

(Chorus)
This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
‘Cause sunshine due is just a cloud away way way way way way
Way way way way way way (hey baby!)
(Verse)
Well today the rock star (today the rock star)
Feels like singing the blues
(Feels like singing the blues)
Don’t abandon that song (Don’t abandon that song)
‘Cause the tune could change (change) change (change) change (change)
Change (change)

(Verse)
We all, of course, been there before
Been there cryin, fightin' the dark
Gravity doesn’t mean the Earth’s your ball-and-chain (chain) chain (chain) chain (chain) chain (chain)

(Chorus)
This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
‘Cause sunshine due is just a cloud away way way way way way
Way way way way way way (hey baby!)

(Bridge)
Everything is cyclical
What goes around us come back around baby
Everything boomerangs
What goes
Up must come down
Love is warm when it’s cold
Humanity will keep your feet on the ground
So do your thing through the rain
If you understand, won’t you sing with me now?
(Chorus x2)
This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got him
‘Cause sunshine due is just a cloud away way way way way way
Way way way way way way

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Ball player paper you would think I was a draft pick

[Intro]

[Verse]
Don't even know if summer gon' feel me
So many sides to a nigga
I wonder who's the real me
Tired of fightin'
Tired of always trying to enlighten
Hit the blunt that I am lightin'
To catch a spark cause I'm writin'
Some shit that'll cause a riot
Or make a war go quiet
Make a fat cat diet
Make the square bitch try it
Make a cheapskate buy it
Tell me who as high as this
Balenciaga kicks for kicks
Tell me who fly as this
Effortless, got dressed quick
You niggas stress at this
An hour on your outfit and
You still can't impress a bitch
I cruise through the city so mean
Gangster lean, with no promethazine
So obsessed with cream
I done hit the lottery in my dream like four times
Took a minute but I burst on the scene in '09
Now tell these hoes meet me and please be on time
She come up out the jeans, and it seems she want mine
For her unborn child
Girls gone wild meets black girl lost
She got the type of body, piss fat girls off
This ain't love dove, this lust
Do you know how fast that wears off
Let me take you back to queens
Where a nigga was a king, uncrowned
Country boy, new kid in town
Ran the streets after sundown
Hit the spots you wouldn't come around
Same block that Sean Bell was gunned down
Told that hatin' ass cop harrasin' me cause I am black
"You ain't have to do that man like that
The nigga ain't even do a crime, yet you squeeze 50 times"
He turned to me with a smirk "51 to be exact", damn
Cole world, no cupid
Got drama with these niggas fronting like they so ruthless
Ok I am supposed to like your record
Cause you got a little record
Tell me do that make you real
Or just real fuckin' stupid
Nickel and Dime nigga
Came back with the hustle but get with the times nigga
You live in rewind nigga
Real niggas believe in me
Cause ain't nobody seein' me
And the way I shine is intended to blind niggas
And I am ghost
Disappear like Copperfield in the six
Switch gears and cop a feel for your bitch
Yeah that yellow bone thing, that's my honey
Everytime my fucking telephone ring it's about some money
And you know that, nigga
You know that

[Outro]
Nobodies feelings getting hurt, nobody getting mad

[Chorus]
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you
Was sorrow
Sorrow

[Verse 1]
You acted funny trying to spend my money
You're out there playing your high class games
Of sorrow
Sorrow
You never do what you know you oughta
Something tells me you're a Devil's daughter
Sorrow
Sorrow
Ahh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I tried to find her 'cause I can't resist her
I never knew just how much I missed her
Sorrow
Sorrow

[Chorus]
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you
Was sorrow
Sorrow
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
With your long blonde hair
I couldn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hair

[Verse 1]
I'm closer to the Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowley's uniform
Of imagery
I'm living in a silent film
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm
Of dream reality

I'm frightened by the total goal
Drawing to the ragged hole
And I ain't got the power anymore
No I ain't got the power anymore

[Verse 2]
I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
Living proof of Churchill's lies
I'm destiny
I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets
Divine symmetry
Should I kiss the viper's fang
Or herald loud the death of Man
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

[Chorus]
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah!
Ah!

[Verse 3]
I'm not a prophet or a stone age man
Just a mortal with potential of a superman
I'm living on
I'm tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation
Of bullshit faith

If I don't explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it
On the next Bardo
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

[Chorus]
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah!
Ah!

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah!
Ah!

[Verse 1]
Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile as a rock & roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well, he can tell you that he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star

[Chorus]
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock & roll star

[Bridge]
I could do with the money (You know that I could)
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
(You know that I could)
I'd send my photograph to my honey
And I'd c'mon like a regular superstar

[Chorus 2]
I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star

[Chorus 1]
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock & roll star
Get it on, yeah

[Bridge]
I could do with the money (You know that I could)
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
(You know that I could)
I'd send my photograph to my honey
And I'd c'mon like a regular superstar

[Verse 2]
I could fall asleep at night as a rock & roll star
I could fall in love all right as a rock & roll star

[Outro]
Rock & roll star
Rock & roll star
(Just watch me now)

[Verse 1]
People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace

[Chorus]
And he was alright
The band was all together
Yes, he was alright
The song went on forever
Yes, he was awful nice
Really quite outta sight
And he sang all night long

[Verse 2]
Femme fatales emerged from shadows to watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs to make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady Stardust sang his songs of darkness and dismay

[Chorus]
And he was alright
The band was altogether
Yes, he was alright
The song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite paradise, and he sang
All night, all night long

[Bridge]
Ooh, how I sighed
When they asked if I knew his name

[Chorus]
Oh, it was alright
The band was alltogether
Yes, he was alright
And the song went on forever
He was awful nice
Really quite paradise, he sang
All night long

(Get some pussy now)

[Verse 1]
Well, she's a tongue twisting storm
She'll come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on electric dreams

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Verse 2]
We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well, the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the Blessed, we're The Spiders From Mars

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Bridge]
Come on
Lay it on

[Chorus]
Come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Outro]
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah

[Verse 1]
(Hey man) Oh, leave me alone, you know
(Hey man) Oh, Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
(Hey man) I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place
(Hey man) My schooldays insane
(Hey man) My work's down the drain
(Hey man) Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she

[Chorus]
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right

[Verse 2]
(Hey, man) Oh, Henry, don't be unkind, go away
(Hey, man) I can't take you this time, no way
(Hey, man) Dear droogie, don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

[Chorus]
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Oh, hit me

[Chorus]
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
And don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
Whoa, she's all right

[Outro]
A Suffragette City
A Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
Whoa, Suffragette city
Ooh, Suffragette City
Ooh-how, Suffragette City
Ooh-how, Suffragette City
Ooh-how, Suffragette
Oh, wham, bam, thank you, Ma'am!
A Suffragette City
A Suffragette City
Quite all right
A Suffragette City
Too fine
A Suffragette City
Ooh, a Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, Suffragette
Suffragette!

[Verse 1]
Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh oh, oh, oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

[Verse 2]
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

[Verse 3]
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural - religiously unkind

[Bridge]
Oh no, love! You're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no, love! You're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone!

[Outro]
Just turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone (wonderful)
Gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful (wonderful)
Gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful (wonderful)
Oh, gimme your hands

All night, we'll be blazin'

We can get high and enjoy the ride
Hold tight, we'll be alright

[Verse 1: J2K]
Uhh, J
Where we going?
Oi Wiley
I’m tryna work out, how I’m gonna work with it
Certified money if I'm banking it
She’s good food, I'm a good dude
Right, so I ain’t gonna ramp with it
First class money, I put my stamp on it
Hold you right there, like a clamp’s on it
And I’ll pay the money to put my hands on it
Now that’s fine, get it?
You get it and that’s mine
Now we’re good to go
She said she’s single, and that’s good to know
Cos she’s a game changer like when the whistle blows
She’s like a Christmas kiss under mistletoes
(Jheeze, jheeze)
Something about the way she
It’s something that’s so wavy
Got me overprotecting like she’s a baby
Crazy

[Verse 2: Wiley]
She wanna see me putting work in
It’s working, now we’re in the dance circling
She got the look in her eye, I know it’s worth it
Me and her being together, it seems perfect
She got something about her
I’m buzzing about her
Couple things that I’m loving about her
I’ve been searching
Everyday I wanna be round her, like her purses
Then I wanna talk about her in my verses
She like a Hershey bar, she got a sweet kiss
I be sipping a fruit punch, sweet lips
She gimme the feeling, so I done a remix
When I'm on the mic, I took the same route as a D6
Can’t believe it, it’s local love
I can see it, there’s hope above
Had it all in my head, now I've spoken up
I was asleep, now I've woken up
She’s mine

[Meek Mill]

Looking like a million bucks!! Smelling like a brick or raw
Went and bought a yellow Breitling, cuz these haters piss me off

Hopped out the wheel, drop like a buck eighty. When the medics came and they ain't even try to save 'em. They said "call the coroner, this one ain't a maybe." Mama came to view him she said "no that's not my baby. He don't look familiar." Is that getting real enough? We gon tear your brother up and show him to your mother. Yup!!!

Ha!! Flamers!!!
Meek Milly! Jahlil we did it again
And it ain't gon stop

[Verse 1]
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ﻿I was lost

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

[Outro]
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know

[Verse 1]
Waiting on the day
Where my thoughts are my own
When this house is my home
And plans are made

[Chorus]
When you'll be there for me babe
When you'll love me all the way
When you take my side in every little firefight
When you hang your things and stay
I'm waiting on the day

[Verse 2]
When my life on the run
Bleaches out in the sun
And shows my age

I'm waiting on the day
When that voice comes to say
It's not wrong what you did
For just a kid

[Chorus]
When you'll be there for me babe
When you'll love me all the way
When you take my side in every little firefight
When you hang your things and stay
I'm waiting on the day

[Verse 3]
Waiting on the day
When these words are in stone
When the kids are all grown
And we go dancing

[Bridge]
Oh can you do it babe?
Can you love me all the way?
Will you tie me tight in little strands of paradise?
Will you walk with me before the morning fades?

[Outro]
I'm waiting on the day

Come back
Come back in our home
Come back in our home
Come back in our home

[Verse 1: Drake]
Part of me wished I can meet with
All you haters in person, they got a lot of
Feelings for me they just ain't certain. How to
Express themselves when I walk into the club and
Take stares like the fuckin elevators ain workin
Yeah. Cause they know the promoter pays you, you wouldn't
Have come if somebody hadn't of made you, you just looking
Forward to seeing women that played you and shitting
On the men they get engaged to, I swear it's like. Uh
More confidence and less fear. We can discuss it further
When y'all manage to get here. Diddy here, O here
Skinny here, Rex here and we just having one of them conversations
About next year. I`ma kill it, I promise that`s how I know you
Mad. I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads. The
Big homie use a flash if you must and I swear I ain't asking
For much, all I want is the

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Hip-hop is like school, yeah I had to
Learn it. Beef is like a blank disc, yeah
I had to burn it. They finally showing me
Respect but I had to earn it. I'm heading to
The finishing line, ain't got no time for
U-turns. Today I realise that I'm not perfect
Everything I did to get here wasn't really worth it
Why won't they just let me be great. You fall down seven
Times you stand up eight. Realise true happiness lies
Inside of you. Everyday give yourself a mental shampoo
The birds singing after the motherfukin` storm gone. If you
Want to sing, you can always sing this song. Turn my swag
On, this my theme song, there`s 95 per-cent chance that I used to
Be your ringtone. I got swissel and cheese but I don't yodel
Heart tatted on my neck they love my vocal

[Hook: Trey Songz]

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
As I sit back and spit this crack and leaking
On the internet and watch my haters react
50 said they can't read between the lines so
I jab, uppercut, punchline after punchline
I know you thinking damn Soulja going hard
Right now. And I'm thinking damn this is just the
Start right now. Soulja Boy is going on a renegade
If life give you lemons make lemonade

[Hook: Trey Songz]

[Outro: Soulja Boy]
Uh, no one person on this earth can change their past
But every single person on this earth can start today
And change their future. That`s real shit. Beezy
Soulja Boy I tell 'em

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
I'm not your normal kind of rap singer
In the building where the subtle scent of crack linger
Fiends smoking off the foil
I only smoke shit from out the soil
Virgin oil, the name Bronson, no Arroyo
Barbecues get thrown with EBT Cards
Land and sea, the air, 3 stars
Till gold plates get made right on arrival
The Amarone got me spinning like a gyro
Take the high road, poppy seeds from Cairo
Aaron Rodgers style: I'm here to take the title
Rock a mask, dawg, 'cause every word is viral
To leave you like a wet noodle, paralyze your spinal

(Smoke this motherfucking weed real quick, hold on
I'mma get back to you in a minute)

[Hook:]
"Darling, let me lay besi—
Darling, let me lay besi—
Darling let me lay beside you
Kiss my burning lips about you"

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Dennis Byrd shit, china doll
Leave your fur split, dig your pockets
Then she'll kill your earth
Even if she's seven days away from giving birth
Ruthless, she'll catch you for your leather and your purse
Lamb roasting over wood-fire, extend the olive branch
Since the 90s I've been rocking hundred-dollar pants
Fifty-dollar drugs linger in my sock
Put the lighter to the plastic, that's the sealant for the top
'Cause we coming from the heights, you know I copped the puro
Tried to put it in the pussy, slid it in the culo
Damn, that's the wrong route
Now I gotta knee her in the stomach so it falls out
Take a deep breath
Ancient knowledge like the crocs up in the Nile
Alabaster tiles in the kitchen cause I'm wyling
Tryna cop a chain that say you styling
Only chain of interest in the water made of islands

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]
Wild world that we living in
I smoke drug got the subtle hint a cinnamon
My mind twisted from the Absinthe
You can thank Flushing for my accent
So much more than rapping
You fucking with the captain
Action Jeter
Salmon on the cedar
You ain't do the job, and then they calling a reliever
Me, Dennis Eckersley
Rhyme flavor like my grandma's book of recipes
I'm 'bout that equity
Large stocks, a palm Glock, bomb box
Long beards, knee draped in sports drop
Loafer pressing on the pedal
Extra heavy doggie cause my leg is made of metal
Often tangle with the devil
Shapeshifter, shaking with strange hands
Bronsolini fresher than Maine clams
Making money every day, it's been the motherfucking game plan
Remain tan during the winter laid in beige sand

[Verse 1]
Disco
GoGo dancer so rare
Move down, up slow
Prostitute stare
I do what I like
I just don't care

[Chorus]
I am my only god
I am my only god
I am my only god
Now

[Verse 2]
Black eyes
Short dress
Let's break it down
You shoot and I pose
Polaroid frown
I'll do what you like
I won't make a sound

[Chorus]
I am my only god
I am my only god
I am my only god
Now

[Verse 3]
Icon
Young star
Heroin fiend
Just sit and I'll sing
I'll be your queen
You know how I like
That celebrity type
Poor me

[Chorus]
I am my only god
I am my only god
I am my only god
Now

[Verse 1]
We were young
We were never growing old
And the glitter was still gold
They way it used to be
It was love
It was easy just to smile
It was easy for a while
The way it used to be

[Chorus]
But even stars, they fade
And colors turn to gray
And I miss yesterday
And the way it used to be
I can't turn back time
Even if I try
I miss you tonight
And girl, I miss the way it used to be

[Verse 2]
Look at you
You've got the life, the pretty house
But you must still think about
The way it used to be
Is it real?
He don't love you like I do
Can we just go back to
The way it used to be?

[Chorus]
'Cause even stars, they fade
And colors turn to gray
And I miss yesterday
And the way it used to be
And I can't turn back time
Even if I try
I miss you tonight
And girl, I miss the way it used to be

[Bridge]
Look at us
Just look what we've become
Just a shell of what was once
The way it used to be

[Chorus]
Even stars they fade
And colors turn to gray
And I miss yesterday
And the way it used to be
I can't turn back time
Even if I tried
I miss you tonight
And girl, I miss the way it used to be

[Outro]
Girl, I miss the way it used to be
Girl, I miss the way it used to be

[Verse 1]
Runnin' from cops, for hundreds of blocks
Like Short Dawg before he stumbled
And dropped
Gun in my crotch and its unloaded
I just toat it for fun hoping that one day
They catch me on camera like Gunplay
Gunbutting motherfuckers that's one way
To sell a album
Need all the help I can get
Cause on this shelf that I sit, its real lonely
My fans do they still want me?
They waitin', I am fightin' satan
He think I am his lil homie
These stories are metaphors
They hold a deeper message for those who fed up
Hoping you had my life instead of yours
They say the grass is always greener
The pussy's always cleaner on the other side
Until you mow the lawn with gonorrhea
And you realize you had it better
Way before the cheddar came
Looking back I wanted your respect and never fame
But you know the saying right Jermaine
Careful what you ask for
Cause even when you was mad poor
At least laughed more
Never thought I'd still be proving myself on my sophomore
I understand its been a year and a half since my last tour
But things have changed since I last seen the ring
But the one who seem to claim that he the king got a glass jaw
And I'mma break this shit
Cole World no handkerchief

[Interlude: (Charlamagne Tha God)]
Two classics....
Ahhh fuck, fuck me I was about to go off
(Well at least you wasn't reading off a blackberry
You know I was about to ask you about wondering)

[Verse 2]
Two classics and I am Kobe Bryant on some Laker shit
Fighting to make the playoffs
Writing and taking no day offs
I'm on fire like money hungry company lay offs
No pink slips if loose lips sink ships
Then God dammit ahhhh fuck these niggas Titanics
I am joking, only provoking
In hopes to go number one again
Hoping some rappers disses me just to make this shit fun again
It's no fair
Pac had Mobb Deep and Biggie
And I get left with is Tyrese and Diggy
This is bullshit

[Intro: Drake & Sampha]
It's not me and you, it's not me it's you
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 1: Drake, Drake & Sampha, Sampha]
Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said "no strings attached" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 2: Drake, Drake & Sampha]
She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Outro: Drake, Sampha]
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
I guess that's just the motion
Talking to you is not enough, no
I guess that’s just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
26 on my third GQ cover
Your new shit sound like you do covers
Of all of my old shit, oh shit
I'm devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed
Swear you niggas is hopeless
I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they winning
On some coach shit, 50 Ms for a three-month road trip
I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them
Drizzy still got some '06 in him
IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on
All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on
It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game
See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane
Pay yourself and owe yourself
Before you come to my city just know yourself
Know where you at
I'm good in every town, I'ma be there doing shows where you at
The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga

[Interlude: Dennis Graham]
But that’s… that’s where all this... that’s where the feeling is
That’s where all that shit comes from… man I mean like
The music that you and I used to listen to ahh.. was just..
Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all
We went through errythang...
I remember you loved Jodeci
I mean like studied, you even made me a CD…

[Verse 2: Drake]
Your money is just a little Barney’s Co-Op for you to be tryna show out
I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op
We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop
Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best MC
I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not
I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot
Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga
I Comedy Central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas
Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both, nigga
I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas
You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga
I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga
Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails
And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel
That five star in your city, they know where we at
I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Jodeci's back
You bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none
The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga
(Fuck you mean you ain’t got no condoms)
Jodeci's back
Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back
I paint pictures and flip words
Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back (Cole)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Roof top, hoes turnt up
Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up
Wonder where she is, fuck could she be?
She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak
Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak
Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me
Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas
Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas
Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain
Felt naked 'cause I laid out all my glory and my shame
Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame
'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no
Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters
I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest
Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started
I'm artistic, you ****** ** ******** ********
Hold your applause
Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?
David and Goliath, takin' on the giants
No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours, Cole
No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars
Tappin' into '94 Nas
Or that '96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre
Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy
Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for 12 hours
Just to get their dollar signed
Thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'
Trenchcoat flow, bottom line
To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine
Flow dumber than your projections
This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet
Your covers keep perplexin' me
Maybe it's too complex for me
But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?
'Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less than me
You legends know that we rap
Bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
Jump off the G4 we can meet out side
What you gon’ do?
Jump off the G4 we can meet out side
What you gon’ do?
Jump off the G4 we can meet out side
What you gon’ do?
Jump off the G4 we can meet out side

[Ludacris]
I say look up in the sky it’s a bird it’s a plane
It’s Luda and a hawk at 700 getting brain
Automatic pilot automatic dough
Jump off the G4 we can meet out side
I said look up in the sky it’s a bird it’s a plane
It’s Luda and a hawk at 700 getting brain
Automatic pilot automatic dough
Bitches on assignment automatic hoes
Press the start button let the games begin
Real recognize real let the lames pretend
What you see is what you get when Luda’s rapping
If I say then I've done or it’s about to happen
But I've said that before now I’m back to snapping
I’m an eight figure nigga and that’s just off rapping
So Imma tell you something different and I just might slap’em
Pour belvy on the nigga then I just might jack’em
Get it?
A little deeper than the average mind
My watch lasts a little longer than the average time
‘Cause I never been average I’m further above
If you've got chicks on your dick mines are further in love
You got a crew that be snapping? Yeah me too
Nigga you like rapping? Yeah me too
You got a wad full of cash? Yeah me too
Got a blunt full of hash? Yeah me too

[I-20]
You keep a squad in the hood nigga? Yeah me too
You got a dash full of wood nigga? Yeah me too
You got a pocket full of stones nigga? Yeah me too
You keep on repping for your zone nigga? Yeah me too
Dealer bitch yeah I’m back ignorant rap shit
And I got hype man but they ain’t here to do adlibs
So go ahead and judge a nigga ‘cause I say I so white
Life’s a craps game I stay screaming out hold dice
Tell G bet the house on me you heard what I said
Tell these niggas down on border man I can cover the spread
Yea they coming for my head but I ain’t made it that big
I got a hair trigger nigga that can split your wig
Right! Ya’ll the et cetera whatever I can brag about
All that local bullshit ya’ll love to hear us rap about
Niggas got a drought so ya’ll can’t serve it at home
Tell ya shooters we can cover it we got us a zone
And yea I’m good with this fucking shorty that’s no lie
I make a straight girl cry, turn a dyke bitch bi
Twenty-eight no backpacking but I’ll flip this pack
My desert eagle is a puncher ‘cause it push shit back

[Intro: Akon]
Konvict
Konvict, Music, and you know we Upfront

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know, girl

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Money in the air as mo' fell
Grab you by your coattail, take you to the motel, ho sale
Don't tell, won't tell
Baby say, "I don't talk Dogg, then she told on me", oh well
Take a picture with me, what the flick gon' do?
Baby, stick to me, and I'ma stick on you
If you pick me, then I'ma pick on you
D-O double G and I'm here to put this d— on you
I'm stuck on p— and yours is right
Rip ridin' the poles and them doors is tight
And I'ma get me a shot 'fo the end of the night
'Cause p— is p—, and baby, your p— for life

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know, girl

[Verse 2: Akon]
Shorty I can see, you ain't lonely
Handful of n— and they all got cheese
See you lookin' at me, now what it's gon' be?
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryna get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin' 'bout thirty stacks in the back
Make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-dealer use to move amphetamines
Girl I, spend money like it don't mean nothing
And besides, I got a thing for you

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know, girl

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg & Akon]
Mobbin' through the club and I'm low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoker's section (Just smokin')
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (Baby, I see you)
Hmm, it's cool, we jet, the mood is set
Your p— is wet, you're rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'
Your t— is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin' at me

[Verse 4: Akon]
Girl, and while you're lookin' at me, I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio, move the patty to the caddy
Baby, you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin' to just give you everything and that's kinda scary
'Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncin' got me tippin' my glass
Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know, girl, girl
From the power bestowed upon me by the third coast
Deep in the trenches of Atlanta where they learned most
You never heard before flows this extra ordinary
And if the burners blow foes is in the mortuary

Here to prevent the destruction of this rap music
Find a blank spot on my wall and put a plaque to it
I'm in the class all by myself nobody's messing with me
Feel free to ask about my wealth I got the weapons with me

So come and get me I'm here
Keep the semi-automatic near no need to fear I wipe out your windshield ‘til you see me clear

[Repeat]
I ruin careers so hide away your tears no shook ones here until you look inside the mirror
Shift rap into second gear stood up and I volunteer now the industry's screaming but can you hear
The ladies just cheer sometimes their lipstick will smear ‘cause in my line of work this He-man needs a She-Ra

I've been appointed straight from the power of Grayskull
Believe the master of the universe gets great skull
I'm so ferocious chopping heads off with my battle axe
Got many faces give them whiplash when I battle Zakk
A diabolical technology like Skeletor
But trained in the art of throwing you through the cellar door
I'm checking off my enemies until I get them all
With powerful beams that disperse from my Ludacris-tal balls
Until the system falls their families will miss’em all kiss’em all goodbye and I try to warn all of ‘em
I guess I really pissed ‘em off peel the cap and twist them off if you got homies then call all of ‘em
These bombs are ticking them off fans are ripping them off your CDs ain’t purchased people just borrow ‘em
And me I'm dismissing them all really insisting they all quit and hurry up before tomorrow comes!

I've been unleashed from the belly of the beast man
Let's have a feast I'll put the toast up to your teeth man
With a flick of my wrist switches I'll activate
Turbo packs which insure me that your back’ll break
As Mekaneck neck extends straight up and bends
You'd be wishing you wore Depends and called a couple friends
I’ll conjure potions that surge power from my finger tips
Don’t get the notion I can give some middle finger tips

It’s just a gift from me to you and there's no telling what we would do
I keep the crew close by and their ready to clap clap
I keep the beef in the stew till they look like Winnie the Pooh
If you have no clue then I recommend that you get back back
See I'm only keeping it true that’s what real players will do
And I'll let the hollow just spew you'd be under attack tack
And then I'll bid you ado and probably send you a few flowers to your funeral no way to snapback

A place where sorcery science and magic intertwine
And where mysterious forces maintain the streets is mine
With special automatic armor that contains gadgets
No one can get to my level I think the game’s had it
I can transform bionic appendages
Challenge your thoughts with these metaphors and synonyms
I shoot game through the sky at amazing speeds
Helping the industry curve at the time of need

[Verse 1]
Who's that lady (who's that lady)
Beautiful lady (who's that lady)
Lovely lady (who's that lady)
Real fine lady (who's that lady)

[Chorus 1]
Hear me calling out to you
Cause that's all that I can do
Your eyes tell me to pursue
But you say "Look yeah, but don't touch, baby"
Nah, nah, nah don't touch

[Verse 2]
Who's that lady (who's that lady)
Sexy lady (who's that lady)
Beautiful lady (who's that lady)
Real fine lady (who's that lady)

[Chorus 2]
I would dance upon a string
Any gift she'd want, I'd bring
I would give her anything
If she would just do what I say
Come 'round my way, baby
Shine my way

[Verse 3]
Who's that lady (who's that lady)
Beautiful lady (who's that lady)
Lovely lady (who's that lady)
Real real fine lady (who's that lady)

[Chorus 3]
I would love to take her home
But her heart is made of stone
Gotta keep on keepin' on
If I don't she'll do me wrong
Do me wrong, yeah

[Chorus]
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to

[Verse 1]
If you want me to love you, maybe I will
Believe me woman, it ain't no big deal
You need love now, just as bad as I do
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to

[Chorus]
It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do now
I can't tell you who to sock it to

Alright
Aw, have mercy

[Chorus]
Ah, it's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to, hit me man
It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to

[Verse 2]
I'm not trying to run your life
I know you wanna do what's right
Give your love girl, to whoever you choose
How can you lose, with the stuff you use now

[Chorus]
It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to
It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do
Don't let me tell you who to sock it to

[Chorus]
Let me hear ya say, "It's my thing (it's my thing)
I do what I want to do."
I can't tell you

[DMX]
Bark if you want nigga
I gots to let you know, I got them things
That'll get you gone nigga
When it's on nigga, we call it backfire
We air niggas out, it's like a flat tire
We some grown men, on some grown shit
On some "you best leave me the fuck alone" shit
We get it on quick, you know what type of shit this is
But we ain't getting drunk cause we don't need no witnesses
FUCK YOU to the judge, FUCK YOU to the police
Fuck the snitch in his fuckin ass, with no grease
We don't want no peace, war 'til we die
And we gon' get it in 'til we fall or we fly

[Hook 2X: DMX]
Get your money up! (What!) Get your paper
Right! (Yeah!)
Get your money up! (What!) Get your paper
Right! (Yeah!)
Get your money up! (What!) Get your paper
Right! (Yeah!)
And watch a nigga do his thing for real
AIGHT?

[DMX]
Back on the grind, back on the clock
Comin back for mine, back on the block
The kid is, back with the Glock to stick niggas up
Hear that meat wagon, come pick niggas up
What nigga, WHAT? You keep a dick in yo' mouth
I'm from New York, but I'm STILL the shit in the South
Motherfuckers don't wan' know about the Dog
And I ain't got no friend for, all of y'all
Look, shit now here gon' change nigga, for real!
Red dot on yo' brain nigga, for real!
I ain't got time for the bullshit

[Verse 1]
Ooh, this old heart of mine been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow, bringing you back again
Hurting me more and more

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing if I'm coming or going

[Chorus]
But I, I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes, I do (Yes, I do)

[Verse 2]
These old arms of mine miss having you around
Makes these tears inside start pouring down

[Pre-Chorus]
Always with half a kiss, you remind me of what I miss
Though I try to control myself
Like a fool I start grinnin'
'Cause my head starts spinnin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I, I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes I do, yes I do

[Verse 3]
Ooh, I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'
The way you treat me leaves me incomplete
You're here for the day, gone for the week now

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it
Tell the world about it

[Outro]
'Cause I, I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you (Darling, I'm)
I love you (Weak for you)
This old heart (Darling, I'm), darling, is weak for you (Mad about you)
(Darling, I'm) I love you (Weak for you)
Yes, I do (Darling, I'm), yes, I do (Mad about you)
(Darling, I'm) I love you (Weak for you)
Yes, I do (Darling, I'm), darling (Mad about you)

[Ronald Isley]
All babies together, everyone a seed
Half of us are satisfied, half of us in need
Love's bountiful in us, tarnished by our greed
When will there be a harvest for the world

A nation planted, so concerned with gain
As the seasons come and go, greater grows the pain
And far too many feelin' the strain
When will there be a harvest for the world

Gather every man, gather every woman
Celebrate your lives, give thanks for your children
Gather everyone, gather all together
Overlooking none, hopin' life gets better for the world

Dress me up for battle, when all I want is peace
Those of us who pay the price, come home with the least
Nation after nation, turning into beast
When will there be a harvest for the world?
When will there be?
I wanna know now, now
When will there be, a harvest?
When will there be, a harvest?
When will there be, a harvest?
When will there be, a harvest?
When will there be, a harvest?
When will there be, a harvest?
When will there be?
When will there be?
Everybody, talking bout the children
When will there be, a harvest?
When will there be?

[Verse 1]
I remember when I was much younger than now
I used to sit and listen to the news, I was the only child
And another day and another night
Wishin' daddy would come home, me and mom couldn't sleep at night

[Pre-Refrain]
He had just went off to fight
For the things we thought were right
So determined to survive
I believe he's still alive

[Refrain]
I sing the ballad for the fallen soldiers
This is a ballad for the fallen soldiers

[Verse 2]
I wrote to my congressman, he sends his regrets
That he's missing in action, but don't give up yet
So many people waitin' like me
Who's got the answer? What could it be?

[Pre-Refrain]
His country wanted him to fight
For the things they thought were right
And he tried to give his all
In DC his name is on the wall

[Refrain]x2

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Refrain]
He had just went off to fight
For the things we thought were right
So determined to survive
I believe he's still alive

[Refrain]x2

[Refrain]
Choosey lover
Girl, I'm so proud of you
I'm so glad you chose me, baby, baby
And I'll make you so happy

[Verse 1]
Thought I had a lover, thought I had a lover
But I was kiddin' myself, baby
By the time I learned about it
By the time I learned the truth about it
She was sleepin' with someone else, oh, but not you, baby

[Refrain]
Choosey lover
Girl, I'm so proud of you
I'm so glad you chose me, baby, baby
And I'll make you so happy

[Verse 2]
Cause you've given me, given me security
Given me security, baby and you're provin' what you said
I never worry about you, never worry about you, baby
Jumpin' in and out of bed, no, not my baby

[Refrain]
Choosey lover
Girl, I'm so proud of you
I'm so glad you chose me, baby, baby
And I'll make you so happy
Choosey lover

And I'll make you so happy

[Intro]
Whoa, la da da da da
Whoa, la da da da da
Whoa, la da da da da

[Verse 1]
Your face straight from a dream I had
Girl, you're bad, a complete woman
So impossible style
Glad I found you and made you mine
And you never judge me for my past
My play aways from way back
You still gave me a chance
And I'm glad just to be your man

[Refrain]
'Cause you're so perfect like an angel
So precious like a newborn
Just what I prayed for, girl, I know
Heaven hooked us up, heaven hooked us up
Breathless when I saw you
Love had no purpose 'till I met you
You're all I prayed for, I know
Heaven hooked us up, heaven hooked us up

[Verse 2]
I don't know where
You came and brought me hope
Thought I would always be living wrong
But now wherever you are, that's where I wanna be
'Cause my faith brought you here, my love keeps you here
My heart needs you here, my soul wants you near
Girl, your love feels so right
I'm happy that you're mine

[Refrain]
I know you're perfect like an angel
So precious like a newborn
Just what I prayed for, girl, I know
Heaven hooked us up, heaven hooked us up
Breathless, when I saw you
Love had no purpose 'till I met you
You're all I prayed for, I know
Heaven hooked us up, heaven hooked us up

[Bridge]
Oh, what I mean
Girl, I'll keep giving to you
And I wouldn't be
A happy man without you
It's like you fell from the sky
This perfect gift to me
Now girl, won't you let me hold you
'Till eternity?

[Refrain]
Perfect angel
Precious like a newborn
Just what I prayed for, girl, I know
Heaven hooked us up, heaven hooked us up
Breathless when I saw you
Love had no purpose 'til I met you
Prayed for, I know
Heaven hooked us up, heaven hooked us up
Perfect angel
Precious like a newborn
Prayed for, I know
Heaven hooked us up, heaven hooked us up
Breathless, saw you
Love had no purpose 'til I met you
You're all I prayed for, I know
Heaven hooked us up, heaven hooked us up

[Outro]
What kind of woman are you
To be so good to me?
And I wanna thank Him
For bringing you into my life

Whoa, la da da da da
Whoa, la da da da da
Whoa, la da da da da
Heaven hooked us up

Nothing is stopping you
Stopping you
Stopping you

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I know I'mma get it, I just don't know how
Heart up on the stage, body in the crowd
Parents always tried to keep me home
But I can't get paid from the crib, so I'll be gone 'til we on
What's up, Finally Famous
I had it on my jacket way back in high school
Know I wanted to be in them night clubs and not all off in that night school
So me and my niggas real life'd it, every week we did them cyphers
At the radio, had a crazy flow, man the city ain't heard shit like this
I woke up early on a Saturday
Said I'mma cash my check and hit some ass today
Hit the bank, my nigga called me like: "Go rap for Ye
He at the station, rap that shit that you rap everyday"
Man, that shit sounds stupid
Then I hung up on his ass, then called him back like "Fuck, let's do it"
I didn't even cash my check, man can't believe my ass pursued it
I didn't even have no gas but somehow God just lead me to it
Like, "Let's do it"

[Interlude: Kanye West and DJ Mo Beatz]
When I heard the songs he was doing
Man, I knew he had to be on G.O.O.D Music
(BIG! SEAN!)
(BIG! SEAN!)
(BIG! SEAN!)
(BIG! SEAN!)
(BIG! SEAN!)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Just to think, last night I was in Venice hugging bitches
Thanking God Almighty, condoms were invented
Cause I had a yellow bone that could've come from out the Simpsons
Man. who claim she never did it (Yeah right)
But under these conditions, she was with it
Then I hopped up on that red eye when I finished
I been gone for five hours, fuck, my head still spinning
Fucked the hotel up, shit she probably still in it
Getting rest that I be missing
But fuck it I'm on a mission
Flight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate
Now it's eight thirty, I'm officially late, for that eight o'clock spot
I know the Program Director hot
But I spit a freestyle up in there so cold
That everybody in that bitch forgot, now I'm running late for sound check
And I heard the line's already to the lot, walking out the station
And that's around the time that I got stopped, by this shorty tryna rhyme
Manager said we ain't got time, but time to time
You gotta make time when it's time for karma to come back around
I say "Aye dawg, What you got?", "Aw dawg, Big Sean, thanks a lot
Um, alright, it's that young renegade, man they been afraid
Tryna follow me get in a maze, Leave you minute maid
Um, I'm like a young black Eminem
It's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan
Tryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them
And a bunch of synonyms about how he was living and I even let him finish it
I mean I can't lie he was alright, but at his age, shit so was I
So I give him my email on a fly
And if his song's good I'll reply

[Interlude: Trick Trick and Shorty]
Trick Trick: Hello
Shorty: Ay nigga, Ay trick, where you at nigga
Trick Trick: Ay what up, whats good, whats up man?
Shorty: Ay bro, ay nigga I just rapped for this nigga Big Sean dawg
Trick: What!
Shorty: Bro, haha, I just rapped for this nigga Big Sean dawg, aye
Trick: Oh hell naw, what?
Shorty: Hey I ran into this nigga, but aye he cool as hell man
Trick: Awwww Dang! Tight!
Shorty: Bet, He short as hell though
Both: Hahahaha
Shorty: But that nigga was cool though man
Trick: Alright!
Shorty: Man just like how he spit a hundred bars, I spit like two hundred bars

[Outro 1: Big Sean]
Tell me what you know about dreams, what you know about having faith
In something you can't see, tell me how much do you believe
What you know about feeling something, that you can't even touch
What you know bout smelling something, that you can't even breathe
But when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on E
All the faith that you had, just ain't all the faith that you need
All the faith that I have, just ain't all the faith that I need
I'm sorry

[Outro 2: Mama Myra]
I know you're not my child talking like that. Focus on shifting this negative energy, into something positive. And the easiest way to do that, is to be grateful for all the things that you do have, for your health, for your family, your friends, all the people that care about you. You've got food to eat, you've got a place to stay. Ugh you know, let's feel good, let's get happy, boi! haha

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Gold teeth and a snapback
Camo shorts, high socks and hoodies
Animal print Joyrich backpack
Keep a Raw cone stuffed with goodie
Eyes low as hell, I rock old Chanel
Smell the kush smoke on my mink
Jacuzzi bubbles on my Cuban link
Sipping champagne, smoking marijuana
Every finger got a ring
You can tell just by our slang
Native print and skinny pants, young Americana
Two Cs on my frame, eating pasta with my team

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel

Polo Sport, nigga I'm on the field (coasting)
No Karo, we cracked the seal
Gotta make sure the act is real
Don't fingerfuck the bud, the pack is real
Fans hyped cause they lit us up
I'm high, don't really give a fuck
I Usain Bolt through Denim & Supply
I'm seasons ahead, you couldn't catch me if you tried
I run my lane so hard, my feet swell up
Continuous waves, word to my sea dweller
'Lo bears, I got so many
Foamposites like I know Penny
Bombay, no Henny
Keep nelly in that old Chanelly
Keep her earrings flooded and her wrists heavy
So when them bitches come through with them fake Speedy she laughin'
RLX'd up, like I came from the Aspens

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
That new BBC Barney's collab came out
I ordered me one, lit one up and got happy as fuck
Shout out to the niggas swagging me up
Cause now you think I get this shit off the back of a truck
I got so much of it
Flaunting pieces - one of a kind custom shit
Going on trips, I hope my luggage fit
You only rock it cause it got two Gs on it
My wife bag cost 6 G’s and got them two C’s on it
Plus, I'm smoking well
My outfit dope as hell
Trying to find out what I'm rocking to the Grammy's
Put that iPhone down fool, don't try to Instagram me

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel

[Intro]
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Baby, here we are again, ooh

[Verse 1]
I can see it in your eyes, you want a good time
You wanna put your body on mine
Alright, but don't change your mind
Don't you change it, oh, no
Oh, yeah, you called me today
Drove all this way, so don't let this buzz go to waste, oh, no
Your pleasure, pleasure island is where we can go

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I won't think you're easy, no, I won't think you're fast
Your eyes say amazing, but your lips came to ask
No need to fight it, when you know it feels right
You say you're a woman who knows what she likes

[Chorus]
Then show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah
Girl, show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah

[Verse 2]
Love the way that you laugh, the way that you smile
Makes me feel like you've been waiting a while
But, guess what, darling? I've been waiting, too
So let's grind, we can get freaky tonight
Right is your ticket to ride
Tell me, girl, what you gon' do?

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I won't think you're easy, no, I won't think you're fast
Your eyes say amazing, but your lips came to ask
No need to fight it, when you know it feels right
You say you're a woman who knows what she likes

[Chorus]
Then show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah
Girl, show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, uh

[Bridge]
It's gettin' freaky in this room, room, room
Now let me hear you say you want that boom, boom, boom
We can take it slow, we can zoom, zoom, zoom
Baby, if you're ready for that uh-uh-uh
It's gettin' freaky in this room, room, room
Now let me hear you say you want that boom, boom, boom
We can take it slow, we can zoom, zoom, zoom
Baby, if you're ready for that uh-uh-uh

[Chorus]
Then show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah
Girl, show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah
La Musica De Harry Fraud

[Intro]
Yeah, Irv (huh?)
Put a thousand on the grey dog (Which one, over there?)
I like that one (Alright)

[Verse 1]
Yo, the long trench wearer, money in my hand, I dare ya
To come and take this, find you in a basement naked
Plus it's rainin'
She took a sniff, now she dancin' like she Usher Raymond
See me swerving in the Lincoln with the Daytons
Seat colors Sanaa Lathan, kinda resembles fried bacon
I shoot at your crew, put the spoon inside the Tiramisu
As I sat there looking cute in a suit
Shit I made it cool
To be yourself again without nobody helpin' em
What is that velvet?
Yes it is baby, I'm a specialist
All these fuckin' demons that infest the kid
This be that shit that your grandfather's invested in
Dad's back, your new shit I had that
My new bitch is half black, Bimmer made the hatchback
I'm havin' flashbacks of razors in the ass crack
Hundred thousand dollars all in ones inside the trash bag
A bunch of fiends, I'm havin' lunch in Queens
A lot of hundreds in my Dungarees
I'm at the garden sittin' Indian style, that means I'm on the floor
My skin is shinin' like it's Armor All
Freak bitches like a carnival
Bitch I stay on the boat just like a barnacle
I don't talk to no sons so bring your father through
And I was born in December, paint the Impala blue
Bitch it's gettin' cold, huh

[Hook]
She sniff blow, did the heel toe
Off the wheel of the de Ville, then I peel slow
For real though, I'm trying to get Shaquille dough
Huh, I'm just trying to get Shaquille dough

[Verse 2]
Hang out the window of my sports car I'm listenin' to Prince
Bitch from Berlin is blowin' me behind the tints
Doves cried, then I let my nut fly in a sluts eye
Eyes still in the mirror lookin' for one time
When we were younger used to play in parks
Now my hunger got me drivin' European sharks
Lay in lofts, paint the hall a light Chilean moss
Shit I stay on the porch, lightin' a torch up like headlights on the Porsche
Tan coupin', work tanner than Cam Newton
Hand crafted Lands snoozin'
Susan, boufin' balloons in, shorty from Oahaxa
Husband back in México, cross this out his lock
Check came in it was $3500 just on the stomach
Imagine what we spent on weapons
And I have our bitch draped up in leopard
Joints filled up with pepper
I'm straight from Queens mother fucker, what you reppin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My bitch gallop like a tan deer
Stealin' outfits? from the Tangiers
I been a man here so many damn years
You see that plane, it lands here
You see that drop, that's to drive me away, I'm wearin' cashmere
Pink champagne spillin' down the glass again
I swear just one more score baby we cashin' in
Me and money got a good rapport
I shot the cuban whore, papi met his maker in the humidor
Dove off the boat with the briefcase, no police chase
Then I went and had a cheesesteak from Ishkabibbles
Hit the sizzle, control the whip with one arm like Richard Kimble
Bitch I've been the symbol
Bitch I've been the symbol
Bitch I've been the symbol
Bitch I've been the symbol
Bitch I've been the symbol

[Hook]

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Yeah, praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
'Cause by now, she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying "Fuck you," "I miss you," or "I hate you so much"
'Cause girls only say "hate you" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes, it goes
You say "Be real," I try, I don't
'Cause you take anything and just make it everything (God)
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring, funny, right?
And I never cheated; I mean, maybe once or twice
But one time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Interlude: Big Sean]
Okay, skeet, smoke, sleep, call, miss, text, woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa, ew, time, kill, months, still

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy (Yup)
I drank too much, please call me a cabby (Swerve)
Penthouse afterparty, hoes want the addy (Swerve)
Fuck, they can ride with us, crawl in the Caddy
Third row, that's when you call, I hit cancel
Really, I hit answer, fuck, I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like, "Why you still talk to my mama?
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo? Man, fuck this tattoo
You the reason I wasn't single in college
What, all because I had you?
Nigga, I don't even have you
How I'm supposed to get past you?"
Then she called the next guy, spillin' some real shit
Now they problems that he got to deal with

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Girl, don't believe them hoes
'Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Mwah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, "Ain't no woman like the one I got!"
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that'd make me a one-eyed fuck
I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, Lil Wayne, Big Sean, Jhené Aiko & Lil Wayne]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart (Tunechi)
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start (Damn)
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Outro: Jhené Aiko]
Baby, last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy, crazy, crazy
Baby, last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy, crazy, crazy

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Say, say, say what you want
But don't play games with my affection
Take, take, take what you need
But don't leave me with no direction

[Hook 1: Michael Jackson]
All alone, I sit home by the phone
Waiting for you, baby (baby)
Through the years, how can you stand to hear
My pleading for you?
You know I'm crying oo oo oo oo oo
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Now go, go, go where you want
But don't leave me here forever
You, you, you, stay away
So long girl, I see you never

[Hook 2: Michael Jackson]
What can I do, girl, to get through to you?
'Cause I love you, baby (baby)
Standing here, baptized in all my tears
Baby through the years, you know I'm crying
Oo oo oo oo oo
(You've got to say, say, say
You've got to say, say, say...)

[Bridge: Paul McCartney, Michael Jackson, and Both]
You never ever worry
And you never shed a tear
You're saying that my love ain't real
Just look at my face these tears ain't drying

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
You, you, you, can never say
That I'm not the one who really loves you
I pray, pray, pray, everyday
That you'll see things, girl, like I do

[Hook 2: Michael Jackson]
What can I do, girl, to get through to you
'Cause I love you, baby (love you / baby)
Standing here, baptized in all my tears
Baby through the years, you know I'm crying
Oo oo oo oo oo

[Outro: Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson]
Oo oo oo oo oo (say, say, say)
Oo oo oo oo oo
Oh baby

Oh baby
Oh baby

Oh baby

[Verse 1]
Here’s the deal
Open your eyes
Your life is a lie
Don’t say a word
I’ll tell you why
You’re living a lie
Your life is a lie
But you deny
You ever lied
Wondering why
Bury your life
Count your friends
On your hands
Now look again
They’re not your friends
Hold your breath
Everyone left
No surprise
Living a lie

[Verse 2]
Tell your wife
This is your life
Your life is a lie
This is your wife
Now she knows
She understands
Her life is a lie
Nobody wins
Try not to cry
You’ll survive
On your own (on your own)

[Verse 3]
Lessons in life
Your life is a lie
Now there’s no time
Wondering why
Where in the world
Is that girl?
He knows it’s alright
To live a life
Waiting to die
Not knowing that
Your life is a lie
Wondering why
Nobody writes
Hollow inside
Periods in light
Fire and ice
Your life is a lie
Your life is a lie
Your life is a lie
Your life is a lie
On your own
One more time
Your life is a lie

[Verse 1]
Alone she lies waiting
Surrounded by gloom
Invaded by shadows
Painting the room
The light from the window
Cuts through the air
And pins the child lying there
Scared of the moon

She pulls up the covers
And shivers in fright
She hides from the color
That rides on the night
The light through the window
That lights up the sky
And causes her mournful cry
Scared of the moon

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's nothing wrong
Don't be bothered they said
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry
It's really too soon
But there she lies shivering
Scared of the moon

[Chorus]
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon

[Verse 2]
The years go by swiftly
And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
When evening descends
The fear of a child
Still intrudes the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon

The feeling of terror
She felt as a youth
Has turned from a fantasy
Into the truth
The moon is the enemy
Twisting her soul
And taking its fearful toll
Scared of the moon

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But now there are others who sit in a room
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
Their lunacy shade
But knowing just why they're scared
Scared of the moon

[Chorus]
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon

[Outro]
Scared of the moon (scared of the moon)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
My green silken river and two lights
I could almost touch the free walls
When we were evicted from the heavens
Fast clouded-over bumbling eyes

[Verse 2]
Now peering out through a sinking
Cosmic smile, reversed completely
Flaming currents forced us to surface
Wet purple gowns and blaring alarms
All for some milky perversion
Nothing the spooks wouldn't be used to
Spoiled by an empty fear of violence
The only time I've ever been dropped

[Verse 3]
The minute the mirror turned its back to me
My distinct conviction of keeping
Eternal sources piled somewhere familiar
Was compromised and tangled in knots

[Outro]
For all I know we were sleeping
Arranged like Fate's vain infantry
Stacked in unconscious opposition
Blind and happy for tomorrow
For tomorrow...
For tomorrow...

[Verse 1]
Whenever I drift by the unknown
Feign like I notice a fundamental tone
The fine petals open and close offended
Poor explanation and nothing shown

[Chorus 1]
Kind of like if a friend exits without a sign
Glimmering like a precious stone
Maybe we shared a dream for 20 nights in a row
I might feel better knowing that I was alone

[Verse 2]
Wherever scientists turn lead to birds
Torment ignites essence, delights from the earth
What you find shocking, they find amusing
Something else to soften a sadistic urge

[Bridge]
When they tell you the extent of the vice
Then the prime time mission is to choke the statistician
And like the senses that you're lurking behind
While it gnaws right through to your core
Oh I'd twist it more

[Refrain]
If you think that you're free (Free like a kite)
Watching as it flies by (Spy the unknown)
Focus on the quiet oars
Tell me how far you'd go (Go where you like)
Knowing your air won't last (Last one to know)
Would you feel better holding the stars up

[Chorus 2]
What if the beast escapes (apes have it good)
And separates like a cloud (loud like a fault)
Seeps into the hollow bones
Wouldn't its eyes expand and zero in like a scope
I might feel better knowing I wasn't alone

[Verse 1]
Glowing in the shadows
Twisted in confusion
Grazing in the meadows
Voices in profusion
Colors, thoughts, emotions
Are trapped within the heart
Feeling no emotions
End without a start

[Chorus]
Introspection, what am I really like inside?
Introspection, why have all the prophets lied?
There's a season when I will find out where I am
And there's a reason, and I will someday find the plan

[Verse 2]
Striving for perfection
And hiding when it comes
Seeing its reflection
And the fire it becomes
Turning of the seasons
And turning outside in
Burning with the reasons
Burning for revenge

[Chorus]
Introspection, what am I really like inside?
Introspection, why have all the prophets lied?
There's a season when I will find out where I am
And there's a reason, and I will someday find the plan

[Bridge]
Tripled by the onslaught
Speeding feud of time
Dying by the unloved
Of voices in the pride

[Chorus]
Introspection, what am I really like inside?
Introspection, why have all the prophets lied?
There's a season when I will find out where I am
And there's a reason, and I will someday find the plan

Introspection, what am I really like inside?
Introspection, why have all the prophets lied?
There's a season when I will find out where I am
And there's a reason, and I will someday find the plan

Introspection, what am I really like inside?
Introspection, why have all the prophets lied?
There's a season when I will find out where I am
And there's a reason, and I will someday find the plan

[Verse 1]
I can still hear the reflections in the air
Feeding time
Either hemisphere, if it's summer there
Seeking you, taking a dive
Streets realigned
Ooh ooh ooh
Stored in my mind

[Verse 2]
All I could do not to steal
All the fun in the world
From your little heart
And now I owe it back to you
But it's hard to catch it and let it go
Find excuses to burn right through the grief
And to melt, to melt, to melt

[Refrain]
Oh my poor memories
Down to a trace
'Til you forget that, I'm alive
And you feel it's all right
Ooh I'm sure you'll be fine
Tune it out
And I'm sure you'll be fine

[Bridge]
Doing well
Finding an excuse
Shutting down soon (over my eyes)
Lost the recall

[Outro]
No line
Disprove
Mean time
Desperate
Confide
Inrush
Disprove
Mean time
Inrush
No line
Desperate
Confide
Inrush
Disprove
No line
Inrush
No line
Over my eyes...
Over my eyes...
Over my eyes...
Over my eyes...

[Verse 1]
Who is much more than a friend
But never by my side?
All beginnings are an end
In the blackness there’s a light
Maybe you will only read
One or two letters at the most
Shipping crates might line the streets
Every stranger is a ghost

[Verse 2]
Cashiers won’t deduct the pain
Loneliness sleeps on the couch
Only noticing the stain
Once the color’s faded out
Let’s go camping in the cold
Make a fire, buy a tent
Envision leather getting old
Re-send pigeons that were sent

[Verse 3]
Try to memorize your smell
It reminds me of a field
Crickets clearer than a bell
Have all their guts recast in steel
Birds don’t cry when echoes quit
They trail off into the fog
Autumn hurts far less than sticks
Knowing winter’s five feet tall

[Verse 4]
Generations of defeat
All assuming you're the worst
They never tied the cans
To the back end of a hearse
Take your hand against my own
If there’s a finger I can grip
Reassure me at the ace
Mine’s a black heart you could flip

[Verse 5]
I’ve come to terms with what I have
What’s been given, what’s been asked
Turn my back against the sea
And beg the serpent for a dance
But in the red dirt muddy towns
Celebration of the dark
Children walking hand in hand
With the pygmies in zee park

[Verse 6]
I can’t touch you only once
You always leave me wanting more
So keep my feet within the house
And stick my toes just past the door

[Outro]
Let me know when I’m in love
Let me die when I’m in love

[Verse 1]
There's plenty of girls in the sea
And plenty of seeds in a lemon
The trick is to try to stay free
When it's never that great to begin with
The surgeon performs precise little cuts
But he's never perfect, he's thinking too much
Oh, and it's really no comfort to me
There's plenty of girls in the sea

[Verse 2]
There's plenty of girls in the sea
And plenty of those are not women
As soon as you get yourself free
Then somebody stops you from swimming
The lifeguard admits, his whistle in hand
That it isn't the muscle, and it isn't the tan
No it's whatever you want it to be
There's plenty of girls in the sea

[Bridge]
Ah the passionate painter will say with a brush:
"It's best to accept it and not make a fuss
Oh, Just cause the grass isn't green"
Yeah, there's plenty of girls in the sea

[Verse 3]
There's plenty of girls in the sea
And plenty of clowns in the village
The trick is to try to be free
And tend to the void, don't just fill it
The bartender concedes, from inside his vest
That none of the best ones were ever the best
So keep it short, simple and sweet
Cause there's plenty of girls in the sea

[Outro]
(Plenty of girls) in the sea
Yeah, there's plenty of girls in the sea
(Plenty of girls) in the sea
Oh, there's plenty of girls in the sea
(Plenty of girls) in the sea
Yeah, there's plenty of girls in the sea
(Plenty of girls)
Whenever you want there to be

[Verse 1]
I'm a trainwreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle, yes, indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day

[Chorus]
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

[Verse 2]
I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention, I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes, I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I mean

[Chorus]
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you, you, you...

[Verse 1]
It can't stop now
The signs keep changing on me
Like a shimmering bell
Long waves enveloping me
And my plastic mind
So chewed and shrinking all the time
Feels it whirling by
Morning, afternoon then night
And I can't get down

*Break*

[Verse 2]
If I don't feel right
Polishing off the sand
Lay by me
And we'll erode
As gently as we can
Into the twilight
Into the twilight
Into the twilight
Into the twilight

[Instrumental Outro]

[Spoken Word: DMX]
Lord Jesus, you have brought me from a place so dark
To the point where I can now feel the love in my heart
And I know it's just a start, for there is more to come
So now I embrace it when I used to run
Didn't know what I was running from or running towards
Until one day I saw it; I was running from the Lord
And when I came back you accepted me with open arms and said "All is forgiven."
And I became so strong that I could fight off the devil with just spoken words
Say it, "Devil I rebuke you" and I saw that I was heard
'Cause no matter what I've been through, I could deal with it
And because of what I went through, I was still fitted
With the armor that comes with the blood of Jesus
Knowing even when we're suffering, He sees us
Or when you're lost He will lead the flock to find the one
Just like any father tryna find his son
And let me remind you, no matter where you at He will find you
And help you put the negative behind you
Lord, give me a sign!
Please let me know you're here, or at least let me know you're near
Remind me to call you, when we need you
Remind me to call you, because we all need to
And give us the strength to just make it through just one more day
In Jesus' mighty name, we pray
Amen

[Intro]
Oh, stealing moments just to be with you
Though it's wrong, it's hard to tell the truth, oh no
She don't have to know, she don't have to know

[Verse 1]
When I meet 'cha, I got my shades on to cover up my eyes
I'm hoping that nobody sees me passing by
Through my disguise I still know you recognize

But you, I know you got a little secret of your own
Sneaking out with me while your man's at home
You know you're wrong but it's so strong still carrying on

[Hook 1]
I go to the other side of town and so I
Never risk the chance will catch her eye
Oh no, she don't have to know, she don't have to know
Oh girl I know you're doing the same thing too
But I won't tell your man the things we do
Oh no, he don't have to know, he don't have to know

[Verse 2]
Someone's watching, we got to be careful next time or we're through
But damn it's so stressful doing the dirt we do
So sad but true, and I know one day I'm gonna pay

Then he ask me to sneak out of town for just a day or three
Go to DC and hold hands publicly all through the streets
Cause they don't know you and they don't know me

[Hook 2]
And oh I'll feel sorry for mistakes we've made
There's no reason that we should tell her today
She don't have to know, she don't have to know

Girl oh, though you give a lot of love to me
Girl I know I'm not the only one you see
But he don't have to know, he don't have to know

[Bridge]
Oh, it's getting crazy and I don't want to hurt my baby
And I know it's supposed to be the last time for you and I
But let's not end this way, just wait another day

[Outro]
Oh, I don't want to let you go and I
So I just can't let her go
She don't have to know, yeah, yeah
Oh I know you're doin' the same thing to her
Oh he don't, they don't have to know

[Intro: Trey Songz] + (Keri) + {Usher}

[Trey] YUP!
Lemme tell ya

I see ya girls checkin' out my trunks
I see ya girls checkin' out the front of my trunks
I see ya girls looking at my junk
Then checking out my rump, then back to my sugalumps

When I shake it, I shake it all up
You'd probably think that my pants had the mumps
It's just my sugalump bump-ba-bumps
They look so good that's why I keep em' in the front

All. the. ladies. checking. out. my sugalumps
They drive the ladies crazay

All these bitches checking out my britches
Put em' in a trance, when I wear track pants
My dungarees make them hungary
They're over the moon when I don pantaloons

My sugalumps are two of a kind
Sweet and white and highly refined
Honeys try all kinds of tomfoolery
To steel a feel of my family jewelry
My candy balls cause a kerfuffle
The ladies, they hustle to ruffle my truffle
If you party with the party prince
You get two complimentary after dinner mints

Girls surroundin' me when I'm standin' on the stoop
Givin' me gifts like free chicken soup
Book tokens, free chicken soup
Standin' on the corner going

We see ya girls checkin' out our trunks
We see ya girls checkin' out the front of our trunks
We see ya girls lookin' at our junk, then checkin' out our junk, then back to our sugalumps

[Rap by "Dave", played by Arj Barker]
Chillin in my store, doin' my thing
When in walks a guy with his dick in a sling
I'm like "holy shit, what happened to you?"
He said "how much will you give me for the family jewels?"
I said "Ten bucks." he said "No way!"
"Ten bucks and a frisbee?" he said "OK"
Then I took his sugalumps and put 'em up in a display
And sold them as hacky sacks later that day

All the ladies they want, a taste of my sugalumps
Sweet sugalumps yeah
All the ladies they want a taste of my sugalumps
Sweet sugalumps yeah
I think I've fallen in love with a girl, it's serious
Ooh, that's great news, Bret, tell me about that girl that's so serious
Well, I don't really know her
Ooh, that don't sound so serious
It's serious, I'm delirious
Sounds serious
Yeah
That's cool, I met a new girl too
Have you?
Yeah
One of those girls you met on the 'net?
No, we really met
Well, that's great news, what's she like? What does she do?
All I know, dog, is that she's careless with her dog
I'm not sure what she does, except she makes me want her
She makes me want to get on top of her
Oh, that sounds great, man, that's sounds great, hey, wait
What?
Maybe I'm crazy, but when did you meet this lady?
Just then
When?
Then
Right then?
Right then
Where?
There
Over there?
Over there
Over there there?
Over there there there
Just now?
Just now
How'd you meet your lady?

I was going for a jog then she lost a dog
I was running in the area and she lost a terrier
Was this about forty seconds ago?
No, about forty-three seconds ago

Ooooh, no, oh no
Oh no, oh no, oh no

No, no, what?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
No, I'm thinking what I'm thinking
So you're not thinking what I'm thinking?
No, cause you're thinking I'm thinking what your thinking
Are you talking about a girl with a beautiful smile?
Yeah
Like strawberry wine?
Yeah, yeah
Blueberry track suit pants?
White chocolate skin?
And socks?
That sounds like her
Hang on a minute, stop the track
Eugene, stop the track
Do you mean the girl who came up to us when we were running in the park just now and she was looking for her epileptic dog?
Yeah, that's the girl
Was her name Brahbrah?
No, I think it was Barbara
Her name was Brahbrah
It was Barbara, there's no such name as Brahbrah
It's Brahbrah
It's Barbara
It was Brahbrah
Barbara
Brahbrah
Barbara
Brahbrah
Barbara, Barbara
Brah
Bret, she was looking at me
No, she was looking at me
Bret, she was looking at me, she had her eye on my knee
Dog, I'm sorry, she had her eye on my guns
Are you loco? She was checking out my buns
No, bro, she had her eye on me
She had her eye on me
Well, how could she have her eye on both of us?
Wait a minute, you talking about the girl with the lazy eye?
I think she might have had a slightly lazy eye
We're both in love with a sexy lady with an eye that's lazy
The girl that's fly with a wonky eye
She's smoking with an eye that's broken, I think it's hot
The way she looks left a lot
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We're both in love with a sexy lady with an eye that's lazy
The girl that's fly with a wonky eye (Put your lazy eye on me, girl)
She's smoking with an eye thats broken, I think it's hot
The way she looks left a lot
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Demon woman
Demon woman

Demon woman
Your hair is like silk
Whilst you're curdling my milk
I know not of what ilk thou art

Demon woman, woman demon

Demon woman
You sit on a rock
Looking nice in your frock
But you're scaring my livestock

Demon woman, woman demon

Demon woman
You're making me moan
Turn my bone into stone
You're taking me home
To meet your familiars
Nice to meet you
You cast your spell
Very well

Demon woman
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Demon woman, woman demon
Ha ha ha...

Demon woman
You cut puppies' toes off
Pull an animal's nose off
How'd you magic my clothes off?

Demon woman
Take me back to your room
Make me howl at the moon
Make me pray to the temple of womb

Demon woman, woman demon

Your breasts are balls of flame
And I'm burning my hands playing these ball games

Demon woman
Demon woman (unholy woman)
Demon woman, woman demon
Ow woman wow wow wow
Ow woman wow wow wow
Devil in a cardigan
Ow woman wow wow wow
Ooh
Aaaaaaaaaaah...
Demon woman

[Verse 1 - Bret (Jemaine)]
I was wandering through the streets of the city
Rambling through the avenues of time
When from nowhere my eyes fell onto a girl
And by chance, her eyes fell onto mine

[Verse 2 - Bret (Jemaine)]
So I sat and I acted all nonchalant
She smoked her lavender cigarette
Reading the future that lay in my hands
My shadow played a bass clarinet
(Where are you going with this, Bret?)

[Verse 3 - Bret (Jemaine)]
We waltzed down a moonlit boulevard
Just two silhouettes in the mist(Oh, yes?)
Days went by and years went by
Moments went by when we kissed
(When was this?)

[Verse 4 - Bret (Jemaine)]
She said, "Your beard is woven of heartache
And we'll drink for the lonely tonight."
And the moon is a horny old drunkard
(Ah, Bret, could you please move over to your right?)

[Verse 5 - Bret (Jemaine)]
We drank dandelion wine and we reminisced
About the moment when we first met that day
(I'm trying to watch TV)
Then we reminisced about how we first reminisced
(Oh yeah? ...Sounds a bit gay.)

[Verse 6 - Bret (Jemaine)]
She handed me a broken memory
A keepsake to forevermore say
That a brief taste of love is as sweet as any
And with that, she made her way
(Oh, yeah? What was her name?)

[Verse 7 - Bret (Jemaine)]
She said her name was a secret
Then she said her name was Cherie
(Is her middle name Cherie?
So it's "A Secret Cherie", maybe?)
Mmm, maybe (What did she look like?)

[Verse 8 - Bret (Jemaine)]
She looked like a Parisian river (What, dirty?)
She looked like a chocolate eclair (That's rare)
Her eyes were reflections of eyes (Oh, nice)
And the rainbows danced in her hair (Oh yeah..)

[Verse 9 - Bret (Jemaine)]
She reminded me of a winter's morning (What, frigid?)
Her perfume was eau de toilette (What's that mean?)
She was comparable to Cleopatra (Quite old?)
She was like Shakespeare's Juliet (Thirteen?!)

[Verse 10 - Bret (Jemaine)]
The bohemians of Soho did pirouettes
As we waltzed through the streets of Manhattan
On rivers of ribbon and sailboats of song
(Bret, did any of this actually happen?)

[Verse 11 - Bret]
The girl I described, she's as real as the wind
It's true I saw her today
The other details are inventions
Because I prefer her that way

Petrov, Yelyena, and me. Lost, but happy, at sea
Petrov and Yelyena said to me "Shouldn't we have something to eat?"

Well, I say "There are plenty of fish in the sea"
But all they can see... is me

They say, "Any last requests?" Biding my time, I say "Yes
I want to party, just we three. Lost, but happy at sea."

So we drank all night from the keg
I passed out, then awoke with one leg
I said, "Petrov, have you seen my leg?"
He said "No" and he went back to bed....
But he looked suspiciously well fed

Three days later they were hungry again
They said, "Any last requests, my friend, again?"
I said, "Do you know any Rolling Stones?
You know, like you're at a rock concert going 'More, more!'"

[Spoken] "Ahh, it was a hilarious, hilarious moment in a very bleak, bleak time of my life."
So we danced all night to the Rolling Stones
When I awoke they were chewing on bones
Yelyena was supping blood from a cup
That's when I knew something was up

[Spoken] "Hey Petrov?"
"What?"
"What is that you're eating?"
"Nothing"
"It looks likea meat."
"Ohhhhh, this? It's umm, one of those, umm.....fish."
"How come it looks so much like my arm?"
"It's an.... arm fish."
"What about the fingers?"
"Fish fingers."
"Well, you see, the thing is, my arm seems to haveabeen hacked off at the elbow last night. I was just wondering if you might have seen it."
"Oh, yeah, look at that, no arm over there. Oh... don't you hate it when that happens? I don't know, um... you were very drunk last night. Perhaps you lost it?.. In a fair game of chance."
"Oh, you're probably right."
"Yeah, you know how it is when we're drunk."
"Yeah"
"'You say 'I'll bet my arm'"
"Oh."
"Just relax. Enjoy the sea, and have some more... fish."

Four months now lost at sea
My friends have almost finished me
Now they are using recipes....

[Spoken] Tonight, we are having some 'mie goreng'

"But wait, this 'You Goreng' is absolutely delicious. You should come over here right away and try some, you really would be proud of yourself."
"How can I?! You have eaten all of my leg!"
"OoOooooOooooh... someone obviously isn't getting any."

Late that night, while they were asleep
I swallowed some arsenic to poison my meat
I was very ill, but revenge is so sweet...
Unlike the last meal my comrades would eat

[Spoken] "Yes, eat it all up. Not so sweet all of a sudden, hmm?"

When I awoke, they were already dead
All that was left of me was my head...
No, not dead, just a head
Lost, but happy, at sea
Lost, but lonely, at sea
Lost, but so lonely...
At sea

Too many dicks on the dance floor
Too many dicks on the dance floor, too many dicks!
Too many dicks on the dance floor, too many dicks!
Too many dicks on the dance floor, too many dicks!

[Verse 1]
Going to the party
Sippin' on Bacardi
Wanna meet a hottie
But there's Adam, Steve and Marty
There's Billy, Todd and Tommy
They're on leave from the army
The only boobs I'll see tonight will be made of origami
Tell the fellas make it understood
It ain't no good if there's too much wood
Make sure you know before you go
The dance floor bro-ho ratio
5 to 1, it's a "brodeo"
Tell Steve and Mark its time to go
Wait outside all night to find
Twenty dudes in a conga line

[Hook]
Too many dicks on the dance floor, easy to fix
Too many dicks on the dance floor, spread out the dicks

[Verse 2: Arj Barker]
Too many dudes with too many dicks
Too close to my shit, too hard to meet chicks
I need better odds, more broads less rods
I came to do battle, skedaddle with the cattle prods
Too many men, too many boys
Too many misters not enough sisters
Too much time on too many hands
Not enough ladies, too many mans
Not enough ladies, too many mans
Not enough ladies, too many mans
Too many mans, too many mans

Oooohooooh
It's a cold night, beneath the street light, there's a man whose pants are too tight
Oh no, his pants are too tight
(My pants are too tight)
He stands there, an empty stare, trying to make enough money for his cab fare home
He'll have to walk home tonight
(Don't have enough for the ride)
The streets are cruel, he tries to act cool, he goes to work with only his one tool
You can put away your tool, Jemaine

You don't have to be a prostitute
No no no no no
You can say no to being a man ho
A male gigolo
You don't have to be a prostitute
No no no no no
You can say no to being a night looker, boy hooker, rent boy, bro ho

He can't see his way out
(I cannot see my way out)
He can't see his way out
(Male prostitution seems to be my only option)
He can't see his way out
(I cannot see my way out)
He can't see his way out
No, no, no, no, no
He's selling cheap thrills, to pay expensive bills
But check your résumé, you must have some other skills
Do you have any other skills? Like typing?

They see him, want him to please them, want him to play them, but they don't even pay him
Oh no, they don't think he's worth it at all
Don't think I know when, he tries to bring them home, maybe that would be a way if he lived alone
Oh, you have a roommate Jemaine, don't bring them home

You don't have to be a prostitute
No no no no no
You can say no to being a man ho
A male gigolo
You don't have to be a prostitute
No no no no no
You can say no to being a night looker, boy hooker, rent boy, bro ho

(Verse 1)
Loretta broke my heart in a letter
Told me she was leaving and her life would be better
Joan broke it off over the phone
After the tone she left me alone
Jen said she'd never ever see me again
When I saw her again, she said it again
Jan met another man
Liza got amnesia, just forgot who I am
Felicity said there was no electricity
Emily, no chemistry
Fran, ran, Bruce turned out to be a man
Flo had to go, I couldn't go with the flow
Carol Brown just took the bus out of town
But I'm hoping that you'll stick around

(Chorus)
He doesn't cook or clean
He's not good boyfriend material
(Ooh, we can eat cereal)
You'll lose interest fast, his relationships never last
(Shut up girlfriends from the past)
He says he'll do one thing and then he goes and does another thing
(Ooh
Who organized all my ex-girlfriends into a choir
And got them to sing?)
Ooh ooh (who? who? mmmm shut up)
(Shut up girlfriends from the past)
(Verse 2)
Mimi will no longer see me
Brittany, Brittany hit me
Paula, Persephone, Stella, and Stephanie
There must be fifty ways that lovers have left me
Carol Brown just took the bus out of town

(Verse 3)
Love is a delicate thing, it could just float away on the breeze
(He said the same thing to me)
How can we ever know if I'm the right person in this world?
(That means he looks at other girls)
Love is a mystery, it does not follow rules
(This guy is a fool
He'll always be a boy, he's a man who never grew up)
I thought I told you to shut up
Mona, you told me you were in a coma
Tiffany, you said that you had an epiphany
Mm
Would you like a little cereal?
Who organized this choir of ex-girlfriends?
Was it you Carol Brown?
Was it you Carol Brown?

(Outro)
Carol Brown just took the bus out of town
But I'm hoping that you'll stick around
Stick around
Stick around
Stick around
Stick around
There are angels

There are angels
Doin' it doin' it doin' it doin' it doin' it doin' it doin' it

Behind the shroud of the clouds
Foolin' 'round

In the clouds they're lying
Feathers flyin'
Angels sighin'

There are angels (ah ah ah)
Well there are angels (going down up there)
Ooh, angels (getting jiggy with it)

Nobody knows what goes on under those robes
Pushin' and puffin' and huffin' and heavin'

Up there they're playing the lovin' game

Turning white clouds gray

[Verse 1]
I’m countin' on a memory to get me outta here
I’m waitin' for the fog around this spooky little town to clear
All this time I’ve spent bein' someone else’s friend
Just one more time, for old time’s sake, I’d like to go back home again

[Verse 2]
The world had seven wonders once upon a time
It’s sure enough the favoured nations aided their decline
And all around me, I’ve seen times like it was back when
But like back then, I’d say amen if I could get back home again

[Chorus]
If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I’d never left, I’d never have known
We all dream of leavin', but wind up in the end
Spendin' all our time tryin' to get back home again

[Verse 3]
Could've been a jailbreak and the spotlight hittin' me
Or was I just some nightclub singer, back in 1963
In the old part of Valencia on the coast of Spain
Never tirin' once of hearin' songs about goin' home again

[Chorus]
If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I’d never left, I’d never have known
We all dream of leavin', but wind up in the end
Spendin' all our time tryin' to get back home again

[Chorus]
If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I’d never left, I’d never have known
We all dream of leavin', but wind up in the end
Spendin' all our time tryin' to get back home again

[Verse 1:Trey Songz]
Very little make up on, baby so flawless, oh
I just wanna wake up on, her body in the mornin'
My tender own ringtone, so I know when she callin' (She's my only love)
Shawty got an ass so fat, I love to jump on it
But she ain't, she ain't, she ain't my (yeah)
Me and her do it big, what it is
Six speed two seats to the crib (Come on)
And I'm feelin' on her thigh right now
And the ceiling is the sky right now
Legs, she working em'
Shoes, I purchased em'
Lambs and she keep em' on while we get our secret on
Hair, she keep it did
Yeah, we get it in, only on the weekends

[Hook]
Cause she ain't my girl, she ain't my girl
She ain't my girl, no she ain't my girl
While I be playin' with her body she be playin' with my mind
All the time cause her man ain't home
She ain't my girl, she ain't my girl
She ain't my girl, no she ain't my girl
Got a pretty lil' shawty
And i hit her lil' body every time cause her man be gone

[Verse 2: Sammie]
You ain't the only, homie
I've been there before
The way she be on me, moanin'
I dont wanna let her go, Nooo
We be gettin' all nasty like
She said her man don't be doing it right
So she holds me, closely
Then she feeds my appetite
I eat it up
Mmm mmm good
Her lovin' is so damn good Ohh
I can't front she know exactly what I want
But its only when her man ain't home

[Hook]

[Bridge: Trey Songz and Sammie]
I love to be up under that
She keep me coming back
All up in the sack
Like a quarterback
Then we run it back
Like a running back
And every time she leave
She make me want her back
Yeah (x15)

[Hook]

[Outro]
She ain't my girl, no, oh noo
She ain't mine no
She ain't mine no, ohhh oh
No no no noo
Yeah noo nah ah

Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?

Peep what I'm saying
Yo, yo, check it, yo

[Verse 1]
Yeah you cats is fly but your plane is crashing
You came and passed
My range blasting
I came slashing
Same fashion
That OJ stabbed him
My brain's packed with more lines than caine addicts
These insane raps should stay wrapped in a Straitjacket
You featherweight class bitch
Don't want mine
That's why your whole squad is telling me
"Pick on someone your own size"
I got the whole nine
Ain't perfect but I'm border lining
My album come with a surgeon general's warning on it (Sick)
I spit a born vomit
The hot shit
Even when I die shit
I'll still be the livest
Quit with the nonsense
You hating but you feeling it though
Stepped on stage
Got arrested for stealing the show
Stealing the zone
Never left it
Niggas never contested
On a five star scale you get one less then Texas (Get it)
I got narcoleptics
Why the whote now
When this shit goes down
Niggas barely show up when I show down
I hold ground
Go more rounds than carrousels
And you beating me only happens in fairy tales
You dreaming
My pieces is so dope you feinding
That Cole flow you sink
When I dive off the deep end
I'm head hunting
Heads front
But ain't said nothing
So heads up or spill red blood cause your head is gushing
Bitch what
No STD's
But still a sick fuck
You blast from point blank range and never hit once
I'm heaven sent
From devilish
To Specialist
You niggas couldn't make a good impression of what cements
So throw up the white flag
No need to fight back
Drop your mic
Head to the freezer
And grab the knife pack
Get your lights snatched
I'm cold as the ice cap
Sold my soul to satan
Turned around and stole it right back
I'm jacking dead broke folks cause I'm dirt poorer
I tried to ball but fouled out in the first quarter
Flagrant rhymes
The facts that you proclaiming
They aiming the same phrase as mine
Taking the same frame of mind
I'm out to shine on any track that I'm hopping on
Changing album names
The false alarm
It's not the bomb
The style is off the wall
Kick shit like Bandhan
Therapist is the man
Hands down like a handstand
With a grand flow and my heart had to follow
I'm so ahead of my time I wrote this rhyme tomorrow, what
The concept of reverse racism is flawed, if not absolutely ridiculous. Most, if not all of the negative responses from people of color toward white people, are reactions to the hatred, violence, cruelty and brutality that they were shown by white people for centuries. Much of the foundation of the modern world was built on the forced free labor of black peoples. The African Slave Trade, the institution of slavery, colonialism, its derivative systems, and the multiple holocausts throughout history, where whites used race as the defining reason to justify their oppression, conquest, and brutal treatment of non-white peoples, are how race became such a factor to begin with.

The initial claim by the oppressors, followed a moral imperative (so they said) that people outside of Occidental and European birth were in savage and cursed conditions, and that God justified the captivity of these people, and the rape and pillage of their lands.

Ironically, these oppressors would try to discard this same God, who supposedly justified this brutality, in the name of Darwin, whose famous line ‘survival of the fittest’ was used to justify criminal behavior once the Bible could no longer be used as a hiding place for economic domination and evil intention.

Spirituality and morality were replaced by capitalism, and with it a conscious shift of focus toward the exploitation of the vulnerable.

In order to justify reverse racism one would have to first create an even playing field, undo the generations of torture, terror, and brutality, and then judge whether or not a non-white person is in fact a racist. This approach would require people to examine the need/addiction to feel superior to someone else for no justifiable reason, and the myriad policies: Spiritual, political and social, that it bore. True dominion is self evident and not the result of sabotaging another in order to achieve it. That would be an illegitimate as well as a fleeting position. The Universe, will eventually seek to right/balance itself.

Of course there are white people who live transcendent lives, not exploiting ill-gotten privilege or perpetuating the sins of their ancestors who used violence and deceit as a means to gain advantage over others. Humanity in proper order is obligated to acknowledge the Truth, whoever it comes from, be they Black, White or other. Righteous indignation is simply a response to long-standing evil.

Much of the world is still reeling from the abuses of Imperialist selfishness, misunderstanding, ignorance and greed. Black people remain in many ways a shattered community, disenfranchised, forcefully removed from context and still caged in, denied from making truly independent choices and experiencing existential freedom. Their natural homes, just like their natural selves, raped and pillaged of the resources and gifts God has given to them. Interpreted through someone else’s slanted lens and filter, they remain in many ways, misrepresented. Taxation without proper representation, might I remind you, was the very platform of protest that began the Revolutionary War, which gained this country its independence from England. Anger is not only the natural response to the abuse of power, but is also appropriate when there is no real acknowledgment of these abuses, or deep, meaningful and profound change.

If we took all of what we deem horrible regarding the criminal abuses that black people have committed over this country’s history, and add it all up, it still does not compare to the hundreds of years of terrorism, violent domination, theft, rape, abuse, captivity, and beyond that black people have suffered under the ideologies and systems of white supremacy, racism, and slave based paradigms. I say this only to say that abuse unresolved begets or creates abuse. How then does the chief offender become the judge? Might does not necessarily mean right. Right is right. People forcibly reduced to sub-human existences, so that they behave in sub-human ways, helps a system to justify itself or feel less guilty about its blood saturated foundation and gross crimes against humanity. People, like plants, grow where the light is. When you enclose a plant and limit its light source, it will bend itself toward the light, for the light is necessary for its survival. This same thing happens to people locked in communities where little light and little opportunity is allowed them, survival then forces them to twist and/or bend toward the only way of escape.

There is good. And I both acknowledge and encourage the good. Instead of throwing out the Baby with the bath water, we do well to expose the intentionally poisoned water the Baby has been forced to soak in since its origin in these lands. America’s particular brand of hypocrisy is gross (double entendre).

I shuddered during sentencing when I kept hearing the term ‘make the IRS whole’… make the IRS whole, knowing that I got into these very circumstances having to deal with the very energies of inequity and resistance that created and perpetuated these savage inequalities. The entire time, I thought, who has made black people whole?! Who has made recompense for stealing, imposing, lying, murdering, criminalizing the traumatized, taking them against their wills, destroying their homes, dividing their communities, ‘trying’ to steal their destinies, their time, stagnating their development, I could go on and on. Has America, or any of the nations of the world guilty of these atrocities, ever made black people or Africa whole or do they continue to sit on them, control them, manipulate them, cage them, rob them, brutalize them, subject them to rules that don’t apply to all? Use language, veiled coercion, and psychological torment like invisible fences to keep them locked into a pattern of limitation and therefore control by others. You have to remain focused to cease from rage.

The prosecutor, who was a woman, made a statement during sentencing about me not doing any charity work for a number of years during my ‘exile.’ A) Charity work is not a requirement, but something done because someone wants to. I was clearly doing charitable works way before other people were even thinking about it. And B) Even the judge had to comment that she, meaning I, was both having and raising children during this period. As if that was not challenging enough to do. She sounded like the echo of the grotesque slave master, who expected women to give birth while in the field, scoop the Baby up, and then continue to work. Disgusting.
When you are beaten and penalized for being independent, or truly self reliant, then you develop a dysfunctional relationship with self-reliance, and a fear of true independence. When you are beaten or threatened with death for trying to read a book, then you develop a dysfunctional relationship with education. When families are broken up by force and threat of violence, then the family structure becomes dysfunctional. When men who would naturally defend their women and families are threatened with castration and death, then this natural response also becomes dysfunctional. When looking at the oppressor is punishable by violence, then examination of him and his system becomes a difficult and taboo thing to do, despite every bone in your body demanding it. When questioning or opposing oppression is punishable by death, imprisonment, or economic assassination, then opposing systemic wrong in any or all of its meta manifestations is a terrifying concept. Anyone forced to live so incredibly diametrically opposed to that which is natural to themselves, will end up in crisis if they don’t successfully find a way to improve or transcend these circumstances! All of which require healing. It is only by the Grace of God and the resilience of the people that things haven’t been worse.

Much of my music, if not all of it, is about Love, a therapeutic resolve created in response to the lack of messages encouraging people like me toward free moral agency. Helping to ameliorate this condition has never been addressed through the political arena alone. It is a sacrificial work that doesn’t simply happen between the hours of 9 to 5 or Monday through Friday, but when inspiration leads us to avail ourselves for the Truth that needs to be said. Unlike the system too often contrarily demonstrates, we believe that people can be and should be helped, and that trauma should not be criminalized but acknowledged, healed and dealt with. This takes awareness, sensitivity and a level of freedom in my opinion the system lacks. And if we don’t know or understand how to do it, then we humbly refer to a higher authority.

We have no desire to create humanoids, turn people into machines, or dumb them down so that they remain dependent longer than necessary to an antiquated system in denial of its many inadequacies and need to evolve. Instead we seek to educate and shed light on the snares, traps, and enticements that people set up in the name of business that are intended only to catch the sleeping and/or uninformed.

Why would a system, ‘well intentioned’, wait until breakdown or incarceration to consider rehabilitation, after generations of institutionally inflicted trauma and abuse on a people? To me it is obvious that the accumulation of generational trauma and abuse have created the very behaviors the system tries to punish, by providing no sufficient outlets for the victims of institutional terror. Clearly, the institution seeks to hide its own criminal history at the expense and wholeness of the abused, who ‘acting out’ from years of abuse and mistreatment, reflect the very aggression that they were exposed to.

[Verse 1]
Comes a time when you're driftin'
Comes a time when you settle down
Comes a light, feelings liftin'
Lift that baby right up off the ground

[Chorus]
Oh, this old world keeps spinnin' 'round
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time

[Verse 2]
You and I, we were captured
We took our souls and we flew away
We were right, we were giving
That's how we kept what we gave away

[Chorus]
Oh, this old world keeps spinnin' 'round
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Oh, this old world keeps spinnin' 'round
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time
There comes a time

[Outro]
Comes a time, comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time

[Verse 1]
It's alright, 'cause the historical pattern has shown
How the economical cycle tends to revolve
In a round of decades, three stages stand out in a loop
A slump and war, then peel back to square one and back for more

[Chorus 1]
Bigger slump and bigger wars
And a smaller recovery
Huger slump and greater wars
And a shallower recovery

[Verse 2]
You see, the recovery always comes 'round again
There's nothing to worry for, things will look after themselves
It's alright, recovery always comes 'round again
There's nothing to worry if things can only get better

[Chorus 2]
There's only millions that lose their jobs
And homes and sometimes accents
There's only millions that die
In their bloody wars, it's alright

[Bridge]
It's only their lives and the lives
Of their next of kin that they are losing
It's only their lives and the lives
Of their next of kin that they are losing

[Verse 1]
It's alright, 'cause the historical pattern has shown
How the economical cycle tends to revolve
In a round of decades, three stages stand out in a loop
A slump and war, then peel back to square one and back for more

[Chorus 1]
Bigger slump and bigger wars
And a smaller recovery
Huger slump and greater wars
And a shallower recovery

[Outro]
Don't worry, be happy
Things will get better naturally
Don't worry, shut up, sit down
Go with it and be happy

[Verse 1]
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
But mama, you been on my mind

[Verse 2]
I don't mean trouble please don't put me down or get upset
I am not pleading, or saying I can't forget you
I do not pace the floor, bowed down and bent, but yet
Mama, you been on my mind

[Verse 3]
Even though my eyes are hazy
And my thoughts they might be narrow
Where you been don't bother me
Or bring me down with sorrow
I don't even mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow
Mama, you're just on my mind

[Verse 4]
I'm not asking you to say words like yes or no
Please, understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go
I'm just whispering to myself so I can't pretend that I don't know
Mama, you're on my mind

[Verse 5]
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind

[Intro]
Soulja
Yeah
Whoop, whoop, whoop

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm ridin' through the city, bad bitch with me
Stacking up a milli', money to the ceiling
Let me show you how I get it, every day, I'm living
Lamborghini tinted, you can't see who in it

[Verse 1]
Ain't hard to tell I'm winning
I wake up and I get it
Balenciaga my kicks, that's just to be specific
I wake up in the morning
No time for that yawning
I just salute to my army
You know that I stay on it
My girl say she love me
I hit the stage, crowd go wild
Is she in love with me
Or in love with my lifestyle? (Lifestyle)
Got a bad bitch that drive me crazy
Pull up in a new Mercedes
We go shoppin', get it poppin'
We go hard, no option

[Bridge]
She too hot, I'm too cool
We get it poppin' in the swimming pool
We hit the club, she stuntin', I'm on one, I'm that dude
She too hot, I'm too cool
We get it poppin' in the swimming pool
We hit the club, she stuntin', I'm on one, I'm that dude

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm ridin' through the city, bad bitch with me
Stacking up a milli', money to the ceiling
Let me show you how I get it, every day, I'm living
Lamborghini tinted, you can't see who in it

[Chorus]
And we just ridin' 'round the city
Ridin' 'round the city
Ridin' 'round the city
Ridin' 'round the city
We just ridin' 'round the city
Ridin' 'round the city
Ridin' 'round the city
Ridin' 'round the city

[Verse 2]
They know that I'm standin' on red carpet wearin' all black
She asked for that D, so I had to give her that
Drop-top foreign, that thing cost a hundred racks
It ain't hard to see my body took a lot of tats
I'm grippin' grain, rollin' loud pack
I'm the ish, I'm all of that
If I go and spend it, you know that I'ma make it back
If I go and spend it, you know that I'm gon' make it back
Drop-top Phantoms, me and Stunna, that's back to back
On that South Beach, YMCMB and that Rich Gang been gettin' money
We on that, pull up in that Maybach
Hit the club, buy gold bottles, I make it rain with eight stacks
Gettin' money since day one, hold it down since day one

[Chorus]
And we just ridin' 'round the city
Ridin' 'round the city
Ridin' 'round the city
Ridin' 'round the city
We just ridin' 'round the city
Ridin' 'round the city
Ridin' 'round the city

[Chorus: Niykee Heaton]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Now I just feel like I'm gonna win
Whole mid-west side, that's my kin
Beneath your beautiful that's my pen
You trying to get dope but I just am
I was born with it, did a tour with it
Them overseas girls always give you more digits
I've been blessed, I done went shore to shore with it
Now trying to help a couple kids do more with it
Got some plaques on the wall and I'm still dope
I'm just trying to show the people that there's still hope
You buy a album and we serve up a meal bro
The label's like "That's gonna cost you a mill bro"
So be it, God told me to
And momma don't believe in that but I know it's true
We came to spread a little love that's what we gonna do
Finally Famous in the house that's the only crew

[Chorus: Niykee Heaton]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 2: T. Mills]
I bought it, I own it
You borrow, I loan it
I got people rocking clothes with my fucking name on it
She said "Milli do your thing"
So I built a stage on it, now my bed rocking
Rocking like one of my shows
All she wearing is perfume, she love my cologne
And I been waiting on my moment what feel like forever
But the more I think about it shit it's probably better
Cause I keep working, I keep grinding, I keep writing, I keep rhyming
I'mma turn a single stone into a pile of diamonds
I remember when I didn't have the funds to buy shit
Holla if that's something that you can identify with
But now I drop a grip on the jeans
And now I drop your rent on some weed
And now I'm making love on your sheets
I'm in your worst nightmare and in your girlfriend's dreams
Wake up, hello, tell me what you see
I'm a skinny motherfucker like six foot three
I said fuck a weight room, I was selling CD's
Getting more pussy than the whole football team
I was born in Riverside and I'm still that
Yeah I heard your new shit and it's still wack
Every time we get together you gonna feel that
This summer and the next, I'mma kill that, Mills

[Chorus: Mike Posner & Niykee Heaton]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 3: Sammy Adams]
I got them wetter than a Vilbrequin youngest of the champions
Beach house music, cue the dark pads and violins
Clear glass out in Malibu with all my friends
Me, Mike Pos, the Mills, and Niykee for the win
I'm growing up I gotta buzz call it motivation
Blowing up like iPhone push notifications
Priceless if I had it back I wouldn't change a thing
It's far from over so I tell the fat lady sing
And she hitting the notes and I'm starting to feel
Like I can't sit in coach cause I get fucking killed
Oh, I own it, oh oh, I'm on it
Cold like Winterfell I Game of Throne it
Hold it, hold it, did anybody notice
They all in the D now, Beantown we own it
Shouts to the D.O. Beantown we roll it
Yeah me and my Gs and we own it, yeah Sammy

[Chorus: Niykee Heaton]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 1]
Fake your way through a conversation
Tell her all the things you wish were true
Maybe you're the voice of a generation
And a princess somewhere waits for you

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you're never gonna change the world
If you're never gonna be a movie star
If you're never gonna change the world
Maybe you're looking too hard

[Chorus]
Don't synthesizer her
Don't redesign her
She's no prize for
A synthesizer

[Verse 2]
Pretend you meet your own expectations
Add another name below your list
Maybe you're the next world wide sensation
You probably know a thousand ones like this

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you're never gonna change the world
If you're never gonna be a movie star
If you're never gonna change the world
Maybe you're looking too hard

[Chorus]
Don't synthesizer her
Don't redesign her
She's no prize for
A synthesizer

[Bridge]
Who you gonna call when the spotlight flickers?
What you gonna do when your curtain falls?
Maybe you can make them not remember her
Maybe you won't end up alone

[Chorus]
Don't synthesizer her (Synthesizer her)
Don't redesign her
She's no prize for (She's no prize for)
A synthesizer (A synthesizer, a synthesizer)
Redesign her
She's no prize for
Synthesizer (Synthesizer)

[Verse 1]
Mama told me when I was young
"Come sit beside me, my only son
And listen closely to what I say
And if you do this, it'll help you some sunny day, ah yeah"

[Break]
(Be a simple man)

[Verse 2]
Oh, take your time, don't live too fast
Troubles will come and they will pass
You'll find a woman, yeah, and you'll find love
And don't forget, son, there is someone up above

[Chorus]
And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can?

Forget your lust for the rich man's gold
All that you need is in your soul
And you can do this, oh, baby, if you try
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can?
Oh, yes, I will

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Boy, don't you worry, you'll find yourself
Follow your heart and nothing else
And you can do this, oh, baby, if you try
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied

[Chorus]
And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can?

Well, alright

Well alright
Oh oh lord
Well alright
Oh lord
Well aright

[Verse 1]
Drive your high heel into my heart
I don't even care
Cause my pride is worth much more than your
Your stupid little love
Every word that you say keeps on bouncing around in my head
When all my delusions of grander have turned into bad jokes instead
You'll be there pointing and laughing to prove you were wiser than I
Well I'm just pretending perfection
I'm flying uncomfortably high

[Chorus]
It feels like I'm falling
It feels like I'm falling
It feels like I'm all in
It feels like I'm falling

[Verse 2]
Drive your high heel into my heart
'Cause I don't even care
My pride is worth much more than your
Your stupid, your stupid little love
Every word that you say keeps on bouncing around in my head
When all my delusions of grander have turned into bad jokes instead
You'll be there pointing and laughing to prove you were wiser than I
Well, I'm just pretending perfection
I'm flying uncomfortably high

[Chorus]
It feels like I'm falling, falling
It feels like I'm falling, falling
It feels like I'm all in, all in
It feels like I'm falling, falling

It feels like I'm falling, falling
It feels like I'm all in, all in
It feels like I'm falling, falling

[Intro]
Uh, I see everybody wanna play gansta now, huh
Well you know what niggas
I'mma just play Kendrick
You gotta respect it
Feel this
Uh, lemme shit on these niggas man

[Verse 1]
Look homie I'm not your crip or your blood
Homie I'm just Kendrick
See me other than him might plead the fifth amendment
Hard headed nigga shit all it take is an instant
Shocked to have scored just as soft as an infant
Say you bust your gun, but never totin' it
You say your man is dope I think he's smoking it homie
Why you provoking it don't mean to boast a bit
But you can call me a fly cause your boy be on some shit
Pussy fly so all the girlies think I'm the shit
I've got it to spend but still never buy them shit
You better guard your bitch
‘Cause all it takes is a finger to turn her on holmes
Something like a lightswitch
Hands down but still dark think I might switch the Jag for the Porsche
‘Cause it got a better steering grip
Young but been a man and you won't understand
Spree wheels looking like a bed room ceiling fan

[Hook]
When the beef start cooking
And the shots start coming
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
People start looking
And people start running
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
I be God damned
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat shit is me

[Verse 2]
(Nigga) I'm from the land where fiends fly like Peter Pan
And the average man got a heat up in his dickie pants
I got some plans, to stack riches
Own 76′s like a Philadelphian
You don't know but now I'm focused like camera lens
And if I know your mans I might give a second chance
‘Cause I don't wanna hurt you
Have ‘em running in herzels
Shells stick to his back like a ninja turtle
Crack sells, drug sell all in the virtue
Been an artist since Prince played in Color Purple
Weed smoke hydro blow on that purple
2 straps on my side like suspenders on Urkel
I suspend they murk you, what you lying for?
You know you ain't eating like feed the children commercials
Man my children circle around your block
Let out shots and be home 30 minutes before they curfew

[Hook]
When the beef start cooking
And the shots start coming
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
People start looking
And people start running
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
I be God damned
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat shit is me

[Outro]
It's real
Kendrick
See me in the streets man
Come to me as a man, man
It's real nigga
Kendrick
You gotta respect it
Niggas respect me man (K. Dot)
Stop being some yank nigga
It's real
Lotta niggas tryna play gangsta, huh
It's 2004 man
You up in this shit quit it
Be yourself man
Still affiliated
Niggas respect me, bitch

[Verse 1]
If you get lonely, think of me only
Prison isn't going to keep me from you
Remember Coney Island and how we
Went into the water, 'til the waves turned blue?
Nobody does have to know that our love's alive
Keep it on the low if you want to hide
Got that same address if you want to write
One Greenwich Avenue, wishing and thinking of you

[Chorus]
Living without you's like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly, I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

[Verse 2]
If you get lonely, think of this only
Heaven hasn't forgotten about you
Though you can't hold me, pick up and phone me
Use your one phone call on your ex girl, boo
I won't tell a single soul how you spend your nights
In that single cell, holding your pillow tight
If you really are afraid, then you ought to know
That you're the one I want, the one I want forever more

[Chorus]
Living without you's like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly, I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

[Bridge]
I know you get scared sometimes, boy
Nothing to be feared when you're in my heart
Troubles come in threes but in your case
They came in millions and trillions, but that's all right

[Chorus]
Living without you's like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly, I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

[Outro]
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white

[Verse 1]
Good times for a change
See, the luck I've had can make a good man turn bad
So please, please, please
Let me, let me, let me
Let me get what I want this time

[Verse 2]
Haven't had a dream in a long time
See, the life I've had can make a good man bad
So, for once in my life, let me get what I want
Lord knows it would be the first time
Lord knows it would be the first time

[Verse 1]
Oh, she can wait
For what I can give
She knows what I am but
She won’t believe me
Is it all okay?
Will I come off the lightest?
I can’t believe it
It’s always like this
(Like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this)

Kept it at bay
Yes, you kept your words
There on your mouth
But it’s not what I heard
If I follow the light
That I deem the brightest
I won’t believe that
It’s always like this

[Chorus]
(No, no, no...)
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I'm not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
But I'm not gone

[Verse 2]
Oh, you can wait
For what I can give
You know what I am
So you know how I live
Try to look proud
But you’re not in the slightest
It's happening now
And it’s always been like this
(Like this, like this, like this...)

[Chorus]
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all

I'm ridin' through the city
Bad bitch with me
Stacking up a milli
Money to the ceiling
Let me show you how i get it
Everyday I'm living
Lamborgini tinted
You can see who in it


Verse 1: ain't hard to tell I'm winning
I wake up and I get it
Balenciaga my kicks, that's just to be specific
I wake up in the morning
No time for that yawning
I just salute to my army
You know that I stay on it
My girl say she love me
I hit the stage, crowd go wild
Is she in love with me
Or in love with me lifestyle?
Got a bad bitch that drive me crazy
Pull up in a new Mercedes
We go shopping, get it poppin'
We go hard, no option
We too hot, I'm too cool
We get it popping in the swimming pool
We hit the club, she stunt and I'm on one, I'm that dude
We too hot, I'm too cool
We get it popping in the swimming pool
We hit the club, she stunt and I'm on one, I'm that dude
(Hook)

Verse 2:They know that I'm stunting on red carpet wearing all black
She asked for that D, so I had to give her that
Drop top foreign, that thing cost a hundred racks
It ain't hard to see my body took a lot of tats
I'm gripping grain, rolling loud pack
I'm the ish, I'm all of that
If I go an spend it, you know that I'mma make it back
If I go an spend it, you know that I'm gon' make it back
Drop top Phantom, me & Stunna, that's back to back
On that South Beach, YMCMB, that Rich Gang been getting money
We on that, pull up in that Maybach
Hit the club, buy gold bottles, I make it rain with eight stacks
Getting money since day one, hold it down since day one

[Produced by Thelonious Martin]

[Sample]
You know that you could be walking down the street and find a treasure
And suddenly the world you see, you feel comes the pleasure
Inside of me you feel that life’s for real
And you always want to spend your love about
Could you be down so long
Just sharing's what is all about

[Verse 1]
Uh, smoke rising from the vehicle, it’s been a long ride
They want me off, but I’m still high
Still pushing that hooptie on the 105
Cross the bridge still rising, see that skyline
Got me feeling alive
Niggas said that I would perish, I didn't budge
Couldn’t stop me, bitch, I’ve been known for the missing love
Trippin', tough, like I was ten seconds from giving up
Hit them up
We can see you kicking dust into these niggas, mention us
Lived to prove against the odds
It’s really nothing, I feel ‘em coming
I’m christening for young gun and devil on my back
Feel like I’m sitting in the oven hot
Living how I want, got me some money
Can you judge me? Naw
Still they do, it’s just something that I don’t listen to
Still I grew, thriving on, I feel like I was slipping through
Sticking truth, tended to the mission, cause a nigga knew
I’m about to fly if they let me out this pigeon coop

[Verse 2]
As I’m blazing this weed
As my mind start racing and my eye sights bleed
As the quickie world turns and I define my G
I don’t sleep, too busy, trying to find my peace
One time for my niggas with a vision of the pictures
Stay determined in your work, well versed in your scripture
We’re together when it hurts, never let them see you injured
Make the reflection in your mirror, offer something to remember
Do it single-handedly even when they say you can’t
You never needed company, all you needed was a chance
All you need is to believe, you can see is this shit advance
Ain’t scared of you nigga, but fear a nigga with a plan, uh

Oooooh, God...
