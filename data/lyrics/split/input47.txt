There's a star in the east on Christmas morn
Rise up shepherd and follow
It'll lead to the place where the Savior's born
Rise up shepherd and follow

Leave your ewes and leave your lambs
Rise up shepherd and follow
Leave your sheep and leave your rams
Rise up shepherd and follow

Follow, follow
Rise up shepherd and follow
Follow the Star of Bethlehem
Rise up shepherd and follow

If you take good heed to the Savior's words
Rise up shepherd and follow
You'll forget your flocks
You'll forget your herds
Rise up shepherd and follow
Leave your ewes and leave your lambs
Rise up shepherd and follow
Leave your sheep and leave your rams
Rise up shepherd and follow

Follow, follow
Rise up shepherd and follow
Follow the Star of Bethlehem
Rise up shepherd and follow
This old guitar taught me to sing a lovesong
Showed me how to laugh and how to cry
Introduced me to some friends of mine
And brightened up some days
It helped me make it through some lonely nights
Oh, what a friend to have on a cold lonely night

This old guitar gave me my lovely lady
It opened up her eyes and ears to me
It brought us close together
I guess it broke her heart
But it opened up the space for us to be
What a lovely place, a lovely space to be

This old guitar gave me my life my living
And all the things I know I love to do
To serenade the stars that shine
From a sunny mountain side
Most of all to sing my songs for you
Ooh, I love to sing my songs for you
Yes I do,Lord, I love to sing my songs for you
If it's the last thing I do, I'll make you mine
Darling, the first thing is you in my design
Just like the stars guard the moon above me
Thats just how I'll guard our love, so love me
Please love me

If it's the last thing I do, I'll take your hand
And though I won't say a word, you'll understand
I'll build a dream just for two
And then I'll make it come true
If it's the very last thing I do

Just like the stars guard the moon above me
Thats just how I'll guard our love, so love me
Please love me

If it's the last thing I do, I'll take your hand
And though I won't say a word, you'll understand
I'll build a dream just for two
And then I'll make it come true
If it's the very last thing I do
This old town ain't been the same
Since this old boys been gone
Lord I still got some good friends
But I feel so all alone
All I hear is disco
See pretty boys with high heels on

Well some people sure hate me
An the police dog me round
Well the only place I'm welcome
Is on the west side of town
Lord I'm on their wanted posters
I can't show my face in town

Play this one for south side...

Jacksonville, I love you
But you don't want me around
Jacksonville, you raised me
And this is where I got my sound
Although I'm your outlaw
I still love my hometown, all around
Ahh this is for the west side boys..

This old town ain't been the same
Since your native sons been gone
Lord, I still got some old friends
But I am so all alone
All I hear is the disco
See pretty boys with high heels on
Well you can keep your disco
Pretty boys with high heels on
I was born the running kind, leaving always on my mind
Home was never home to me at anytime
Every front door found me open I would find the back door open
There just had to be an exit for the running kind

Within me there's a prison, surrounding me alone
As real as any dungeon with its walls of stone
I know running's not the answer, but running's been my nature
And the thing in me that keeps me moving on

I was born the running kind, leaving always on my mind
Home was never home to me at anytime
Every front door found me open I would find the back door open
There just had to be an exit for the running kind
Neon magic, a playground for the noise
Got the boys feeling tough, acting rough
Looking for trouble?
You better mind your tongue
Having fun much too much
Chasing cars, hit and run

They try their hardest
To stand out in the crowd, talking loud
Neon girls carrousels
Show off their colours
For some local fame
That's the name (of their) game
Acting cool, out of school
You're the same
'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse

In my mind, I want you to be free
For all of our friends
Would you listen to me
Now hear what I say
We wish you a Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas)
To each (To all of you) one of you
Mhm

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep, sleep in heaven, heavenly peace

Go on and rest your mind
And sleep
Sleep, in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born, oh yes
Christ, Christ the Savior is born

What a joyous day
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Silent night (As I sit around by the fireplace)
Holy night (Watching the gleaming tree)
All is calm (If I had one wish in this world)
All is bright (It would be that all men would be free)
'Round yon virgin Mother and Child
(Let's celebrate the Savior, let's give thanks unto the world)
Holy Infant so tender and mild (Jesus is born)
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep (Sleep), sleep in heaven, heavenly peace

Just sleep, and relax your mind
To all our family and friends
I want you to remember this line (Merry Christmas)
Merry Christmas (To all of you)
And we mean it, Merry... (Merry Christmas)
Merry Christmas (To all of you)
Merry Christmas from The Temptations

Floating in the River Jordan

(J): And if you haven't got yours, send four pence in and get a free one!

(G): And seeing as (*since?) we're gathered around the Christmas microphone here in the studio, we might as well get together with a little Christmas message for you

(P): Which goes something like this...

(G): ... like this

(J): (Singing)
Christmas comes but once a year
But when it does, you know it's here
Because we've got a hmm-mm-mm-aam-
Singing

Christmas comes but once a year
But when it does it brings good cheer

(G): Has he turned it off?

(G): Have you turned it off, lad?

(P): Hey, basher!

(J): It's still the same

(P): Turned it off, basher?
I was cutting a rug
Down at a place called Jug
With a girl named Linda Lu
When in walked a man
With a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you know who

He said, "Hey fat fellow
With the hair colored yellow
Watcha tryin' to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there
And I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you"

I said, "Excuse"

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shakin' like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, mean
Big and bad, Lord
Pointin' that gun at me
Oh, wait a minute, Mister
I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble with you
And I know you don't owe me
But I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you

Oh, won't you give me three steps
Gimme three steps, Mister
Gimme three steps towards the door
Gimme three steps
Gimme three steps, Mister
And you'll never see me no more, for sure

Well, the crowd cleared away
And I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you son
Well, it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four

Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lu
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door
Oh, won't you give me three steps
Gimme three steps, Mister
Gimme three steps towards the door
Gimme three steps
Gimme three steps, Mister
And you'll never see me no more

Show me the back door

[Chorus]
Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

[Verse 1]
Last Saturday night I got married
Me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife are parted
I'm going to take another stroll downtown

[Chorus]
Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in the town
Sometimes I take a great notion
To jump into the river and drown

[Chorus]
Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

[Verse 3]
Stopped ramblin', stopped my gamblin'
Stopped staying out late at night
Goin' home to my wife and family
Gonna stay by the fireside bright

[Chorus]
Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

Irene goodnight (goodnight), Irene goodnight (goodnight)
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams (goodnight)

Goodnight Irene (goodnight)
Goodnight (goodnight)
Irene  (goodnight)
Irene  (goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Well I'm walking this lonely street
But I'm far from bein' alone
'Cause everyone I meet
Has nowhere to call home
So they move on from day to day
Just to stand in a line

Well my mother she comes to me
And begs me not to fight
For the sake of the family
I have to stay out of sight
So I move on from day to day
Just to stand in a line

On the road again
For a job I never find
People talking...
As if we're not their kind
I got a handbill
Says there's work up here
Left my homeland...
And paid a price too dear
I've come to the end of the line
There's too many men
Despair in their faces...
Each one of us hoping to find a life
A home, a dream...
Within the line

I ain't helpless
I just need a hand
These are hard times
For every kind of man

I've come to the end of the line
There's too many men
Despair in their faces
Each one of us hoping to find
A life, a home, a dream
A place to be

I've come to the end of the line
There's too many men
Despair in their faces
Each one of us hoping to find
A life, a home, a dream
A place to be
This song is dedicated
To the city of New Orleans
From the whole world, let's go

I feel your heartbeat, I see your tears fall
I see your hands go up, now you've given up on it all
I see your head go down, I know you've lost hope
You're walls keep on comin' down and you can't take no more

Every road you travel seems like your journey's end
That life's an endless battle that you can't seem to win
Well I say, stand up and claim what's yours
Leave those troubles behind and don't you look back no more

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine

I know your struggles and I feel your pain
You're doin' everythin' to stop yourself from goin' insane
Tryin' to find the strength to fight your way back
But life keeps swingin' on you 'cause you're under attack
You prayed and cried about it but still no change has come
My life is livin' proof that you're not the only one
And that's why I say, stand up and take your place
Hold your head up high and put a smile upon your face

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine

When the storm sends it dark clouds
(And put it right over you)
And a step seems like a million miles
(And you don't know what to do)
You gotta stand and be strong now
(You've got to get up now)
And the morning will come and victory will be yours, yours

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
(No matter the weather)
Let your light shine, let your light shine
(We gonna shine together)
Way down upon Sycamore Slough
A white man sings the blues
Selling roses of paper mache
With flecks of starlight dew
I swiped a bunch and threw it your way
Where hazy moonlight glowed
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Way down upon Shadowfall Ward
End of the avenue
Run, hide, seek in your own backyard
Mama's backyard won't do
All night long I sang Love's Sweet Song
Down where the water flowed
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Moonlight wails as hound dogs bay
But never quite catch the tune
Stars fall down in buckets like rain
Till there ain't no standing room
Bright blue boxcars train by train
Clatter where dreams unfold
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Way down upon Seminole Square
Belly of the river tide
Call for me and I will be there
For the price of a taxi ride
Night double-clutches into today
Like a truck downshifting its load
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Thread the needle
Right through the eye
The thread that runs so true
All the others I let pass by
I only wanted you
Never cared for careless love
But how your bright eyes glowed
Way down down along Lazy River Road
I'm a glum one
It's explainable
I met someone
Unattainable
Life's a bore
The world is my oyster no more
All the papers
Where I lead the news
With my capers
Now will spread the news
Superman
Turns out to be flash-in-the-pan
I've been around the world in a plane
Designed the latest IBM brain
But lately
I'm so downhearted
'Cause I can't get started with you
In Cincinatti
Or in Rangoon
I simply smile
And all the gals swoon
Their whims
I've more than just charted
But I can't get started with you
O tell me why
Am I no kick to you
I who'd always stick to you
Fly through thin and thick to you
Tell me why I'm taboo
Each time I chanced
To see Franklin D
He always said
Hi buddy to me
And with queens
I've a la carted
But I can't get started
With you
Over the ground lies a mantle of white
A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night
Two hearts are thrilling
In spite of the chill in the weather, ooh, the weather

Love knows no season, love knows no clime
Romance can blossom any old time
Here in the open, we're walkin' and hopin' together
Together, together, together

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can built a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?"
We'll say, "No, ma'am!"
But you can do the job when you're in town"
Later on we'll conspire, as we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can built a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling?
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland
Open your heart and let it grow
Show me your love, show me love
'Cause this is our chance at liberty
There's no one but us, it's you and me
Go on babe, don't give up on us
Choose me and I'll show you love
Go on babe, don't give up on us
Choose me and I'll show you love
Let me show you love
Hey Adam, you'll never guess what I saw last night
What?
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus. That's right
Oh no
They were listening to music, and their voices were low
And he looks a lot like someone that you and I both know!
Who?

Well, I saw Santa rockin' round the Christmas tree
And Mama was as close to Santa as you are to me

They filled up the socks
But before he could go
They started to kiss

Santa just couldn't go

Well, I saw Mama help Santa decorate the tree
With little bitty presents and candy canes for you and me

He started to leave...
Mm!
Then he turned around
I made a noise
*Clunk*
I was sure to be found!
Well, I saw Mama kissin' Santa 'neath the mistletoe
Yeah, and he looked like someone I thought you oughta know
Got your midnight invitation
Wrote it different from before
Somehow I just don't get excited like I used to
Just to stand before your door

Even though you broke my dreams
And destroyed my will to give
I cannot wait I won't refuse
I'll not forget but I'll forgive

Put it back the way it was
Put it back that way because
You have broke a faithful heart
And you've torn it all apart
You let me down
When it was up to you

Once you gave me sunny mornings
We were happy then that way
You were warm and sweet and loving
I wanted nothing but to stay
Now I ain't coming back forever
But I'm coming back for more
Keep your grieving invitations
Go on eat your heart outside your door

Put it back the way it was
Put it back that way because
You have broke a faithful heart
And you've torn it all apart
You let me down
When it was up to you

Put it back the way it was
Put it back that way because
You have broke a faithful heart
And you've torn it all apart
You let me down
When it was up to you

Oh you let me down
Oh and it's up to you
Oh I'm feeling down
Oh and it's up to you
Well I, I just came back today
I just came back from the storm
Yeah!
I said: I just came back, baby
I just came back from the storm
Yeah, from the storm
Well, I didn't know it then
But I was sufferin', sufferin'
For my love to keep me warm
It was so cold and lonely, yeah
The wind 'n' cryin' blue rain
Were tearing me up
It was so cold and lonely
The crying blue rain was tearing me up
Oh, tearing me up. (tearing me up)
I wanna thank you my sweet darling
For digging in the mud and picking me up
(Thank you baby)
Thank you so much!
(Thank you baby)
(Thank you baby)
(Thank you baby)
It was a crying blue rain burning my eyes
The wind and lightning struck by a surprise
It was you my love who brought me in
I love you so much
I'll never stray from you again
Hey!

I just came back baby
I just came back to get my baby on her way
Yeah, yeah
I Wish You Love Lyrics

Goodbye, no use leading with our chins

This is where our story ends

Never lovers, ever friends

Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day

But before you walk away

I sincerely want to say

I wish you bluebirds in the spring

To give your heart a song to sing

And then a kiss, but more than this

I wish you love
And in July a lemonade

To cool you in some leafy glade

I wish you health

But more than wealth

I wish you love

My breaking heart and I agree

That you and I could never be

So with my best

My very best

I set you free

I wish you shelter from the storm

A cozy fire to keep you warm

But most of all when snowflakes fall
I wish you love

But most of all when snowflakes fall

I wish you love

I wish you love

I wish you love, love, love, love, love

I wish you love
From the bottom of my heart I love you
What more can I say?
From the bottom of my heart I need you
You're part of my day

My inspiration is you alone
To call my own
I love you, I love you

From the bottom of my heart I want you
It's you I adore
Ev'ry moment we're apart I miss you
And, darling, what's more

I'd be on my way to heaven
If you'd say "I love you from the bottom of my heart"

From the bottom of my heart I want you
It's you I adore
Ev'ry moment we're apart how I miss you
And, darling, what's more
I'd be on my way to heaven
If you'd say "I love you from the bottom of my heart"
She stepped down from her carriage at 10 Vermillon Street
I took off my roustabout and slung it to her feet
We went into her parlor and she cooled me with her fan
But said i'll go no further with a fantasy makin' man
I said i'd walk on Ponchatrain for what you have today
Just to drink from your deep well and i'll be on my way
She laughed and heaven filled the room said this i give to you
This body's wisdom is the flesh,but here's a thing or two
Death and hell are never full
And neither are the eyes of men
Cats can fly from nine stories high
And pigs can see the wind
She let me make my pallet in the moonlight on the floor
Just outside of paradise but right in hell's back door
The image of her nibbled at the eye of my soul
My dreams were a hurricane and quite out of control
Then her voice came through the storm it's more than flesh ideal
You will have to pay for any wisdom that you steal
I awoke to tinted windows and lavender and red
The first station of the cross is just above my head
I awoke to gargoyles and a hard bench for my bed
Jesus Christ and Pontias Pilate were just above my head
Death and hell are never full
And neither are the eyes of men
Cats can fly from nine stories high
And pigs can see the wind

[Verse 1: Damon Harris and Otis Williams]
Money, I ain't got none
(Where I was born, everything was dull and dingy)
Job, can't find one
I lived in a place they called the inner city
The streets raised me from a baby
(Getting ahead, huh, was strictly a no-no
'Cause nobody cares what happens to folks that live in the ghetto)

[Verse 2: Richard Street and Damon Harris]
Thousand of lives wasting away
People living from day to day
This is a challenge just staying alive
'Cause in the ghetto, only the strong survives

[Verse 2: Damon Harris and Melvin Franklin]
Broken down homes, kids strung out
They don't even know what life's all about
Stealin' cars, robbin' bars
Muggin', drugs, rat-infested and no one's interested

[Verse 3: Richard Street and Damon Harris]
Kids dodgin' cars for recreation
Only adds to a mother's frustration
Break-ins, folks comin' home and findin' all their possessions gone
Oh ho

[Outro: Dennis Edwards]
It's an every day thing - well well - in the ghetto
It's an every day thing in the ghetto

[Verse 1]
The boat rides we would take
The moonlight on the lake
The way we danced and hummed our fav'rite song

[Refrain]
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

[Verse 2]
The midway and the fun
The Kewpie dolls we won
The bell I rang to prove that I was strong

[Refrain]
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

[Bridge]
The early morning hike
The rented tandem bike
The lunches that we used to pack
We never could explain
That sudden summer rain
The looks we got when we got back

[Verse 3]
The leaves began to fade
Like promises we made
How could a love that seemed so right go wrong?

[Refrain]
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

[Verse 4]
I've tried so to forget
At times I do, and yet
The mem'ry of you lingers like our song

[Refrain]
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

[Intro]
You are my everything
You are my everything
You, my everything
Everything, everything, everything

[Verse 1]
It's all because of you, I'm never sad and blue
You've brightened up my days in your own special way
Whenever you're around, I'm never feeling down
You are my trusted friend, on you I can depend
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred to me the first time I saw your face
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

[Chorus]
You are my everything
Love so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything and everything is you

[Verse 2]
My darling only you can make my dreams come true
And every night I pray, you'll never go away
I promise I will try until the day I die
To treat you like a king cause you are my everything
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you

[Verse 3]
When you're lovin' me, put your lovin' arms around me
When you're lovin' me, said I feel so safe, I find security
When you're lovin' me, forever I want you to hold me
My everything, my every, every, every, everything

[Chorus] + 

[Bridge] + 

[Chorus]
You are my everything
Love so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything and everything is you

[Outro]
And I thank you, thank you, thank you
I'm a king bee baby, buzzing around your hive
I'm a king bee baby, buzzing around your hive
Yeah I can make honey baby, let me come inside

Well I'm a king bee, want you to be my queen
Well I'm a king bee, want you to be my queen
Together we can make honey, the world has never seen

Well I'm a king bee baby, come buzz all night long
Well I'm a king bee baby, come buzz all night long
Yeah I can buzz better baby, when your man has gone

'Cause I'm young and able to buzz all night long
I'm young and able mama, Lord to buzz all night long
And you know together we can make some honey
Like the world ain't never known

Pull your car in my driveway, cut your bright lights way down low (note 1)
Drive your car up in my driveway, mama, cut your bright lights way down low
I'm gonna wind up your transmission
Till your motor won't run no more
Hello there, is there any air? Can you slow me down?
Can you believe that what you see could never ever be so real somehow
Down to earth, my merry men
There's some help needed here and you're there
You can see if you stand on your chair
That there's millions and millions and
Millions and millions of people like

Hello there, Do you really care? Have you time to learn?
Could you believe that what you read
One thousand pages couldn't tell you why
Down to earth, my merry men
There's some help needed here and you're there
You can see if you stand on your chair
That there's millions and millions and
Millions and millions of people like you

That there's millions and millions and
Millions and millions of people like you

[PROLOGUE]
NARRATOR:
Once upon a time, or maybe twice, there was an unearthly paradise called Pepperland. Eighty thousand leagues beneath the sea it lay... or lie, I'm not too sure.

[00:01:49 THE BLUE MEANIES OVERLOOK PEPPERLAND]

CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Pepperland is a tickle of joy on the blue belly of the universe. It must be scratched.
Right, Max?
MAX:
Yes, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
What?! We Meanies only take NO for an answer. Is that understood, Max?
MAX:
No, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
That's better. Are the troops in readiness?
MAX:
No, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
The Bonkers?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Clowns?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Snapping Turks?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Anti-music missiles?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
The dreadful Flying Glove?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Splendid! Today, Pepperland goes blooey! Fire!

[The first blue bubble encloses the stand where the band plays. Everybody runs scared.]

FRED:
The Meanies are coming! The Meanies are coming!
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Glove, Glove, come here, Glove! Look out there, and what do you see? Tell him, Max.
MAX:
Someone running, Glove.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Yes. Well, you'll soon put a stop to that, won't you, Glovey? Go, Glove, point! And having pointed, pounce down! I haven't laughed so much since Pompeii! What?! What?! What?! The Glove is losing his touch. Do your worst! Explode them!
FRED 

[to the GLOVE, which is pointed him]:
It's not polite to point!
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Thing of beauty... Destroy it for ever!
FRED 

[to the MAYOR and other three people who are playing music.]:
Sir, Sir, the Meanies are coming!
MAYOR:
Not here, young Fred. They wouldn't dare.
FRED:
They would. They are. What are you going to do?
MAYOR:
Finish the quartet.
BLUE MEANIES:
Fire!

[One bomb gets one musician.]
FRED:
Trio, sir.

[Another bomb gets the second musician.]

FRED:
Duet, sir.
MAYOR
Duet?

[The third musician is hit with a bomb too.]

FRED:
Solo!
MAYOR:
Young Fred, the Blue Meanies are coming!

[FRED takes the MAYOR in his arms and runs.]

MAYOR:
4 scores and 32 bars ago our forefathers...
FRED:
Our quartet?
MAYOR:
And foremothers...
FRED:
Another quartet?
MAYOR:
Made it in this yellow submarine...
FRED:
What, that little thing?
MAYOR:
To Pepperland. Climb aboard, young Fred.
FRED:
But, sir, I can't even make my soap float.
MAYOR:
I'm appointing you Lord Admiral.
FRED:
Lord Admiral? In that event, yes.
MAYOR:
Hurry, Young Fred. Go! Get help!
FRED:
Where should I go?
MAYOR:
No time for trivialities.

[As the BLUE MEANIES bomb the MAYOR, FRED sails away.]

CREDITS

[0:07:41 THE BEATLES: YELLOW SUBMARINE]
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine
…
Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain.
Full speed ahead.
Full speed it is, sir.
Action stations! Action stations!
Aye, sir, aye.
Captain, Captain!
As we live a life of ease
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine,
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine,
…

[0:10:20 THE YELLOW SUBMARINE GETS TO LIVERPOOL]

[0:11:03 THE BEATLES: ELEANOR RIGBY]
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear
No-one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No-one was saved
All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?

[0:13:14 STREET OF LIVERPOOL]

RINGO:
Who... is me? Liverpool can be a lonely place on a Saturday night. And this is only Thursday morning. Compared with my life, Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl. Nothing ever happens to me. I feel like an old, splintered drumstick. I'd jump into the River Mersey, but it looks like rain. Nothing ever happens to me.

[As RINGO walks down Hope Street, is followed by the submarine. A bobby lies on the floor playing with a cat.]

BOBBY:
Puss, puss-puss. Puss, puss, puss. Here, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. 

[The Bobby sees Ringo] Ahem, er...
RINGO:
Would you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a yellow submarine?
BOBBY:
No, I would not.
RINGO:
Oh yeah, I didn't think you would.

[Ringo goes up a hill to reach The Pier, the house where he lives with the other Beatles.]

RINGO:
I could have sworn there was a yellow submarine. But that isn't logical, is it? It must have been one of them unidentified flying cupcakes or a figment of my imagination.
But I don't have an imagination.

[RINGO enters the house. FRED comes and knocks at the door.]

FRED:
Help, help, help!
RINGO 

[from inside]:
Thanks, I don't need any.
FRED:
Help! Won't you please, please help me?
RINGO:
Be specific.
FRED:
... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!!
RINGO:
What you need is...
FRED:
'H' for hurry, 'E' for ergent, 'L' for love me and 'P' for p-p-p-p-please help.

[0:16:08 THE HOUSE OF THE BEATLES]

[Door opens and Fred enters. There is a long corridor with many doors. A lot of strange things enter and leave the rooms.]

VOZ:
Hiya, baby!

[RINGO goes downstairs in a car.]

RINGO:
Your story has touched my heart. Jump in, we'll get my friends.
FRED:
Bless you!
RINGO:
Did I sneeze?

[They return to the corridor.]

FRED:
Just park it here.
RINGO:
I'll just park it here.

[They enter through a door.]

FRED:
What would your friends be doing here?
RINGO:
Displaying.
FRED:
Displaying what?
RINGO:
Displaying around.

[The room is full of interesting objects, like a museum.]

FRED:
Can't we take one of these?
RINGO:
No, Fred, I only work with me mates.
FRED:
Frankenstein?
RINGO:
I used to go out with his sister.
FRED:
His sister?
RINGO:
Yeah. Phyllis. Hey, I wonder what would happen if I pulled this lever.
FRED:
You mustn't do that.
RINGO:
Can't help it. I'm a born lever-puller.

[He does it. Frankenstein gets up and takes a drink. Then he becomes JOHN.]

JOHN:
Ringo, I've just had the strangest dream.
RINGO:
I warned you not to eat on an empty stomach. Now listen to old Fred.
FRED:
... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!!
RINGO:
What do you think?
JOHN:
I think he needs a rehearsal.

[They return to the hall.]

JOHN:
When do we leave?
RINGO:
Let's get the other two, John.
JOHN:
What day is it?
RINGO:
Sitar-day.
JOHN:
Then George will be here.

[He opens a door. Indian images.]

[0:18:55 THE BEATLES: LOVE YOU TO (beginning)]

RINGO:
George, what are you doing up there?
GEORGE 

[driving a red car]:
Now, what is it, Ringo? Is there a matter you'd like to take up or down?
RINGO 

[pointing to FRED]:
This chap here...
FRED 

[JOHN and RINGO also say the last words]:
...Blue Meanies!!!
GEORGE:
You're nuts, the pair of you.
RINGO:
Wait a minute, that's my car.
GEORGE:
How do you know it's your car?
RINGO:
I'd know it anywhere.
GEORGE:
What's it look like, then?
RINGO:
It's red with yellow wheels. 

[The car changes colours]I mean, blue with orange wheels.
GEORGE:
It's all in the mind.

[They all get into the car.]

RINGO:
Come on, move over, I'm driving.
GEORGE:
I got here first.

[They argue about who will drive.]

RINGO/GEORGE:
I'll drive, if you like... No, you sit in the middle... I'm sitting in the middle... You said you were driving... I am driving... I'll get in the back, then.

[Finally, they depart. A car crash is heard. They return and open a door. Inside the room there is a girl lying on a bed. King-Kong looks through the window and grabs the girl.]

JOHN:
Do you think we're interrupting something?
RINGO:
I think so. We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?

[JOHN opens another door. A train is coming at full speed. John closes the door, scared.]

GEORGE:
It's all in the mind.
JOHN:
Try one of those doors.

[RINGO opens a door. Inside the room there is a loud party.]

GEORGE:
Yes, they do look very nice, don't they?
RINGO:
Yes, they do.
JOHN:
They do, though, don't they?
GEORGE:
Yes, they do.
RINGO:
Don't dey, dough?
GEORGE:
Dough?

[PAUL meets them.]

JOHN:
Don't ask. Dat's dough.
PAUL:
What's the matter, folks?
RINGO:
Blue Meanies.
FRED:
Well, lads, what do you think?
JOHN 

[as they walk]:
I think that...
FRED:
Remember, there'll be rough seas ahead. So, what do you think?
PAUL:
Well, then, um...
FRED:
Pounding, overwhelming waves. What do you think of that?
JOHN:
Well, I think that...
RINGO:
As a matter of fact, I...
ALL BEATLES:
I think...
FRED:
Well?
RINGO:
I've forgotten.

[They all go outside and stop in front of the submarine.]

FRED:
Right, then, let's get this vessel shipshape.
JOHN:
I kind of like the way it is, submarine shape.

[0:22:18 THE JOURNEY BEGINS]

We see a series of landscapes. We hear the end of “A day in the life”.

[0:22:45 INSIDE THE SUBMARINE]

PAUL:
So, this is a submarine.
JOHN:
Soft, isn't it?
RINGO:
Not if you're on the bottom.
FRED:
All right, lads, time to stow the gab and turn to.
PAUL:
Groovy. How do you start this thing?
FRED:
It starts with a Blue Meanie attack.
JOHN:
Supposing there's no Blue Meanies in the neighbourhood?
FRED:
Then you start looking for a switch.
RINGO:
Perhaps this is it.

[The submarine sails into a strange world.]

[0:23:22 THE BEATLES: ALL TOGETHER NOW]
One, two, three, four / Can I have a little more?
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten / I love you
A, B, C, D / Can I bring my friend to tea?
E, F, G, H, I, J / I love you
Sail the ship
Chop the tree
Skip the rope
Look at me
All together now
All together now (all together now)…
Black, white, green, red / Can I take my friend to bed?
Pink, brown, yellow, orange and blue / I love you (All together now)
All together now (all together now),
all together now (all together now)...
Sail the ship
Chop the tree
Skip the rope
Look at me
All together now
All together now (all together now)…

[0:25:30 THE SEA OF TIME]

RINGO:
What time is it?
JOHN:
It's time to time.
PAUL:
Look, the hands are slowing down.

[The submarine sails backwards.]

PAUL:
Do you ever get the feeling...
JOHN:
Yeah.
PAUL:
… that things aren't as rosy as they appear to be under the surface?
RINGO:
What's happening, John?
JOHN:
Well, in my humble opinion, we've become involved in Einstein's time-space continuum theory.
GEORGE:
All right.
JOHN:
Relatively speaking, that is.
GEORGE:
Of course. Maybe time's gone on strike.
RINGO:
What for?
GEORGE:
Shorter hours.
RINGO:
I don't blame it. It must be very tiring being time, mustn't it?
JOHN & PAUL:
Why?
RINGO:
It's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it?
JOHN:
You surprise me, Ringo.
RINGO:
Why?
JOHN:
Dealing in abstracts.
RINGO:
Just because I'm a drummer... I don't half feel funny.

[RINGO shrinks, becoming younger]

PAUL 

[also getting younger]:
You're not half the lad you used to be.
GEORGE 

[getting younger]
Look, everything's getting bigger.
JOHN 

[getting younger]:
It's not. It's us that are getting smaller...
RINGO 

[mourning]:
I want my mam.
FRED:
And younger. There you are, lads. Old Fred will get you out of all this.
RINGO 

[pointing outside]
Look at that!
GEORGE:
It's all a load of Father Xmas's.
JOHN:
It's not. It's Father Time.
GEORGE:
How do you know?
JOHN:
I read it in a book.
FRED:
I don't want to alarm you, but the years are going backwards.
GEORGE:
What's that mean, old Fred?
FRED:
It means if we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we'll all disappear up our own existence.
JOHN:
What are we gonna do, then?
FRED:
We could always try a few buttons.
RINGO 

[sobbing]:
I want my mam.
FRED:
Time's fast running out for us, I'm afraid!
JOHN:
Can't we do something to the clock?
GEORGE:
What do you mean, John?
JOHN:
Move the hands forward, see what happens.
FRED:
Clever lad.

[JOHN forces the clockwise and the submarine goes forwards.]

JOHN:
Something strange is happening. It's speeding up now.
PAUL 

[looking outside]:
Funny... a submarine remarkably like our own.
JOHN:
Uncannily.
RINGO:
There's someone in it. Look.
JOHN:
And they're waving.
RINGO:
It's a group of fellas.
JOHN:
Wave back. Maybe we're both part of a vast yellow submarine fleet.
RINGO:
There's only two of us.
JOHN:
Then I would suggest that yonder yellow submarine is one of ourselves…
FRED:
Going backwards...
JOHN:
… in time!
GEORGE:
Look at Ringo.

[RINGO is getting older, and so the rest.]

JOHN:
Oh dear, we're all the same.
PAUL:
Senile delinquents.
GEORGE:
And I can hear my beard growing.
RINGO:
We'd better do something.

[0:28:20 THE BEATLES: WHEN I’M SIXTY FOUR]
When I get older, losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older, too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings, go for a ride

[As Paul sings, time is going back and The Beatles turn back to their real age.]

[A text can be read: “sixty-four years is 33.661.440 minutes and one minute is a
long time… Let us demonstrate”.]
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[A series of well illustrated numbers accompany the voice of Paul form 1 to 64, matching the last one with the end of the song.]
Every summer we can rent a cottage
in the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee,
Vera, Chuck and Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely
what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form,
mine forever more
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

JOHN:
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen, but would you agree that we have been passing through the Sea of Time?
RINGO:
That would explain a few things. I'm glad I'm not young any more. Or was it old?
JOHN:
What kind of a sea is this?
FRED:
The Sea of Science.
JOHN:
Oh, yeah.

[0:31:15 THE BEATLES: A NORTHERN SONG]
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
He just wrote it like that
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that
It doesn't really matter
What chords I play
What words I say
Or time of day it is
Cause it's only a Northern Song
It doesn't really matter
What clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern Song
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no-one there.

[0:33:46 A MONSTER WITH A TRUNK AND TUSKS]

[As the song sounded The Beatles evolved through the space. When they come back to the submarine a strange animal enters with them.]

GEORGE:
He looks wrong.
PAUL:
He doesn't look at all well.
GEORGE:
In fact, he's horrible.
JOHN 

[hiding.]:
He's so ugly.
ALL:
Really ugly!

[The animal breaks to mourn.]

FRED:
Somebody push a button.

[RINGO does so and the animal is ejected outside the submarine to the Sea of Monsters.]

[0:34:18 SEA OF MONSTERS]

JOHN:
There's a cyclops.
PAUL:
Can't be. He's got two eyes.
JOHN:
Then it must be a bi-cyclops.
GEORGE:
There's another one.
JOHN:
A whole cyclopedia.

[Among the monsters there is one that swallows everything like a vacuum. The BEATLES look out the hatch.]

JOHN:
There's a school of whales.
RINGO:
They look a bit old for school.
PAUL:
University, then.
RINGO 

[driving the submarine]:
University of Whales. They look like dropouts to me.
FRED:
You've got to steer clear!
RINGO:
Steer clear?
FRED:
Yes, steer. Clear?
RINGO:
Yes, dear.

[RINGO presses a button. The submarine shows a big smile. The whales smile too.]

FRED:
Now, whatever you do, don't touch that button.
RINGO:
Which button?
FRED:
That one.
RINGO:
This one?

[RINGO presses the button and is ejected from the submarine onto the back of a dinosaur. Before he is eaten, he is rescued by a horse-like creature.]

FRED:
That was the panic button.
PAUL:
Poor Ringo.
JOHN:
Poor lad.
GEORGE:
Never did no harm to no-one.
JOHN:
Lads, now Ringo's gone, what are we gonna do?
FRED:
Learn to sing trios.
PAUL:
No, let's save the poor devil.
JOHN:
I see footsteps.
FRED:
It's a pair of kinky boot-beasts.
JOHN:
Preparing to attack.

[The boots try to step on the submarine, but PAUL presses a button and the submarine steps on the boots.]

JOHN:
I don't half miss Ringo.
PAUL:
He's far out there.
JOHN:
Always was.
RINGO:
'H' is for hurry!
PAUL:
Here comes Ringo!

[RINGO rides the horse creature.]

JOHN:
There goes Ringo.

[A boxing monster approaches the submarine.]

GEORGE:
It's seen us.
FRED:
Find a boxing button.
PAUL:
Whoever heard of a boxing button?
JOHN:
Who cares? Find one.

[The boxing monster hits the submarine.]

FRED 

[pushing a button]:
Fire one!

[The submarine expels lot of strange gadgets, including a banner with the words “The Rolling Stones”.]

FRED:
Uh-oh, wrong one.
JOHN:
That.

[The submarine flatters the monsters with a cigar. We hear “Air on the G-string”, de Bach until the cigar explodes.]

GEORGE:
There goes Ringo again.
JOHN:
Rides well, doesn't he?
RINGO:
'E' is for ergent...

[The vacuum monster appears again.]

FRED:
Oh no, not the dreaded vacuum again.
PAUL:
We'll be sucked into oblivion.
GEORGE:
Or even further.
FRED:
Put her in reverse.
JOHN:
So long, sucker.
PAUL:
Too much.
GEORGE:
Too soon.
FRED:
Reverse! Reverse!
JOHN:
Ringo time.

[Another monster is swallowed by the vacuum monster.]

RINGO:
'L' is for love me...

[Indians go chasing RINGO.]

JOHN:
Indians!
RINGO:
Help! Help! 'P' is for please...
JOHN:
So, press a button.

[0:39:33. The seventh cavalry leaves the submarine and rescues RINGO.]

JOHN:
How was it, Ringo?
RINGO 

[pulling arrows off himself]:
'Arrowing.

[The vacuum monster keeps gobbling other monsters.]

FRED:
Look who's back. Full speed ahead.
RINGO:
Oh, no.
JOHN:
The motor's packing in.
FRED:
By all the sea nymphs, we're losing power. We're being swallowed. What shall we do?
PAUL:
Serve tea.
JOHN:
Lovely.

[The vacuum monster swallows everything, including itself.]

[The submarine is left in nothing.]

FRED:
By Neptune's knickerbockers, she's puttered out.
JOHN:
Maybe we should call a road service.
PAUL:
Can't. No road.
RINGO:
And we're not sub-scribers.
JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE:
Subscribers! Oh!
GEORGE:
I know something about motors. Let me have a look.
FRED:
Here.
GEORGE:
Is that the motor?
FRED:
Can't you tell one when you see one?
GEORGE:
Of course I can. Let me peruse it.

[Put his finger on the motor and get shocked.]

JOHN:
What do you think?
GEORGE:
I think I burned my finger.
RINGO 

[looking outside]:
Here, lads. Look at this.
JOHN:
What do you think it is?
GEORGE:
Nothing.
RINGO:
Looks like nothing.
PAUL:
It's a local inhabitant.
RINGO:
He's probably one of the nothings.
PAUL:
At least that's something. Let's show him our motor.
JOHN:
Steady on. You don't want to show your motor to just anybody.
GEORGE:
But this is a nobody.
JEREMY:
Medic, pedic, zed oblique,
orphic, morphic, dorphic, Greek.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
JOHN:
Can you tell us where we're at?
JEREMY:
A true Socratic query, that.
JOHN:
And who the Billy Shears are you?
JEREMY:
Who? Who indeed am I?

[He gives a different visiting card to each BEATLE.]

JOHN 

[reading card]:
Jeremy?
PAUL 

[reading card]:
Hillary?
GEORGE 

[reading card]:
Boob?
RINGO 

[reading card]:
Ph. D?
ALL:
Who?
JEREMY:
Eminent physicist, polyglot classicist,
prize-winning botanist,
hard biting satirist,
talented pianist, good dentist, too.
JOHN:
Lousy poet.
JEREMY:
Critic's voice, take your choice.
RINGO:
Must be one of them angry young men.
PAUL:
Or a daffy old creep.
JEREMY:
I, daffy old creep?
GEORGE:
Do you speak English?
JEREMY:
Old English, middle, a dialect, pure...
PAUL:
Well, do you speak English?
JEREMY:
You know, I'm not sure.
RINGO:
He's so smart, he doesn't even remember what he knows.
PAUL:
Why don't we show him our motor?
JOHN:
Should we really... show him our motor?
PAUL:
He may not have seen one before.
JEREMY:
Turbo-prop, super-combustible spring.
Metrocyclonic and stereophonic,
This motor, I see, has a broken down thing.
JOHN:
He fixed it?
PAUL:
He fixed it.
GEORGE:
Great. Let's go.
JEREMY:
I must complete my bust, two novels,
finish my blueprints, begin my beguine.
JOHN:
Must you always talk in rhyme?
JEREMY:
If I spoke prose, you'd all find out,
I don't know what I talk about.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
PAUL:
Hey, fellas. Look.
JEREMY:
The footnotes for my 19th book.
This is my standard procedure for doing it.
And while I compose it,
I'm also reviewing it.
GEORGE:
A boob for all seasons.
PAUL:
How can he lose?
JOHN:
Were your notices good?
JEREMY:
It's my policy never to read my reviews.
JOHN:
There must be a word for what he is.

[0:43:00 THE BEATLES: NOWHERE MAN]
He's a real Nowhere Man
Sitting in his Nowhere Land
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
He's as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere Man, can you see me at all?
Nowhere Man, don't worry,
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else
lends you a hand
Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
He's a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody

JOHN:
Okay, men, all aboard. Let's go somewhere.
RINGO:
What about him?
JOHN:
He's happy enough going around in circles.
RINGO:
Poor little fella.
PAUL:
I don't know. Ringo's just a sentimentalist.
RINGO:
Look at him. Can't he come with us? 

[Goes over to JEREMY]
Mr. Boob, you can come with us, if you like.
JEREMY:
You mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man?
RINGO:
Come on, we'll take you somewhere.

[Inside the submarine, JOHN gives FRED the motor.]

JOHN 

[to JEREMY]
Okay, Booby. Down the hatch.
JEREMY 

[laughing]:
Down the hatch. A quite curious phrase.
The middle South Midlands
Victorian phase.
It's usage undoubtedly on the increase.
I must work it into
my New Statesman piece.
JOHN:
That's the hatch, friend.
JEREMY:
Indeed.
FRED:
Steady now, crew. Prepare to go forward.
GEORGE:
Forward.
PAUL:
Forward.
JOHN:
Forward.
RINGO:
Forward.
ALL:
Forward!

[But the submarine has problems going forward.]

JOHN:
It's awfully quiet.
GEORGE:
What shall we do, Jeremy?
JEREMY:
Repair, revive, revamp, renew.
Ipse dixit, just turn the screw.

[The BEATLES and JEREMY go outside.]

JEREMY:
Log sign, clog sign, big thingamabob.
JOHN:
What's he saying?
PAUL:
What's he doing?
JEREMY:
Chewing gum will do the job. A turn of the screw, and all is and all is new.

[The submarine stars, but only FRED is on board.]

FRED:
I can't stop her. 'H' is for hurry, 'E' is for ergent, 'L' is for love me…
JOHN:
'P' is for... goodbye?
GEORGE:
That was lovely, Jeremy.
PAUL:
We've lost the sub for good.
JOHN:
Or for bad. Or for worse.
JEREMY:
I'm sorry about that.
RINGO:
But he did fix the motor.
PAUL:
Where are we?

[They stand on a head. There are a lot of heads around.]

JOHN:
It looks like the foothills.
PAUL:
The foothills of what?
JOHN:
The foothills of the headlands.

[0:48:06 THE BEATLES: LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees
and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you,
you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun
in her eyes and she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people
eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles
as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head
in the clouds and you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With Plasticine porters
with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds…

[0:51:09 ON THE FOOTHILLS OF THE HEADLANDS]

JOHN:
Carry on, lads, carry on.
RINGO:
Certainly was carrying on.
JOHN:
I feel a draft.
PAUL:
We must be near the Sea of Holes. Don't you think we should ask somebody for directions?
JOHN 

[talking to a mass of heads]
Excuse us...
PAUL:
Can you tell us the way to Pepperland?

[The heads point arrows, but the arrows point in circles.]

JOHN:
Thanks.
PAUL:
Gosh, look at all this dust? Where did it come from?
JEREMY:
A chemical error and quite imprecise. This is a condiment...
RINGO:
Condi...
JEREMY:
A spice.
JOHN:
He's right, you know. It's pepper.
PAUL:
Pepper?
GEORGE:
Pepper.

[They smell and sneeze. The mass of heads sneeze too. They fly into the Sea of Holes.]

[0:52:08 THE SEA OF HOLES]

RINGO:
John? Paul? George? Is anybody home?
PAUL:
Where are we?
JOHN:
A holey sea. This place reminds me of Blackburn, Lancashire.
PAUL:
Oh, boy...
GEORGE:
How many do you think there are in all?
JEREMY:
Enough to fill the Albert Hall.
PAUL:
Didn't old Fred mention something about the Sea of Holes just before the Sea of Green?
JOHN:
Yeah.
GEORGE:
Through one of them spots must be the Sea of Green. But which? Which one?
JEREMY:
Thesis, antithesis, synthesis, causes of causal causation.
JOHN:
Jeremy, what do you know about holes?
JEREMY:
There are simply no holes in my education.
PAUL:
You mean you haven't composed a whole book?
GEORGE:
Great. What shall we do?
JEREMY:
Be empirical. Look.
RINGO:
The booby's making more and more sense.
PAUL:
It's getting better all the time.
JOHN:
Great. Come on, let's all look for the Sea of Green. The Sea of Holes... into the Sea of Green.
JEREMY:
Hydrolate, verdant chrysodine.
I think we're near the Sea of Green.

[JEREMY is caught by the leg by a BLUE MEANIE. RINGO picks a hole up and plays with it for a while before to put it in his pocket.]

RINGO:
I've got a hole in me pocket.
PAUL:
Where's Jeremy?
JOHN:
He was over there.
GEORGE:
He's not here now.
PAUL:
He must have jumped ship, then.
RINGO:
He wouldn't do that. He's our friend. Booby, Jeremy, Hillary, where are you?

[0:54:29 Suddenly, everything is tinted of green as we hear a bit part of the song Yellow submarine: “Sea of green, sea of green, sea of green, green, green, green...”]

[The BEATLES arrive in Pepperland, just on the base of the temple.]

[0:54:41 PEPPERLAND]

JOHN:
Pepperland. A bit salty around the edges. Looks all dingy.
GEORGE:
And drab.
PAUL:
And quiet.

[RINGO finds a pile of apples. He takes one and passes it to PAUL.]

JOHN:
Safe at last.
PAUL:
And none the worse for our adventures.
JOHN:
Reminiscent in many ways of the late Mr. Ulysses.
RINGO:
There's an eye in the apples.

[RINGO brings down the pile of apples and uncovers the MAYOR. The Yellow Submarine comes down from the sky and lands on the house of music. FRED descends sitting down in an anchor.]

FRED:
There she blows! Lord Mayor, sir... I've made it, I'm back.
GEORGE:
Who's this?
FRED:
Our Lord Mayor. He's been bonked. 

[Ringo removes the apples]. Lord Mayor, sir... unbonk yourself. Even a little snatch of a tune might get him up again.
JOHN:
All right, let's sing.

[0:55:54 THE BEATLES: HAVE YOU GOT TIME TO RECTIFY]
Have you got time to rectify, time to rectify...

MAYOR:
Do I hear music? Do I see... young Fred?
FRED:
You do, Lord Mayor.
MAYOR:
Bless my metronome. And did you bring the help?
FRED:
Yes, yes. Look.
MAYOR:
Holy pizzicato, young Fred. It's quite uncanny, your faces...
PAUL:
We're quite cute, really.
MAYOR:
You could pass for the originals.
JOHN:
We are the originals.

[They go downstairs from the house of music.]

MAYOR:
No, no... Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
RINGO:
They couldn't be much with a name like that. Sergeant Pepper?
FRED
You could impersonate them and rally the land to rebellion.
MAYOR
Where are your instruments?
JOHN
Lost in the Monstrous Sea.
PAUL
Sea of Monsters.
FRED
We'll get other instruments, Lord Mayor.
MAYOR
Not a chance. The Meanies captured everything that maketh music.
PAUL
They hate music that much, do they?
MAYOR
They shrink at the very sound.
JOHN
Okay, you guys. It's shrinking time in Pepperland.
All people in Pepperland keeps grey and motionless (except for escape from the blue
meanies).
BLUE MEANIE
Aim, fire!
The Beatles hide behind cut-outs.
PAUL
He reminds me of my old English teacher.
JOHN
Look, if you must shout, shout quietly.
GEORGE
What do we do?
JOHN
Coagulate with the crowd.
PAUL
Cut-outs at the ready.
JOHN
Then let's cut out.
They come to a high bandstand surrounded by thorns.
PAUL
What a grand bandstand.
JOHN
That's where the gear's kept. Come on.
Blue meanies with dogs.
GEORGE
Cavey, cavey.
At dusk.
PAUL
All right, the coast is clear.
GEORGE
Now's our chance.
RINGO
But how'll we get over?
GEORGE
Easy. Follow me.
They jump the fence of thorns
BLUE MEANIE
A-ha! You fools!
The watch fires his machine gun.
The Beatles reach the bandstand moving between asleep blue meanies.
RINGO
It's not very light in here, is it?
GEORGE
Shh! Keep the noise down.
JOHN
Look what I found. It's their uniforms.
PAUL
Nice bit of gear, that.
RINGO
They'll look great on, eh?
PAUL
Dey will, won't dey?
RINGO
Won't dey, dough.
JOHN
How do I look?
PAUL
Groovy, groovy. How about me?
RINGO, looking thru the window
Bad scene, lads. We're surrounded.
GEORGE
Oh, heck.
RINGO
A million billion Meanies.
PAUL
They're coming this way.
ALL
Hide!
Trying to hide they make a lot of noise.
PAUL
Do you think they heard us?
JOHN
I hope not.
GEORGE
What did you say?
SOMEONE
Shhhh!
GEORGE
Good plan.
1:03:22 DAWN, by Grieg.
PAUL
Look. They're all asleep.
RINGO
They look cute when they're asleep. Almost human.
GEORGE
Come on. Let's get out of here.
PAUL
On tiptoe.
They take their instruments and go down the hill.
RINGO
Tiptoe through the Meanies...
THE OTHER
Shh!
Ringo steps on the bagpipe. Some meanies wake.
PAUL
Let's exude.
The Beatles are persecuted. Ringo falls down and jumps on the John arms.
GEORGE
Relax, lads. Not a Meanie in sight.
JOHN
Not even a teeny Meanie.
PAUL
Not even a teeny-weeny Meanie.
RINGO
Great.
PAUL
Oh, look. Breakfast.
RINGO
I'm dying for a bit of brekky.
George takes an apple. Four tall meanies do the same.
JOHN
Look out.
A blue meanie heads the four tall meanies.
CHIEF
Sound off, one, two, three, four...
TALL MEANIES
One, two, three, four...
The Beatles, one above the other, march behind the row of tall meanies.
JOHN
Five.
CHIEF
Five? 

[John eliminates the last one with an apple stroke.] Sound off, one, two, three,
four.
TALL MEANIES
One, two, three...
JOHN
Four.
John eliminates another one.
TALL MEANIES
One, two...
JOHN
Three.
CHIEF
Three?
JOHN
Two.
CHIEF
Two?
JOHN
One.
CHIEF
One? 

[The chief stares at the column made of the four Beatles] Are you Bluish? You
don't look Bluish.
JOHN
Run for it.
The Beatles escape again.
PAUL
Right, men. We've made it.
GEORGE
Instruments at the ready.
JOHN
Okay, on the beat. A-one, a-two, a-three, a-four, a-five, a-six…
RINGO
Hey, can't you make it three?
JOHN
All right. On the beat of three... A-one, a-two, a-three...
1:06:34 THE BEATLES: SGT. PEPPER’S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND
It was twenty years ago today,
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style,
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you,
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here,
it's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience,
we'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home
I don't really wanna stop the show,
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's gonna sing a song,
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you,
The one and only Billy Shears
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
THE BEATLES: WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS
Billy Shears!
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
The inhabitants of Pepperland recover color and smile. Lennon has been presented as Billy Shears, but Ringo’s voice is heard.
01:08:49 THE MEANIES GATHER AROUND THEIR CHIEF
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Ah! The hills are alive...
ASSISTANT
With the sound of music.
The Chief Blue Meanie hits his assistant. Then he gets a tantrum.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Who is responsible for this?
ASSISTANT
Rimsky Korsakov?
The assistant is shot and kicking, but still resurfaces.
ASSISTANT
Guy Lombardo?
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE, laughs
My dear friend... let us not forget that heaven is blue. 

[Suddenly choleric] Tomorrow, the world! Bring in my Bluebird.
PEPPERLAND INHABITANTS
Who? Who? Who?
PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO
Who? Who? Who?
The mouth of John expels the question WHO?
A blue big glove crosses the air.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Ah! Here you are, my little Glovey-dovey. Go get thee hence and destroy yon upstarts. 

[New rage] Smash them! Squash them! Crash them! Oblue-terate them!
MEDICAL DOCTOR, as the Chief collapses
Here, your Blueness, have some nasty medicine.
CHIEF, exuberant
The Glove, the Glove, the Glove!
PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO
Glove? Glove? Glove?
From the mouth of John emerge the word GLOVE.
GEORGE
He's a clever lad, isn't he?
RINGO
Open your mouth, it won't hurt. 

[Try to see into the mouth of John] John, you haven't half got a big mouth, haven't you?
GEORGE
It's easy. All you need is love.
JOHN
Yes.
And expeles again the word GLOVE, but this time the initial G vanishes.
1:12:02 THE BEATLES : ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE
Love, love, love (x3)
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love,
Love is all you need
Nothing you can know that isn't known,
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be
that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy
All you need is love, (All together now)
All you need is love, (Everybody)
All you need is love, love,
Love is all you need
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
The words emerged from the mouth of John neutralize the glove attacks.
JOHN
Go, Glove, lovely Glove.
RINGO
You took the words right out of my mouth, John.
GEORGE
Hey, wait, and watch. 

[Floating] It's all in the mind, you know.
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Everything revives in Pepperland. The word NO becomes NOW and then KNOW.
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
The meanies flee and The Beatles are acclaimed by the crowd.
A little bit further they find a blue glass ball.
GEORGE
Hey, that's a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl.
JOHN
In Pepperland all things are possible.
PAUL
It's not a goldfish bowl.
RINGO
Just a big glass bowl, then.
PAUL
Yes, blue glass.
RINGO
It must be from Kentucky.
Paul knocks the bowl. Some music starts to sound.
JOHN
There's something inside.
RINGO
Four fellas.
GEORGE
What are they doing there?
PAUL
They're not having a ball, that's for sure.
JOHN
It can't be.
PAUL
It's us.
JOHN
But we're here.
PAUL
It's Sgt. Pepper's...
RINGO
Lonely...
GEORGE
Hearts Club...
GEORGE
Band.
JOHN
The resemblance is truly striking. If I could come in here I think the theory put forward
by Einstein…
PAUL, spoofs an old song called ‘Any old iron’
Any old Ein, any old Ein, any, any, any old Einstein.
JOHN
… could well be applied here. The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking two eggs...
The other three try to break the ball.
PAUL
John!
JOHN
… beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper...
GEORGE
John!
JOHN
George?
GEORGE
How do we get them out?
JOHN
Break the glass.
GEORGE
We can't. It's Beatle-proof.
JOHN
Nothing is Beatle-proof.
PAUL, to Ringo
Have you got your drumsticks with you? A drum break might shatter it.
RINGO
No, I haven't.
GEORGE
Have a look in your pocket.
1:15:50 “Baby you’re a rich man” is heard.
RINGO
I've got a hole in my pocket. I wonder if...
Ringo sticks the hole on the ball. The ball gets empty.
RINGO
Yeah, it still works.
GEORGE
We take back all we said.
JOHN
You're a genius.
PAUL
A sheer genius.
RINGO
I know, I know, I know. 

[Some colors get out of the ball] Like coloured telly.
GEORGE
Like crystal.
PAUL
They're decanting.
The members of the Band face their peers.
RINGO 2
Hello, brother.
RINGO
Yeah, without a doubt.
GEORGE
We're the spitting image of each other.
GEORGE 2
Golly, yeah.
JOHN
I'm led to believe that you're an extension of my personality.
JOHN 2
Yes, I'm your alter-ego man.
JOHN
And I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob. 

[They walk together] I'm glad you asked me that. Because as a matter of fact there's a war on. Then, brothers in war, to the
skirmish must we hence.
JOHN 2
Shall we hence?
PAUL
Let's not waste time sitting on the hence. Beatles to battle. Charge!
The Blue Meanies attack again. The Beatles run for a hide.
JOHN
We're surrounded.
RINGO, pointing the four-headed dog
Nice dog, though.
The Beatles hide inside a hurdy-gurdy. John turns the crank and sings:
1:17:26 THE BEATLES : HEY BULLDOG
Sheepdog... standing in the rain
Bullfrog... doing it again
Some kind of happiness
is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're
something special when you smile?
Childlike... no one understands
Jack knife... in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence
is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like
to listen to your fears
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
Big man... walking in the park
Wigwam... frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude
is measured out in you
You think you know me
but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me,
You can talk to me
You can talk to me...
if you're lonely you can talk to me
Hey, bulldog (x4)
John to the dog:
What do you say? Sing it.
Do you know any more? Play it!
Todos
Hey, bulldog.
The Beatles escape from the dog and the guards. Ringo finds Jeremy hanging from
the branch of a tree.
RINGO
Jeremy, can it be you?
JEREMY
Can it be me? I think you'd better
inquire of the guards,
for when I was captured,
they took all my cards.
RINGO
Shh, that's enough, Jeremy. Come on, the whole world's being attacked.
JEREMY
What do you want me to do?
Do you recommend fisticuffs
versus the guard?

[With a fighting manual in his hand Jeremy challenges the guard ]
Oh, guard! Blue Meanio!
Left to the nostril, right uppercut,
right to the eyebrow, left to the gut.
Jeremy stumbles into a tree. An apple falls down and knocks out the meanie. Ringo
congratulates Jeremy.
RINGO
Jeremy!
JEREMY
Come on, Ringo!
The Chief treats to stem the rout.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Get back! Get back! Once more unto the breach, dear Meanies! You're advancing the wrong way! Retreat backwards! Get back there now!
The Chief is swept along.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
My kingdom for a horse! 

[Jeremy comes close to him] I think I'll tear him up into little pieces.
JEREMY
He does, does he?
CHIEF
I think I'll make a blueburger out of him.
JEREMY
Ha-ha, I don't care what you think.
CHIEF
You don't, eh? We'll soon see about that.
JEREMY
He does in truth seem quite annoyed,

[Opens the manual]
some reference material
before I'm destroyed.
Where ground is soft most often grows,
Arise, arise, arouse, a rose.

[Suddenly, a rose arise in the Chief nose]
A rosy nose?
CHIEF
Speak your last piece!
JEREMY
Peace, peace,
supplant the doom and the gloom.
Turn off what is sour,
turn into a flower and bloom, bloom.
Ha-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom,
bloom, bloom...
A lot of pink roses cover the whole body of the Chief. He flees crazy.
RINGO
First time I saw that Nowhere Man, that nobody, I knew he was somebody.
JOHN
You're right. Hello there, blue people. Won't you join us? Buck up, and otherwise go
mingle. What do you say?
CHIEF
Max?
MAX
Your Blue... I mean your Newness!
CHIEF, takes some flowers
It's no longer a blue world, Max. Where could we go?
MAX
Argentina?
JOHN
Are you with us? Will you join?
CHIEF
Shall we?
MAX
No!... 

[Chief threatens to hit him] Yes, your Newness!
CHIEF, smiles
Yes, Max...
JEREMY, close to them
Yes. Oh, yes is a word with a glorious ring,
A true, universal, euphonious thing.
In genders embracing
and chasing of blues,
the very best word
for the whole world to use. Ha-ha!
CHIEF
Yes, let us mix, Max. I've never admitted it before, but my cousin is the Bluebird of
Happiness.
1:24:41 THE BEATLES : IT’S ALL TOO MUCH
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes,
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside,
the more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much
Everybody dance. Jeremy and the Chief reconcile. The Chief cries of
emotion.
Nice to have the time
to take this opportunity
Time for me to look at you,
and you to look at me
It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
It's too much

Catchy tune, that.

I can't seem to get it out of my head.
GEORGE
Then shake it.
RINGO
That's what we've been doing all night.
PAUL
Yeah, it was a great party.
GEORGE
And we brought back lots of lovely souvenirs. Here is the motor.
PAUL
I've got a little love.
RINGO
And I've got a hole in my pocket.
PAUL
A hole?
RINGO
Half a hole, anyway. I gave the rest to Jeremy.
GEORGE
What can he do with half a hole?
PAUL
Fix it to keep his mind from wandering.
RINGO
Look at John, will you?
John has been looping through a telescope.
PAUL
What's the matter, John? Blue Meanies?
JOHN
Newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre.
There's only one way to go out.
GEORGE
How's that?
JOHN
Singing!
RINGO
One...

Hurry up and wait, yeah, baby
Waitin' here on your love
Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
"Love will find a way?"
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Well, my bad luck is falling
Falling down like rain
Bad luck is falling
Falling down like rain
No matter what I do
Seems like my luck won't never change

I felt kinda lucky
My luck was running slow
The last hand I caught four aces
And the police broke down the door
I said, Lord
Lord, what can a poor boy do?
Well, ain't it bad when you can't make no money
Seems like all the bad breaks will come to you

Yeah, I got home this morning
She was looking kinda funny
She said "Don't come in, daddy
Daddy, unless you got some money"
And I said, Lord
Lord, what can a poor boy do?
Well, ain't it tough when you can't make no money
Without your woman turning her back on you
Well now, I asked my woman for some dinner
She looked at me like a fool
She said, "I'm playing checkers, daddy
And I think it's your turn to move"
I said, oh
Lord, what can a poor boy do?
Yes, it's bad when you can't make no money
And your woman turns her back on you
Lion in my winter
I'm a lion with no crown

You wanna make me big man , a star on a screen
Some kind of James Brown or something in between
But when I ask for money you smother me in charms
I can't live on glory when your bendin' both my arms

I , I was a lion in winter
And man I had friends for miles around
I was a lion in my winter
What good's a lion Lord, without a crown

You're living in a cave man ,upon your marble throne
You think you own the heavens, but you've got to be alone
You know I prayed for sunshine, a woman with my name
I don't want to live man, you gave away the game

I, I was a lion in winter
And man I had friends for miles around
I was a lion in my winter
What good's a lion Lord , without a crown
I, I was a lion in winter
And man I had friends for miles around
I was a lion in my winter
What good's a lion Lord , without a crown
Never argue with your heart, it isn't smart, it isn't sound
Love don't know from season, logic, rhyme or reason
Love can be found in every port
Love gets around, in short

It has happened to a cricket in a thicket
It has happened on a streetcar and a bus
There has even been a rumor it has happened to a puma
Why shouldn't it happen to us?
It has happened to the mamma of a lama
To a pelican and to an octopus
Since it happened to the swordfish, it no longer is a "board fish"
Why shouldn't it happen to us?
It's elusive, profusive, nobody has an exclusive
On love, man, beast or dove
Take the regal old eagle, the porcupine and the beagle
Yes the kangaroo all pitch woo
It happened to a tuna at Laguna
To a girl named Myrtle and a guy named Gus
Why a lot of sense come to me by the shores of Isagumi
Why shouldn't it happen to us?
Oh the busy little hornet doesn't scorn it
To ignore it really is ridiculous
It's a ritual in Turkey, Motanique in Albuquerque
Why shouldn't it happen to us?
There's no ration on passion, l'amour is always in fashion
It wings beggars and kings
Take the cheetah and eeta, the halibut and the mosquito
Yes, and billy-goats feel their oats
Oh it thrills the tiny sparrow to its marrow
And the armadillo deems it super-plus
Why our ancient barnyard rooster finds it quite a morale booster
Why shouldn't it happen to us?
I had even heard a reindeer whisper "Please, say that again, dear,"
Why, oh why, shouldn't it happen to us?
Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

Well, you give me all your lovin' and your turtle dovin'
All your hugs and kisses and your money too
Well, you know you love me baby
Until you tell me, maybe
That some day, well I'll be through

Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die
Love is in the air

Te quiero, mi quieres
Te adoro, I confess
I love you, do you love me?
I adore you, can't you see?

Darlin' to me you are fantastic
For you I will swim the entire Panama Canal
And you will be my girl

I will dance the flamenco with a flamingo
In the streets of Miami all night long
Until you hear my song

Yes, yes, I know, call me crazy
Call me insane, as long as you call me
My number is

Te quiero, mi quieres
Te adoro, I confess
I love you, do you love me?
I adore you, can't you see?
Te quiero, mi quieres
Te adoro, I confess
I love you, do you love me?
I adore you, can't you see?
Living on free food tickets
Watering the milk from the hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can we do? Mmm

Tears from your baby sister
Crying 'cause she doesn't have a dress
Without a patch for the party to go
Oh but you know, she'll get by

Because she's living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mommy's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can

It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground
Walking to the town to find a job

Trying to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
And it chills to the bone
Boy you better go home where it's warm
And you can live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mommy's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can

Living on dreams ain't easy
But the closer the knit, the tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
You take them in stride, family pride

You know, faith is your foundation
With a whole lot of love
And a warm conversation and many a prayer
Making you strong where you belong

Living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mommy's gonna love you just as much as she can

Living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mommy's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can
Yo, remember back on the bully when cats used to harmonize like
"Wooo... wooo... wooo..."
Yo, yo, my men and my women, don't forget about the Deen
The Sirat al-Mustaqim, yo
It's about a thing
Yo, yo, yo, if you feel real good, lift your hands up in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere
Yeah, yeah
Put them up, put them up
Put them up, put them up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you and him then give him a little trim

To begin, how you think you really goin' to pretend
Like you wasn't down when you called him again?
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably ... again
Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the Jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin?

Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock, when you really are a gem

Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending him
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament

Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because of sin
Look at what you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans, come again

Yo! A-when when come again (yeah yeah)
When when come again (yeah yeah)
My friend come again (yeah yeah)

Guys you know you'd better, watch out
Some girls, some girls are only, about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Tims than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, popping yin (Like you got Yen)

Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by the waist men
Cristal by the case men, still living in his mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men
Need to take care of their three and four kids

But they face a court case when the child support's late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men, the punk domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men

How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
Unh unh come again
Yo yo come again
Brethren come again
Sistren come again

Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Girls you know you'd better, watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Guys you know you'd better, watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Girls you know you'd better, watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Hey, we have some very intelligent women in here, man
Do you think you too young to really love somebody
No, no, no, no, no
I say it for me and I am adult and I say wait you too young to be in love
This is silly, you infatuated with them
You got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas
I mean it might be something I don't know
It is a difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody
Well you tell me, what's the difference
What's the difference?
You can love anybody but when you in love with somebody
You looking at it like this
You taking that person for what he or she is
Not matter what he or she look like
And no matter what he or she do
If you can fall in love you can fall out of love
You might stop being in love with that person, but you can't stop loving that person
Sometimes they never been loved before, they never been in love before
They don't know the feeling to be loved
She poetic
She killed you
We get in that conversation with that right?
(Yeah, sing a song bro'...)
If the sun refused to shine
I don't mind, I don't mind
(Yeah)
If the mountains ah, fell in the sea
Let it be, it ain't me
(Well, all right)
Got my own world to live through and uh, ha !
And I ain't gonna copy you
Yeah (sing the song brother...)
Now if uh, six uh, huh, turned out to be nine
Oh I don't mind, I don't mind uh ( Well all right... )
If all the hippies cut off all their hair
Oh I don't care, oh I don't care
Dig
'Cause I've got my own world to live through and uh, huh
And I ain't gonna copy you
White collar conservative flashin' down the street
Pointin' their plastic finger at me, ha !
They're hopin' soon my kind will drop and die but uh
I'm gonna wave my freak flag high, high !
Oww !
Wave on, wave on...
Ah, ha, ha
Fall mountains, just don't fall on me
Go ahead on mister business man, you can't dress like me
Yeah !
Don't nobody know what I'm talkin' about
I've got my own life to live
I'm the one that's gonna die when it's time for me to die
So let me live my life the way I want to
Yeah, sing on brother, play on drummer
I'm so in love with you, please love me
Whatever else you do, just love me
Go your way and dance and play till dawn breaks though
If you'll just call up and say "I love you, just you"

You're all that I desire, love me
I'd die if you should tire, oh, of me, love me
I'll be kind and I won't mind if you're not near
If you'll only love me, dear

(brief music interlude)

Love me
I'll be kind and I won't mind if you're not near
If you'll only love me, dear
You took a mystery and made me want it
You got a pedestal and put me on it
You made me love you out of feeling nothing
Something that you do
And I was there and not dancing with anyone
You took a little , then you took me over
You set your mark on stealing my heart away
Crying , trying , anything for you

I'm in the middle of a chain reaction
You give me all the after midnight action
I wanna get you where I can let you make all that love to me
I'm on a journey for the inspiration
To anywhere and there ain't no salvation
I need you to get me nearer to you
So you can set me free
We talk about love , love ,love
We talk about love
We talk about love , love ,love
We talk about love
You make me tremble when your hand moves lower
You taste a little and you swallow slower

Nature has a way of yielding treasure
Pleasure made for you , oh
You gotta plan , your future is on the run
Shine a light for the whole world over
You never find your love if you hide away
Crying , dying , all you gotta do is

Get in the middle of a chain reaction
You get a medal when you're lost in action
I wanna get your love all ready for the sweet sensation
Instant radiation
You let me hold you for the first explosion
We get a picture of our love in motion
My arms will cover , my lips will smother you
With no more left to say
We talk about love , love , love
We talk about love
You let me hold you for the first explosion
My arms will cover , my lips will smother you

All you gotta do is get in the middle of a chain reaction
You get a medal when you're lost in action
I wanna get your love all ready for the chain reaction ...

[Intro]
Study war no more
Lay down your arms
Study war no more
Lay 'em down, lay 'em down now
Study war no more
Lay down your arms
Study war no more

[Verse 1]
Newsreels rattle the Nazi dread
The able-bodied have shipped away
Molly McGee gets her tea-leaves read
You'll be married in a month, they say
These leaves are crazy
Look at this town there's no men left
Just frail old boys and babies
Talking to teacher in the treble clef

[Chorus]
She plants her garden in the spring
She does the winter shoveling
Tokyo Rose on the radio
She says she's leavin' but she don't go

[Verse 2]
Out of the blue just passing through
A young flight sergeant on two weeks leave
Says "Molly McGee, no one else will do"
And seals the tea leaf prophecy
Oh, these nights are strong and soft
Private passions and secret storms
Nothin' about him ticks her off
And he looks so cute in his uniform

[Chorus]
She plants her garden in the spring
He does the winter shoveling
But summer's just a sneeze in a long, long, bad winter cold
She says "I'm leavin' here" but she don't go

[Verse 3]
Sleep little darlin'
This is your happy home
Hiroshima cannot be pardoned
Don't have kids when you get grown
Because this world is shattered
The wise are mourning, the fools are joking
Oh, what does it matter?
The wash needs ironing and the fire needs stoking

[Chorus]
She plants her garden in the spring
He does the winter shoveling
The three of 'em laughing 'round the radio
She says "I'm leavin' here" but she don't go

[Chorus]
She plants her garden in the spring
They do the winter shoveling
They sit up late and watch The Johnny Carson Show
She says "I'm leavin' here" but she don't go

Got to be there
Got to be there in the morning
When she says hello to the world
I've got to be there, got to be there
Bring her good times, oh
Then show her that she's my girl
Oh, what a feeling there'll be
The moment I know she loves me
'Cause when I look in her eyes, I realize
I need her sharing her world beside me

So I've got to be there
Got to be there in the morning
And welcome her into my world
And show her that she is my girl
When she says, hello world! (go to be there, got to be there)
I need her sharing the world beside me

That's why I've got to be there
Got to be there where love begins
And that's everywhere she goes
And I've got to be there so she knows
That when she's with me, she's home (home, she's home)
(Home, she's home) Yeah

[Guitar intro]

[Verse 1]
Look to the mirror
I can tell no lies
Time drawing nearer
Still I wonder why

[Short guitar riff]

You are the giver
Me I never try
Now we're together
Still I wonder why

[Multi-tracked guitar symphony]

[Verse 2]
Please can you tell me
When you're by my side
And when my eyes see
Will I wonder why

[Guitar riff]

If you are with me
I can only try
To find the answer
In the words that ask the question

[Bridge 1]
Why don't we know
And why don't it show
I wanna find out
Try let it all out

[Instrumental part with guitar lead]

[Dual guitar part]

[Instrumental part with guitar lead again]

[Bridge 2]
Why don't we know
And why don't it show
I wanna find out
Why

Why

[Instrumental outro]
Come all ye fair and tender ladies
Be careful how you court young men
They're like a star on a summer's morning
They'll first appear and then they're gone

They'll tell you some loving story
They'll declare to you their love is true
Then they will go and court some other
And that's the love they have for you

Do you remember our days of courting
When your head lay upon my breast
You could make me believe with falling of your arm
That the sun rose in the West

I wish I was a little sparrow
And I had wings with which to fly
Right over to see my false true-lover
And when he's talking I'd be nigh

But I'm not a little sparrow
I have no wings with which to fly
So I sit here in grief and sorrow
To weep and pass my troubles by
If I had known before I courted
That love was such a killing thing
I'd a-locked my heart in a box of golden
And fastened it up with a silver pin
Arrested on charges of unemployment
He was sitting in the witness stand
The judge's wife called up the district attorney
Said you free that brown eyed man
You want your job you better free that brown eyed man

Flying across the desert in a twa
I saw a woman walking across the sand
She been a-walkin' thirty miles en route to bombay
To get a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man

Way back in history three thousand years
Back every since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women shed a tear
For a brown eyed handsome man
That's what the trouble was brown eyed handsome man

Beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her daughter go out and find yourself
A brown eyed handsome man
That's what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man
Milo venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To get brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man

Two, three count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stand
Rounding third he was headed for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man
That won the game; it was a brown eyed handsome

[Intro]
Oh, boricua
Oh, boricua, huh
Oh

[Chorus]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got (Boricua, huh, boricua's in the house)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

[Verse 1]
From In Living Color to movie scripts
To On the 6 to J. Lo to this
Headline clips
I stay grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real I thought I told ya (I'm real)

That's just me
Nothing phony, don't hate on me
What you get is what you see, oh

[Chorus]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (From the Bronx)

I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

[Verse 2]
I'm down to earth like this
Rocking this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and loving it
Rumors got me laughing kid
I love my life and my public
Put God first and can't forget to stay real (Real)
To me it's like breathing, yeah

[Chorus]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot

[Verse 1]
Firefly, firefly
Shine your light tonight
Assist the moon and stars
In helping us
To ease our minds

[Chorus]
Firefly, firefly
Golden night of serenity, yeah
Show us the light naturally
And maybe she won't worry
When there ain't nothing I can do

[Verse 2]
When sea runs dry
And the stars fall from the sky
She's a vulnerable flower
And she believes in me
Even when I have to lie
I shouldn't have to lie
To make the world seem alright
Firefly, Firefly

[Spoken Interlude]
I come home with the weight of the world on my shoulders
But knowing the strength she sees in me
I smile because she believes me

[Chorus]
Firefly, Firefly
Golden night of serenity, yeah
Show us the light naturally
And maybe she won't worry
When ain't nothing I can do

[Verse 3]
When sea runs dry
And the stars fall from the sky
Ooh, she's a vulnerable flower
And she believes in me
Even when I have to lie
I shouldn't have to lie
To make the world seem alright

Mmm, mmm, mmm

Ooh, she's a vulnerable flower
And she believes in me
Even when I have to lie
I shouldn't have to lie
To make the world seem alright

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, firefly
You make the world seem alright

[Spoken Intro: CeeLo Green, Kingston, Man]
What's your last name?
Kingston
Say, "My name is Kingston Calloway"
My name is Kingston Calloway
Say, "I am the son of the soul machine"
I am the son of the soul machine
Excuse me, Mister Green
The guests are waiting for the album to start
Well, let them wait!
I'm talking to my son
I peeked in to say good-night
And there I heard my child in prayer
"And for me, some scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for my hair"

All our town was closed and shuttered
All the streets were dark and bare
In our town, no scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

Through the night my heart was aching
Just before the dawn was breaking

I peeked in and on her bed
In gay profusion lying there
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

If I live to be a hundred
I will never know from where
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair
Day after day alone on the hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way, his head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Is talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And he never listen to them
He knows that they're the fools
But they don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round, round, round, round, round
Oh

I ain't buying you no diamond ring
Well, we ain't gettin' married, nah
I ain't buying you no diamond ring

[Verse 1]
I gotta give up to quiet
The storm that rages inside
The way that I hid my damage pride
You gave me away
And I've had enough
I imagine the words I say to you
I'm finding strength to follow it through
I'm ready to change

[Chorus]
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, we're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We'll only find ourselves by losing all
Control, control, control, control
Control, control, control, control

[Verse 2]
I'm opening up
Show me a sign I can't believe
These crazy emotions flow through me
I'm gonna explode, oh
You take me away
And what is my ordinary life
I won't be afraid of what we might find a love I can hold

[Chorus]
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, we're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We'll only find ourselves by losing all, no

[Bridge]
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
New horizon ready to paint
With every breath, you take me away

[Chorus]
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, we're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control, control, control, control
Control, control, control, control

No one looked...as I walked by
Just an invitation would have been just fine
Said no to him...again and again
First he took my heart...and then he ran

No one knows how I feel
What I said unless you read between my lines
One man walked away from me
First he took my hand...take me home

Stand back...stand back
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
It's alright...it's alright
To be standing in a line
(Standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I cry...

Do not turn away my friend
Like a willow I can bend
No man calls my name
No man came
So I walked on down away from you
Maybe your attention was more
Than you could do
One man did not call
He asked me for my love
And that was all

Stand back...stand back
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
It's alright...it's alright
To be standing in a line
(Standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I cry..

So I walked on down the line
Away from you
Maybe your attention was more
Than I could do
One man...did not call
Well he asked me for my love
That was all

Stand back... stand back
In the middle of my room i did not hear from you
Its alright... its alright
To be standing in a line
(Standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I cry...

[Marvin Gaye]
Get your ass in gear
Come closer here
See your passion sweat
Now is it wet?
I'll jam you 'til you faint
You're no saint
I'll rock you 'til your sore
Like a whore
Forget that closet scene
I'm so mean
I'll throw you on the floor
Like before
You say it's not your thing
But still you come
You say you hate my guts
Still want some
You silly little freak
Tryin' to rise
The devil's strong in you
It's in your eyes
The thing that's deep in you
You can't resist
I'm gonna tie you up and have my wish
You do not understand but still you love
The way you worship it is all your thinking of
Everybody knows the thing you love
While you're on your knees
Raise your dress above..
Get down...
...Shut up
You nasty little slave, kiss my feet
Put your face right here and start to eat
Get down...
Shut up...
Get down...
Get up!
If you do it right, you get the pipe
And if you do it wrong, I'll spank you long
I love you, my masochistic beauty
I love you, I love your booty
I love it, my masochistic beauty... Yes
I love you, I love your booty
And it's my duty to spank your booty
And it my duty to spank your booty

[Gordon Banks using vocoder]
It's my duty
To spank your booty

[Marvin Gaye]
I love you
Got to learn
Shutup!
Get down
Get up
Get down
Get up
I know about your thing
You hate yourself
You selfish little bitch
You're in poor health
I'll use you till you moan
And cry so hard
Your guilt becomes your key
To turn to God
Although I am a part of this
Like you
I am a master man
With work to do
You must obey my will
Or face my rod
'Cause if you can't for me
You can't for God

Get down
Get up!
Get down
Get up!

Bitch, are you coming?
Get down

Deception is your game
You've been had
All your men are glad
And you are sad
Most of them were rich
But you are poor
Yet you take their cum
For nothing more
Seems that you're delighted
To fuck fate
You're looking for a way
To close the gate
The things you know you
Should you never do
Despite all the pain
It takes you through
My masochistic beauty
Love, let me know, let me know
Love, let me know, let me know, let me know

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard for me to tell you so
You may not be in the mood
To learn what you think you know

There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

Love, let me know, let me know

When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place
Before this love affair began
But if you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

No no no no

Tell me what it is
There's no need to make believe
Make believe, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world
Try to find a place for me
Try to find, find a place for me

'Cause at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
And if you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

Let me know, let me know
Let me know, oh
Love
Oh, baby
Stay at your best baby, yeah
Please do it for God's sakes
I came in like a restless wind
On a wagon train
But I'm gonna go like a July snow
Back to where I came from
Gonna leave this humdrum
It's too slow and tame

None of your business where I've been
Don't ask me what I've done
Run your ranch and punch your cows
And stay behind my gun man
Colorado's right hand will put you on the run

I got a gal in Denver town
That's crying over me
But I said goodbye and I let her cry
I miss her company but
I'll get out of this rut
Rio Bravo's killing me

They got a man locked in a cell
That's a freer man than I
He's gonna laugh right in their face
When they lead him out to die and
He's gonna leave these badlands
And ride off in the sky
You're gonna see old Colorado
Headin' for the door
You better believe I'm gonna leave
Like the 904 train
Gonna breathe some air again
That ain't been breathed before
The moon and you appear to be so near and yet so far from me
And here am I, on a night in June, reaching for the moon and you
I wonder if we'll ever meet, my song of love is incomplete
I'm just the words, looking for the tune, reaching for the moon and you

I wonder if we'll ever meet, my song of love is incomplete
I'm just the words, looking for the tune, reaching for the moon and you

[Intro]
Yeah, well well well, yeah-heh
Yeah, hey, hey
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Driftin' on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than with you, yeah
Lovin' you, well, well, well

Day will make a way for night
All we'll need is candle lights
And a song, yeah
Soft and long, well, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Glad to be
Here alone with a lover unlike no other
Sad to see
A new horizon slowly comin' into view, yeah

[Chorus]
I wanna be living for the love of you
Ah, yes I am
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
Alright now

[Verse 2]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Lovely as a ray of sun
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
That touches me when the morning comes
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Feels good to me, yeah
My love and me (Ooh, ooh, ooh), well
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Smoother than a gentle breeze
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Flowin' through my mind with ease
Soft as can be (Ooh, ooh, ooh), well
When you're lovin' me
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
When you're lovin' me, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Love to be
Ridin' in the waves of your love
Enchanted with your touch and
It seems to me
We could sail together in and out of mystery, well

[Chorus]
I wanna be living for the love of you
Alright now
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
You got me, girl
I wanna be living for the love of you
Alright now
All that I'm giving, giving, is for the love of you
Ah, yes, I am

[Verse 3]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Paradise I have within
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Can't feel insecure again
You're the key
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Well, and this I see
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, I see
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now and then I lose my way
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Using words that try to say
What I feel (Ooh, ooh, ooh), yeah
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Love is real
Oh, love is real, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I might as well
Sign my name on a card which could say it better
Time will tell
'Cause it seems that I've done just about all that I can do

[Outro]
I know that I'm living for the love of you
Oh, yes, I am
I know that I'm living for the love, love of you
Every, every day, I'm, living, for, the love of you
I'm living, for the love
Each and every day, I, I, oh oh, I
Oh, yes, I am
I wanna say it one more time
Said I'm living for the love
Each and every day, I, I, oh oh, I
Lord knows I am
Write that down
Said that I'm living for the love, love of you
Woo-hoo

[Verse 1]
Oh, I believe you are a rainbow
All the heaven I need to see
You're the promise everlasting
Ah, and where you are I hope to be

[Chorus]
And oh, make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl
You're all I need, oh yes you are, you're all...
You're all I need, oh yes you are
You're all I need

[Verse 2]
Whatever pain's inside, you make it better
Ah, you seem to realize when I'm concerned
You are the only one who goes through the changes
Ah, giving my life directions if I am turned

[Chorus]
And oh, make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl
You're all I need, oh yes you are, you're all...
You're all I need, oh yes you are
You're all I need

[Verse 3]
How am I worthy of love from an angel?
Princess imperial of my soul
Don't really matter if you choose not to answer
Hoping that what I've revealed you already know

[Chorus]
Make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl
You're all I need, oh yes you are, you're all...
You're all I, ooh ooh
You're all I need

[Bridge]
Oh, I love you, I love you, girl, oh oh
You're all I, ooh ooh, all I need, all I need
Ah, sweet lady

Girl, you're all I need - Girl, you're all I need
Girl, you're all I need - Girl, you're all I need
Girl, you're all I need - Girl, you're all I need
Girl, you're all I need - Girl, you're all I need
Hey, uhum, it's love
You and me got love
Like she do to me

[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love

[Verse 1:]
It seems to be the problem loving you
'Cause I love everything about you
The way you do the things that you do
I'm so happy baby, to have you here with me
And there ain't no doubt about it
I'm gonna keep you here with me
No matter what I do, I'm gonna keep loving you
Every day, every night
(It's so good to say)

[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love

[Verse 2:]
I'm in love with the things you know you do to me
And there ain't no shame about the way we swang, baby
I'll go crazy if there's no you in me
'Cause I just can, I always need you here with me
No matter what I do, I'm gonna keep loving you
Every day, every night
(It's so good to say)

[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love

I need you every day, I need you every night
I need you every day, I need you every night
I need you every day, I need you every night
I need you every day, I need you every night
(I'm in love with you)

[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
*Speaking* "G'day, my name's Tony. On behalf of myself and the coachline I'd like to thank you for choosing to drive with us today. I'm a local, I hope I can impart some local knowledge. If you've got any questions don't hesitate, just sing out. For those who are interested, there's the Old Bridge, swaying away. Replaced by the New Bridge in 1972. Funny thing, the Old Bridge used to be called the New Bridge. Yeah, bit of a funny thing. Up ahead there's the bronze of Bluey, a local sheepdog, who became a member of Regional Council. It was a bloody great day for dogs, not just here, but everywhere in the North Island. There's the town's oldest street. That's the Museum of Meat. There's the town's largest industry, that's the sock factory, hence the giant sock."

*Sings* The town hall
Note the mosaic wall
Well, there are 5,600 tiles on that wall
I know, I counted them all
The local school, the local swimming pool
Which was opened by the Governor General
Back in 1952
Where I was caught with a friend aged 11, sniffing tractor fuel
We thought we were pretty cool, breaking them changing shed rules

But do you see up there?
The banner hanging in the air?
The Presbyterian Fair
Well, I never go, there's too many Presbyterians there
But if you're interested, the fair's in the third weekend of August every year
But don't bother entering the raffle
It's always won by some kid of the Mayor

Do you hear that sound?
The town clock, heard from anywhere in town
Until 1960, it was a little place in Norway
We bought it for a hundred pounds
Rumor has it they sold it cheap because the chimes were too loud
But every time I hear that sound it makes me so proud
Look to your left, what a beautiful sight
It's Paula, Paula Thompson, nee Paula Wright
Look at her hair, it's still gorgeous, even now
Flowing like the Womahonga River
Which incidently, is to your right
And it's the largest, in the area
In terms of volume
Everybody, look at Paula, look at Paula Thompson
I always thought I'd marry Paula
But some things just don't work out that way
Well, that's the most important thing you'll learn on the tour today
That, and the fact there'll be a toilet break
At the information center near the manmade lake

*Speaking* "Yeah, I'll just ask you one favor, if you do see Paula in town later on that you don't mention the details of the tour. I'd appreciate that. Same goes for my wife, Gloria. You'll recognize her, she looks a hell of a lot like Paula, actually. She often gets mistaken for Paula, but, um, well, she's not Paula, that's for sure, no."

*Singing*
Paula Thompson, born in '54
To a family of four
To the family next door
Take me back next door
Paula Thompson, nee Paula Wright
That's her old house, number 39
Number 41 was mine
If this old coach could go back in time
I'd drive to 1979
Take me back...
Take me back, take me back
(Take, take, take, take me back)
Take me back, take me back
(Take, take, take, take me back)
Take me back, take me back, take me back, take me back, take me back, take me back...
*Speaking* "Yeah, sorry about that. I always get a little bit emotional on the corner of Rutherford and Brown Streets. But, um, that is truly the end of the tour, so mind your step, yeah, good on you."

[Intro: Girl & Mike]
Mike...
Yeah, baby
It's over
How can you say that?
I'm sorry, that love is gone
No, please don't leave me
Don't feel bad
How can I not feel bad? I love you
But, it's better this way
No, I don't believe this
No, baby

[Verse 1]
I never thought that it could be
You would turn and do this to me
I can feel the love that we had here between us merely fade away
You told me you'd never go away
And for me you'd always be here
Now you tell me that something's wrong and you must move on

[Chorus]
A lonely heart is what I'll be
If no one cares for me
Let me show you now
The way that it would be if you were with me
Now I can feel the love we share
When you say it's not there
Deep inside I know that you still care
But I need you to show me now

[Verse 2]
I'm lookin' for a quiet place where love is free
And the dreams we shared last eternally
I feel now that it's the time
So won't you please come over here?
The closer and the closer I get to you
Keeps me warm to know that you'll stay around
So please keep your promise to me and don't go

[Chorus]
A lonely heart is what I'll be
If no one cares for me
Let me show you now
The way that it would be if you were with me
Now I can feel the love we share
When you say it's not there
Deep inside I know that you still care
But I need you to show me now
If no one cares for me

[Outro]
Let me show you now
The way that it would be if you were with me
Now I can feel the love we share (I can feel, I can feel)
When you say it's not there
Deep inside I know that you still care (Deep inside, deep inside)
But I need you to show me now
(If no one cares for me)
(Let me show you now, the way that it would be)
I don't feel bad
I don't feel lonely
I'm just glad its over

I don't need your love, and I don't want it
Heaven's up above and I'm upon it
Without you, without you

I don't want to kiss you again, can you believe it?
I don't want to be your friend
I just want you out of my life until my life ends
Oh yeah

I don't feel bad
I don't feel lonely
I'm just glad its over

I know you think I'm weak, I'll tell you something
It's better if we don't speak I got nothing
To say to you anyway
I said what I meant, to put it mildly
I hate you 100 per cent, I mean that kindly
Oh, you're not for me, not for me

I don't feel bad
And you're not the only one I ever had

I don't feel sad
I don't feel lonely
I'm not even sorry
I'm just glad its over

I'm not playing with you
You're just getting your due
Oh, it's true, it's true
I'm just glad it's over

Oh, I'm sorry I ran, I didn't mean it
Let's get back to where we began, stop screaming
I want you back in my arms every day
After today

Don't feel bad
Oh, you know I'm sorry
Just be glad it's over
Don't feel sad
We all have to be lonely
Just be glad it's over

I'm just glad it's over
I can see the sun shinin' down on me
Is it you my love that I can see
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me walk to Monday's rain (Monday's rain)
To Monday's rain (Monday's rain)

In this my life, I walk in light
You are my love so baby I'm all right
Don't let me down, baby
Don't let me down
Oh baby, please don't let me walk in Monday's rain (Monday's rain)
In Monday's rain (Monday's rain)

Ah....

Ev'ry man alive has got to have someone
So what will I do when baby you are gone
Don't let me down
Don't walk on me
My Sunday sunshine
Hide Monday's rain (Monday's rain)
Hide Monday's rain (Monday's rain)
Monday's rain (Monday's rain) Ah...
I am loved, I am loved
By the one I love in every way
I am loved, absolutely loved
What a wonderful thing to be able to say

I'm adored, I'm adored
By the one who first led my heart astray
I'm adored, absolutely adored
What a wonderful thing to be able to say

So ring out the bells and let the trumpets blow
And beat on the drums, 'cause now I know, I know

I am loved, I am loved
What a wonderful thing, what a beautiful thing
What a glorious thing to be able to say
What a wonderful thing, what a beautiful thing
What a glorious thing, I am loved

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
A thousand bails of that mid shit

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
This that 

[?] kush shit
My girlfriend think she president Bush, bitch
Hell yeah, and I'm gone off that lean shit
My brother Duke keep on sendin' me that green shit
Fuck jail, Gucci time, man I'm hood rich
I'm in that Zone 6, I throw it like the first pitch
My yellow 'Rari in the front and I parked it
A black chick in some heels match the carpet
I'm pullin' up to the club like I own it
Ain't with that bullshit, Gucci don't condone it
My tolerance get low with the flexin'
I woke up, bought my main chick a Lexus

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
A thousand bails of that mid shit
Hell yeah, this that shit that get your kids rich

[Verse 2: Slim Dunkin]
I be the brick squad youngin', leave you stankin' like a Funyun
On these other rap nigga's toes like a bunion
I'm BS, and you BS, but I'm Brick Squad, you the Bull Shit
Pistol like my chaperone, we goin' on a school trip
Places that you never seen, blowin' on that stupid green
Rollin' on a stupid beam, hit the scene in limousines
Codeine and Promethazine, diamonds in my pinky ring
Nigga what the fuck you mean?
Brick Squad, dream team
I got money to blow, naw, I ain't Drizzy
Money make the world go 'round, that's why I'm dizzy
Standin' behind Gucci, Flock, they like "Who is he?"
Slim Dunkin in this muhfucka, cut the chizzy

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
A thousand bails of that mid shit
Hell yeah, this that shit that get your kids rich
Hell yeah, a hundred bags of that kush shit

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It's Big Gucci, excuse me while I ball
Until my release my nigga, no lights out
Lights out, creep on in silence
Why do I promote violence while nonviolent?
Why my tattoos smilin'?
To remind me of the time they robbed me with no problems
Now my problem solvin' is revolvin' around all these continents
And my company stretch from here to Compton to Bouldercrest
But brother 

[?] say, "Bompton"
That's somethin' to those who have nothin'
No bluffin', Brick Squad, no cuffin'

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
A thousand bails of that mid shit
Hell yeah, this that shit that get your kids rich

Hell yeah, a hundred bags of that kush shit
Hell yeah, this that president Bush shit
Hell yeah

[Verse 1]
Shifting, shifting, shifting a lot
Like it makes so much difference to me
Huffing, puffing, marching around
Like I know how much better it should be
I know it looks like I disagree, nine-tenths of the time

[Chorus]
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind

[Verse 2]
Childhood puppy is old and gruff
Your mother wants to give him away
Pillar of strength was lifted off his deathbed
Three weeks ago today

[Chorus]
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind

[Chorus]
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind...
They wait to plead their case, unknown cast aside
I love to see their face, can we spare the lie?
Are we afraid to see them, prisoners of history
These beautiful minds, trapped inside, bring them back to life
Let 'em shine, let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine, let 'em shine on

So dark when I see sparks, if we don't snuff 'em out
We've gotta let 'em flame, let 'em speak their name
Let 'em reach up to the clouds
Can't eat if we don't feed 'em, can't read if we don't teach 'em
There's no light if we just hide 'em
Don't just let 'em die
Let 'em shine (yeah yeah yeah) let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine (yeah yeah yeah) let 'em shine on
Oh let 'em shine on (yeah yeah yeah) let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine on (yeah yeah yeah) let 'em shine, on

Oh sparks flicker, in the distance
Lonely out in space
They sing out, but we're not listening
Cause we don't see their face
We can't let 'em die we can't, make 'em hide
All the little miracles that live inside
Let 'em shine, oh
Let 'em shine (yeah yeah yeah) let 'em shine on
Let 'em live (yeah yeah yeah) let 'em shine on
Let 'em be loved (yeah yeah yeah) let 'em shine on
Let 'em grow (yeah yeah yeah) let 'em shine, on
C'mon let 'em love (yeah yeah yeah) hey
C'mon let 'em love (yeah yeah yeah) hey hey hey yeah
C'mon let 'em love (yeah yeah yeah) Yeah-ha-heah
C'mon, yeah-ha-heah-ha-heahh

Hold 'em close, let 'em know
That they'll get through the night
Ordinary people could, be a hero
Don't put out the light!

Let 'em shine, let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine, let 'em shine on
Yeah
Yea-yeah
Let 'em shine on
When I was sitting on my piano one day
A magical thought came my way
To write a number for the BBC
Kenny Everett McCartney
All together on the wireless machine
Kenny Everett McCartney
All together on the wireless machine
Kenny Everett McCartney
All together on the wireless machine
I do believe that I won't make it through the night
If you don't come on back to me and love me now
There ain't no way that I can say that it's all right
I do believe that you're not thinking anyhow

But I believe if you'll remember how it was a little while
If you'll recall that what we had was hard to beat
And I believe that if you'll meet me half way down that second mile
We will trade in all the bitter for the sweet

I do believe that you're not happy without me
I think you feel the way I'm feeling without you
Come on and give in to that feeling one more time
I do believe you won't regret it if you do

But I believe if you'll remember
Got a new way of driving
Come ride in this car with me
Got a new way of driving
Come ride in this car with me
I ride so you bring back your memory

We'll ride in the mornin'
Put your clean clothes in my arms
We'll ride in the mornin'
Put your clean clothes in my arms
I'll ride so even
I swear I won't do harm

Well we'll ride in the mornin'
We'll ride at night
We'll ride pretty baby til we ride just right

Come on baby in this car with me
I'll ride you so easy
Bring back your memory
Well we'll ride in the mornin'
Ride before day
Ride pretty baby drive the blues away

Come on baby in this car with me
I'll ride you so easy
Bring back your memory
Hey, Mona, hey hey hey hey, Mona
I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna build my house next door to you
Can I make love to you once in a while?
Maybe we could do a little kissing and tellin' lies
When I come out on the front, girl
You'll listen to my heart goin' bumpity bump
I need you baby and it ain't no lie
When I'm through lovin' I'll surely die
You give your hand to me
And then you say hello
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
But you don't know me

No, you don't know the one
Who dreams of you each night
And longs to kiss your lips
And longs to hold you tight
To you I am just a friend
That's all I've ever been
No you don't know me

But I never knew
The art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you

Afraid and shy I let my chance goes by
The chance that you might love me too
You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy

You'll never ever know
The one who loved you so
No, you don't know me
Know what you really need
You can't get enough
Too many mouths to feed
Ain't life enough
Call this survival
Don't pray for a sign

Know what you really want
You can't get it back
Down on the water front
Better watch out Jack
Nights on the mainline
Rust on the rail

I've seen 'em swindle this town
I've seen 'em tumble it down
I've seen red rivers, fire and steel
I've felt the thunder chained to the wheel

Know what you mean to me
Goes deeper than that
Can't fight your destiny
Don't know where it's at
Don't look for light'n
Or pray for a sign
I've heard the legends
I've watched the skies
I feel the power
The flame in your eyes

I've seen 'em swindle this town
I've seen 'em tumble it down
I've seen red rivers, fire and steel
I've felt the thunder chained to the wheel
Love is funny or it's sad
Or it's quiet or it's mad
It's a good thing or it's bad
But beautiful

Beautiful to take a chance and if you fall, you fall
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all

Love is tearful or it's gay
It's a problem or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But beautiful

And I'm thinking if you were mine, I'd never let you go
And that would be but beautiful, I know

[Instrumental]

Love is tearful or it's gay
It's a problem or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But it's beautiful
And I'm thinking if you were mine, I'd never let you go
And that would be but beautiful, I know
Moonlight mood when twilight is ending
You're in my moonlight mood and our hearts are blending
There comes the same old glow that we used to know long ago
You appear in a ribbon of moonlight

There you are, as lovely as ever
You vow by every star to love me forever
Although you're far away, we meet in my solitude
You are mine when I'm in my moonlight mood

There you are, as lovely as ever
You vow by every star to love me forever
Although you're far away, we meet in my solitude
You are mine when I'm in my moonlight mood
I met her in Venezuela
With a basket on her head
If she loved others she didn't say
But I knew she'd do, to pass away the time in Venezuela
Pass away the time in Venezuela

I gave her a silken sash of blue
A beautiful sash of blue
Because I knew that she could do
With all the tricks, I knew she knew
To pass away the time in Venezuela

And when the wind was out to sea
The wind was out to sea
And she was taking leave of me
I said: Cheer up there'll always be
Sailors ashore on leave in Venezuela

Her lingo was strange but the thought of her beautiful smile
The thought of her beautiful smile
Will haunt me and taunt me for many a mile
She was my gal and she did the while
To pass away the time in Venezuela
Well, East coast girls are hip, I really dig those styles they wear
And the Southern girls with the way they talk, they knock me out when I'm down there
The Mid-West farmers’ daughters really make you feel alright
And the Northern girls with the way they kiss they keep their boyfriends warm at night

I wish they all could be California girls
(I wish they all could be California)
I wish they all could be California girls

The West coast has the sunshine and the girls all get so tanned
I dig a french bikini on Hawaii island dolls by a palm tree in the sand
I been all around this great big world and I seen all kind of girls
Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the states, back to the cutest girls in the world

I wish they all could be California girls
(I wish they all could be California)
I wish they all could be California girls

I wish they all could be California girls
(Girls, girls, girls, yeah, I dig the)
(I wish they all could be California)
(Girls, girls, girls, yeah, I dig the)
I wish they all could be California girls
(Girls, girls, girls, yeah, I dig the)
(I wish they all could be California)
(Girls, girls, girls, yeah, I dig the)
I wish they all could be California girls
(Girls, girls, girls, yeah, I dig the)
(I wish they all could be California)
(Girls, girls, girls, yeah, I dig the)
I wish they all could be California girls
(Girls, girls, girls, yeah, I dig the)
(I wish they all could be California)
(Girls, girls, girls, yeah, I dig the)
Oooh
(Girls, girls, girls, yeah, I dig the)
Girls
(I wish they all could be California)
Oo-oooh
Allures
You ask and not
Remain forever
In a state of infertility
No, you ask and not
Remain forever
In a state of Infertility
No, they sure will have to come out
(They sure will have to come out)
One day in the big world, the big world
(One day into the big world)
Oh lay me down in Forest Lawn in a silver casket
Put golden flowers over my head in a silver basket
Let the drum and bugle corp play taps while cannons roar
And sixteen liveried employees sell souveniers from the funeral store

I want to go simply when I go
They'll give me a simple funeral there I know
With a casket lined in fleece
And fireworks spelling out "rest in peace."
Oh take me when I'm gone to Forest Lawn

Oh lay me down in Forest Lawn, they understand there
They have a heavenly choir and a military band there
Just put me in their care, I'll find my comfort there
With sixteen planes in a last salute they'll drop a cross in a parachute

I want to go simply when I go
They'll give me a simple funeral there I know:
With a hundred strolling strings
And topless dancers with golden wings!
Oh take me when I'm gone to Forest Lawn
Oh, come, come, come, come
Come to the church in the wildwood
Kindly leave a contribution in the pail
Be as simple and as trusting as a child would
And we'll sell you the church in the dale

To find a simple resting place is my desire;
To lay me down with a smiling face comes a little bit higher
My likeness cast in brass will stand in plastic grass
While hidden weights and springs tip it's hat to the mourners filing past!

I want to go simply when I go
They'll give me a simple funeral there I know
I'll lie beneath the sand
With piped in tapes of Billy Graham
Oh take me when I'm gone to Forest Lawn

Rock of Ages, cleft for me
For a slightly higher fee!

Oh take me when I'm gone to Forest Lawn!

[Intro:]
Don't go
Don't go
Oh whoa, don't go, yeah
Don't go, you can't leave me now
Oh, oh, whoa don't go

If you leave me now
You take away the biggest part of me, oh baby
Ooooh no, woman please don't go

You'll take away the very heart of me, babe
Don't break my heart woman
Oooh no, no baby, please don't go
Oooh no, I want you to stay

[Bridge:]
Oh listen
A love like ours, this love is hard to find
How could we let it slip away
You see, we come too far, baby
To leave it all behind
Look around
How could we end it all this way
(Don't leave me this way)
When tomorrow comes and we both regret
The things that we said, said today baby
Oh yeah, don't leave me
Don't leave me, don't leave me, ooh yeah
Try and understand baby

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge:]
Ooooh, baby
A love like ours, this love is hard to find
They don't have any baby
How could we let it slip away, oh it's slippin' baby
I feel it slippin' baby, slippin' away
We come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all today
Oh when tomorrow comes and we'll both regret
The things that we said today, baby
I don't want that on me girl

[Verse 1:]
And oh
If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest
The biggest, the biggest part of me
Oooh, oh no, don't go baby
Oooh, I just want you to stay, shorty

Stay baby, stay, stay, stay babe
Don't go baby
La da da da da da da da da
Please don't go
No, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, I ain't gon' let you leave babe
Oh, I'm gonna try my best to stop you baby
Oh babe

[Ad-Libs]

Whoa, I think he's so embarassed
And I ain't gon' have it (don't go)
No, not today baby
If you leave me now
Move, walk away from the door
Close that door girl
When the wind was green
At the start of the spring
When the wind was green
Like a living thing

It was on my lips
And it's kiss was fair
You were there

When the wind was red
Like a summer wine
When the wind was red
Like your lips on mine

It caressed my face
And it tossed my hair
You were there

Then came the fall and all of love
Came tumbling, stumbling down
Like leaves that lost to frost and found
They were flying-crying
In a brown wind dying
But the winter's come and we both should know
That the wind is white like the swirling snow
And we'll never see all the wonderful things to be seen
When the wind is green
See here's the thing

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig the attitude and how you're actin' like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travie and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me?
Hmm, that sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burgulary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some naked peekaboo
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Such an angel with a devilish angle
I'm quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl
And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Now here's another bar, I'm coming for the slow gunners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your mom and 'em
No turning back so you better buckle up
Shit, don't be concerned with mine
I feel like a Speak and Spell way I got you learning my lines
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I change my name to "Did He Really Just Say That Shit?"
Yep
I'll take a mile if you let me
6-5, 200 plus and so sexy
My legs going numb for keeping my phone on vibrate
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been tryin' to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

[Verse]
Good god girl, you're giving me goosebumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you
It's not a scam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan, I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like the antidote's under my tongue
Whoa

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Damn
I remember when, I remember
I remember when I lost my mind
Something so special about that place
Even your emotions had an echo, so much space
And when you're out there
Out there, I'm out of touch, babe
It wasn't because I didn't know enough, no
I knew too much
Do you think I'm crazy
Do you think I'm crazy
Do you think I'm crazy
Do you think I'm crazy
I heard that you had
Had the time of your life
Don't think twice, don't think twice
That's my advice to you
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control
Yeah, I think you're crazy
Yes, I think you're crazy
Oh, I think you're crazy
Oh, I think you're crazy, baby
My heroes had the heart
To live a li li li to live
And all I remember is that
I want to be like them
Do you think I'm crazy
Do you think I'm crazy
Do you think I'm crazy
Do you think I'm crazy, child
You are there, in autumn gold or summer green
You are there, to lend enchantment to the scene
I hear music, and all because You Are There

In a mist, behind a window in the dawn
We have kissed, but when I reached for you, you'd gone...
You come and you go, like April snow
Until I wonder, darling

Are you real, or an illusion I embrace
Half a dream, the other half that laughing face
Although, in my heart, I know that
You are there
You are there
You are there!
Well
Hey, hit the right note this time, OK?
What's the right note?
Play it this time
Probably an F C
Easy, I haven't learned it yet
Hey, man, they expect me to play this woo-woo machine
This is ridiculous
Give me a note
Hey, yeah, it really is
Just for instance a note
We're talking of the E flat actually
We aren't too nervous for this song
Ah, this is the second night we've tried it
If the light man would just dim the lights a little, in fact just turn them, out I'd like to go look for a fire hydrant
Easy
Well, enough for the locker room patter
Carl did so well on that last diddy
We thought he'd do another one, wouldn't you Carl?
Yeah
Of course with the group's help, you know
OK, he's gonna do our new song called "Good Vibrations"
Here we go
One, two, three
I, I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(Oom-bop-bop, good vibrations)
She's giving me excitations
(Bop-bop, excitations)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(Good, good, good, good vibrations)
She's giving me excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(Good, good, good, good vibrations)
She's giving me excitations

Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(Oom-bop-bop, good vibrations)
She's giving me excitations
(Bop-bop, excitations)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(Good, good, good, good vibrations)
She's giving me excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(Good, good, good, good vibrations)
She's giving me excitations
(Aaaaah)
(Ah, my, my, what)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(Ah, my, my, what a sensation)
(Ah, my, my, what elation)
(Ah, my, my, what elation)

Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a happenin'

Aaaaah

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(Good, good, good, good vibrations)
She's giving me excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(Good, good, good, good vibrations)
She's giving me excitations

Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Hey
Uh
Thank you
Wow, thank you very much
Thanks
Thank you
The Beach Boys!
A real big hand for them folks
I had it all worked out
I thought I knew just what I want
But, girl, as it turned out
I guess I really didn't know at all

I've been playin' life by the ear
Now the words of love I hear
Is so very clear

Whenever you are near
It's like a spell that's taken over me
What's happenin', my dear?
It wasn't in my plans to fall in love

But, girl, what can I do?
You see, I'm so in love with you
I'm so in love, baby

You never know when
(You're gonna fall in love)
Oh, it just seems to happen
You never know when
(You're gonna fall in love)
You see, love has no sense of time

You never know when
You're gonna fall in love
Love

Since you came around
There's been a certain change in me
And in your love I felt
I slowly found myself turnin' around

How could I let myself go?
I guess you'll never really know
Ah, ah, you never, never, never, ever, ever know

You never know when
(You're gonna fall in love)
Oh, boy, it just seems to happen

You never know when
(You're gonna fall in love)
You see, love has no sense of time

You never know when
You're gonna fall
Love has no sense of time
Love has no sense of time

Ooh, hoo, you never know when
You're gonna fall in love

[Verse 1]
I know what people say
They say you don't know how to love
But I want you anyway
You're like a drug and I can't get enough
You'd be great in motion pictures
'Cause baby, you really got me blind
You're the only one I wanna see
You're the only one that does it to me every time

[Chorus]
Baby, you're an ocean that's too wide to cross
And baby, you're the cross that's too deep to bear
Baby, you're the star that's too far away
Baby, you're a trip and a half, but I don't care

[Verse 2]
I know what people think
They think I'm a star struck little fool
But baby, you could be flat broke
I'd still be crazy for you
I know that I'm in love
'Cause I'd change my whole life just to make you smile
And I still can't have you when I want
But when I do it's only for a little while

[Chorus]
Baby, you're an ocean that's too wide to cross
And baby, you're the cross that's too deep to bear
Baby, you're the star that's too far away
Baby, you're a trip and a half, but I don't care

[Post-Chorus]
You see, it's in my diet (Diet), ooh
Something in the water don't compute, ooh
Baby, I'm quite happy after you give me love
And you can see who's the fool

[Bridge]
You're, you're an ocean too wide to cross
(Baby, you're an ocean that's too wide to cross)
(Baby, you're the cross that's too deep to bear)
Yes you are, ooh
(Baby, you're the star that's too far away)
Baby, baby
(Baby, you're a trip, I don't care)
You're a trip and a half, a trip and a half, half
(Baby, you're an ocean that's too wide to cross)
(Baby, you're the cross that's too deep to bear)
You are the star who's much too far away
(Baby you're a trip)
You
Baby
(Baby, you're a trip)
You're a trip, yeah, and a half (Baby, you're a trip)
(Baby, you're a trip)
You're a trip and a half
And I don't, I don't, I don't care, I don't care (Baby, you're a trip)
Baby, baby, no no (Baby, you're a trip)
You're a trip and a half, baby
Trip and a half (Baby, you're a trip)
I'd do anything you want me to do, baby
I'd change my life for you, you (Baby, you're a trip)
You, you are that star who's much too far away
I don't care girl 'cause I, I, I, I love (Baby, you're a trip)
You, love you, baby, oh yes (Baby, you're a trip)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're a trip and a half, a half (Baby, you're a trip)
You're a trip and a half (Baby, you're a trip)
(Baby, you're a trip)

[Outro]
I, I know those people say
They say you don't know how to love
But I want you anyway, baby, you're like a drug
I can't get enough 'cause you
You'd be great in motion pictures, girl
You really got me blind
You'd be the only one I wanna see
Only one that done it every time
I'd do the do with you
You're like an ocean much too wide to cross
You are the cross that's much too deep to bear
You are the star much too far away
But I don't care, you're a trip and a half
I want you every day, hey
A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an "Oh, beg your pardon"
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said, "May I have the next one?"
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions, but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words "ever after"
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream
She was bronzing in the sun drinking a cool rum punch
When a guy named D' Gatoni said, "Wow! Let me take
Your picture. You could be a model, girl. There's a guy
I know to show you how."
Now a model waves good-bye as on the plane she flies
Off to meet the king, the King of Tonga
King of Tonga
Now the girl gets to the palace dressed in black silk lace
She says, "Well, my king of fashion and fame..."
And the king swings down and he fall on his face
Said, "I'm so really, really glad you came."
Now the girl tries to resist, running from his kiss
Now she's callin' the cops on the King of Tonga
King of Tonga
Daddy still doesn't momma night
Tells her son, "Son, you squeeze her tight."
His daddy taught him everything he knows
So the king steals the daddy's clothes
Now the police knew the king, they knew him very well
They said, "King, king what's the matter now?"
He said, "Boys, you've got to talk to this bride-to-be
'Cause this crazy girl won't take my vow."
They said, "Give her romance."
And the king takes a chance
And soon there'll be a new Queen
For the King of Tonga
King of Tonga
King of Tonga

[Prince: Spoken]
Oh what a beautiful morning
Oh what a beautiful ass
Darling, this is my final plea for love
Take me now or witness this slow and horrible death of your purple fox
My time is running out
I can wait no longer
I watch as you make love to others
Disgusting as it seems, it intoxicates me
You might say that I'm amused to the point where my blood increases
My heartbeat accelerates and my mouth waters uncontrollably
For I know that no man will ever love you like your purple fox
No man will ever kiss you in this lifetime or the next
The way you and I kiss tonight
Take me now as I am
For I am becoming confused to what I stand for and desire
Tell me, darling
Who I am, who I am, what I am, what am I?

[Sung]
Oh! Are these my lips?
Or are they petals from some crazy flower?
Oh! Are these my hips?
If they are, then they're some kind of powerful

All day, all night
You can be my baby, I'll make you feel alright
All day, all night
You can be my baby, I'll make you feel alright

Oh! Is this ur mouth?

You can be my baby, I'll make you feel alright
All day, all night
You can be my baby, I'll make you feel alright
Whoo! Shockalaka
Mmm
Shockalaka

Oh! Is this your house?
Or am I in an ocean of desire?
Oh! You make me wanna shout
When I'm in your love, I feel on fire, ooh
All day, all night
You can be my baby, I'll make you feel alright
All day, all night
You can be my baby, I'll make you feel alright
Whoo! Shockalaka

Uh-huh
Rodney Burke: I've got one card here and it's on the same subject, eh, but this one says, "We think the show is great and we dig the Beatles the most, but we still haven't heard a word from Ringo yet."
Ringo: Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!
Rodney: "And how about him singing?" Well, what will you sing for us, Ringo? Will you say a few words?
Ringo: Hello, there, kiddies. I'd like to sing a song for you today called "Matchbox." There you go
Rodney: Set fire to that lot. Okay, Ringo, thanks very much
Ringo: Don't you et smart with me, you know
Rodney: Do you mind? Get over to your microphone, "Matchbox."
Oh, I can't explain baby
But heaven only knows why
Oh, I can't explain
And heaven only knows why
Yes, I'll be in love with you baby
I guess until the day I die

You are to me, baby
What the water is to the sea
Oh, you are to me, baby
What the water is to the sea
I only want your love, baby
So tell me why don't you want me

Yes, I don't believe in miracles
I believe what's to be will be
Yes, I don't believe, I don't believe in miracles
I only believe what's to be will be
Yes but if I did believe in miracles, baby
Baby, you would be a miracle to me
Yes, you're my first thought baby
Yes my last and in between
Oh, you're my first thought baby
Yes my last and in between
I say you're the greatest champion baby
Oh that any man has ever seen

[Verse 1]
Louise, she just wasn't thinking
When she climbed into his bed
She only wanted to lie beside him
To hell with his best friend
She woke him up and she whispered
But the answer wasn't good:
"Whatever made you think I would ever love you
Even if I could?"

[Chorus]
Louise (Louise)
You can't be anybody's friend
Louise (Louise)
I'll love you 'til I'm dead
Louise (Louise)
Not even if she likes the way you dance
Louise never heard about puppy love
'Cause they don't know that term in France

[Verse 2]
She came from across the country
Just to stare into her phone
She came to the same apartment
She only wanted to be left alone
And she could catch anybody's attention
But it never won her friends
Love could kick you out on the streets
But it'd never pay your rent

[Chorus]
Louise (Louise)
You can't be anybody's friend
Louise (Louise)
I'll love you til I'm dead
Louise (Louise)
Not even if she likes the way you dance
Louise never heard about puppy love
'Cause they don't know that term in France
This time we almost made the pieces fit, didn't we?
This time we almost some sense of it, didn't we?
This time I have the answer right here in my hand
Then I touched it, and it has turned to sand

This time we almost sang the song in tune, didn't we?
This time we almost made it to the moon, didn't we?
This time, we almost made (almost made) a poem rhyme
And this time we almost made that long hard climb
Didn't we almost make it this time?
This time

[Verse 1]
I yearn for romantic compassion
To love is my sole aspiration
For thee who has love in a million
That has burnt unto consternation

[Verse 2]
All those who are pig-faced and divisive
Glowing for our faces and our hearts
Fusing at the sad transformation
That has sadly altered the power

[Chorus]
It had to end, became too disappointing
Another end leading a new beginning
I'll try again, the right one will come along
I need someone intoxicating and strong

[Verse 1]
I yearn for romantic compassion
To love is my sole aspiration
For thee who has love in a million
That has burnt unto consternation

[Chorus]
It had to end, became too disappointing
Another end leading a new beginning
I'll try again, the right one will come along
I need someone intoxicating and strong

[Verse 1]
Out of all the reindeer you know you’re the mastermind, yeah
Run, run Rudolph, Randolph's not too far behind

[Chorus]
Ooh, run, run Rudolph, Santa’s got to make it to town, yeah
(Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph)
Santa, make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
(Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph)
Run, run Rudolph, wheeling like a merry-go-round, ooh

[Verse 2]
Said Santa to a boy child "what have you been longing for?" Yeah
"All I want for Christmas is a rock and roll electric guitar" Yeah
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a shooting star, ooh

[Chorus]
Said run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
(Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph)
Santa, make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down, yeah
(Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph)
Run, run Rudolph, wheeling like a merry-go-round, yeah yeah

[Bridge]
Uh-huh, oh, yeah yeah
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
Ooh ooh, oh yeah yeah, oh

[Chorus]
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
(Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph)
Santa, make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
(Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph)
Run, run Rudolph, wheeling like a merry-go-round

[Verse 3]
Said Santa to a girl child "what would you like most to get?"
"I want a little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink and wet"
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a saber jet

[Chorus]
Run, run Rudolph, Santa’s got to make it to town
(Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph)
Yeah yeah, Santa, make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
(Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph)
Oh, run, run Rudolph, wheeling like a merry-go-round, yeah
Run, run Rudolph, Santa’s got to make it to town
(Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph)
Santa, make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
(Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph)
Hey, run, run Rudolph, wheeling like a merry-go-round

[Outro]
Oh, run Rudolph, wheeling like a merry-go-round
Run, run Rudolph, wheeling like a merry-go-round
I think I'm gonna have to move, people
I gotta move out of my neighborhood
Hey, I said I'm gonna have to move
I gotta get out of my neighborhood
Because you see
The women they tell lies on me
And the men they just don't mean me
No doggone good

Every time my telephone rings
Some lady trying to play
Some old funny game on me
Every time my telephone rings
Some lady trying to play
Some old funny game on me
And every time my front doorbell rings
Some angry six foot man
With a knife in his hand

They say I'm in love with a woman
That works down at the Chicken Shack
They say Deacon Jones' wife
Gave me a brand new Cadillac
That's why I gotta move
I gotta get out of my neighborhood
I tell you the people
They tell lies on me
Hey, they just don't mean me
No doggone good
My landlady came by my apartment

She came by just to make up my bed
But it took her all night long
Can you imagine what the neighbors said
That's why I gotta move
Hey, I gotta get out
Of my neighborhood
I tell you the people
They tell lies on me
Hey, they just don't mean me
No doggone good

Hey, I gotta move
Hey, I gotta move
I gotta move
I gotta move

Hey, the people, the people
Don't like me here, people
Oh you know they just don't mean me
No doggone good

Nobody loves me but my mother
Sometimes I think
She could be jiving, too
Hey, nobody
Nobody loves me but my mother
And she could be jiving, too
Now I think you know
Why I act funny, baby
Oh when you do the things you do

[Intro: Izza Kizza]
Must be the worst day of my life
Izza Kizza, girl

[Verse 1: Calvin Harris]
My first mistake was letting you into my life
Yes, it was
My second mistake was allowing you into my bed
Laying in my bed
My third mistake was loving you more than I should
Though I really should know better
My fourth mistake was sitting with you
While you're telling me that you can't do this anymore

[Chorus: Calvin Harris]
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side

[Verse 2: Calvin Harris]
I'm walking home and listening to MP3s
Just how did I let you decide to destroy me?
I'm missing you, it crossed my mind that a heart will bleed
The love that I have left behind is gonna finish me
It's one of those days

[Chorus: Calvin Harris & Izza Kizza]
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side
('Cause it's the worst day of my life)
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
(Girl, Izza Kizza)
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side

[Verse 3: Izza Kizza]
See, yesterday, I called her back
The day before, I called her flat
It ain't working, break my neck
Still, it ain't cut me my cheque
A week ago, I did my thing
Three o' clock, I missed my train
Tomorrow, I thought we could chill
There won't be us, you won't, I will
The moral of the story like I told my cousin Corey
You see, Cupid, he will stab you in the back like Jason Voorhees
So he's got smoking me cigarettes and got me drinkin' 40s
And the doctor said, "Take two of these
And call me in the morning"
It's the worst day

[Chorus: Calvin Harris & Izza Kizza]
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side

[Bridge: Izza Kizza]
Yeah, writing's on the wall
Got no heart, no soul, no control

[Outro: Calvin Harris]
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
My life
Don't make me beg for your kisses
Beg for your tender embrace
I want your love, not your sympathy
Please don't make a beggar of me

Since I looked in your direction
Your tenderness is all I seem to crave
But when I look for your affection
You smile, my dear, and tell me to behave

Don't make me beg for your kisses
Beg for your tender embrace
I want your love, not your sympathy
Please don't make a beggar of me

While I sigh and keep confessing
The love I have for you will never die
Somehow you always keep me guessing
And wondering just how long I'll have to cry

Don't make me beg for your kisses
Beg for your tender embrace
I want your love, not your sympathy
Please don't make a beggar of me
What good are words I say to you?
They can't convey to you what's in my heart
If you could hear instead
The things I've left unsaid

Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

So lucky to be
The one you run to see
In the evening, when the day is through

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new

And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you
I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new

And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you
Lucky to be loving you
We were growing, time was going so fast
Without knowing, we were growing so fast

We were lying down, in the shade
I remember the love we made

We were lying down, on a bed
I remember the tears we shed

We were growing, time was going so fast, (Growing up)
Without knowing, (Falling down) we were growing up fast (Growing up, Falling down)
(Growing up, Falling down)

We were laughing too, we were sad
I remember the fun we had
We were crying loud, with the pain
We will never be here again

Growing up, falling down

[Intro]
Ah..
Man, why did it have to happen to me?
Man, what did I do to get this?
What'd I do to deserve this?
Check it out, uh

[Verse 1]
I woke up in the morning with my hand on my head
Not knowin' this would be one day that I'd dread
I prayed the night before, for a let-me-live
The way this day turned out wasn't my prerogative
I went to the kitchen to get some cereal smooth as silk
But when I looked in the ice box, there wasn't no milk
Well I don't need no breakfast, I'm too fat anyway
I just grab a cup of juice and be on my way
So I got my car keys, on route to my job
I walked out, my windows broken and my car got robbed
They took my radio and my favorite cassette
What a way to start the day, aww - what's next?
I get to the office, my boss starts to scream
It was really unbelievable, like a bad dream
He kept talkin' all this blahse blahse
And looked at me and said, "What you have to say?"

[Chorus]
I'm havin' a bad day
Things ain't goin' my way
I'm havin' a bad day
Today, today
I'm havin' a bad day
Things ain't goin' my way
I'm havin' a bad day
Today, today

[Verse 2]
Here's somethin' else that happened to me
In the middle of this day that's B-A-D
To begin this era of grief and aggravation
I was parked by a meter and still got a citation
Took the ticket off my window, got in my car alright
A cop pulled behind me at a red light
"Your liscence, registration and insurance card"
I was buggin' out 'cause it was really hard
I didn't do nothin', asked, "Why'd you pull me over?
You never saw a young man drive a Range Rover?"
He let me go and said, "Don't do it again" - "Why,"
I said, "Thank you officer, you been a nice guy"
So I stopped at the store to get somethin to drink
Guess what happened to me before I could blink
They had my truck in the air just about to be towed
For $700 in tickets I owed

[Chorus]
I'm havin' a bad day
Things ain't goin' my way
I'm havin' a bad day
Today, today
I'm havin' a bad day
Things ain't goin' my way
I'm havin' a bad day
Today, today

[Verse 3]
After all that I could finally go home
And rest my feet and get on the telephone
I had a unbelievable time in the city
I shoulda be down with the 

[?] committee
I tried to cook some dinner but it came out burnt
The fire was too hot, I just had learned
So freak it, I'll go to a restaurant
I brought a girl with me, asked, "What do you want?"
"Shrimp and lobster, two bottles of Alizé"
I looked at her and said, "Hey, hey, hey!"
She ate all the food and drank all of the liquor
I better bring her home so I can stick her
So I got her to my house as fast as I can
This is like takin' candy out of a baby's hand
But when I got her to my room, without no doubt
She was so intoxicated that she passed out

[Chorus]
I'm havin' a bad day
Things ain't goin' my way
I'm havin' a bad day
Today, today
I'm havin' a bad day
Things ain't goin' my way
I'm havin' a bad day
Today, today

[Outro]
This is one day
That ain't my day
I don't know what happened to me
But my name is the B
Say your peace
Say your 

[?]

[?]
I'm gonna 

[?]
I'm gonna 

[?]
I'm gonna- I'm gonna- I'm-I'm gonna...

[Intro]
Spotlight, shine bright
Tonight, spotlight

No one knows you better than you know yourself
Do the thing you want, don't wait for someone else
Life is just a party, that's all you need to know
It's your turn to shine, baby let yourself go

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody is a star
Everyone is special in their own way
So you set your goals high and go far
Don't put off tomorrow what you can do today

[Chorus]
Spotlight, open up your eyes and see
Spotlight, shining out for you and me
Spotlight, this world is yours and mine
Spotlight, this is your chance to shine

[Verse 2]
Don't stand in the corner waiting for the chance
Make your own music, start your own dance
When you feel the rhythm, I'll be by your side
Now you have the power baby, love is on your side

Everybody wants to shine
Don't stand in the sideline, step into the light
But it's got to come from inside

And step into the light

This is your chance to shine
It's got to come from the heart, do it right from the start
And step into the light

[Jemaine and (Bret)]
In the Marmalade Forest (Forest)
Between the make-believe trees
In a cottage cheese cottage
Lives Albi (Albi)
Albi (Albi)
Albi the racist dragon

[Jemaine (spoken)]
Part 6: and so, all the people of the village chased Albi the racist dragon into a very cold, very scary cave. And it was so cold and scary in there that Albi began to cry dragon tears—which, as we all know, turn into jellybeans!

Anyway, just at that moment, he felt a tiny little hand rest upon his tail, and he turned around, and who should that little hand belong to but the badly-burnt Albanian boy

[Jemaine (as Albi), spoken]
What are you doing here? I thought I killed you!

[Jemaine, spoken]
... Growled Albi, quite racistly

[Jemaine (as the Badly-Burnt Albanian Boy), spoken]
No, you didn't kill me, Albi. I was just very badly burned. I crawled to safety, and I'm still alive, although I'm very badly disfigured

[Jemaine, spoken]
... Laughed the boy

[Jemaine (as the Badly-Burnt Albanian Boy), spoken]
Why are you crying?

[Jemaine (as Albi), spoken]
I'm crying because all of the villagers chased me here. I think it's because I'm so racist

[Jemaine (as the Badly-Burnt Albanian Boy), spoken]
No Albi, they chased me here, too. It's just because... you and I... we're different

[Jemaine, spoken]
And suddenly, Albi wasn't racist anymore!

[Jemaine and (Bret)]
So they sat in the cave (the cave!)
And ate bubblegum pie
YUM! (YUM!)

Albi the racist—
Well, not anymore!—
Dragon
The way you read the crowd, the way you make them pay
You stepped in and did the scene a whole new way
No one would resist you now and even if they could
Hollywood just never had it quite this good

I see your name in lights, I see them standing in line
They send the cards and the wine
Broadway here she comes
You should be a natural

Camera, action, do it again
(Ooh, anyway I gotta do it)
What a reaction, do it again
(Yeah, gonna make you a star)

Camera, action, do it again
(Ooh, anyway I gotta do it)
What a reaction, do it again
(To get you this part)

No one had to tell you what your smile was for
You sure there's not an uncle name of Barrymore
Now she did this and she did that you are the latest talk
Now there lining up for you around the block
Throwing roses and Holy Moses
Even the Times say
Sparks fell from the skies
That gets you immortalized

Camera, action, do it again
(Oh, anyway I gotta do it)
What a reaction, do it again
(Yeah, I'm gonna make you a star)

Camera, action, do it again
Ooh, anyway I gotta do it)
What a reaction, do it again
(To get you this part)

They gave you 5 stars, they're sending big cars
And Sunset Boulevard will never be the same
You give it a brand new name

Camera, action, do it again
(Ooh, anyway I gotta do it)
What a reaction, do it again
(Yeah, I'm gonna make you a star)

Camera, action, do it again
(Ooh, anyway I gotta do it)
What a reaction, do it again
(To get you this part)
Camera, action, do it again
(Ooh, anyway I gotta do it)
What a reaction, do it again
(To get you this part)

Camera, action, do it again
What a reaction, do it again
Camera, action, do it again
What a reaction, do it again

Camera, action, do it again
What a reaction, do it again
I got to find me one
Yes, I got to find, find me one
Oh, one girl who believes in me
And wants to marry me
Oh, I got to find, find me one

Boys, I got to find, find me one
Yes, I got to find, find me one
Oh, one girl to sit and hold my hand
And tell me that I am her only man
Oh yes, I got to find, find me one

One little girl that I can trust
Ooh, one little girl that tells me
She loves me so very much
One little girl, one little girl that tells me
That she needs me
And wanna love me, and wanna love me tenderly

Yes, I got to find, find me one
Yes, I got to find, find me one
Oh, one girl who believes in me
And wants to marry me
Oh yes, I got to find, find me one
Oh, I got to find, find me just one
Oh, don't you know, I got to find me just one
You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinking of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
The things we said today

You say you'll be mine, girl
Until the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
The things we said today

Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay. And that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then I will remember
The things we said today

Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will tremember
The things we said today
Now I'm the kind of guy
Don't let a good thing pass me by
I've added two and two
Come up with me and you
Why not let's give it a try

And I believe that you're the kind of girl
Who could brighten up this poor boys world
So stop your hesitating
Ain't no need to waiting
If you love me don't wonder why

Oh let it oh let it happen
You and me
Let it oh let it
Just let it happen
Let it happen to you
Let it happen to me
Come on now come on baby

Well I know you're daddy's girl
And I respect what your mama said
But I'm sure they'd understand
'Cause that's how mama got a man
And that you can't deny
And I believe that it's time you realized
And opened up your pretty eyes
And see that when the real thing comes along
You'd better get it before it's gone
Just don't let it pass you by

Let it whoah let it
Let it happen
To you and me baby
Let it oh oh let it happen
Let it happen to you
Darling let it happen to me
Come on come on baby

Let it oh let it just let it happen
One more time baby
Let it please let it happen

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Dear Mrs Bill Collector
I know you just doing your job, don't mean to disrespect ya
But we been going through this thing since way back
I told you when I get the dough I would pay back
But I got problems baby
(Yeah, if you only knew) I got bigger problems baby
Hey
So why you talking about the money that I owe
Like as if I didn't know man it don't mean nothing to me
'Cause right now I got my little boy crying and my grandmother dying
Could you please stop fucking with me, listen here
I ain't looking for no tears but my brother got a year
And my mother keep smoking that shit
On top of that I'm broke, please put that in your notes
For the next one to call me up talking that shit
And then I holla

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I just can’t take this shit anymore
I just might lose control
I feel like letting it go
Please just leave me
I need to be left
And if I'm wrong (I'm wrong)
Then let me be wrong
Just leave me alone

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Dear Mr Policeman
Ayy, am I wrong or ain't you supposed to keep the peace man
I could have swore that I was driving pretty peaceful
So why the hell is you pulling over me for?
Is it this black Mercedes?
Oh no I get it I get it I get it
Or 'cause I'm black? Hmm maybe
Yeah hey tell me why my hands start sweating
And I hold my breath every time that you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won't hear a sound
Man I'm nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pulled me over, you frowned on me
With your flashlight tell me what do you see
Thug niggas drug dealers it's a trip
Every nigga in this whip got a mother fucking college degree

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I just can’t take this shit anymore
I just might lose control
I feel like letting it go
Please just leave me alone
I need to be left alone
And if I'm wrong (I'm wrong)
Then let me be wrong
Just leave me alone

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yea, my middle finger to the law, bustin off, tryna touch the sky
My teacher said, "Impossible", but I'ma fuckin try
Plus how he gon' tell me, he don't make the rules
There's niggas dying everyday, man, we don't make the news
Instead they talkin bout some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole, top story, Tiger Woods "be fuckin all these white hoes"
Anchorman stop snitchin
Cut the commercial, he be texting all the side bitches, hey my goodness
How ironic, on trial for possession of some chronic
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than the comet
Hey your honor, is you kidding? How you sit above me?
Are you perfect motherfucker, how you finna judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us
These cops is bad boys, baby just like Puff
They hate they jobs and they days be fucked up like us
At the end of the day, you niggas just like us

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I just can’t take this shit anymore
I just might lose control
I feel like letting it go
Please just leave me alone
I need to be left alone
And if I'm wrong (I'm wrong)
Then let me be wrong
Just leave me alone

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
The microphone molester, machete undresser
"Stupid-dope-fresh" type shit resurrector
Top gun, miramar, best-of-the-best-er
The leave-an-emcee-peace-in-rest-er
The skill tester, the flex-the-gunner
The make-funner, the adversary make runner
Make summer cold with rhymes I spit
Kick gift to lifted delinquent wit
I be prophet, my hand—top it? Stop it
Fly like rocket when I rock it
Lock it down with this perverse verse
Every fuckin' curse, a burst of hurt
Move crowds: physical fitness rhymes
Coke heads couldn't do my lines
I'm decorated like Christmas pines
My battalion rocks
Emcees become silhouettes of chalk

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
Reading my eyes will say it in many ways
Losing my pride will save it in many days

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Hit the dirt 'cause the words I spit
Will do more than just rip your shirt
I'll bitch slap your soul, contact the track control
You're comin' at me? You can't hack it, though
So ridiculous, watchin' my crew get sick of this
Wickedness, pitchin' this
Lyrical viciousness to crews and cliques
Made of men and mistresses
This is my life, the twilight in the fight night
And trying to see nothin' but the highlights
When I write these eyes on horizons
Die for my song, cry rhymes in krylon
Fire on, move men telekinetically
Esoterically beat-speaking with clarity
Feel my verities, heroism of heresy
And sever every emcee I see with severity

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
Reading my eyes will say it in many ways
Losing my pride will save it in many days

[Interlude: Mark Wakefield]
Why not? What I came
Why not? What I came
Why not? What I came

[Bridge: Mark Wakefield]
Why not give me what I came to deserve?
Why not give me what I came to believe?
Why not give me what I came to deserve?
Why not give me what I came to believe?
Why?!
Ahh!
Uhh!
Uh

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
Reading my eyes will say it in many ways
Losing my pride will save it in many days
Where is my old school teacher? I don't remember her name
With a dunce cap, I was always her feature, I loved her just the same
She stood by through my childhood, like small town school teachers do
At some little school house here in the wild wood, they taught men like Lincoln too

One day I tearfully told her my mother expects me to pass
Then she let me look over the shoulder of the brightest girl in the class
Wish I knew how to reach her, I'd write a letter and say
If I lived the way you taught me to, teacher, I'd be a better man today

Wish I knew how to reach her, I'd write a letter and say
If I lived the way you taught me to, teacher, I'd be a better man today
Mo boys, is you right
Done got it right
All I hate about linin' track
These ol' boys are gonna break my back

Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)
Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)

Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)
Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)

Thinking on the money that I ain't made
Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)
Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)
Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)
See Eloise gonna line 'em track

Moses stood on the Red Sea shore
Gotta batten down the waves with a 2 by 4

Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)
Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)
Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)
See Eloise gonna line 'em track

Now if I could I surely would

Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)
See Eloise gonna line 'em track
Should I reveal exactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?
Should I recite beneath the pale moonlight?
And swear by the stars above you?

Could I repeat the sweetest story told?
Could I entreat, would it be too bold?

Should I reveal 'xactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?

Could I repeat that sweetest story told?
Could I entreat, would it be too bold?

Should I reveal 'xactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?
And swear by stars above you?
Should I confess I love you?
Come on strong girl, lay the heavy trick on me
The church of man, love, is such a holy place to be
Make me baby, make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air

Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!

Alright ah
Come on you mothers
Far out

Keep your mouth shut, but listen to the word inside
Keep your head on, but open up your eyes real wide
Keep the change strong, let the things you've torn aside
There isn't any room to hide

Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!

Take it out take it out
Oh
Oh
Ready

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo, I knew this cat named Ardy, he wore sandals and socks
When he came to the party, he would make sure it rocks
He would flail his arms around and do the Ardy Dance
Leavin' every motherfucker with funk in they pants
Hey yo, it's Friday, you're at the jam of the year
But somethin's missin' there, man, Ardy ain't here
People standin' on the wall, not freakin' at all!
Check it, what you need to do is give Ardy a call
And then 60 seconds later there's a knock on the door (Who is it?)
My man Ardy with Bacardi, saying, "Get on the floor!"
And I been getting' down ever since he said that shit
At the dance club, havin' a conniption fit
Now, who rocks the party more than Ardy? (No one!)
And who smokes base back of the alley? (Ardy!)
When we found him on the street he was homeless and shit
So we addicted him to coke so he'd be dependent
Now, if he wants more drugs, he's gotta rock the rugs
Go down the ho stroll and pick up cock for us
Hey yo, Ardy's got the steps that'll move your body
That's why we like the Ardy that rocks the party

[Chorus]
We like the Ardy that rocks the party
We like the Ardy who rocks the party
(Sandals and socks, sandals and socks)
We like the Ardy that rocks the party
(Sandals and socks, sandals and socks)
We like the Ardy who rocks the party

[Verse 2]
Yo, Ardy stinks like a motherfucker drowning in shit
But the crazy part is how much I love that kid
He's intelligent and charming, ugly and disgusting
For a hit of yay he'll do just about anything
"Like suck my dick?" Hell yeah, he'll suck your dick, nerd
You're holding weight, he'll do anything (Word?)
He wears glasses and has a haircut like a clown
And if you got a girl over, you don't want him around
"'Cause he smells bad?" Nah, dawg, 'cause he'll snatch her up
Straight player for real, sporting sandals and socks
Picture the most disgusting fucking man on the planet
Then multiply that by eight, goddamn Ardy's great
Do anything for my ace, even clean his face
When the schmutz starts to dry, plus he always stays placed
In the brand new Tevas, bust the wool socks
You came here to party, he came to smoke rocks

[Chorus]
We like the Ardy that rocks the party
We like the Ardy who rocks the party
We like the Ardy who rocks the party
(Sandals and socks, sandals and socks)
We like the Ardy that rocks the party
(Sandals and socks, sandals and socks)

[Verse 3]
Ardy, smoothest cat you've ever seen
The chicks know what I mean (He's so fresh and so clean)
He'll rub up on your leg without warning, start humping it
Oh lord, what's that smell in his pants? He's been dumping it
True game, making all the girls pause
(Ardy you look good with that dump in your drawers)
If Ardy ever stopped rocking you know we would kill him
Roll him up in a carpet and throw him off of a building
So I slip him PCP whenever he's not looking
So he keeps the party jumping from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, he looks good when he's smoking on rocks
And don't forget, y'all, he's wearing sandals and socks

[Chorus]
We like the Ardy that rocks the party
We like the Ardy who rocks the party
We like the Ardy that rocks the party
We like the Ardy who rocks the party
We like the Ardy that rocks the party
(Sandals and socks, sandals and socks)
We like the Ardy who rocks the party
(Sandals and socks, sandals and socks)
We like the Ardy that rocks the party
(Sandals and socks, sandals and socks)
We like the Ardy who rocks the party
(Sandals and socks, sandals and socks)

[Outro]
Sandals and socks, sandals and socks
Sandals and socks, sandals and socks
Sandals and socks, sandals and socks
Sandals and socks, sandals and socks
Here I am closing my eyes again
Trying so hard not to see
All the things that I see
Almost willing to lie again
I swear that it just isn't so
It just isn't me

We are never alone
Even though we'd like to be

The I go and open my eyes again
Love in your eyes is the thing
That I'd most like to see
I'd be willing to die again
To know of a place and a time
Where it always could be

To be always with you
And you always with me

This is my autograph
Here in the songs I sing
Here in my cry, in my laugh
Here in the love that I bring
To be always with you
And you always with me

Say a prayer and open your heart again
You are the love and the life
That we all need to see
Always willing to shine and then
Peace on this earth is the way
That it always can be

To be always with you
And you always with me

This is my autograph
Here in the songs I sing
Here in my cry, in my laugh
Here in the love that I bring

To be always with you
And you always with me
Ah, ah, ah, ah
I was a lover, a leader of me
All of the women I knew were my friends
I was so happy, my feet on the ground

I didn't know I was on the way down
'Cause you don't feel the same
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game

Ah, ah, ah, ah
I had a billion or two in the bank
I gave to charity, ain't got no thanks
You gave me all that a woman could give

Less you're affection, I don't want to live
'Cause you don't feel the same
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game
'Cause you don't feel the same

I was a lover, a leader of me
All of the women I knew were my friends
I was so happy, my feet on the ground
I didn't know, I was on the way down
'Cause you don't feel the same
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Watching the bobbins
Go up and down
Fine Irish linen
For a ladies gown

One shirt a penny
Seven in a tag;
Ten hours a day
And her heart begins to drag

This never ending cycle goes on
But she promised she would never stay...
For long

Rocking the treadle
Ache in her soul
She keeps the rhythm
And it takes a toll

Threading the needle
Strains in her eyes
Old withered fingers
Steal her young girl's pride
She's saving every penny she earns
Because the passion for her freedom
Still burns

[Intro]

[Intro: Timbaland]
Is it goin'? Is it goin'?
Is it goin'? Is it going?
I don't know what you're lookin' for
Oh, yeah, boy, come on

[Verse 1: Nelly Furtado]
I'm the type of girl that look you dead in the eye, eye
I'm real as it comes, if you don't know why I'm fly-y-y-y-y
I seen you to try switch it up, but girl, you ain't that dope
I'm the Wonder Woman, let me go get my rope
I'm a supermodel and mommy — sí, mami
Amnesty International, got Bangkok to Montauk on lock
Love my ass and my abs in the video called "Promiscuous"
My style is ri-dic-dic-diculous-ulous-ulous

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
When Timbo' is in the party, everybody put up they hands
I get a half a mil' for my beats, you get a couple gra-a-and
Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-I-A way down to Japan
I'm a real producer, and you just a piano man
Your songs don't top the charts — I heard 'em, I'm not a fa-a-an
N— talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]
Could you speak up and stop mu-mumbling? I don't think you came in clear
When you're sittin' on the top, it's hard to hear you from way up here
Now I saw you tryna act cute on TV, "Just let me clear the air..."
We missed you on the charts last week — damn, that's right, you wasn't there
If s-sexy never left, then why is everybody on my shi—?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
'Cause our run will never be over — not, at least, until we say (Uh)

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

[Live Intro]
Thank you guys so much for coming to the show
I'm gonna leave you with this
You guys are a great crowd
If you didn't like the show, though, remember
When life gets you down:
Make a comforter

[Spoken Intro]
I feel like hip-hop
Used to be a voice for the voiceless, you know?
And now it's become, at least in the mainstream, a symbol of
Misogyny, Gay panic, Fiscal irresponsibility, you know?
So I figure
If you can't beat 'em
Join 'em

[Verse 1]
Hittin' the club up VIP
I got a fake mustache and a fake ID
I look like Woolly Willy
With a really woolly willy, and I
Bypass the bouncer
Pass by an ex and I flex and bounce her, wowser
Look at all of Bo's hoes
Lookin' for a ride on Bo's hose, and I
Spot a little Latino
Booty so big, call it Oprah's ego
We go do it, through it
She says "Dios mia, mi amigo!"
Pull it out, stick it in your mouth
And I bust in the back of ya
Swallow, bitch
There's people starving in Africa

[Chorus]
Single every single day
Do it every single way
Make the single ladies say
"Oooh Bo!"
And if I were gay
Though I swear I'm straight
I'd make the fellas say
"Oooh Bo!" I said "Oooh Bo!"

[Verse 2]
You're an ice cream sundae with a cherry on top
But careful, cherry, cause I'm the King of Pop
Pop, pop, pop goes my weasel
Now you look like Jackson Pollock's easel
Yeah, my suggestion is
You don't blow 'til you know what congestion is
Swallow when you know what digestion is
Follow Bo, the only question is
Have you been splattered before
By the Mad Hatter matador?
Cake batter, never more
It don't matter whether you're
Spanish, French, Swedish, or Cambodian
I'll slime you so hard you could be on Nickelodeon

[Chorus]
Single every single day
Do it every single way
Make the single ladies say

[Silence]
And if I were gay
Though I swear I'm straight
I'd make the fellas say

[Audience: "Oooh Bo!"]
"Oooh Bo!"
I said "Oooh Bo!"
I said "Oooh Bo!"

[Verse 3]
You think that you can handle me?
Girl, don't make me laugh
I said my junk is bipolar
It'll split you in half, yeah
And if you're lucky
I might just bring you home
And I'll have you going down
Like you're growin' an extra chromosome
And when you grab me
Don't grab me by my buns
Cause I got a bad case of the ru-runs
I got the runs
I got the ru-uuns

[Chorus]
Single every single day
Do it every single way
Make the single ladies say
"Oooh Bo!"
And if I were
Oh, so if I were
Yeah, and if I were

[Spoken]
I wanna break it down for ya'll
I came from the streets, with nothin'
Now I'm makin' hit records
For my people still livin' in the streets
Still livin' in poverty, I wanna tell you
I'm doin' this for you
My success is your success
And I know you may be thinkin'
"Hey, if you really believe that
Why don't you use some of your money
To help rebuild the neighborhood
Instead of putting spinning rims on a gold jet ski?"
And to that I say...
Uh, chorus is comin' up

[Chorus]
Single every single day
Do it every single way
Make the single ladies say
"Oooh Bo!"
And if I were
Oh, so if I were
Yeah, and if I were

[Verse 4]
You gotta fume like a tuna
I'll smell ya later
I met a fat chick
And I fucked her in an elevator
It was wrong on so many levels
It was wrong on so many levels
It was wrong on
No matter what you say, baby
No matter what you do
The way you treatin' me, baby
Is comin' back home to you

Cryin' won't help you now
Cryin' won't help you now
Cryin' won't help you, baby
Because you been so mean to me (cryin' won't help you)

You're cryin' won't help you
You're cryin' won't help you, now
Cryin' won't help you, baby
Because you been so mean to me (cryin' won't help you)

Now the way you treat me woman
I just don't understand
I'm gonna leave you woman
Do the best I can

Cryin' won't help you now
Cryin' won't help you now
Cryin' won't help you, baby
You been so mean to me (cryin' won't help you)
Just before I leave you woman
I want you to understand
I'm goin' back to my woman
You go back to your man

Cryin' won't help you now
Cryin' won't help you now
Cryin' won't help you, baby
Because you been so mean to me (cryin' won't help you)

(Cryin' won't help you)
(Cryin' won't help you)
(Cryin' won't help you)
(Cryin' won't help you)
(Cryin' won't help you, ooh)
(Cryin' won't help you)

[Intro]
Ooh-oh

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, my girl and me
Shared our love so tenderly
Then came the day she said the words goodbye
If she only knew how she changed my life
She was my life, the world to me
But when she left, she took the best of me

[Chorus]
Oh, why did she have to leave me, why (Why did she have to say goodbye) (I wanna know why)
Oh, (I wanna know why) I want to know now
Girl (Girl come home, so I can dry wipe my weeping eyes) why don't you come on home, girl
I've been cryin' cryin', now listen

[Verse 2]
A shadow of man that’s all I am
Since that day my girl has been gone
Was it me oh what it could it be
Only yesterday I was king on the throne
Her whereabouts, I wished I knew
I want to her to know
That without her my life is blue

[Chorus]
Now why, (Why did she have to leave me, why did she have to say goodbye) why why why why why why
And woah, (I wanna know why) I want to know now
Girl (Girl come home, so I can dry wipe my weeping eyes) why don't you come on home, girl
I can't stand it here without you no longer, listen

[Verse 3]
She didn’t have to go
That girl knew how much I loved her so
She was the light in my world
The one and only girl, for me, oh oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Why, (Why did she have to leave me, why did she have to say goodbye) why why why why why why
Oh, (I wanna know why) I want to know baby
Girl (Girl come home, so I can dry wipe my weeping eyes) why don't you come on home, baby
I can't stand it without you

[Bridge]
Since you have been gone
My world is slowly turning to dust
So you see find you I must

[Chorus]
Why, (Why did she have to leave me, why did she have to say goodbye) why why why why why why
Why, (I wanna know why) I want to know, oh
Girl (Girl come home, so I can dry wipe my weeping eyes) why don't you come on home, baby
I can't stand it without you, oh

[Outro]
Why, (Why did she have to leave me, why did she have to say goodbye) why why why why why why
Oh (I wanna know why)
Girl (Girl come home)
When I was just a little boy, when I didn't know
My daddy put me on his knee and showed me the way to go
He said "a woman will do her best to make a fool out of you
So be a man and stand the test and see what you can do"

I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man

If you got what it takes my boy
You can always choose
Work it out before it's too late my boy
Make sure you never lose

I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man

Born a man...

Ev'ry woman wants her man to live and learn on her land
Where I go, baby you go
Arrangement, man and wife
I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man

Born a man...
There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings he belongs to you
An old love story that's known to very few
But if you wear these golden earrings, love will come to you
By the burning fire, they will glow with every coal
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul
So be my gypsy, make love your guiding light
And let this pair of golden earrings cast their spell tonight
Lauryn: Brethren dont cut me when i'm going. I dont hear myself. We bout to drop, drop drop drop. You can bring the beat up a little bit in the headphones. Bring the beat up a little bit. We bout to drop. We bout to drop, drop, drop, drop

L-Boogie:
I got moxy, I'm so d**n foxy
Industry try to block me like cops and paparazzi
Full stop, Don't copy, Just cop me properly
Everybody same policy, universal equality
Responsibility, polity, to survive economically
Some people do it comically, Fruits of freedom, equality
Invest your money properly, people own me apology
Intellectual property, stealing stolen commodity
Souls searching or controlling and robbery, Cold lack of comradere
Clones, Copy-cats bother me, Mine, Own, Blind cats, follow me
Honesty, honesty, honestly, all these jokes are common-league
Puppets with no autonomy
Yup Its Fugees Entirely

Chorus
I see you looking but you better take it easy
Tell your crew I said tell em take it easy
Here's come the rocket launcher, you better take it easy, take it easy, take it easy
(Lauryn: too sleazy)
Too much ex mami, take it easy
Good with the sex mami, you'll be like, take it easy
Ay papi, better take it easy, take is easy, take it easy
Clef:
You movin bricks but you better take it easy
Here's a tip, you're too flashy
I don't tip twice, but you best friend he DT
And that dog sniffin in the back ain't Lassie
And I ain't rhymed in a minute, but ya'll ain't catch up
And that ain't blood on your shirt, man that's ketchup (That's ketchup)
Picture Clef getting a writer to give him help
I'd rather kill myself become a ghost and write for myself (OH MY GOD!!)(***see C)
Cuss I'm the top celebrity, top celebrity, top celebrity, MC (Bing!)
I flow for the thugs, gypsies, and hippies (Bing!)
A ghetto maestro with a Nat Turner flow (Bing!)
Malcolm X come out, hit the Klu Kulx Show (SHOOWOOWOO)

Chorus
I see you looking but you better take it easy
Tell your goons that they better take it easy
Here's come the rocket launcher, take it easy, take it easy, you better take it easy (Lauryn: too sleazy)
Too much ex mami, take it easy
Good with the sex you'll be like take it easy
Ay papi, mami take it easy, take is easy, you better take it easy

L-Boogie:
Don't you know
Originals get plagerized, majors minors, must supervise
Haters, Climbers get scrutinized, Placaters, Blind and stupid guys
Wicked people choose homicide, Dregs of society heathen dem
Beggars, bogus misleading dem, Nigra, Negro, Negrito dem
Angelitos con libre dem, Chico's, Chica's completing them
Addiction, fiction, bleeding them, capitalism eating them
Misunderstanding cheatin them, The ignorance defeating them
True loyalty is leaving them, got royalty believing them
Eyes open deceiving them, Reconciling, Receiving them
Reckless driving and grieving them, Matthew Andrew and Peter them
(Slow down)
We bout to reconcile (repeat)
We bout to reconcile (reconcile)
We bout to reconcile(recon, recon, reconcile)
We bout to reconcile, (tell em to give off my style) (Slow Down)
We bout to reconcile (reconcile like Public Enemy)
We bout to reconcile (Slow Down) (reconciliation) (tell em to get off my style)
We bout to reconcile(running with my crew again)
We bout to reconcile (Slow Down) (tell them to get my off style) (repeat)
Pras:
Stop the track, what ya'll thought I wasn't coming
Been in the L.A., few flicks, few millions
Back with the Fugees, foo-fighting for a few billions
Dub plate dealing, sound boy killin
Anything we do, we want that cap for me realin?
Angelo, Simone, Michelle, you know them willin
Can't fight the feelin, when I pull in the SFR, every girl love's a ghetto superstar (that's Pras baby)
Run hip hop like pin stripe Lees and
I got love for my crew like Big had for Cease (C's)
Pull and sqeeze on these MC's
I don't really wanna do it, take it easy

I see you looking but you better take it easy
Tell your goons that they better take it easy
Here's come the rocket launcher, take it easy, take it easy, you better take it easy (Lauryn: too sleazy)
Too much ex mami, take it easy
Good with the sex you'll be like take it easy
Ay papi, mami take it easy, take is easy, you better take it easy

You scared yet, ah pack your dibby dibby dub box

[Verse 1]
New realities are conditions
Much to little for us to suffer
Because we don't know any better
There are a hundred ways to fall in step

[Verse 1]
New realities are conditions
Much to little for us to suffer
Because we don't know any better
There are a hundred ways to fall in step

[Verse 2]
Because for the past two hundred years
The wine drunk and the freedom proclaimed
Oh, are dubious and laughable
Waiting to yield a new use of life

[Chorus]
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
A knife to cut the root, the root of ignorance
A knife to cut the root, the root of ignorance
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence

[Verse 1]
New realities are conditions
Much to little for us to suffer
Because we don't know any better
There are a hundred ways to fall in step

[Verse 2]
Because for the past two hundred years
The wine drunk and the freedom proclaimed
Oh, are dubious and laughable
Waiting to yield a new use of life

[Chorus]
Life is a circus
It's not a fair
Life is a hard road
When you're not there
At the fair

[Verse 1]
Friends come to see me
(With what way shall I go?)
To see the show
(To help my friend and foe
I'll let them fight me down)
When will they realise?
(To laugh and drag my name on the ground)
The circus must go
(Nothing ever stung so badly)
To defend
(And with what way shall I go?)

[Verse 2]
Papa, he talks to me
Don't dry your arm
Gets deep inside you
Does you real harm
Don't you care?

[Verse 3]
High tight-rope walker
(With what way shall I go?)
Stands straight and tall
(To help my friend and foe
I'll let them fight me down)
Don't lose your balance
(To laugh and drag my name on the ground)
From way to home
(Nothing ever stung so badly)
Crowds don't care
(And with what way shall I go?)

[Chorus]
Life is a circus
It's not a fair
Life is a hard road
When you're not there
At the fair
(And with what way shall I go?)

All I can see is black and white
And white and pink and blades of blue
That lay between the words I think
On a page I was meaning to send her
With you I couldn't tell if it bring my heart
The way I wanted when I started
Writing this letter to you
And if I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you'd understand
I'm the man who loves you
All I can be is a busy sea of spinning wheels
And hands the feel for stones to throw
And feet the run but come back home
It make no difference, ever known
Make no difference, ever known to me
If I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you'd understand
I'm the man who loves you
All I can see is black and white
And white and pink and blades of blue
That lay between the words I think
On a page I was meaning to send her
With you I couldn't tell if it bring my heart
The way I wanted when I started
Writing this letter to you
If I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you'd understand
If I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you'd understand
If I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you'd understand
I'm the man who loves you
I'm the man who loves you
---
.
Well, she's walking
Through the clouds
With a circus mind
That's running wild
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
And fairy tales
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind

When I'm sad
She comes to me
With a thousand smiles
She gives to me free
It's alright, she says, it's alright
Take anything you want from me, anything
Anything

Fly on, little wing
Let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow for
Tomorrow never comes!

Domani -- forget domani
Let's live for now and anyhow
Who needs domani?
The moonlight -- let's share the moonlight
Perhaps together we will never be again

Ah, che luna -- oh, che mare
With such a moon and such a sea
And you and me

I get so dizzy when you're standing near
It's not the music that you hear
My heart is beating like a jungle drum

Let's take the minutes as they speed away
And hope it's true what people say:
When you're in love to-morrow never comes
Let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow for
Tomorrow never comes!

Domani -- mahrone, domani!
With such a moon and such a sea
And you and me

Let's take the minutes as they speed away
And hope it's true what people say:
When you're in love tomorrow never comes

Let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow for
Tomorrow never never comes!

[Chorus]
Come on down hard on me, baby
Come on down hard, as you can
Come on down hard on me, baby
Lord, come on down, hard as you can
Come on down hard on me, baby
Show me that I'm your lover man

[Verse]
Come on down hard juicy
Turn me into jelly bread
Bring that love down hard on me, baby
Rock me, rock me right through the bed
Come on down hard on me, baby
Please show me I'm your lover man

[Outro]
I want to love you so much, 'til I hope we can make it
I want to love you so much, 'til I hope I don't break it
I want to love you so much, 'til I can't stand it
I want to love you so strong, 'til you've got to say you've had it
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Thanks for the memory
Of things I can't forget
Journeys on a jet
Our wondrous week in Martinique
And Vegas and roulette
How lucky I was

[Verse 2]
And thanks for the memory
Of summers by the sea
Dawn in Waikiki
We had a pad in London
But we didn't stop for tea
How cozy it was

[Bridge 1]
Now since our breakup I wake up
Alone on a gray morning-after
I long for the sound of your laughter
And then I see the laugh's on me

[Verse 3]
But thanks for the memory
Of every touch a thrill
I've been through the mill
I've lived a lot and learned a lot
You loved me not and still
I miss you so much

[Verse 4]
Thanks for the memory
Of how we used to jog
Even in a fog
That barbecue in Malibu
Away from all the smog
How rainy it was

[Verse 5]
Thanks for the memory
Of letters I destroyed
Books that we enjoyed
Tonight the way things look
I need a book by Sigmund Freud
How brainy he was

[Bridge 2]
Gone are those evenings on Broadway
Together we'd go to a great show
But now I begin with the late show
And wish that you were watching, too

[Verse 6]
I know it's a fallacy
That grown men never cry
Baby, that's a lie
We had our bed of roses
But forgot that roses die
And thank you so much

[Verse 1]
The message you're about to hear is not meant for transmission
Should only be accessed in the privacy of your mind
Words are intense so my dear if you dare to listen
Take off your clothes
And Meet me between the lines

[Chorus]
Are you ready for the touch that makes you go insane
Breast to lips to cheek to mane
I'll pull your hair, you'll feel no pain
Are you ready for the only forever we'll both obtain
The only joy in this forsaken game
You'll feel ashamed and ordained
When I lay my hands on you

[Verse 2]
The touch you're about to feel is the one you've been wishin' for
It's been here like an echo inside your space and time
It's about to get freaky cause the places that I'll be kissin'
Are the places that no other man could ever find
Oh wind up ready for

[Chorus]
The touch that makes you go insane
Breast to lips to cheek to mane
I'll pull your hair, you'll feel no pain
Are you ready for the only forever we'll both obtain
The only joy in this forsaken game (God forbid)
You'll feel ashamed and ordained (God forbid)
When I lay my hands on you

[Bridge]
Nobody knows
Like God knows
Where the deepest part of your river flows
Snap Snap
Undo these nylon hose
Around your thigh my finger goes slowly
Like a cat tip-toes
Until I reach the capstone
I will touch thee in the softest manner
Like "Europa" in the hands of Santana

[Chorus]
Are you ready for the touch that makes you go insane
Breast to lips to cheek to mane
I'll pull your hair, you'll feel no pain
Are you ready for the only forever we'll both obtain
The only joy in this forsaken game
You'll feel ashamed and ordained
When I lay my hands on you
When I lay my hands on you

[Intro]
Uh
Yeah
Hello
Hey

[Verse]
I be high
When I split a dutch and fill it up
I be high
When I get my money doubled up, I be high
When a model wanna let me cut, I be high
When I'm shinin' cause my diamonds blush, I be low
When a nigga can't get away, I be low
When I can't seem to make a way, I be low
When I can't even feed myself, I be low
When I realize I'm by myself
But I be high
When I'm shopping for expensive clothes
I be high
When I get what I couldn't before, I be high
In the club while I'm poppin bub
I be high
When I'm cruisin, sittin' on them dubs But I be low
At the shows in my dressing room, I be low
When I see that I'm a different dude, I be low
On the plane looking at the sky, I be low
But my highs keep the rhythm tight

[Hook]
I be high, then I be low, I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, but I be cool
This the story of my life, I be high
Then I be low, I be low, Then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, but I be cool
That's the story of my life

[Verse]
When I gotta get ready for work
I be low
Cause after bills my pockets be hurt
I be low
When I can't take a girl out
I be low
Cause they can't even figure me out
But I be high
When the phony chicks show me love
Cause in my mind I read em' but don't give a fuck
I be high
When a nigga get attention
I be high
When ya girl catch feelings
Then I be low
When I go into the empty space
I be low
When I'm lookin' at a stressed face
I be low
Cause my brother face through hard time
I be low
With my nigga' ridin close behind
Then I'm high
When I know the places we can go
I be high
When I think of what the future hold
I be high
When she ask for my room number
I be high
But my lows keep a nigga' humble

[Hook]
I be high, then I be low, I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, but I be cool
This the story of my life, I be high
Then I be low, I be low, Then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, but I be cool
That's the story of my life

[Verse 2]
I was high
When the label said that I was dope
I was high
In my eyes cause I had hope
I was high
When I first had the taste of love
I was high
When I left the city I was from
And I was low
When I had a recent heartbreak
I was low
Cause I truly thought I had a mate
I was low
When I lost her over silliness
I was low
Cause she twisted what my words meant
But I was high
When I finally had the chance to see
Everything that's pretty ain't always good for me
I was high
When she first said I like you
Man I must be too high to even write, dude
And these things show you growth
Some niggas show a little
But I'll show you the most
Highs and lows
And succeed for sho
The only thing left to do is say a toast
Cause...

[Hook]
I be high, then I be low, I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, but I be cool
This the story of my life, I be high
Then I be low, I be low, Then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, no need to worry
This the story of my life

[Outro]
Now won't you please save Scotty, Lord?
Help me, please
Help me, please
Now won't you please save Scotty, Lord?
Won't you please save Scotty?
Help me, please
You say you don't need me
I know where your love goes
You go missing after midnight
I should know better and the bed is cold
And if you think I'm not the real thing
I don't wanna die of hunger
I got my world created for you
But you don't stay
Not my imagination no more
I can't be dealing with the bad girl
Lives in your head
You got your someone I , don't cry
You go and take a strangers love instead

Over you is where I should be
I could be loving you too much
Under me is where you should be
I could be loving you too much

You know I love the way you do it
When you do it right
You ain't no one man woman
Were you ever
If you don't come back running
When you've had enough
And baby , you got it , I want it
Show me what's left of your love
Over you is where I should be
I could be loving you too much
Under me is where you should be
I could be loving you too much

I won't be no dirty weekend
I stay with you for good
He can be your outside lover
I've got eyes
I know he's in your blood
Just let me hold you for the hour
I go where you lead me
I need some inspiration from you
I'm ready for the mystery , take me
Don't let me fall
Don't let me drown down here in the rain
There is no alibi , don't lie
You love a stranger and the world is pain

Over you is where I should be
I could be loving you too much
Under me is where you should be
I could be loving you too much
Too much , too much
Too much , too much
Too much , too much
Too much , too much ( come a little bit closer)
Too much , too much ( come a little bit closer)
Too much , too much ( come a little bit closer)
Too much , too much ( come a little bit closer)
Too much , too much ( come a little bit closer)

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yea man, I heard you wasn't gonna do it no more
They said it was overwith for you
Overwith? shit nigga I ain't going nowhere
Shit nigga I ain't going nowhere
Shit nigga I ain't going nowhere

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Snoop Dogg this is me
Back up in the place to be

Listen close we gon' dream
And we gon' toast, this that year
When things was bad this that time
When I'm gon' smash getting cash
Is all I know, I think the year was '94
Or was it later really don't matter
Cause I gets cheese , I gets cheddar

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Funny style, funny niggas
Funny style, funny niggas
Funny style, Kurupt in the building
They funny style, aye Snoop
Punk motherfuckers in disguise I can tell
Soon as I see them when I rise in the spot
Gotti in the building everybody realized
Looking in my eyes niggas is surprised
What the fuck is cracking don't they know what's happening?
The next time this nigga get close, clap him
This nigga like a bitch moving so slow

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Just bring the beat back and let the shit bang
Cause Snoop is on the mic and I came to bang
I don't come to play I come to drop heat
And niggas like you get dusted in the streets
You just try to rap about what you know
And I'm gonna keep this shit way on the low
Me man my clique me and my crew
We come through this bitch and banging on you
You think you can fuck with us
But I don't think you'll fuck with us
See we the shit DPGC
For 20 years and thats all me

[Verse 4: Kurupt]
Bitch, run through the spot
Tipping the hit
Run and get all my money nigga I get
The bitches they love me and they stay on my dick
I'm rolling with dabs, little half 

[?]

Make them pussy lips spread
Bitches is crazy, they all on my dick
Loving my Mercedes what up bitch

[Verse 5: Snoop Dogg]
I'mma show you motherfuckers whats a poster G
And let me get these niggas close to me
You can size me up, you can picture the frame
You can study my style you can write down my name
You can change up the beat and you can slow this shit down
You can try to get close but this is still Dogg Pound
We be fuckin it up, we be smoking the dope
We be on the tour bus from coast to coast

[Verse 6: Kurupt]
Got all my money, all my hoes
Every corner, all my hoes
All my homies, all my souls
Like what's crackin, and they know
In a second niggas get hit then it's over
Look look, why these niggas trippin all over
In the spot with my homies deep with heaters
Looking at these suckers pulling out they millimeters

[Verse 7: Snoop Dogg]
So y'all should know when you stepped up
You got fucked up and that's what's up
See this is true we gray and blue
DPGC I thought you knew
From this day forward, I promise you with all my heart
That we shall never be apart, from this day on
From this day forward, I'm yours to call your very own
I live my life for you alone, from this day on
On and on, I'll welcome each new tomorrow
Knowing that our tomorrow is here
On and on, and even beyond forever
Heaven is mine whenever you're near
From this day forward, I give you me with all my love
From this day forward, from this day on

From this day forward, I give you me with all my love
From this day forward, from this day on
Yeah, you won't listen to nothing I tell you, woman, you keep on doin' as you please
Yeah, you won't listen to a thing I tell you, baby, you keep on doin' as you please
But I've taken it as long as I can, baby, when is this foolishness gonna cease

I worried myself crazy, baby, cried both night and day
I worried myself crazy, woman, I cried both night and day
You didn't believe me, baby, when I told you I'm gonna leave one day

Yeah, you told me that you love me, woman, but action speaks louder than words
Well, you said that you love me, woman, but action speaks louder than words
I won't be foolin' around no more, that's a line everybody has heard

If you don't change for the better, baby, you better do it real soon
If you don't change for the better, woman and you better do it real soon
Or you will wake up one of these mornings, baby, and find yourself in a empty room
Angela, I'm still alive
Angela, I'm still alive
The sun and the sea
The darkness in the way
All the pain don't get no better
It gets stronger every day

It happens to be true
That I still pray to you my love
Voices in the night, don't help
My searching for the truth, my love

And when I'm lost
And high above the storm
I hear your name
I'm empty inside, I'm empty inside
And where are you

Angela, I'm still alive
For the two of us
I'm still alive
You've got to imagine us
All the world was on our side
We had the power of the universe
And we were ready
We were ready for the ride
Moonlight in her hair
Her eyes the wonder of the age
But all I mean to you my love
Is just a spotlight on an empty stage

And through it all
One fire in the rain
Keeps burning on, keeps burning on
I can't stop my heart
It's beating for you
Reaching for you
But you are gone
I'm empty inside, I'm empty inside
And where are you

Angela, I'm still alive
For the two of us
I'm still alive
Angela, I'm still alive
Angela, I'm still alive
Angela, I'm still alive
Weeell,. they had to have something new
A dance to do for recreation so someone started twistin'
A cat who was really hep, put down a step
A new gyration soon, all the kids were twistin'

It didn't take long before the grown-ups were trying it
Who's who was buying it all over town
You see them, a-squirming and a-worming and a-twistin' around

It spread like a forest blaze, became a craze
That rocks the nation now, everybody's twistin'

(musical interlude)

Well oh well oh well oh well, they had to have something new
A dance to do for recreation so someone started twistin'

And a cat who was really hep, he put down a step
A new gyration soon, all the kids were twistin'

No, it didn't take long before the grown-ups were trying it
Who's who was buying it all over town
You'll see them, a-squirming and a-worming and a-twisting around
It spread like a forest blaze, became a craze
That rocks the nation now, everybody's twistin'
There's a-hopping, and a slopping, and a floppin'
Sacroilliac's a popping, everybody's twistin'. Bop!
Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in
But it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

Always know sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean, ah yes
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
My name is Bob
And I don't have a job

[Chorus:]
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song

[Verse 1:]
Catch me cruisin through Decatur with my streetwalkers
Spittin, pimpin at these women, ain't a sweet talker
A young country boy, came up out the creekwater
What a grizzly boy, lookin like a beast on it
Now I don't like the law, so fuck the police department
Pullin me over, and I don't even be speedin on em
Well I think it's cause they don't like me, well me so sorry
Cause I got all the caucasians saying that he's so bossy
Well long story short, this is me and I'm bossy
If I wasn't smokin weed, then I'd be drinking coffee
Well pour this in my cup, just to show I give a fuck bout what ya'll be thinkin need what I'm sayin, gone and zip it up
I don't even know why I'm in this goddamn booth

[Chorus:]
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song

[Verse 2:]
If you ain't noticed I don't really give a damn
'Cause this life's too hard to follow rules and be takin exams
So I decided to do music just to make some fans
So while I got the mic I want to say fuck Uncle Sam
I just think of crazy shit and try to make it jam
So when I'm tired of rappin I sing the best I can
Simpy cause I ain't got nothin better to do with time
I'd rather producin rhymes than slangin and shootin dimes
I ain't really got nothin else to say but I'll finish it
Just to show ya'll how ya'll can benefit if I'm generous
I'll just write a verse, sit back and collect percentages
It's 4 o'clock and I don't even think I'm finished yet

[Chorus:]
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
My song
My song
My song
It's that time of year again
That Christmas time feeling is here again
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again
Yes, the Christmas time feeling is in the air again

I see snow flurries comin' down
Paint a pretty party scene all over town
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again
Yes, the Christmas time feeling is in the air again

Lots of mistletoe hangin' everywhere
Plenty of free gifts and so don't despair
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again
Yes, the Christmas time feeling is in the air again

She's so pretty but I'm so young
When I'm sixteen I'm gonna have some fun
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again
Yes, the Christmas time feeling is in the air again

All the little children of this great big world
Are waitin' for the season's biggest thrill
I wonder if I'll ever be able to get to sleep again
Because the Christmas time thrill is in the air again
Been tossin' and a-turnin' all through the night
I'll be wide awake until broad daylight
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas Eve is here again
Yes, the Christmas time feeling is in the air again

Old Saint Nick'll be stoppin' in
To see the lady of the house again
I wonder if he'll ever go and try to kiss Mommy on the cheek again
'Cause the Christmas time feeling is in the air again
Yes, the Christmas time feeling is in the air again
(feat. E-40)

If god had long hair, and a go-t
And if his eyes were pretty glazed
And he looked spaced out would you buy his story
Would you believe he had an eye infection?

(Course)
And yeah, yeah, god looks baked
And yeah, yeah, god smells good
And yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What is god smoked cannabis?
Hit the bong like some of us
Drove a tie-die microbus, and he subscribes to rolling stones

If god made this place in the begging and did he grow any seeds 
Or did he put them there for Adam and Eve
So they'd be hungry for the apple that the snake was always offering

(course)
And yeah yeah god rolls great
And yeah yeah god smells good
And yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
What if god smoked cannabis?
Do you suppose he had a buzz?
When he made the platypus
He made it earth our home
Does he like Perljam or the stones?
And do you think he rolls his own
Up there in heaven on the throne?
And when the saints go marching home
Maybe he sits and smokes a bone
Hey hey come in they come

O.k. boys, take one

Danny and the Juniors set a groove stuck 'em blblblblu shoot
Say shoot
I should
Why don't you say "shoot" quick right as the song
Danny and the Juniors set a shoot stuck 'em down in the bloot, spoot
Fruit, toot

O.k. let's get ready
Let's dub, let's overdub a little a little finger p-
No, no, no Clem no!
By greckins you put a little, little bit, a little finger poppin' on thar
It's gonna be a million-and-two seller

Hey, will you take off that hat? You look like George Washington!
I'll throw you across the river
You'll throw me across? The what? The Pontiac?
I'll throw you across the river. I threw a silver dollar across, I can
Throw you
When you hear the countdown, everyone shut up because it's awful tight
Yeah

Outside your lawn

For 99 cents
We're on
You got a better deal than I did

Is this mike on?

All the way from Hawthorne California we're flying over Carl Wilson who's
Going to jump 600 feet into a two foot cup
Into a damp rag
Come on
Hey look, I'm gonna leave you home
Hey you guys just a second, I forgot my note
Just a second I'm gonna go to the piano

Ahh Ahh
O.k. let's make one Charlie
You guys ready, let's go
"Welcome to the real world", she said to me
Condescendingly
"Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white"
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you "stay inside the lines"
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take
The so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits, and maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't
Find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies
They love to tell you "stay inside the lines"
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above

I am invincible as long as I'm alive

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I just can't wait 'til my 10 year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for
Ooh...yeah

[Verse 1: Shawn Stockman]
What can I do
To make you feel secure?
Remove all your doubts
So that you'll know for sure that you're the apple of my eye, girl
Fulfillment of my dreams

Time will show the value
Of just what you mean to me
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings or anything that I could give you
It wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you there to guide you through
Well, ain't it good to know you do?

[Chorus]
I know just how you feel
Well, this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us all will reveal in time

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
I tell you I love you, but you don't believe it's true
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings or anything that I can give you
It wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you there to guide you through
Well, ain't it good to know you do?

[Chorus]
I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us will all reveal in time

I know just how you feel
This time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us all will reveal in time

Da da da...

Or anything that I could give you
It wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you there to guide you through
Well, ain't it good to know you do?
I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us will all reveal in time

I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us will all reveal in time

I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
Oh, that special love in us will all reveal in time

I know just how you feel
(So let your little heart lay down upon me)
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us will all reveal in time
Night after night, you wander the streets of my mind
Night after night, don't know what you think you will find
No place to go, nowhere to turn
Everything around you seems to burn, burn, burn
And there's never any mercy in sight, night after night

Night after night
Night after night

Night after night, some new plan to blow up the world
Night after night, another old man kissing some young girl
You look for salvation, you find none
Just another broken heart, another barrel of a gun
Just another stick of dynamite, night after night

Night after night
Night after night

Night after night, you drop dead in your bed
Night after night, another bottle finds a head
Night after night, I think about cutting you loose
But I just can't do it, what would be the use?
So I just keep a-holding you tight, night after night
Night after night after night after night after night
Night after night after night after night after night

Night after night after night after night after night
Night after night after night after night after night
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Cryin' on my front door
You done daddy dirty now
And honey he ain't gonna love you no more

And don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Cryin' on my front door
You done daddy dirty now
And honey he ain't gonna love you no more

Well you can cry, cry, cry, cry
Oh now baby, you can wail
Yo can bang your little head on the pavement
Till the man comes and throws you in jail

Cryin' on my front door
You done daddy dirty now
Yeah and honey he ain't gonna love you no more

Well you can cry, cry, cry, cry
Oh now baby, baby you can wail
You can bang your hear on that hard hard pavement
Till the man comes and throws you in jail
Cryin' on my front door
You done daddy dirty now
And honey he ain't gonna love you no more

Yeah, you know you done him dirty now
You know you done him dirty
And I just can't love you no more
This right here

Cack it into yo ear
Resurrect and disappear
Bitch I'm bigger, you small

And your just a funny guy,little duval
Bitch Im a beast, man, dog
Licking the blood up off my paws
Filling my cup up, silly straw

Put her beaver on my log
Then she lick lick like a frog
Pretty boy Im not at all

Nigga damn, always talkin' to bitches not my age

Tender love baby face

But I never spend on them
Only circle that Im in, is the circle of success
Fuck stress, have sex
And I do that shit the best, aww

[Intro]
This is sweet sorrow
Living for tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Oh, I wish I didn't love you so
My love for you should have faded a long
A real long time ago, yeah yeah yeah, ah baby
Oh, oh, I wish I didn't need your kiss
Tell me, why must your kiss torture me and drive me crazy this?
Do it, baby

[Bridge]
I (I'm gon' find somebody) should be smilin' by now
With some new, new, fine, tender friend
Smilin' by now
With my heart on the mend, on the mend

[Verse 2]
When I try, oh yeah, oh, oh
Something in my heart says "No," oh, oh
I can't get you out of my head
I've still got to depend on you
Oh, and I wish, I really wish I didn't love you so
Oh, don't you know, baby?

[Outro]
Now, I wish, I wish, I wish, oh baby
Girl, I wish, I wish, I wish, oh baby
I didn't love you so much
Dive in, the heart of extremes
All assembled in a style
Extremes reconciled
Improvisation

Rational and poetical, summing up contradictions
Lyrical departure
Formal unity
All in one

Intimate sensuality
Big and cold non places of concrete
Art and social action
Freedom and control
All in one

A knowing type of beauty
(A knowing type of beauty)
That inspires freedom
(That inspires freedom)
The beam is bright and shining
(The beam is bright and shining)
Not the fall of love
Reality clipped its nose, hiding personally
Utopia and reality
Hand in hand all this way
Dedicate to change that it can't bring about

It failed but succeeded
It failed but succeeded
And I wake up in the mornin'
With my hair down in my eyes and she says "Hi"
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are goin' off to school…goodbye
And she reaches out 'n' takes my hand
And squeezes it 'n' says "How ya feelin', hon?"
And I look across at smilin' lips
That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun

And if that's not lovin' me
Then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when my self is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind

Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy
And ask her if she could get away and meet me
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me
'cause she's made that way
And if that ain't lovin' me
Then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes
And there's no such thing as make-believe
Puppy dogs, autumn leaves 'n' BB guns

God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis
I been there - been there
Done that - done that
You got guns? - we got guns...
Yo, I got straps - we got straps...
A million muthafuckas on the planet Earth talk that hard
Bullshit - 'cause it's all they worth...

No question, it's all about the D - O - E
So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree
Ain't tryin' to stock around for the Illuminati
Got to buy my own island by the year 2 G...
Since way back I've been collecting my fee
With the 48-tracks and the M - I - C
Got a palace in the Hills overlooking the sea
It's worth 8, but I only paid 5 point 3
Worldwide, got the triple beam, I slide
Listenin' to yo demo in a stretch limo
It's how I ride - cartel style
Full, stacked to the max now
A million-dollar smile, people wonder how
'Dre Day' every day. Trips to Montigo Bay
With more chips than Frito Lay
Flossed jewels in a tire, ain't nuthin' fly
Straight or illegal - it's still the root of all evil...
Coz...
(Chorus) x 2
Young black Rockerfeller. Hell, a swiss and mozarella
Pockets sweller, gettin' money like a bank teller
'Cause a fool and his dough soon split
So when you come across a fool get all that she be gettin'
Ladies, get your paper too
Don't expect for no man to support you
Keep it true
'Cause most brothers are raised to decide for the pesos
My woman is independent, makin' dough by the case loads
I'mma keep buildin'... make it killing
Kick back, relax, and grow old with my millions
That's where it's at. You got drama, I got the gat
But we're both black so I don't wanna lay you flat
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get
Private Jet, 600 coupes that I runs if...
I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet
Spend a mill, no sweat, water the line with my wet...

(Chorus) x 2
This is for the millionaires
Throw a stack in the air and watch brothers start plottin'
Honeys start to stare
'Cause game is money and money is game
And broke brothers make the 45 flame with no shame
Now many people die over these dead green guys
Ignorance and greed take their ass by surprise
It's the root of all evil and sins
Yet and still it makes the world go around
Like my 20-inch rims...
Moolah y'all
Platinum plaques cover my walls
Grindin', diamonds shinin', and without one flaw
Get the cash, the grass, the ass will bounce
Luciano and all amounts, that's all that counts 'cause...
I been there...
And done that...

Been there, done that...
The Aftermath!
So there you have it!

[Verse 1]
There's a storm across the valley, clouds are rolling in
The afternoon is heavy on your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane a mile or more away
And the whining of his wheels just makes it colder

[Verse 2]
He's an hour away from riding on your prayers up in the sky
And ten days on the road are barely gone
There's a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove
It's the light in your eyes that makes him warm

[Chorus]
Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

[Verse 3]
There's all the news to tell him, how'd you spend your time
What's the latest thing the neighbors say
And your mother called last Friday, sunshine made her cry
You felt the baby move just yesterday

[Chorus]
Hey, it's good to be back home again, yes it is
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

[Bridge]
And all the time that I can lay this tired, old body down
To feel your fingers feather soft upon me
The kisses that I live for, the love that lights my way
The happiness that living with you brings me

[Verse 4]
It's the sweetest thing I know of, just spending time with you
It's the little things that make a house a home
Like a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove
The light in your eyes that makes me warm

[Chorus]
Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

Hey, it's good to be back home again, oh it is
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Hey, it's good to be back home again
I said hey, it's good to be back home again

I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one, adore you and want you so
I'm just a no one with nothing to give you but oh,.
I love you
He, he buys you diamonds, bright, bright sparkling diamonds
But believe me, dear, when I say
That he can give you the world
But he'll never love you the way I love you
He can take you any place he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
But I can only watch you
With my nose, pressed up against the window pane
I, I who have nothing, I, I who have no one
Must watch you go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else
When darling, it's I who loves you
I love you, I love you, I love you
All I got is a black cross
And two crabs in my left eye
What you say you want you want
Like a lump in your right thigh

We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend
We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend

You the users of the wheel
Stink of oil and electric eels
Users of forbidden tools
We must be the fools

We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend
We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend
Cancel the world
Erase history
There is no future
As far as I can see

We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend
We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend
Seems like the more i climb the hill gets deeper
And the more i rise see I greater
Its like the more I give see the more is taken
And the more I'm loved the more I'm hated
Still the more I fall the more ill get up
And keep on driving when the road gets tough
And i won't stop till i get whats mine
But until then
See I'm
Tearing down the walls and I'm moving the mountains
I'm stirring up the sea and be leaving in a change
Putting out the fire endure it to the end
They will come and i will shout victory
Tearing down the walls and I'm moving the mountains
I'm stirring up the sea and believing in a change
Putting out the fire enduring to the end
The day will come when i will shout victory
Seems like the more I win the more I lose
The more my minds made up the more I'm confused
Its like the more i search the more i get lost
And just when i get on seems like i fall off
But the more it rains the more i pray
Cause i know tomorrow will bring a brighter day
So i won't stop till i get whats mine
But until then
I'm
Tearing down these walls and I'm moving the mountains
I'm stirring up the sea and be leaving in a change
Putting out the fire endure it to the end
They will come and i will shout victory
I'm
Tearing down the walls and I'm moving the mountains
I'm stirring up the sea and be leaving in a change
Putting out the fire endure it to the end
They will come and i will shout victory
When the morning comes i will rise
There a angel for me in the sky
As long as heavens right by my side
I'm
Tearing down these walls and I'm moving the mountains
I'm stirring up the sea and be leaving in a change
Putting out the fire endure it to the end
They will come and i will shout victory
( repeat till end)

[Verse 1]
If you call and call
Your self esteem is low
And I heard you'd called
Is there no calling?
And away I go
Any way you go
I was o­n your tail
As clear as crystal

[Chorus]
But it was harmless
It couldn't hurt you
Oh you were helpless
I know you'll get through
I know, I

[Verse 2]
Chemicals are cold
See you sit down o­n
A chemical you cause
Is like a crystal
So I heard you say
I got to get away
I'm o­n a second trail
As clear as crystal

[Chorus]
But I was harmless
It couldn't hurt you
Oh you were helpless
I know you'll get through
People are pressed
Liberties crushed
Shouldn't it resound
Cry of our soul?
It is so faint I can't hear it
I know it's there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere

Men could ask for happiness
They could ask for brotherhood
When we were not a lonely crowd
Natural was impersonal
Was non individual
Where strangers were not a threat
But more of a potential
Public space was wide open
The relevance was action

Beyond the cry
Lies the meaning
Common language
Of belonging
It is throttled, it is confused
Has to be there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere...
I got those worried blues
And I got those worried blues
I got those worried blues
I got those worried blues
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before

I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
WORRIED BLUES
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
I'm going where the climate suits my clothes

Honey babe don't leave me now
Honey babe don't leave me now
Oh honey babe don't leave me now
Honey babe don't leave me now
I got trouble in my mind
Listen to that cold whistle blow
Lord listen to that cold whistle blow
Listen to that cold whistle blow
Listen to that cold whistle blow
I'm going where I'm never been before
So I got those worries blues, lord
I got the worried blues
I got the worried blues 
And I got the worried blues
I'm a-going where I never been before
Gonna wave to the people
Looking on the side of
The road as I'm rolling by
Wave goodbye to trouble
That's always on my mind
Gonna jumpstart my life
Or go down trying
Gonna wave to the mem'ries
I carry in my heart and the
New ones I'll find along my way;
To the new millenium
Reeling 'round the bend like
A dove or a dark-wing bird of prey
Gonna wave, gonna wave
Gonna wave to the wind
Gonna wave my way
My way on through the wind
Gonna wave, Gonna wave
Gonna wave to the wind
Gonna wave my way to the
Edge of the world and jump in
Gonna snap like a banner
Sailing sheets to the breeze over
Oceans of sky to the moon
I could hold out forever
Keeping it together
Or wish upon a star and call the tune
Lift my voice like the young man
Broken in the war who
Cries out to know the reason why
Gonna rise up and reel out
The love song in my soul to the
High wide and handsome morning sky
Gonna wave, gonna wave
Gonna wave to the wind
Gonna wave my way
My way on through the wind
Gonna wave, Gonna wave
Gonna wave while the wind
Plays the stars, the sky, the
Moon and the night like a hymn
Gonna ride with the thunder
Let the sky crack asunder
As lightning cries out the rain
Gonna wade across rivers
Gathered in the streams from the
Mountains that rise above the plain
Wave away my confusion
That drives this delusion
So long I forgot that I could fly
Soar aloft like a songbird
Dancing in the wind
Singing long, singing loud, singing high
Gonna speak to the breeze
Add my voice to the wind
Singing: say, can you see me
By the dawn's early light screaming in?

[Verse 1]
I saw you at the grocery store
Oh you both looked happy
Picking out the usual
She's a carbon copy
Of everything you lost, of everything I'm not
I guess you just forgot how to pick 'em

[Verse 2]
If she's the one I've heard about
I'm disappointed
If she's the reason why you left
I'm not impressed at all
Well this looks like the end
Yeah, I hope we can still be friends
Congratulations

[Chorus]
Let me be the first to wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse that creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me again

[Post-Chorus]
And again
And again
And again

[Verse 3]
Well, someone had to tell the truth
And I'm always honest
I read you like an open book
And it's obvious to me
She's just the one between, heading no where fast
Sure it's gonna last forever

[Chorus]
Let me be the first to wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse that creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me again
Let me be the first to wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse that creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me again

[Outro]
And again
And again
And again
Oh, you wish
You wish
You wish
You do
Speaks:
Empty is the sky before the sun wakes up
Empty is the eyes of animals in cages
Empty, faces of women mourning
When everything's been taken from them
Me, don't ask me about empty

Sings:
Empty is a string of dirty days
Held together by some rain
And the cold winds drumming at the trees again
Empty is the color of the fear
Long about September when the days
Go marching in a line toward November
Empty is the hour before sleep chills you every night
And pushes you to take me away from every kind of light
Empty is me. Empty is me

[Verse]
Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
Round yon virgin
Mother and child
Holy Infant
So tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Like a dead man walking

[Verse 1]
Out last night and the night before
But I ain't set foot outside my door
In my neighborhood you can come on in
Everyone would be there if they ever been

Find out where they came from
Found out where they went
Life these days ain't no accident
Grab em off the corner get em on the phone
Get em all together and bring em all along

[Chorus]
We're gonna roll onto the break of day
We're gonna roll all through the month of May
We're gonna roll
We're gonna roll it all up
And then we'll roll it all away

[Verse 2]
You can put your things off
I don't mind
Well take me off
Takes all kinds
Feeling's gonna get you
Right down to your soul
Let it all out let the good times roll
Mad mans a comin here
He's bringing the sky
He always goes God knows why
Break out the glasses pay up the rent
This boy is heaven sent

[Chorus]
We're gonna roll onto the break of day
We're gonna roll all through the month of May
We're gonna roll
We're gonna roll it all up
And then we'll roll it all away
Yo, I ain't seeing you in a minute, but I got something to tell ya, listen
See the thing about you, that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change, my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
You see, she sorta looks, just like you
She even smiles, just the way you do
So innocent, she seemed, but I was schooled
I'm reminded when I look at you, but
You remind of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
Thought that she was the one for me
Til I found out she was on her creep
Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me
This is why we could never be
You remind of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
I know it's so unfair to you
But I'd be lingering the rest to you
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me, whoa
You remind of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
You remind of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
The butler henry baker extinguishes the fires
Whilst sir fred'rick harold robinson casually retires
Another day tomorrow cries alan crayon steel
All must be up early to have the morning meal
The maid comes with decanter and to the butler there
Said 'sir here's what you ordered' 
He said 'no one seems to care '

It must be good to live in the house of lords
It must be good to live in the house of lords

The house is now in darkness before the coming day
But at five o'clock that morning , the master passed away

The housemaid drew the curtains and the doctors watched the dawn
And the brother bendix sadly watched the gardener mow the lawn

It must be sad to live in the house of lords
It must be sad to live in the house of lords

Grandma mildred marshall was pouring out the tea
When she heard about the news of sir frederick's tragedy
The hall is now in sadness and everybody cried
On the banks of burntley river is where sir frederick lies
It must be sad to live in the house of lords
It must be sad to live in the house of lords
Written by (traditional)

I went down to the station
I leaned up against the door
Yeah, I went down to the station
I leaned up against the door
I said good-bye to my sweet, ride on
I said now, she couldn't use me no more

It was a mean old fireman
And a cruel old engineer
He was a mean old fireman
And a cruel old engineer
Yes, takin' way my sweet woman
And left me standing here

Break:

I used to roll my baby
Till she - was forced to jump and shout
I used to roll my sweet baby
Till she was forced to jump and shout
Now that train pulls in boys
And I'll come walkin out
I heard the fireman blow the whistle
And the engineer ring the bell
I heard the fireman blow the whistle
And engineer ring the bell
I knew it was time boys
To - bid my baby farewell
Um
Your baby's out runnin round
Hangin with the crowd
Draggin your business in the street
And talking out loud
Sayin you bought her this and that
And how much you done spent
I swear she must believe it's all heaven sent
Hey boy you better bring the woman around
To the sad old truth the dirty lowdown
Strings
You're the one, the one I adore
The only one my life was put here for
Though people try to poison with lies
I see the truth when I look in your eyes
You're the one that I wanna grow
Old with
The only one I want by my side
And you're the one that I know I can
Grow with
That is why I gotta say...

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fall in love unless I'm
Loving you, unless I'm loving you
I don't wanna fall in love unless I'm
Loving you, unless I'm loving you

Now it seems to me the angels above
Created you for me to love
And the way I feel it can't be denied, no
Cos you know it's true when you look in
My eyes
I'm the one that you wanna grow
Old with
The only one who's really by your side
And I'm the one that you know you can
Grow with
That is why you gotta say...

[Chorus]
If I'm not loving you I don't want no one
Else, it's true
Baby I'd much rather be by myself
Cos you
You do something to me I can't
Describe, that's why
That's why I gotta say I... that's why I
Gotta say I...

[Chorus]
I said I, I don't wanna fall in love
(unless I'm loving you)
Don't wanna fall in love
(unless I'm loving you, )
I said I, I don't wanna fall in love
(unless I'm loving you)
Don't wanna fall in love
(unless I'm loving you, )
I said I, I don't wanna fall in love
(unless I'm loving you)
Don't wanna fall in love
(unless I'm loving you, )

[Verse 1]
Baby, let me tell you about how I feel
This urge is seizing me, controlling it's unreal
Ooh, ah baby, I wanna let you know
You got me yearning, so baby, let me show you

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I want you baby, gotta let you know I need ya here with me (Right here and nowhere else)
This ain't the right way, gotta find another way to earn your love
Just give me a clue 'cause you know

[Chorus]
Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willing
To cry and beg and plead when you need

[Verse 2]
Pardon my expression (You're excused)
But the feeling I have is so strong
I guess you know this isn't easy to do
I keep trying and trying to give my love to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I want you baby, gotta let you know I need ya here with me
This ain't the right way, gotta find another way to earn your love
Just give me a clue 'cause you know

[Chorus]
Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willing
To cry and beg and plead when you need
Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy (Sympin' ain't easy)
And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willing
To cry and beg and plead when you need

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I want you baby, gotta let you know I need ya here with me
This ain't the right way, gotta find another way to earn your love

[Chorus]
Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willing
To cry and beg and plead when you need
Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy (Sympin' ain't easy)
And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willing
To cry and beg and plead when you need
Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willing
To cry and beg and plead when you need

[Outro]
Sympin' ain't
Sympin' ain't
Sympin' ain't
Ain't easy
Finally Found A Reason to live
No words can fill my head
Finally, here at ease, I'm within
The light that fills my head
And I Finally Found A Reason to live
And I never knew the way to begin

Waiting on a wish in a well
That day may never come
I've been known to follow my mind
Those days are far behind
And I Finally Found A Reason to live
And I never knew the way to begin

But now that I see your face
My world is a better place
For how can I ever leave you from my world
Your world?

Finally found a feeling that's real
In you, in me, I feel
Time is just a turn of the wheel
The way to love revealed
And I Finally Found A Reason to live
And I never knew the way to begin
But now that I see your face
My world is a better place
For how can I ever leave you from my world
Your world?
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through
Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never ending
Wouldn't it be nice?
Maybe if we think, and wish, and hope, and pray, it might come true
Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married
And then we'd be happy
Wouldn't it be nice?
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice?
This is just a song
To help you through the night
Just like a lullaby
And if you're not strong
And everything ain't right
This is my lullaby
Oh

I wanna know your name
You just kill me, could you at least do that?
I wanna know your name
Or better yet, stand there
Just do that

I wanna know your name
Your name
You just kill me, could you at least do that?
I wanna know your name
Your name
Or better yet, stand there
Just do that

Hey yeah

I wanna know your name...
Know your name...
I wanna know your name...
Know your name...
Uh!
Oh yeah

I wanna know your name
You just kill me, could you at least do that?
I wanna know your name
Know your name
Or better yet, stand there
Just do that

Hey yeah!
Oh yeah!

I wanna know your name...
Know your name...
I wanna know your name...
Know your name...

Uh
My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you

Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you, dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you
Mother, I'm going to join the Air Force today
I don't care what the neighbors may say
But I'm going to join the Air Force today
Mother,I don't care what my father might think
Perhaps it's going to drive him to drink
But I don't care what my father might think
Don't ask me why, it's my mind and it's right
Don't ask me why, it's my mind
It's better, it's better than being alone
Alone on the ground. Now I find
Mother,I've got to join the Air Force you see
I've seen my friends and they all agree
That's it's better than joining the army or going to sea
Mother,I've go to join the Air Force you see
I've seen my friends and they all agree
That's it's better then joining the army or going to sea
Mother, Mother, Mother
Do you still sing of the mountain bed we made of limbs and leaves?
Do you still sigh there near the sky where the holly berry bleeds?
You laughed as I covered you over with leaves
Face, breast, hips, and thighs
You smiled when I said the leaves were just the color of your eyes

Rosin smells and turpentine smells from eucalyptus and pine
Bitter tastes of twigs we chewed where tangled wood vines twine
Trees held us in on all four sides so thick we could not see
I could not see any wrong in you, and you saw none in me

Your arm was brown against the ground, your cheeks part of the sky
Your fingers played with grassy moss, as limber you did lie
Your stomach moved beneath your shirt and your knees were in the air
Your feet played games with mountain roots as you lay thinking there

Below us the trees grew clumps of trees, raised families of trees, and they
As proud as we tossed their heads in the wind and flung good seeds away
The sun was hot and the sun was bright down in the valley below
Where people starved and hungry for life so empty come and go
There in the shade and hid from the sun we freed our minds and learned
Our greatest reason for being here, our bodies moved and burned
There on our mountain bed of leaves we learned life's reason why
The people laugh and love and dream, they fight, they hate to die

The smell of your hair I know is still there, if most of our leaves are blown
Our words still ring in the brush and the trees where singing seeds are sown
Your shape and form is dim but plain, there on our mountain bed
I see my life was brightest where you laughed and laid your head...

I learned the reason why man must work and how to dream big dreams
To conquer time and space and fight the rivers and the seas
I stand here filled with my emptiness now and look at city and land
And I know why farms and cities are built by hot, warm, nervous hands

I crossed many states just to stand here now, my face all hot with tears
I crossed city, and valley, desert, and stream, to bring my body here
My history and future blaze bright in me and all my joy and pain
Go through my head on our mountain bed where I smell your hair again

All this day long I linger here and on in through the night
My greeds, desires, my cravings, hopes, my dreams inside me fight:
My loneliness healed, my emptiness filled, I walk above all pain
Back to the breast of my woman and child to scatter my seeds again

[Chorus]
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would

[Verse 1]
Where it began
I can't begin to know when
But then I know it's growing strong
Was it in spring
Then spring became the summer
Who'd have believed you'd come along

[Pre-Chorus]
Hands, touchin' hands
Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you

[Chorus]
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would

[Verse 2]
I look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two
And when I hurt
Hurtin' runs off my shoulder
How can I hurt when holdin' you

[Pre-Chorus]
Warm, touchin' warm
Reachin' out and touchin' me, touchin' you

[Chorus]
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would

[Chorus]
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would

[Outro]
My sweet
Oh, you sweet Caroline

[Verse 1]
Well, the ragman draws circles, up and down the block
I'd ask him what's the matter, but I know that he don't talk
And the ladies treat me kindly, and they furnish me with tape
But deep inside my heart, I, I know I can't escape
Oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 2]
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
With his pointed shoes and bell
Speaking with some French girl, who says she knows me well
And me, I'd send a message, to find out if she's talked
But the post office has been stolen, and the mailbox is locked
But oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 3]
Now, Mona, she tried to warn me, stay away from the railroad line
She says all the railroad men
Drink up your blood like wine
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that"
But then again there's only one I've met
He just smoked my eyelids, and he punched my cigarette
Whoa, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 4]
Grandpa died last week, and they buried him in the rocks
Everyone still talks about how badly they are shocked
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
When he built a fire on Main Street, and he shot it full of holes
Oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Now the Senator, he came down here, showing everyone his gun
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son
And me, I nearly got busted, and wouldn't it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck
Oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 6]
Now the preacher looks so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest
And he cursed me when I proved it to him
Then I said, "You see, not even you can hide
You see, you're just like me, and I hope you're satisfied"
Oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 7]
Now the rainman gave me two cures, then he said jump right in
The first was Texas medicine, the second was just railroad gin
And like a fool I mixed them, and it strangled up my mind
Now people just get uglier, and I've got no sense of time
Oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 8]
Now, when Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free, 'neath her Panamanian moon
And I said, "Ah, come on now, you know about my debutante
And she says, "Your debutante knows just what you need
But I know what you want"
Oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 9]
Now the bricks, they lay on Grand Street where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly, it all seems so well timed
And here I sit so patiently, waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all of these things twice
Oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again
Oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again
In the time it takes to laugh
Love can turn the key
Crystal clear the future lies
And what will be will be

Don't hold it back
Take the chance you missed
Don't hold it back
Fill the emptiness

Soon the time to say farewell
Will come with no return
Older now but wiser from
Lessons we have learned

Don't hold it back
Take the chance you missed
Don't hold it back
Fill the emptiness

Slip through your fingertips
Speak from your heart don't let it
Slip through your fingertips
Search for the feeling in it
Don't let it -
Slip through your fingertips
Lost if you leave too late
All at your fingertips
Gone if you hesitate
Frank:
Let's take an old fashioned walk, I'm just bursting with talk
What a tale could be told if we went for an old fashioned walk

Doris:
Let's take a stroll through the park, down a lane where it's dark
And a heart that's controlled, may relax on an old fashioned walk

Doris:I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart
Frank:There's nothing like walking and having a "heart to heart"

Frank & Doris:
I know a girl who declined, couldn't make up her mind
Frank: She was wrapped up and sold
Doris: coming home from an old fashioned walk

Doris:Some couples go for a buggy ride, when they start caring a lot
Frank:Others will bicycle side by side, way out to some romantic spot

Frank & Doris:
Let's take an old fashioned walk (Let's take an old fashioned walk) I'm just bursting with talk (I'm just bursting with talk)
Frank: What a tale could be told
Doris: if we went for
Frank & Doris: an old fashioned walk
Frank & Doris: Let's take a stroll through the park (Let's take a stroll through the park) down a lane where it's dark (down a lane where it's dark)
Frank: And a heart that's controlled
Doris: may relax on
Frank & Doris: an old fashioned walk

Doris: I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart
Frank: There's nothing like walking and having a "heart to heart"

Frank & Doris: I know a girl who declined, couldn't make up her mind
Frank: She was wrapped up and sold
Doris:coming home from
Frank & Doris: an old fashioned walk

Frank: If your girl has declined
Doris:and won't make up her mind
Frank & Doris: What you need is a "heart to heart" talk
Take a stroll through a park, down a lane where it's dark
And go for
Frank & Doris: an old fashioned walk
I've been out on this highway now
Five days in a row
My words all run together
My feet are movin' slow
Ive got to stop and eat
While its still light
There's a local angel sitting on my right
Do you believe in love at first sight
Baby, you look good to me tonight

I'm ordinarily very shy
And I'd be polite if I had time
Baby, you look good to me tonight
Tomorrow, Ill be good and gone
Please don't make me wait that long
Baby, you look good to me tonight

I get off at eleven, she said
And walked away
She poured a cup of coffee and
She brought it on a tray
She said, It would be nice if you could stay
You're the best idea I've had all day
Usually I put up a fight but
Baby, you look good to me tonight
Well I'm ordinarily very shy
But I grinned at her as I ate my pie
Baby, you look good to me tonight
I thought I must be in a dream
When she asked me if I wanted cream
Baby, you look good to me tonight

All in all you know
It's not a bad life on the road
If you've got wheels to roll
And lucky stars above
Your destiny's your own
You go as far as you can go
And if there's time to sleep
There's time to make love

I came, I saw, I conquered
But I rode off in the sun
But I know the look she left with me
Keeps telling me she won
Her face is the only thing I see
Whispering those words of prophesy

I may come easy, but I don't come free
You're never gonna see the last of me
Baby, you look good to me tonight
I was born to love you now can't you see
Baby, you look good to me tonight
I'm ordinarily very shy
But I take the time to satisfy
Baby, you look good to me tonight
Gotta have you near all the time, with your dreams wrapped up in mine
Gotta be a part of your soul and your heart all the time
Nothing in the world that I do means a thing without you
I'm just half alive in my struggle to survive without you
You are my way of life, the only way I know, you are my way of life
I'll never let you go, never let you out of my sight, be it day, be it night
You belong to me, that's the way it will, be wrong or right
I don't need crowds at my door, the applause from the floor
All I need is you and the love we once knew, nothing more
You are my way of life, the only way I know, make me your way of life
Do what you wanna do
Tell ya, Who to sock it to
I know it's your thing
You can do what you like
But if you want some good loving don't take all night
I knew it from the start you had a real big heart
Tried to hide what you feel when you shouldn't just chill
You like bein' served with a silver spoon
Well, you met the right guy, never serve too soon
Oh, I like the way you talk when you look in my eye
I can read between the lines, let's go for a ride
If you want me to love you, maybe I will
Believe me woman, it ain't no big deal
Hon' you need love now, just as bad as I do
Makes me no difference, now, who you give your thing to
Ow, it's your thing
Do what you wanna do
Oh, baby I can't tell you
Who to sock it to
It's your thing
Do what you wanna do
Now, girl I can't tell you, who to sock it to, hey!
It's your thing
Ah, do what you wanna do, do
Baby I can't tell you who to sock it to
It's your thing
Do what you wanna do, do
Now, girl I can't tell you
Who to sock it to
Have no time to run your life
I know you wanna, do, do what's right
Oh, give your love girl to 'ever you choose
How can you lose, uh, with the stuff you use
Oh, it's your thing
Do what you wanna do, do
Girl I can't tell you, who to sock it to
It's your thing, yeah
Do what you wanna do
Oh, baby I can't tell you
Who to sock it to
It's your, who

[Intro:]
Wherever you are, I wanna be
It's never too far, it don't matter
Just take me there

[Verse 1:]
There's never a place to far
Too far for me to go
'Cause I always feel at home with you
I'll cover the universe and land on every star
If I can find out where you are, it's true

[Chorus:]
Mountain high, valley low, desert heat, arctic cold
Wherever you are, that's where I want to be
Mountain high, valley low, desert heat, arctic cold
Wherever you are, that's where I want to be

[Verse 2:]
Take me on a vision quest and focus in on me
So you can tell me what you see in me
Please don't let me live a lie
Let me live in honesty
'Cause you're the only truth that can set me free
That's why I want to go

[Chorus]
Mountain high, valley low, desert heat, arctic cold
Wherever you are, that's where I want to be
Mountain high, valley low, desert heat, arctic cold
Wherever you are, that's where I want to be

[Bridge:]
Without you I feel like I could lose my mind
That's why I can't let go
I'll just keep on trying
Seeking you 'til the end of all time
Following you any place, anywhere
Cause wherever you are, I want to be there

I wanna be where you are, uh huh

Oh, wanna be with you, wanna be
I wanna wanna be with you
What what, wanna be with you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I wanna be... Play!

[Organ Solo]

Uh huh, come on, that's it, that's it
Play them keys
Uh huh, we hear you
Come on up in here!

[Chorus]
Mountain high, valley low, desert heat, arctic cold
Wherever you are, that's where I want to be
(I wanna be where you are, uh huh)
Mountain high, valley low, desert heat, arctic cold
Wherever you are, that's where I want to be

Take me anywhere you wanna take me
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I'm gon' go
No matter, no matter, no matter

[Ad-Libs:]
I don't like the cold!
But believe me, I'll go wherever
You know that's where I wanna be
'Cause wherever you are
You're never too far away from me
That's why I, that's why, gotta go
Wherever you go, I wanna go
(I wanna be where you are, uh huh)
Whatever you know, I wanna know
Plant the seed and I will grow
Your mysteries I will know in time
Come and let me know where I have to go
In order to do what you want me to do
When you want me to do it
How you want me to do it
(I wanna be where you are, uh huh)
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go
(Wherever you are, that's where I want to be)
I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna be where you are
(I wanna be where you are, uh huh)
Wherever
Wanna be where you are
I am one of seven brothers
Five of us must leave and start again
In this land of Saints and Martyrs
Tears of sadness hide within the rain

So fare thee well, Remember me...
Sail from the Harbour of Tears

I can hear my father calling
'Godspeed, my son
Wherever you may go'
He looked so small
Down on the quayside
A man I guess
I'll never really know. Goodbye, lad... I'll miss you
Though I don't show it
I am a farmer of the land
I'm not a man of words
Forgive me my failing
You never knew me
Godspeed wherever you may go...
So fare thee well
Remember me...
Sail from the Harbour of Tears
Go!

I'm gonna wake you up early 'cause I'm gonna take a ride with you
We're goin' down to the Honda shop, I'll tell you what we're gonna do
Put on a ragged sweatshirt, I'll take you anywhere you want me to

First gear, it's all right
Second gear, I'll lean right
Third gear, hang on tight
Faster, it's all right

It's not a big motorcycle, just a groovy little motorbike
It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys, that two-wheel ride
We'll ride on out of the town to anyplace I know you like

First gear, it's all right
Second gear, I'll lean right
Third gear, hang on tight
Faster, it's all right

It climbs the hills like a Matchless 'cause my Honda's built really light
When I go into the turn, lean with me, and hang on tight
I better turn on the lights, so we can ride my Honda tonight
First gear, it's all right
Second gear, I'll lean right
Third gear, hang on tight
Faster, it's all right

First gear, it's all right
Second gear, I'll lean right
Third gear, hang on tight
Faster, it's all right
Don't you ever feel sad
Lean on me when times are bad
When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble and about to drown
Just hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
I'm goin' my way, your lover
If you get cold, I will be your cover
Don't have to worry 'cause I'm here
No need to suffer baby, 'cause I'm here
'Cause hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Reach out to me for satisfaction
Call my name now for quick reaction
Now don't you ever feel sad
Lean on me when the times are bad
When the day comes and you're down, baby
In a river of trouble and about to drown
Just hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Just hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Just hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'

[Verse]
Everything becomes so defined
That in the end there's no definition
They do not mean a thing
They don't tell a story

[Chorus]
We communicate more and more
In more defined ways than ever before
But no one has got anything to say
It's all very poor it's all just a bore
Someone has to make the difference
Between the seeming and the meaning
The seeming overruns the meaning
(We communicate more and more, it's all very poor it's all just a bore)

[Intro: Pitbull]
Catch me on the getaway like OJ on the highway, all white bronco
Catch me on the way to check out my dog
Mohombi all the way, all the way out in Congo
Catch me with a couple beautiful women that's ready for a combo, let's hit the condo
Welcome to the new age hotel, California
Nice to meet you, Armando

[Pre-Chorus: Mohombi]
You're like the sun in California
Where there's no you, there's no euphoria
You're like the sun in California
Where there's no you, there's no euphoria

[Chorus: Mohombi]
Na na na na na
No, I don't want to party without you
Na na na na na
No, I don't want to party without you
Na na na na na
No, I don't want to party without you
Na na na na na
No, I don't want to party without you

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Pits taking over the world
Y'all better get used to the fact
I jump on the track, drop the bass
And I ain't talkin' 'bout crack
I was born in a era, where Michael Jackson
Was still tryna figure out the man in the mirror
And when it came to drugs
Miami would always stand and deliver
Welcome to the 80s
Ladies and gentlemen
I took over the radio, I took over the clubs
Late night, no Letterman
My father, he was never there
But it made me a better man
The party's the world, the world's my girl
I dare you not to let 'em in

[Pre-Chorus: Mohombi]
You're like the sun in California
Where there's no you, there's no euphoria
You're like the sun in California
Where there's no you, there's no euphoria

[Chorus: Mohombi]
Na na na na na
No, I don't want to party without you
Na na na na na
No, I don't want to party without you
Na na na na na
No, I don't want to party without you
Na na na na na
No, I don't want to party without you

[Outro: Mohombi]
You're like the sun in California
Where there is no you, there's no euphoria
His spirit joined and so was formed
Ten thousand years ago
Between the swan and Hercules
Where even dark clouds glow

To live with grace, to ride the swell
To yet be strong of will
To love the wind, to learn it's song
And empty space to fill

Apollo taught me to rhyme
Orpheus taught me to play
Andromeda cast down her sign
And vega lights my way

Smoke rings in a galaxy
An endless flight through time
Lyra gave her harp to him
And left him free to climb

A winter's journey from the moon
To reach the summer sun
To rise again, to sing for you
A song that's yet unsung
Apollo taught me to rhyme
Orpheus taught me to play
Andromeda cast down her sign
And vega lights my way

His spirit joined and so was formed
Ten thousand years ago
Between the swan and Hercules
Where even dark clouds glow

To live with grace, to ride the swell
To yet be strong of will
To love the wind, to learn her song
And empty space to fill

[Verse 1]
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
Standing here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn
The taxi's waiting and he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could die

[Chorus]
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

[Verse 2]
There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now, they didn't mean a thing
Every place I go, I'll think of you
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back, I'll bring you a wedding ring

[Chorus]
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Because I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

[Chorus]
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground

[Verse 1]
I don't know what's gonna happen to you baby
But I do know that I love ya
You walk around this town with your head all up in the sky
And I do know that I want ya

[Chorus]
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Ooh! Down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
You tease me with your loving to play hard to get
'Cause you do know that I want ya
I need to do you something to get closer to your soul
And you do know that I want ya

[Chorus]
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground

Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)

[Verse 1]
I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick
And steer as we drove through town
He'd tousle my hair and say "Son, take a good look around
This is your hometown"

[Chorus]
Your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown

[Verse 2]
In '65 tension was running high at my high school
There was lots of fights 'tween blacks and whites
There was nothing you could do
Two cars at a light on a Saturday night
In the back seat there was a gun
Words were passed, in a shotgun blast
And troubled times had come to my hometown

[Chorus]
My hometown
My hometown
To my hometown

[Bridge]
Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad track
Foreman says "These jobs are going, boys
And they ain't coming back
To your hometown"

[Chorus]
Your hometown
Your hometown
Your hometown

[Verse 3]
Last night me and Kate laid in bed
Talking about getting out
Packing up our bags and maybe heading south
I'm thirty-five, we got a boy of our own now
Last night I sat him up behind the wheel and said
"Son take a good look around
This is your hometown"
Writer(s): Raposo

When all the songs are out of tune
And all the rhythms ring so untrue
When I don't find the words to say
The thoughts I bring to you

When I hear lonely singers
Who are just as lost as me
Making noise, not melody

You will be my music
You will be my song
You will be my music
I can't wait any longer if I'm wrong

I'll never find the song to tell me
All the things I need to say
And I'm afraid as time goes by

That someday soon you'll go away
And I'll be lost and trying
For songs I'll never sing
Wanting you is ev'rything
You will be my music
You will be my song
You will be my music
I can't wait any longer if I'm wrong
I can't wait any longer for my song
Are you getting the spirit in the dark
Are you getting the spirit in the dark
People moving, ah, tell me we're grooving
Just getting the spirit in the dark

Tell me, sisters, how do you feel
Tell me, my brothers, my brothers
How do you feel
Do you feel like dancing
Get up there and let's start dancing
Get up and let's start dancing
Start getting in the spirit
Oh, getting in the dark
Spirit in the dark

Just like Sally Walker
Sitting in a saucer
That's how you do it
Just go on, get on up to it
Ride, Sally, ride
Put your hands on your hips
Cover your eyes, and move
Come on get it
Get in the spirit
Move with the spirit
Come on and move, get in the spirit
Darling, move, move with the spirit
Oh move, get in the spirit
Help me move
Move
With the spirit
Spirit
Are you getting the spirit
Spirit in the dark
I wanna know, are you getting the spirit
Getting the spirit
Getting it in the spirit
Are you getting the spirit
Getting the spirit
Keep moving
Oh hey, we're rocking and grooving
Just getting in the spirit
Getting the spirit
Oh in the dark

We're gonna do it one more time
It's just like Sally Walker
Sitting in that great big flying saucer

Hey, that's how you do it
Get down and get on up to it
Come on and get it
Ride, Sally, ride
Put your hands on your hips
Cover your eyes, and move
Move, move on
Move with the spirit
I'm telling you to groove
Groove on
Groove with the spirit
On and on
Go on and move
Move
With the spirit
Spirit
Come on and groove
Move it
Groove with the spirit
Move on
On and on
Yeah
Help me, help me, help me
Help me move, move, move, move
Move, move, move, move
Move, move, move, move
Move, move, move, move
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
You got it, you got it
You got the spirit

Spirit

Feel it

I feel it, baby
You know what I mean, baby?
Yes, I do
Oh baby. You gotta feel the motivation
I feel it, honey, I feel it

Feel the spirit
In the dark
Get ready
I got plenty o'nothin' and nothin's plenty for me
I got no car, got no mule, I got no misery

Folks with plenty of plenty, they got a lock on the door
Afraid somebody's gonna rob 'em while they're out a'makin' more
What for?

I got no lock on the door, that's no way to be
They can steal the rug from the floor, that's OK with me
'cause the things that I prize, like the stars in the skies, are all free

Say, I got plenty o'nothin' and nothin's plenty for me
I got my gal, got my song, got heaven the whole day long
Got my gal
Got my love
Got my song

I got plenty o'nothin' and nothin's plenty for me
I got my gal, got my song, I got heaven the whole day long
Got my gal
Got my love
Got my song
I lost the sunshine and roses, I lost the heavens of blue
I lost the beautiful rainbow, I lost the morning dew
I lost the angel who gave me summer, the whole winter too
I lost the gladness that turned into sadness
When I lost you
(musical interlude)
And I lost the angel who gave me summer, the whole winter too
I lost the gladness that turned into sadness
When I lost you
Dusk and the shadows falling o'er land and sea
Somewhere a voice is calling, calling for me
Dusk and the shadows falling o'er land and sea
Somewhere a voice is calling, calling for me
Dearest, my heart is dreaming, dreaming of you
Somewhere a voice is calling, calling for me, calling for me

[Verse 1]
I don't know just how it happened; I let down my guard
Swore I'd never fall in love again, but I fell hard
Guess I should have seen it coming; caught me by surprise
Wasn't looking where I was going; I fell into your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing rain
Before I, I knew what hit me, baby, you were flowing through my veins

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
I'm out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you!

[Verse 2]
Midnight blows in through the window, dances 'round the room
Got me hypnotized, I'm getting high on love with you
I couldn't live without you now, Oh, I know I'd go insane
I wouldn't last one night alone, baby
I couldn't stand the pain!

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to you
Hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes
Drowning in blue
Outta control
Now nothing's impossible, I've found for when my chin is on the ground
I pick myself up, dust myself off, and start all over again
Don't lose your confidence if you slip, be grateful for a pleasant trip
And pick yourself up, dust off, start over again
Work like a soul inspired until the battle of the day is won
You may be sick and tired, but you be a man, my son
Will you remember the famous men who have to fall to rise again
So take a deep breath, pick yourself up, start all over again
(musical interlude)
You gotta work like a soul inspired until the battle of the day is won
You may be sick and tired, but you be a man, my son
Will you remember the famous men who have to fall and then to rise again
So take a deep breath, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start all over again
(musical interlude)
Once again now:
Will you remember the famous men who have to fall and then rise again
So take a deep breath, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start all over again
(coda)
That's enough now
Once a wand'ring ne'er do well
Just a vagrant roving fellow
I went my way

Life was just a joke to tell
Like a lonely Punchinello
My role was gay

But I knew the joke was aimless
Time went on, I liked the game less
For you see

Somewhere lurked a spark divine
And I kept wond'ring whether mine
Would come to me

Then my fortune turned and I found you
Here you are with my arms around you
You will never know what you've meant to me
You're the prize that heaven has sent to me
Here's a bright and beautiful world all new
Wrapped up in you
You are love, here in my arms
Where you belong
And here you will stay
I'll not let you away

I went day after day with you
You are spring
Bud of romance unfurl'd
You taught me to see
One truth forever true

You are love
Wonder of all the world
Where you go with me
Heaven will always be

You are love, here in my arms
Where you belong
And here you will stay
I'll not let you away

I went day after day with you
You are spring
Bud of romance unfurl'd
You taught me to see
One truth forever true

[Intro]
Just a little love (Ooh baby)
Before my life is gone
Just a little love

[Verse 1]
Every flower needs a little water
Before it can bloom
Every bit of darkness needs some sunshine
To brighten up the gloom

[Pre-Chorus]
Every lonely heart needs a little love
To keep it beating strong
And all I want is a little loving
Before my life is gone

[Chorus]
Just a little love (Baby, baby)
Before my life is gone

[Verse 2]
Every rainbow needs a little color
To brighten up the day
Every baby robin needs some teaching
Before he can fly away

[Pre-Chorus]
Every lonely heart needs someone to love
To keep its purpose strong
And all I want is someone to love me
Before my life is gone

[Chorus]
Just a little love (Baby, please)
Before my life is gone

[Bridge]
Every lonely man needs a loving woman
To keep his purpose strong
And all I need is someone to love me
Before my life is gone

[Outro]
Just a little love (Mmm, somebody love me)
Before my life is gone (Oh my)
Just a little love (I need somebody)
Before my life is gone (Mhm)
I fucked this girl in Talahassee
Doggie style so i named her Lassie
Came on her, florida state clothes
Filled up all her semen holes
Fucked this girl from purdue
Came in her hair, fucked up her doo
She was cryin, like tammy faye baker
Her pussy got hotter than a boiler maker
Met Santa's daughter in Baton Rouge
Fucked up Christmas like Mr. Scrooge
Dropped her off at LSU
Smoked all her weed, drank all her brew
Fucked George Bush daughter in Dallas, Texas
Rode that ass just like a Lexus
Fucked her again in ft. worth
Stuck my dick in her pussy and I started to surf

(CHORUS)
Colt 45, Afroman
Tryin to get all the pussy that I can
To the cross country in my Afro van
SMOKIN WEED
2X

I priced this hooker in Ohio
I said, Bitch, you too high Ho
I got a cheaper ho in Cincinatti
Fucked her in the back of my 83 Caddy
Broker as hell smokin Newport singles
Came in her ass and said "Fuck the Bengals"

(afroman rant)

SMOKIN WEED!

Smokin weed, State-to-State
Beer and munchies got me gaining weight
Missionary style in chilla coffee
Little mamma said, "would you please get off me"
Beatutiful girl, Iowa City
Roll a blunt fatter than a big fat titty
She sucked my dick, while she held my thighs
I came in her Iowa Hawk-"Eyes"
My dick went BOING in Des Moines
Going going go-Buckaw!

SMOKIN WEED!
(CHORUS 2x)
Oklahoma, Smoke-lahoma
Buffalo, Puff-alo
Fort Smith, Fort Spliff

SMOKIN WEED

(CHORUS 2x)
Close to you I will always stay
Close to you, though you're far away

You'll always be near, as though you were here by my side
No matter where in my dreams, I'll find you there

Close to me, sharing your caress
Can't you see you're my happiness?

Wherever you go, my heart will go too
What can I do?
It only wants to be close to you

Wherever you go, my heart will go too
What can I do?

If you knew the joy you bring
How my hungry heart would sing
If only we could be close to you

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
I don't even know why I'm trippin'
'Cause you're gonna do your thing so it don't make a difference
And I ain't gonna change, I'ma stay on this mission
A big backyard, few cars, and a kitchen
I wanna put you in, it takes a minute for the pop off
I bet you look cute in the coupe with the top off
If you ain't gonna ride this train you should hop off
'Cause if it ain't real, baby girl, it's a knockoff

[Pre-Chorus: Boyz II Men]
And oh, I swear you're the one that I wanted
That's why I'm like, "Girl, just live in the moment"
'Cause I ain't never felt this way about a woman
You play a big part in the man I'm becoming
So baby please

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
If you really wanna leave, baby, now is the best time
(Now is the best time)
'Cause I can't make you believe, I done gave you my best line
(Gave you my best line)
'Cause all I got right now is a flow
And I can see that you need more
But I can play you six in a row, right now (Right now)
All I got is a flow (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
All I got is a flow (Oh, oh oh)
Is it good enough for you, girl?

[Verse 2: Nathan Morris]
Please don't miss what I'm sayin'
I'm far from a kid and I'm so not playin'
Never felt a heart so cold in L.A. and
You're throwing in a towel right before the weigh-in
You don't even see that I'm due for a knockout
I'm puttin' in work, it's too early, to clock out
So shorty lay back, be cool, we gon' rock out
This thing is too loud and it's so hard to block out

[Pre-Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Feeling like a 747 fly away
If love is blind come and take my sight away
I ain't gotta see, I can feel that you want it
So please don't be afraid of whatever we becoming, becoming, yeah

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
If you really wanna leave, baby, now is the best time
(Now is the best time)
'Cause I can't make you believe, I done gave you my best line
(Gave you my best line)
'Cause all I got right now is a flow
And I can see that you need more
But I can play you six in a row, right now (Right now)
All I got is a flow (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
All I got is a flow (Oh, oh oh)
Is it good enough for you, girl?

[Bridge: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
And I'ma let it breathe
I'ma let it breathe like the breeze through the tree tops
And Imma let it breathe
I'ma let it breathe, do you love me or love me not? Yeah
I'ma let it breathe (Breathe)
I'ma let it breathe, breeze like the tree tops
I'ma let it breathe
Tell me do you love me?
(I'ma let it breathe, let it breathe, oh ooh ooh)

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
If you really wanna leave, baby, now is the best time
(Now is the best time)
'Cause I can't make you believe, I done gave you my best line
(I gave you my best line, yeah)
'Cause all I got right now is a flow
(Now is a flow)
And I can see that you need more
(You need more)
But I can play you six in a row (Six in a row)
Right now (Right now)

[Outro: Boyz II Men]
All I got is a flow (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
All I got is a flow (Oh, oh oh)
Is it good enough for you, girl?

[Verse 1]
Her day was born in shades of blue
Her song was sad, the words were true
Her morning came too fast, too soon
And died before the afternoon

[Chorus]
Poor lady day could use some love, some sunshine
Lady day has too much rain
Poor lady day could use some spring, some breezes
Lady day has too much pain

[Verse 2]
It's such a lonely face
It's such a cloudy sky
So many shadows in her eye
So many empty dreams
So many bitter times
Just a handful of broken rhymes

[Chorus]
Poor lady day could use a smile, some kindness
Lady day has too much rain
Poor lady day could use some dreams, some flowers
Lady day has too much pain

[Verse 3]
Just too much to say
Just to much to know
Too little time to say hello
And then the evening comes
And now she doesn't cry
And it's too late to say
Good-bye

[Chorus]
War, huh, yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, uh-huh
War, huh, yeah, what is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, say it again, y'all
War, huh, whoa whoa whoa, what is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, uh-huh
Listen to me

[Verse 1]
Oh, war, I despise
'Cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears
To thousands of mothers' eyes
When their sons go to fight
And lose their lives

[Chorus]
Oh, war, huh, good God, y'all
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again
War, hey, whoa whoa whoa
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Listen to me

[Verse 2]
War, it ain't nothing
But a heartbreaker
(What is it good for?)
Friends only to the undertaker
Oh, war
It's an enemy to all mankind
The point of war blows my mind
War has caused unrest
In the younger generation
Induction then destruction
Who wants to die?

[Chorus]
Aaaaah, war, huh, good God y'all
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again
War, huh
What is it good for
Absolutely nothing
Listen to me

War, huh, yeah yeah yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Come on, let me hear ya...

[Bridge]
Talkin' 'bout war now

War, it ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
It's got one friend, that's the undertaker
War has shattered many a young man's dreams
Made him disabled, bitter and mean
Life is much too short and precious
To spend fighting wars these days
War can't give life
It could only take it away

[Chorus]
Oh, war, huh, yeah, oh yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again y'all

War, huh, hey hey, yeah yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Come on, say it

War, huh, come on and shout it y'all
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Come on, come on now

[Bridge]
It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
Friends only to the undertaker
Peace, love and understanding
Tell me, is there no place for them today?
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But Lord knows there's got to be a better way

[Chorus]
Ooooooh, war, huh, good God y'all
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again y'all

War, huh, whoa whoa whoa whoa
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again y'all

War, huh, whoa whoa whoa whoa
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Men had need of shelter from the evil, from the night
The devil ? wind was blowin? and from heaven came a light
The Son of God, a carpenter and He came with a plan
To build a house where heaven could be offered unto men

When he came here, He laid down a mighty firm foundation
And the columns and the beams were churches, scattered through the nation
And then rooms were added to it on that same old solid rock
And roofs were raised by willing hands, from the bottom to the top

Then the people came and filled the house, were singing prayer and praise
Some turned and rejected, His house fell on leaner days
Oh, Son of God, oh Carpenter, will you come back around

The blocks and beams are crumbling and the house is falling down

Now the storm is raging and the devil?s angry roar
He?s screaming at the windows and howlin? at the door
And though the faithful few inside are standing true and strong
The house has been neglected and it won?t be standin? long
Then the people came and filled the house, were singing prayer and praise
Some turned and rejected, His house fell on leaner days
Son of God, oh Carpenter, will you come back around
Our blocks and beams are crumbling and the house is falling down

Son of God, oh Carpenter, where you come back around
The blocks and beams are crumbling and the house is fallin? down
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever, trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours - We live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust, I seek; and I find in you
Every day, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close, no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever, trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

I never opened myself this way
Life is ours - We live it our way
Hey, all these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust, I seek; and I find in you
Every day, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah-h'eah!

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever, trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters

Chased your pain away

In my special way

Ain't half the man as me
Hey I don't have to prove nothing
Long as you're satisfied
Cos if you need more loving
There's plenty more inside yeah
Just tell them I'm glad that he's my man
Something they'll never understand
That is why I....I...

Once I tried to capture the rapture of the night
Silly dreams I knew would disappear
But it seems they left a souvenir
One refrain eternally will haunt me, taunt me
It came from nowhere the night that we met
T'was like a melodious plea, wee moon song that wasn't meant for me
Why is it always reminding me of a love dream that never could be
Wee moon song that wasn't meant for me
It came gliding into my heart, riding on a moonbeam from above
Sorrow and this and the whole world blended in a rhapsody of love
There I heard her singing to somebody else
What I thought was my melody
Wee moon song that wasn't meant for me
Shake down the stars, pull down the clouds
Turn off the moon, do it soon
I can't enjoy the night without you
Shake down the stars
Dry up the streams, stop all my dreams
Cut off the breeze, do it please
I never thought I'd cry about you
Shake down the stars
I gave you my arms, my lips, my heart
My love, my life, my all
But the best that I had to offer you
I found was all too small
Crush every rose, hush every pray'r
Break every vow, do it now
I know I cannot live without you
Shake down the stars
The sunday mornin' gospel goes good with the soul
There's blues, folk, and country, and rock like a rollin' stone
The world could come together as one
If everybody under the sun
Add some music to your day
(Add some music add some add some music to your day)
A bob didit a bop didit

You'll hear it while you're walkin' by a neighbor's home
You'll hear it faintly in the distance when you're on the phone
You're sittin' in a dentist's chair
And they've got music for you there
To add some music
(Add some music add some add some music to your)
To your day
A bob didit a bop didit

Add some music music everywhere (add some music)
Add some add some add some add some music (add some music)
Your doctor knows it keeps you calm
Your preacher adds it to his psalms
So add some music
(Add some music add some add some music to your)
To your day
Music
(Add some music add some music)
When you're alone
(Add some music add some music)
Is like a companion
(Add some music add some music)
For your lonely soul
Oo oo oo woo oo woo oo oo oo oooo

When day is over (when day is over)
I close my tired eyes (I close my tired)
Music is in my soul

At a movie you can feel it touching your heart
And on every day of the summertime
You'll hear children chasing ice cream carts
They'll play it on your wedding day
There must be 'bout a million ways
To add some music
(Add some music add some add some music to your)
To your day

Add some music to your day
Add some music to your day
Add some music to your day
Add some music to your day
Add some music to your day
I got a boogie-woogie woman
Boogie-woogie all the time
I got a boogie-woogie woman
Boogie-woogie all the time
If she keep on boogyin'
She bound to lose her mind

Well, she boogies in the mornin'
And she boogies all night long
Well, she boogies in the mornin'
And she boogies all night long
She's still goin' strong

Well, she boogies in the mornin'
And she boogies late at night
Well, she boogies in the mornin'
And she boogies late at night
Well, I don't mind her boogyin'
'Cause her boogyin' is all right

Well, she's a bogie-woogie woman
And she boogies all the time
Well, she's a bogie-woogie woman
And she boogies all the time
Well, if keep on boogyin'
She bound to lose her mind

Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the Gypsy in me

I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want these arms about you

Don't be a naughty baby
Come to papa, come to papa do
My sweet embraceable you

I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want my arms about you

So don't you be a naughty baby
Come to papa do
My sweet embraceable you
I can wait another day
Until I call you
You've only got my heart on a string
And everything a-flutter

But another lonely night
Might take forever
We've only got each other to blame
It's all the same to me, love
'Cause I know what I feel to be right

No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there

May I never miss the thrill
Of being near you
And if it takes a couple of years
To turn your tears to laughter
I will do what I feel to be right
No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away

Yes, I know what I feel to be right

No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
No more lonely nights, no no

[Justin Timberlake:]
I'm wakin, up in the morning
Hustling to the stage and fuckin performin'
Bustlin' through the hate and bustin' the door in
Lately nothing misses I must've been scorin'
Speaking of the Misses I'm watchin' 'em pour in
Just like a drink that I'm enjoying
I don't mean bottles - you're welcome to join in
Just look at me soarin' - Feeling like Jordan

Oh-oh
Hold up I ain't finished yet
On the top, but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut, I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands, let me say it again
Oh-oh
You ain't heard, I'm the shit
On the top, but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut, but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on, but guess what?

[Chorus:]
I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
Cause I'm a winner, yeah I'm a winner

[Jamie Foxx:]
I'm steppin', out in the evening
People in there screaming, you gotta be cheating
But I'm so breezy, I make this look easy
No faking I'm seizing, you gotta believe it
I went from TV's, to screens, to DVDs
To CDs, to MP3s, overseas - I got
No time, the talkin' is boring
Just look at me soarin' - Feeling like Jordan

Oh-oh
Hold up I ain't finished yet
On the top, but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut, I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands, let me say it again
Oh-oh
You ain't heard, I'm the shit
On the top, but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut, but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on, but guess what?

[Chorus:] I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
Cause I'm a winner, yeah I'm a winner

[T.I.:]
That's right
You see the - Porsche Panamera got 'em in hysteria
The turbo super fast, and that Mclaren even scarier
Hemme turnin' corners, burnin' rubber in your area
I'm hard to follow once i pop clutch and hit the throttle
ReI'm recession-proof
I don't run to money - money run to me
In this economy guess I'm considered an anomaly
Bugattis, Maseratis, new Ferraris - I got one of each
My future bright, tight
Like the bitch I got in front of me
Turn pain to progression in every studio session
Passion into perfection, to failure I'm an exception
Fuck if you wanna lose, to battle me is a blessing
You couldn't die at the hands of a better man
I ran from the bottom to the best - no Auto-Tune
Been in the lead, so you seen can't follow whom
Never that, I'm the freshest go ask whoever that
King back, money long as an old Cadillac

[Chorus:]
I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
Cause I'm a winner, yeah I'm a winner

[Verse 1]
I wanna love you, yeah, yeah
Over and over again
I wanna see, see what your life, life can be
(Over and over)

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, baby
Don't say goodnight when you know
It's time for love
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say goodnight, oh, when you know
I gotta have your love

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel you
I wanna thrill you, girl
I want to caress you
Ooh, never let you go

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, baby
Don't say goodnight (Don't say goodnight), oh, when you know
I gotta have your love
And oh, baby
Don't say goodnight (Don't say goodnight) when you know
I gotta have your love

[Bridge]
Some people say
That life is for the livin'
So let's live it, baby, yeah
Most of the people say
That love is for the givin'
So let me love you, girl, yeah

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say goodnight (Don't say goodnight), oh, when you know
It's time for love
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, baby
Don't say goodnight (Don't say goodnight) when you know
I gotta have your love

[Bridge]

So let's live it, baby, yeah
Most of the people say

So let me love you, girl, yeah

[Chorus]
And hey baby
Don't say goodnight (Don't say goodnight), oh, when you know
I gotta have your love
And hey baby

I gotta have your love

[Outro]
And ooh-wee, baby
Don't say goodnight
Don't ever, ever say, ever say

Ever, ever, ever say
Don't say goodnight
Don't say goodnight

[Intro]
Water boy
Where are you hiding?
If you don't come right here
Gonna tell your pa on you

[Verse]
There ain't no hammer
That's on this mountain
That ring like mine, boy
That ring like mine
I'm gonna bust this rock, boy
From here to the Macon
All the way to the jail, boy
All the way to the jail
You jack o' diamond
Jack o' diamond
Know you're old
I know you are old
You could rob my pocket
Rob my pocket
Silver and gold, boy
Of the silver and gold
There ain't no sweat, boy
That's on this mountain
That run like mine, boy
That run like mine
I'm gon' bust this rock, boy
From here to the Macon
All the way to the jail, boy
All the way to the jail

[Outro]
Water boy
Where are you hiding?
If you don't come right here
Gonna tell your pa on you
Water boy
I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her, too
'Cause I love her, oh yessiree

She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
'Cause I love her, oh yessiree

A love like ours
Will never die
As long as I
Have you near me

Bright as the stars that shine
Dark as the sky
I said I know, I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her, oh yessiree, yessiree

Yeah, a love like ours
Will never die
As long as I
Have you near me

Bright as the stars that shine
As dark as the sky
I said I know, I know this love of mine
Will never die
'Cause I love her, oh yessiree, yessiree

I love her
Yes, this love of mine will never die
Simply 'cause I love her
I want the world to know that I love her
Whenever I try to hold my baby
She just stand there for a while
No matter how I try to please that woman
She won't even crack a smile
Lord, maybe you in heaven can help me
'cause this is one evil child
Oh, I say maybe, maybe somebody can help me
Because this is one evil child

When I buy her flowers or candy she just looks at me and growls
She say, "You must be guilty or have a guilty conscience buddy"
Because I'm convicted without a trial
She just grunts when I call baby, hmm one evil child
I said, "Lord, maybe you can help me, because she's a strange and evil child"

Still, I'm tryin' to please my woman but she 'bout to drive me wild
I buy her hundred dollar dresses, people
Still she complains about the style
Won't somebody give me a suggestion?
Help me with this evil child
Oh, maybe the Lord in heaven above can help me

[Verse 1]
I heard you're gonna leave me
I've known it for awhile
I wasn't naive to the news my mind just couldn't walk a mile
I only see you with me cause I know the things you like
I know all that you believe and all the plans of your life
So take a minute to understand me, to re-evaluate your mind
I'm everything you need and in this world
A good man is hard to find
And I know you'll miss me
When all is said and done
You'll think about this day and then you'll realize I was the one

[Chorus]
U know
That all u need is in me
And u know
That my love's alright (ohhh, oh)
And baby, U know
I can't be denied girl, u know
Ooh u know, u know

[Verse 2]
Gave you all a man can give you
Made sure I found the time to keep it all together
But the way you're treating me ain't right (Can't understand it)
Why you doing me the way you do it
Do you enjoy to see our love fade away
Can't face the world without ya
Can't even sleep at night
Gave you all that I treasured
And I tried to love you with all my might
And I know you'll miss me when all is said and done
You'll think about this day and realize that I was the one
U know

[Chorus]
U know
That all u need is in me
And u know
That my love's alright (ohhh, o)
U know
I can't be denied girl u know
U know, u know
U know
That all u need is in me
And u know
That my love's alright (ohhh, o)
U know
I can't be denied girl u know
U know, u know

[Bridge]
You Know
You Know
You Know
I can't be tonight girl U know
U know, U know...
(oh yea)
(oohhhhhhh)
U know...

[Chorus]
U know
That all u need is in me
And u know
That my love's alright (ohhh, o)
U know
I can't be denied girl u know
U know, u know

Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Head's all empty and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seein' double
Pays my ticket when I speed

She come skimming through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you

She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive
Sugar magnolia
Ringin' that blue bell
Golder than sunlight
Go on out singing
I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on honey, come along with me

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines in the summer night moonlight
Crazy in the sunlight, yes indeed

Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander 'round
I wander 'round

Sunshine daydream
Walkin' in the tall trees
Goin' where the wind blows
Bloomin' like a red rose
Breathin' more freely
Light out singing, I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream
Sunshine daydream
Walk you in the sunshine

[Verse 1]
This is the place
Sit down, you’re safe now
You’ve been stuck in a lift
We’ve been trying to reach you, Thom
This is the place
It won’t hurt ever again

[Chorus]
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Empty all your pockets
Because it’s time to come home

[Verse 2]
This is the place
Remember me? I’m the face you always see
You’ve been stuck in a lift
In the belly of a whale at the bottom of the ocean

[Chorus]
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Empty all your pockets
Because it’s time to come home
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Ah, let it go

[Outro]
Today is the first day
Of the rest of your days
So lighten up, squirt
Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun
Shine on you crazy diamond
Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky
Shine on you crazy diamond
You were caught on the cross fire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on you target for faraway laughter, come on you stranger
You legend, you martyr, and shine!

You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon
Shine on you crazy diamond
Treatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light
Shine on you crazy diamond
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on you raver, you seer of visions, come on you painter
You piper, you prisoner, and shine!
Come out, come out wherever you are
I know, I know you're not very far!
How I wish you'd hurry
'Cause I'm inclined to worry;
These arms of mine are open
Hoping you'll appear
Where are you, dear?

Come out, come out wherever you are
Come out, come out from under that star!
Yes, and incidentally
Mentally
I'm not up to par
So come out, come out, come out
Wherever you are

So come out, come out, come out
So come out, come out, come out
Wherever you are
Me and my baby
Keeps falling out
Let me tell you
What it's all about

She wanna sell my monkey
She wanna sell my monkey
She wanna sell my monkey
But that'll never do

It used to be hers
But she gave it to me
Why she wanna sell him
I just can't see

She wanna sell my monkey
She wanna sell my monkey
She wanna sell my monkey
But that'll never do

She wanna know
Why we don't get along
She don't realize
She's doing me wrong
She wanna sell my monkey
She wanna sell my monkey
She wanna sell my monkey
But that'll never do

I have to hang around
Every day and night
I can't trust the girl
Out of my sight

She wanna sell my monkey
She wanna sell my monkey
She wanna sell my monkey
But that'll never do
Shattered dreams, worthless years, here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began, then was done, now I stare into a cold and empty well
The many sounds that meet our ears, the sights our eyes behold
Will open up our merging hearts and feed our empty souls
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever

Without despair, we will share and the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been must never end and with the strength we have won't be erased
When the truths of love are planted firm they're only hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you will echo in my mind
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever

[Hook: Yolanda Adams]
I got, got the victory
I got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus, yes I do
He is a mighty conqueror
In him I will trust all my battles He'll fight
I got, got the victory I got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus
For me He died but He rose on the third day
That's why I have true victory everyday

[Verse 1: Yolanda Adams]
Truly I been through the storm and rain
I know everything about heartache and pain
But God carried me through it all
Without His protection I'd surely fall
I been broke without a dime to my name
But all my bills got paid 'cause I called on Jesus name
You can't tell me that God isn't real 'cause I got the victory and that's why I'm still here

[Hook: Yolanda Adams]
I got, got the victory
I got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus, yes I do
He is a mighty conqueror
In him I will trust all my battles He'll fight
I got, got the victory I got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus
For me He died but He rose on the third day
That's why I have true victory everyday

[Verse 2: Yolanda Adams]
I'm not worried 'bout material things I don't have
I just rest 'cause I'm sure in my savior's care
'cause I know that my blessing is on the way
I can't see it right now but I stand by faith
I fought many ,many battle's in His name
I held up the bloodstained banner and proclaim
That Jesus is the Truth and the Light
Believe it when I say He will make it alright

[Hook: Yolanda Adams]
I got, got the victory
I got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus, yes I do
He is a mighty conqueror
In him I will trust all my battles He'll fight
I got, got the victory I got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus
For me He died but He rose on the third day
That's why I have true victory everyday

[Bridge: Yolanda Adams]
Yeah I got the victory, yeah I got the victory yeah, yeah, yeah
(And if you have the victory sing along with me)
Yeah I got the victory, yeah I got the victory yeah, yeah, yeah
(Over all of the trials, hey yeah, sing it with me I got the victory)

[Hook: Yolanda Adams]
I got, got the victory
I got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus, yes I do
He is a mighty conqueror
In him I will trust all my battles He'll fight
I got, got the victory I got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus
For me He died but He rose on the third day
That's why I have true victory everyday

[Bridge: Yolanda Adams]

Sing along with me I got it, I

[Hook: Yolanda Adams]
I got, got the victory
I got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus, yes I do
He is a mighty conqueror
In him I will trust all my battles He'll fight
I got, got the victory I got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus
For me He died but He rose on the third day
That's why I have true victory everyday
Midway between happiness and sadness boiling but not overflowing
Fails to only make a better come back, more powerful and poignant and falls again
Destructive lust for life erected, on the verge pricked up like a picket
Fearing to respond to the tempting but malevolent call of the other side
Is this the way our romance ends
I got the message when you said we could be friends
My love was true, I can't believe I'm losing you
We played a game, of give and take
But I stopped playing when my heart began to break
What can I do, I can't believe I'm losing you
Wish I could erase every little trace of love that's in the heart of me
Every little dream, every little scheme, will always be a part of me
There's nothing left for me to do
We've passed the point of no return, and now we're through
It's still too new, I can't believe I'm losing you
It's still too new, I can't believe I'm losing you
Ollie told me I'm a fool
So I walked on down the road a mile
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee, and what do you think he said to me?

[Chorus:]
When you awake you will remember ev'rything
You will be hangin' on a string from your...
When you believe, you will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know
Ollie showed me the fork in the road
You can take to the left or go straight to the right
Use your days and save your nights
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat

[Chorus:]
Ollie warned me it's a mean old world
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;
But what am I supposed to do:
Read the writing on the wall
I heard it when I was very small

[Chorus:]
Wash my hand in lye water, I got a date with the Captain's daughter
You can go and tell your brother
We sure gonna love one another, oh! you
May be right and ya might be wrong
I ain't gonna worry all day long
Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite
My old car froze up last night
Ain't no reason to hang your head I could wake up in the mornin' dead
Oh! and if I thought it would do any good
I'd stand on the rock where Moses stood
You don't drive a big fast car
And you don't look like a movie star
And on your money, we won't get far
But baby, you got what it takes
(Yeah, yeah)
To satisfy
(Yeah, yeah)
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And whoa, whoa, yeah
You got what it takes for me
You don't live in a beautiful place
And you don't dress with the best of taste
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face
But baby, you got what it takes
(Yeah, yeah)
To satisfy
(Yeah, yeah)
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And whoa, whoa, yeah
You got what it takes for me
And when you're near me, ooh wee
My head goes around and around
And when you kiss me, whoa, yeah
My love comes tumblin' down, you send me
You don't live in a beautiful place
And you don't dress with the best of taste
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face
But baby, you got what it takes
(Yeah, yeah)
To satisfy
(Yeah, yeah)
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And whoa, whoa, yeah
You got what it takes for me
And when you're near me, ooh wee
My head goes around and around
And when you kiss me, whoa, yeah
My love comes tumblin' down, you send me
You don't live in a beautiful place
And you don't dress with the best of taste
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face
But baby, you got what it takes
(Yeah, yeah)
To satisfy
(Yeah, yeah)
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And whoa, whoa, yeah
You got what it takes for me
Whoa, yeah, you got what it takes for me
Hmm, you got what it takes for me
No need, no, if I close
But you got what it takes for me
Hmm, you got what it takes for me

[Verse 1]
Magdalene is trembling like a washing on a line
Trembling and gleaming
Never before was a man so kind
Never so redeeming

[Chorus 1]
Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue, in radiation rose
Ecstasy, now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free?

(Who're you gonna get?)

[Verse 2]
I am up a sycamore, looking through the leaves
A sinner of some position
Who in the world can this heart healer be
This magical physician

[Chorus 2]
Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue, in radiation rose
Misery, now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free?

(Who're you gonna get?)
(Oh ho)

[Refrain]
Enter the multitudes
The walking wounded, they come to this diver of the heart
Of the multitudes (Oh ho)
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

[Verse 3]
Oh, climb down, climb down he says to me
From the middle of unrest
They think is light is squandered
But he sees a stray in the wilderness
And I see how far I've wandered

[Chorus 3]
Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue, in radiation rose
Apathy, now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free?
(Who're you gonna get?)
(Oh ho)

[Refrain]
Enter the multitudes
The walking wounded, they come to this diver of the heart
Of the multitudes (Oh ho)
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

[Verse 4]
Oh, all around the marketplace, the buzzing of the flies
The buzzing and the stinging
Divinely barren and wickedly wise
The killer nails are ringing

[Chorus 4]
Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue, in radiation rose
Tragedy, now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free?

[Outro]
(Oh ho)
(Who're you gonna get?)
(Who're you gonna get?)
(Who're you gonna get?)
(Who're you gonna get?)
(Who're you gonna get?)
(Who're you gonna get?)
Well, I wanna go out without tearing my bed, now
I'se so scared my baby quit 'n'
I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it
And loose that girl of mine

Well she spend my money - buying me clothes
She's done cheapest woman I ever did know 'n'
So, I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it
And loose that girl of mine
Yeah

Break:

I got a good friend from Alabam
He tried to steal my chick I don't know how many time
I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it, ah
I can't afford to do it
And loose that girl of mine, ah
I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it
And loose that girl of mine, um
Strange things have happened, like never before
My baby told me I would have to go
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home
No use in worrying, 'cause the world gone wrong
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

I told you, baby, right to your head
If I didn't leave you I would have to kill you dead
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

I tried to be loving and treat you kind
But it seems like you never right, you got no loyal mind
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind
Praise the Good Lord to get her out of your mind
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

Said, when you been good now, can't do no more
Just tell her kindly, "there is the front door"
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

[Chorus 1]
My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
The way he described it, he said I'd be better dead than live
I didn't listen to his jive
I knew all along that he was all wrong
And I knew that he thought I was crazy but I'm not
Oh no

[Chorus 2]
My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
He said I need treatment but I'm not that easily led
He said I was the type that was most inclined
When out of his sight to be out of my mind
And he thought I was nuts
No more ifs or ands or buts

[Verse 1]
They say as a child, I appeared a little bit wild
With all my crazy ideas, but I knew what was happening
I knew I was a genius
What's so strange when you know that you're a wizard at three
I knew that this was meant to be

[Verse 2]
Now I heard little children were supposed to sleep tight
That's why I got into the vodka one night
My parents got frantic, didn't know what to do
But I saw some crazy scenes before I came to
Now do you think I was crazy?
I may have been only three but I was swinging

[Verse 3]
They all laugh at angry young men
They all laughed at Edison and also at Einstein
So why should I feel sorry if they just couldn't understand
The idiomatic logic that went on in my head?
I had a brain, it was insane
Oh, they used to laugh at me when I refused to ride
On all those double decker buses
All because there was no driver on the top

[Chorus 3]
My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
But I said, "Dear doctor, I think that it's you instead
Because I, I've got a thing that's unique and new
To prove it I'll have the last laugh on you
'Cause instead of one head, I got two
And you know two heads are better than one"

[Verse 1]
When I found out this love's undone
I was like a gun
Sure as it was over
Felt like nothing good could come

[Pre-Chorus]
Sure as it's gonna play and play
Like Michael back in the day
I'm gonna peel you away

[Chorus]
Now as I begin
To wash you off my skin
I'm gonna peel you away
'Cause you're not right within

[Verse 2]
I love you so
Sometimes love has to let go
So this time don't think it's a lie
I say goodbye

[Chorus]
Now as I begin
To wash you off my skin
I'm gonna peel you away
'Cause you're not right within

[Outro]
Now it's time
To wash you off my skin
Now as I begin
It couldn't be right 'cause you're not right within
I say goodbye

[Verse 1]
Be who you are
Don't ever change
The world was made to measure for your smile
So smile

[Verse 2]
Those crazy dreams
We threw, we threw away
I never been alone with you
I never could
They say
That love will find a way
And love will never be set free
And I won't ever let you be
You could not understand
You never will

[Verse 3]
Be who you are
I bless, I bless your name
And all that summer madness caused the rain
And we... we

[Instrumental]
Ahh...
Ahh...
Ahh...

[Release]
The glory that we made
My love will grace the halls of time
For love that never can be mine
You could not love me then
I love you still

[Verse 4]
Be who you are
Seize life and find a way
And I will be that shadow loving who you are
Be who you are
We were
Well I roll and a-tumble
I cried the whole night long. (2x)
Well I had the feelin', baby
Somethin's goin' on wrong
Well I really love you, baby
Come on and say you'll be mine. (2x)
Well, if you don't like my taters
Don't you trip (?) my vine
Well I cried last night, mama
I cried the night before. (2x)
Well I had the feelin', baby
You don't love me no more
Well if the river was whiskey
I was a diving duck. (2x)
Well I would swim to the bottom
Baby, I wouldn't come up
Well I roll and a-tumble
I cried the whole night long. (2x)
Well I had the feelin', baby
Somethin's goin' on wrong
We'll try the old "Pride of Cucamonga" again

On the edge of an empty highway, howling at the blood on the moon
Diesel Mack come rolling down my way, can't hit that border too soon
Running hard out of Muskrat Flats, it was sixty days or double life
Hail on my back like a shotgun blast, high wind chimes in the night

Oh oh, Pride of Cucamonga, oh oh, bitter olives in the sun
Oh oh, I had me some lovin', and I done some time

Since I came down from Oregon, there's a lesson or two I've learned
Standing in the road alone, I'm watching the fires burn
The northern sky it stinks with greed, you can smell it for miles around
The good old boys in the Greystone Hotel are still doing that git on down

Oh oh, Pride of Cucamonga, oh oh, silver apples in the sun
Oh oh, I had me some lovin', and I done some time

[Instrumental break]

I see your silver city'll shine, but I know I can't go there
Your streets run deep with poisoned wine, your doorways crawl with fear
So I think I'll head for Mexico where the weed grows green and fine
Wrap myself around a bush of that bright, whoa, Oaxaca vine
Whoa whoa, Pride of Cucamonga, oh oh, silver horse in the sun
Oh oh, I had me some lovin', and I done some time
Done some time, and I done some time

[Verse 1]
I was looking for an easy ride
Never wanting to get inside
Now, I know I'm letting go of my defenses and cold hard lines
Because you've shown me there's better times
Changin' my life in so many ways...

[Chorus 1]
And I love you
Because you make me smile
Just like the morning sun
You make me smile
You know you make me smile
So many ways at once
Ah, you make me smile

[Verse 2]
Why this feeling never came before
The answer to that, I'm not quite sure
Maybe time will help this rhyme
All I know is I'm different now
You make me happy
And you're somehow always there to understand
I'm just a man...

[Chorus 1]
And I love you
Because you make me smile
Just like the morning sun
You make me smile
You know you make me smile
So many ways at once
Ah, you make me smile

[Instrumental 2:20 - 3:10]

[Chorus 2]
Because you make me smile
Just like the morning sun
You make me smile
You know you make me smile
So many ways at once
Ah, you make me smile

[Outro]
You make me smile...
You make me smile...
You make me smile...
Ahh, you make me smile!
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garden in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes the people all complain

Stephen prospered in his time
Well he may and he may decline
Did it matter, does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket is hanging clear to hell
Halfway twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again

Lady finger, dipped in moonlight
Writing "what for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet colors, call it your own
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the by and by
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

Saint Stephen shall remain, all he lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been there so long, he's got to calling it home

Fortune comes a crawlin', calliope woman
Spinnin' that curious sense of your own
Can you answer?
Yes I can!
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

[Chorus]
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Senora, work your body line
Work, work, work, Senora, work it all the time

[Verse 1]
My girl's name is Senora
I tell you friends, I adore her
And when she dances, oh brother!
She's a hurricane in all kinds of weather

[Pre-Chorus]
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Whoa!

[Chorus]
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Senora, work your body line
Work, work, work, Senora, work it all the time

[Verse 2]
You can talk about Cha Cha
Tango, Waltz, or the Rumba
Senora's dance has no title
You jump in the saddle
Hold on to de bridle

[Pre-Chorus]
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Whoa!

[Chorus]
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Senora, work your body line
Work, work, work, Senora, work it all the time

[Verse 3]
Senora, she's a sensation
The reason for aviation
And fellas, you got to watch it
When she wind up, she bottom, she go like a rocket

[Pre-Chorus]
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Hoist those guns a little higher!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Up the chimney!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Whoa!

[Chorus]
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Senora, work your body line
Work, work, work, Senora, work it all the time

[Verse 4]
Senora dances Calypso
Left to right is the tempo
And when she gets the sensation
She go up in the air, come down in slow motion

[Pre-Chorus]
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Whoa!

[Outro]
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Senora!
Blue light rain, unbroken chain
Looking for familiar faces in an empty window pane

Listening for the secret, searching for the sound
But I could only hear the preacher and the baying of his hounds

Willow sky, I walk and wonder why
They say love your brother, but you will get it if you try

Roll you down the line, boy, drop you for a loss
Ride you down on a cold railroad and nail you to a cross

(To F7)

November and more, as I wait for the score
They tell me forgiveness is the key to every door
(That goes D-minor 7th, C-major 7th, F, E-minor, G)
A slow winter day, a night like forever
Sink like a stone, float like a feather

(This here is the instrumental
The short length of the pause between the parts of this rhythm is correct)

[Instrumental break]

(D-minor 7th, C-major 7th)
(D-minor 7th, C-major 7th, G-minor 7th, F, E-minor)

Lilac rain, unbroken chain
Song of the sawhet owl
Oh, out on the mountain, it'll drive you insane
Listening to the wind howl

Unbroken chain of sorrow and pearls
Unbroken chain of the sea
Unbroken chain of the western wind
Unbroken chain of you and me

[Harmonizing]

Um, let me hear that, let me hear the whole thing, would ya?
Just through the phones...

[Intro]
Tina Knowles: You know, y'all really need to talk to Bey
Kelly Rowland: Come on now Aunt Tina, she in love!
Angie Beyince: Her head is in the clouds
Kelly Rowland: And it'd be different if he could do something for her
Angie Beyince: Right, I could do better by myself
(Kelly and Tina agreeing)
Kelly Rowland: She in love, Tina!
Angie Beyince: Hey, Bey
Beyonce: Hey, y'all
Angie Beyince: Where you been?
Beyonce: Um, with my man
Tina Knowles: You know, you a Tiffany diamond, but you let him treat you like this?
Kelly Rowland: That's what I'm tryna tell her!
Angie Beyince: And I ain't know how to tell you, but last week I saw him with Kim - he is wrong!
Kelly Rowland: He is kinda wrong
Angie Beyince: He a liar and a cheat!
Tina Knowles: Beyonce, you could do so much better

[Verse 1]
You say that he's wrong, you say that he's no good
Leave him alone, 'cause he's gonna hurt you
But what they don't know is how he makes me feel
You say that he creeps, always runnin' the streets
He's playin' the game and he'll never love me
You say that he's fake but why does it feel so real?

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say, I ain't goin' nowhere
No matter what you think, I'ma always be there
The love that we share, it lives inside of me
(The love that we share, it lives inside of me)
No matter what your hearin', it's all in the past
No matter what your feelin', this love is gon' last
The heart of his soul that breathes inside of me
(The heart of his soul that breathes inside of me)

[Chorus]
My man (he makes me feel so special)
My man (he makes me feel so precious)
My man (he makes me feel wonderful)
My man (we're feelin' so comfortable)
My man (he makes me feel so special)
My man (he makes me feel so precious)
My man (he makes me feel wonderful)
He's the guy, what? He's my man

[Verse 2]
You say you don't trust him, because he been locked up
You say that he trouble 'cause he out in the strip club
But you were young once, so you should understand
You say that you know, so you been a witness
You say it's for sure, say he got a mistress
Until you can show me, I'm gon' stand by him

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say, I ain't goin' nowhere
No matter what you think, I'ma always be there
The love that we share, it lives inside of me
(The love that we share, it lives inside of me)
No matter what your hearin', it's all in the past
No matter what your feelin', this love is gon' last
The heart of his soul that breathes inside of me
(The heart of his soul that breathes inside of me)

[Chorus]
My man (he makes me feel so special)
My man (he makes me feel so precious)
My man (he makes me feel wonderful)
My man (we're feelin' so comfortable)
My man (he makes me feel so special)
My man (he makes me feel so precious)
My man (he makes me feel wonderful)
He's the guy, what? He's my man

[Chorus]
My man (he makes me feel so special)
My man (he makes me feel so precious)
My man (he makes me feel wonderful)
My man (we're feelin' so comfortable)
My man (he makes me feel so special)
My man (he makes me feel so precious)
My man (he makes me feel wonderful)
He's the guy, what? He's my man
Frankie was a good girl
Everybody knows
Paid one hundred dollars
For Albert's new suit of clothes
He was her man but he done her wrong

Albert said, "I'm leaving you
Won't be gone for long
Don't wait up for me
Or worry about me when I'm gone"
He was her man but he done her wrong

Frankie went down to the corner saloon
Get a bucket of beer
Said to the bartender
"Has my lovin' man been here?"
He was her man but he done her wrong

"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no stories
I ain't gonna tell you no lies
I saw Albert an hour ago
With a gal named Alice Bly"
He was her man but he done her wrong
Frankie went down to 12th Street
Lookin' up through the window high
She saw her Albert there
Lovin' up Alice Bly
He was her man but he done her wrong

Frankie pulled out a pistol
Pulled out a forty-four
Gun went off a rootie-toot-toot
And Albert fell on the floor
He was her man but he done her wrong

Frankie got down upon her knees
Took Albert into her lap
Started to hug and kiss him
But there was no bringin' him back
He was her man but he done her wrong

"Gimme a thousand policemen
Throw me into a cell
I shot my Albert dead
And now I'm goin' to hell
He was my man but he done me wrong"

Judge said to the jury
"Plain as a thing can be
A woman shot her lover down
Murder in the second degree"
He was her man but he done her wrong
Frankie went to the scaffold
Calm as a girl could be
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens
Said, "Nearer, my god, to thee"
He was her man but he done her wrong
Baby, you went and broke your faithful promise
How could you do a thing like that to me?
Didn't I give you everything I'd promised
How could you do a thing like that to me?

Never thought you'd be untrue
When my back was turned on you

If someone gave me all the world to hurt you
I wouldn't do a thing like that to you

Never thought you'd be untrue
When my back, it was turned on you

If someone gave me the whole wide world to hurt you
I wouldn't do a thing like that, to you
No ma'am, I wouldn't do a thing like that to you
So how could you do a thing like that to me?
(1, 2, 3, 4)

Ah...

I never fell in love so easily
Where the four winds blow I carry on
I'd like to take you where my spirit flies
Through the empty skies
We go alone
Never before
Having flown

Faster than lightening is this heart of mine
In the face of time I carry on
I'd like to take you where my rainbow ends
Be my lover friend
We go alone
Never before
Having flown

I am your hurricane
Your fire in the sun
How long must I live
In the air?
You are my paradise
My angel on the run
How long must I wait?
It's the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment you're there

You'll never know what you have done for me
You broke all those rules I live upon
I'd like to take you to my shangri-la
Neither here or far
Away from home
Never before
Having flown

I am your hurricane
Your fire in the sun
How long must I live
In the air?

You are my paradise
My angel on the run
How long must I wait?
It's the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment you're there

There I'd like to take you where my spirit flies
Through the empty skies
We go alone
Never before
Having flown

[Chorus]
My babe, my babe
My babe, my babe
My baby, my baby
She's so sweet to me

[Verse 1]
As sweet as honey
She make me feel like a bee
She walks like an angel
She got a ways like a child
A million dollar kiss and a billion dollar smile

[Chorus]
My babe, my babe
My babe, my babe
My baby, my baby
She's so sweet to me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I don’t need money, I don’t need gold
I need her love to satisfy my soul
With my babe I don’t need a thing
But a married life and a wedding ring

[Chorus]
My babe, my babe
My babe, my babe
My baby, my baby
You're so sweet to me
I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moves me so, it moves me so
I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moved me so, moved me so
It might be your kisses or your warm embrace
It might be the smile on your lovely face
I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moves me so, moved me so
I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moves me so, moves me so
I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moved me so, moved me so
It could be the way that you say 'I love you'
It could be the funny little things you do
I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moves me so, moved me so
I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moves me so, it moves me so
I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moved me so, moved me so

[Incomprehensible] you sip your tea
The funny little way you make love to me
I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moves me so, oh, you move me
You move me so, oh baby, you moved me so
You move me so, you move me so
Kill me, you move me so
The song a robin sings
Through years of endless springs
The murmur of a brook at eventide
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide

A great symphonic theme
That's Stella by starlight
And not a dream
My heart and I agree
She's everything on earth to me

A great symphonic theme
That's Stella by starlight
And not a dream
My heart and I agree
She's everything on earth to me
My way was the hard way
Didn't know it at the time
I could've made it by now
But I 'as too busy tryin'
Your way was too easy
Thank God you came along
You took me to a special place
Where nothing can go wrong

Easy, on easy street
You're the one who gave me love
That made my love complete
Easy, on easy street
The dream I pictured in my mind
Could never be this sweet
Everything I'll ever need
Is here with you on easy street

I know you're up to something
What's on your little heart
It really doesn't matter, 'cause
I know I'll love my part
Easy, on easy street
You're the one who gave me love
That made my love complete
Easy, on easy street
The dream I pictured in my mind
Could never be this sweet
Everything I'll ever need
Is here with you on easy street

Is here with you on easy street
The dream I pictured in my mind
Could never be this sweet
Everything I'll ever need
Is here with you on easy street
One moment, one moment ago, I left, I left the road
And got lost with no map to find but just stop
And it got me right back home to where you are
To the place I need, to the place I started
Where I come home, the place I belong with you

And when I'm lost it's you I turn to
And when the line is crossed it's you I turn to
Only you, only you, only you, only you
And when I'm lost it's you I turn to
Only you

I walked, I walked the road for so long, for so long alone
Until I found one ray of light I need
And it got me right back home to where you are
To the place I need, to the place I started
Where I come home, the place I belong with you

And when I'm lost it's you I turn to
And when the line is crossed it's you I turn to
Only you, only you, only you, only you
And when I'm lost it's you I turn to
Only you, only you
When you are near the way is clear
You show me who I am

And when I'm lost it's you I turn to
And when the line is crossed it's you I turn to
Only you, only you, only you, only you
And when I'm lost it's you I turn to
Only you

One moment, one moment ago I left, I left the road
When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he put her down
When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime, tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
Sleep out in the rain, if she said it ought to be
When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul, she can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for the fool
He'd be the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see
When a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
You said you've had enough
I've packed up all my stuff
I'm waiting for the cab in the hallway
I've got nothing to explain
I'm naked in the rain
Like every part of me is on display

Trying to act like everything's ok
No way

What did I do?
You say I screwed it up and it cost you
All it took was one slip and I lost you
What did I do?
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you
What did I do?

I know that you won't call
Won't talk to me at all
You left me in my less than perfect world
I'm done with feeling small
I really gave it all
Tried to be your stupid cover girl
You must be glad you finally had your way

What did I do?
You say I screwed it up and it cost you
All it took was one slip and I lost you
What did I do?
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you
What did I do?

I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never write this story
Maybe looking back
Many years from now
When it's all to late to be sorry
You'll be thinking
What did I do?

Chorus:
What did I do?
You say I screwed it up and it cost you
All it took was one slip and I lost you
What did I do?
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you
What did I do?
You say I screwed it up and it cost you
All it took was one slip and I lost you
What did I do?
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you

I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never write this story
I guess we'll never know
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you
What did I do?

[Intro]
My mind's telling me no
But my body, my body's telling me yes
Baby, I don't wanna hurt nobody
But there is something that I must confess to you, woo

[Chorus]
I don't see nothing wrong (Oh, oh) with a little bump n' grind

[Verse 2]
You say he's not treating you right
Good lady, spend the night
Listen, I'll love you like you need to be loved, lady, hey
You see, I've opened up my doors
So you don't have to go searching anymore
You'll never (You'll never want another lover)
You'll never want another love like me, hey, hey, hey, hey
Baby, you'll never find another me

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you need someone (Someone like me)
Someone like me to satisfy (Your every need), mmm baby
Your every little need, baby, I don't see

[Chorus]
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump n' grind
(With a little bump n' grind)
I don't see nothing wrong (With a little bump n' grind)
I don't see nothing wrong, baby (I don't see)
I don't see nothing wrong (Nothing wrong) with a little bump n' grind
(With a little bump n' grind)
I don't see nothing wrong (Baby)
I don't see nothing wrong, baby (Break it down)

[Bridge]
Kissing you in the right places, gently
Taking you higher
Baby, won't you reach for me
And I will satisfy your every, every little need

[Outro]
(I don't see nothing wrong)
Hey, baby, I don't see
(I don't see nothing wrong, baby)
Nothing wrong with a little
(I don't see nothing wrong)
Nothing wrong with a little
(I don't see nothing wrong, baby)
Ah, listen

If it's early in the morning

We will bumpin' and grindin'

(I don't see nothing wrong, baby)
Hey, hey, we'll be bumpin' and grindin'

Yes, we will; yes, we will
(I don't see nothing wrong, baby)
Yes, we will, woo

I don't see nothing wrong

It's just you and me, me and you

Hey, ha, baby

Everything you ever need

Gonna give it to you, baby, baby, baby, baby

(I don't see nothing wrong, baby)

I'm so glad about it, I'm so glad about it
(I don't see nothing wrong, baby)
I'm gonna give you
(I don't see nothing wrong)
I don't see nothing wrong

(I don't see nothing wrong)
Hush a bye my baby slumber time is coming soon
Rest your head on mommie's breast while daddy hums a tune
Are the old folks were humming the banjos were strumming
And the soft breezes sigh as in days long gone by
Way down in Missouri where I heard this melody
When I was a little fellow on my mommie's knee
The old folks were humming the banjos were strumming so sweet and low

Hush a bye my baby go to sleep on daddy's knee
Journey back to Dixie Land in dreams again with me
Oh, it seems like your daddy was there once again
And the old folks were strumming that same old refrain
Way down in Missouri when I heard this lullaby
While the stars were blinking and the moon was shining high
Are the old folks were humming the banjos were strumming so sweet and low
I've had my fun If I don't get well no more
I've had my fun, people, If I don't get well no more
My heath is fallin' on me
Yes, and I'm going down slow

I want you to write my mother and tell her the shape I'm in
Oh please write my mother, tell her the shape I'm in
I want you tell her to pray for me, people
Well, to forgive for my sins

On that next train South, mother
You can look for my clothes on
On that next train South, mother
You can look for my clothes on
Yes, I had my fun, mother, this is all in prayers
Yes, I had my fun, people, mother, this is all in prayers
Yes, if you don't see this old body, mother
You know I'm gone out of this world somewhere
Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
Well the way I used to love you baby
Baby that's the way I hate you now

You used to say that you loved me
But baby I believe you've changed your mind
You used to say that you loved me
But baby I believe you've changed your mind
Well I don't blame you baby
Because you ain't what you used to be

Let me love you just one more time
Yes let me love you just one more time anyway
Oh, let me love you, let me love you, let me love you
One more time baby
Let me love you just one more time anyway
Oh you can't quit me now baby
Because you didn't mean me no good anyway

Well you know where I'm from baby
So please don't try to mistreat me
Yes you know where I'm from baby
So please don't try to mistreat me
Yes because I'll make your mother a present
Baby of you and your casket too
Oh you once said you loved me
And you would do anything I said
Oh you once said you loved me baby
And you would do anything I said
Oh but the way you treat me now baby
I just soon rather be dead

Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
The way I used to love you
Baby that's the way I hate you now

[Intro: Pitbull]
International sensation
INNA
And Mr. Worldwide, dalé

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm like a quarterback, I got options
But I play the point in school
Broke ankles, more than a few
Broke hearts, yeah that too
Twenty years later, same movie, same script
Same player, more chips
More women, more haters
Different toilet, same shh...
Why get caught up in emotions?
Why go through the same motions?
In a sick way she loves to see me mad
It gets her wetter than the ocean
She's a good girl gone bad
But bad girls don't like good guys
Now tell me if you think I'm a good guy
That's what I though, ha let's ride

[Chorus: INNA]
All the things you do, all the things you say
Playin' with my heart so I can run away
All the things you did, all the things you said to me
Said to me, said
Now I'm lonely in my bed
All the things you do, all the things you say
Playin' with my heart so I can run away
All the things you did, all the things you said to me
Said to me, said
Now I'm lonely in my bed

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
They act hard, but they got soft hearts
And I know their soft spots
I meet 'em, I greet 'em, I train 'em
And show 'em all about Hard Knox
Listen, next thing you know (Next thing you know)
They holding the fort down like Fort Knox
Then they fall in love and make everything seem what it's not
Damn!
These are called rules of engagement
Welcome to the world of entertainment
They don't want a man like Rayman
They want a man that's duck in the Raymond's
I know it's ironic
But the good girls love bad guys
Now tell me, do you think I'm a good guy?
That's what I though, now let's ride

[Chorus: INNA]
All the things you do, all the things you say
Playin' with my heart so I can run away
All the things you did, all the things you said to me
Said to me, said
Now I'm lonely in my bed
All the things you do, all the things you say
Playin' with my heart so I can run away
All the things you did, all the things you said to me
Said to me, said
Now I'm lonely in my bed

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: INNA]
All the things you do, all the things you say
Playin' with my heart so I can run away
All the things you did, all the things you said to me
Said to me, said
Now I'm lonely in my bed

[Verse 1]
Are we really sure
That a love that lasted for so long
Still endures?
Do I, really care?
Hey hey
Let's talk about the distractions going on elsewhere

[Chorus]
I, keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why? I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark
Oh, in the dark, woo

[Verse 2]
My mind drifts now and then
Looking down dark corridors and wonders what might have been
Something's up ahead
Hey, should I keep this same direction
Or go back instead?

[Chorus]
I, I keep hearing footsteps baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why? I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark
Oh, in the dark, hoo

[Bridge]
Honey, let's stop walking around
When there's love lost to be found
Oh, and you Know I still care, I still care
What's the sense of going elsewhere?

[Verse 3]
Who feels, really sure?
Can that feeling guarantee your happiness shall endure?
Do we really care?
Hey hey
Let's look at what's been happening and try to be more aware

[Chorus]
I, I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark, ay, in the dark
Why? I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark
Oh, in the dark, hoo

[Outro]
Hey hey, let's stop walking around
Well, when there's love lost, lost to be found
Oh honey, you Know I still care, I still care
What's the sense of going, going elsewhere?
Oh honey, let's stop walking around, and around, and around
When there's no love to be found
Hey baby, you Know I still care, I still care
What's the sense of going, going elsewhere?

[Intro]
Um, I moved to Hollywood recently from Boston, where I grew up, and I heard about these wild Hollywood party nights that people would have
I didn't think they were true until I moved to Hollywood and I started having them
This a song about a crazy night I had a couple of months ago. It's called "What Did I Do Last Night?"

[Verse]
Yeah
(Yeah, yeah)
What the fuck did I do last night?
I cried myself to sleep

[Skit 1]
It was a good one
I like the word poop, sorry
Yeah, we're getting edgy
I like the word poop, because when you say the word 'poop'
Your mouth makes the same motion your butthole does when it poops
Poop
Not my best, probably my worst

[Skit 2]
When did my mother first describe gay sex to me?
Good question, I was 8 years old
I have a joke for that
I was 8 years old
She sat me down at the dinner table, she was very mature about it
She said, "Do you know your father and I love each other?"
I said, "Of course. You and dad love each other more than 2 people in the world, could possibly love each other."
She said, "Well two men can love each other in the exact same way that your father and I love each other."
Yeah, she said, "What happens when two men love each other like that?
What they do is they take off their clothes...
They get in the bed...
And they SHIT ON THE BIBLE!"

[Outro]
So I don't really talk to her anymore
Where you are seems to be as far as an eternity
Outstretched arms, open hearts
And if it never ends, then when do we start?

I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back, I have something to say

How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I
Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart

I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
And I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back, I have something to say

How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack

How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel...
The sun is slowly fadin' in the western sky
Sometimes it takes forever for the day to end
Sometimes it takes a lifetime
Sometimes I think I'll never see the sun again

There's a heavy smog between me and my mountains
It's enough to make a grown man sit and cry
It's enough to make you wonder
It's enough to make the world roll up and die

I think it's kind of interesting the way things get to be
The way that people work with their machines
Serenity's a long time comin' to me
The fact I don't believe I know what it means

In the east a shaded moon is hangin' lazily
I do believe I saw the old man smile
I do believe I did
I do believe he's been laughin' all the while

I think it's kind of interesting the way things get to be
The way that people work with their machines
Serenity's a long time comin' to me
The fact I don't believe I know what it means any more
When the sun is slowly fadin' in the western sky
Sometimes it takes forever the day to end
Sometimes it takes a lifetime
Sometimes I think I'll never see the sun again
Sun again
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church
Where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream

Waits at the window
Wearing a face that she keeps
In a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people!
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people!
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon
That no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night
When there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people!
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people!
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried
Along with her name
Nobody came

Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands
As he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people!
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people!
Where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
So my name is Endorphin
I can make you happy you see
I come from planet Venus and I'll take you there
You could be my ecstasy
The '80s are over and the time has come
For a new proclamation of love and fun
Monogamy and trust, is what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'll give up all my lovers if you can make me shout, Oh

S is for scandalous
E is for exciting
X is for adults only
Let's do something frightening

Sex, sex, can't stop the feelin' baby, nobody should
Sex, sex, anything this dangerous, has to be good

Now I'm the type of alien
Who knows just what he wants
But U're the type who plays in the trees
You got it, maybe that's why you float
I climb a thousand trees if I have to
But baby I'm warnin' you
One of us is gonna end up on our knees
Sex, sex, can't stop the feelin' baby, nobody should
Sex, sex, anything this dangerous, has to be good

Good, good

Just has to be sex
Sex

(Get up) on the chair baby, let me dance under your skirt (get up)
Everybody on the dance floor now
Get up, on the table now, let me show you how to flirt (get up)

I like it baby, when you let me touch you there
I like it, girl, I knew you wasn't wearin' any underwear

Baby, is it wrong, that I want you so
I want you baby
I want you now

S.E.X

Sex, sex, can't stop the feelin' baby, nobody should
Sex, sex, anything this dangerous, has to be good

Just has to be good
Fellas - all the boys that know 'bout the good thing, say yeah yeah
And all the girls with no underwear on say yes (yes)
We're gettin' funky tonight
Sex
Yo, pick this up
Fellas, I want everybody sayin'it on the one, come on: "S.E.X."
Say it S.E.X. come on S.E.X. say it S.E.X
Keep that goin', Fellas
Come on (S.E.X.) yeah (S.E.X.) come on (S.E.X.)
Ladies (S.E.X.), back'em up (S.E.X.), one time: "is the best"
Come on (is the best, is the best, is the best)
One lover: sex (I don't think U heard me)
One lover: sex (yeah)
Two lovers: death (quit it)
Two lovers: death

So my name is Endorphin, I can make you happy you see
I come from planet Venus and I'll take you there
You can be my ecstasy

Now's the time for you to rock the nation with love and fun
Do the nasty with one love, but only one

Oh Sex

[Verse 1]
Hush my baby, Don't you cry
I'll dry your eyes. Fulfill your heart's desire
Let's go in. Try again
Careful this time. Broken promises linger in our mind

I'll give in completely. Hearts break so easy
I know. Believe me. Oh, I've tried
But my arms can hold you. My kiss console you
I'll come and love you tonight

[Chorus]
And I...
I love, I love, I love
Love hurts sometimes
But this feels right

You...
You love, you love, you love
Though you've been burned
You still return

[Verse 2]
Come and share my house, my home, and all I own
I'd love to give to you
Aren't you tired of going along this lonely road?
It takes its toll on you

Give me your emotion, your heart's devotion
Give anything you like
And I'll give understanding. Life's so demanding
I'm all you need to get by

[Chorus]
And I...
I love, I love, I love
Love hurts sometimes
But this feels right

And You...
You love, you love, you love
Though you've been burned
You still return

I love, I love, I love
Love hurts sometimes
But this feels right
And You...
You love you love you love
Though you've been burned
You still return

Still return
Still return to love (Oh)
Keep coming back to love (Ah oh)
One or two moments
A piece of your time
Is all I am asking
And I'll give you mine
One or two moments
Out of all you have got
To show how I love you
Believe it or not
Remember the day
I rolled into town
With my heart in my shoes
My head hanging down?
Now my only trouble
The rest I forgot
Is to show how I love you
Believe it or not
Done time in the lockup
Done time in the street
Done time on the upswing
And time in defeat
I know what I'm asking
And I know it's a lot
When I say that I love you
Believe it or not
I know I'm no angel
My prospects are high
As the flood line in summer
When the river's gone dry
But I'll roll up my shirt-sleeves
And make my best shot
To show how I love you
Believe it or not
Right now while the sun shines
On the crest of the hill
With a breeze in the pines
And a gray whippoorwill
Making music together
In a land time forgot
Let me show how I love you
Believe it or not
You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you preach
Screw my brain till it hurts
You've taken all my money
And you want more

Misguided old mule with your pig headed rules
With your narrow minded cronies
Who are fools of the first division

[Chorus]
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You've never had a heart, of your own

Kill joy, bad guy, big talking, small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me?
Can you face me?
But now you can kiss
My ass goodbye!
Feel good, are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide?
(I think you should)
Is your conscience all right
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good feel good?

You talk like a big business tycoon
You're just a hot air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
You're just an overgrown schoolboy
Let me tan your hide

A dog with disease
You're the king of the 'sleaze'
Put your money where your mouth is
Mister know-all
Was the fin on your back
Part of the deal? (shark)

[Chorus}
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You've never had a heart (you never did) of your own
(right from the start)
Insane, you should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Then make yourself null and void
Make me feel good
I FEEL GOOD!
He made his way to the border
In the shadow, under the trees
Down by a stream, in a hollow
Turn your head, feel the breeze

And the Red Queen was waiting for the news
For the White King to move
And the balance hung upon the head of one who tried
To stay within the shadows
And keep his undercover secret tight

They let him in by a backway
Into a chamber reserved for the Queen
She took the note that he gave her
Opened it slowly and started to read

Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold
Give it to the pawn who came, she cried
He says the White King thinks the game of chess is wrong
And all the courtiers crowded her
And this is what she told the gathered round
Go to the store by the dungeon
Take all the red paint, take all the white
Make up a newborn colour
Cover your neighbor, we'll be alright

There will be no game today, she cried across the board
Every day will be a holiday
And all the pieces cheered as tidings spread abroad
And the Pink Queen sat
And smiled at the cat, who smiled back
Take it as it comes girl
You gotta understand
Take it on the run girl
The world's at your command, Oh
I know it's a difficult thing
When the one you love makes you cry
I know if the phone doesn't ring
It is keeping you waiting every night
So take it as it comes, girl
Don't let him bring you down, yeah
Keep your motor runnin'
You know you own this town, yeah
Sometimes it's easy to worry
When love is in the lost and found
Take it as it comes, girl
Whoa, you'll make it through no doubt
It'll all come around
Yeah, yeah. Oh no. Take it baby
I know it's a difficult thing
When the one you love says goodbye
Seems like the world's always changing
Gotta learn how to take it all in your stride
So take it as it comes, girl
You gotta try again, yeah
Let me be the one, girl
I'll help you over him, yeah
Sometimes it's easy to worry
There's nothing to worry about
Take it as it comes, girl
Yeah, we'll make it through no doubt
It'll all come around
Take my hand. Whoa, yeah
It should all come around
Take it as it comes, girl
You gotta try again, yeah
Let me be the one girl
I'll help you over him
There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees half forlorn
And there on a sunny morning
Little Jimmy Brown was born

All the chapel bells were ringing
In the little valley town
And the songs that they were singing
Were for baby Jimmy Brown

Then the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
Bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love

There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there, twenty years thereafter
Jimmy was to meet his love
All the chapel bells were ringing
Was a great day in his life
'Cause the songs that they were singing
Were for Jimmy and his wife

Then the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
Bless, oh Lord, this celebration
May their lives be filled with love

From the village hidden deep in the valley
One rainy morning, dark and gray
A soul winged its way to heaven
Jimmy Brown had passed away

Just a lonely bell was ringing
In the little valley town
T'was farewell that it was singing
To our good old Jimmy Brown

And the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
May his soul find the salvation
Of thy great eternal love
Intro - R. Kelly + (Nick Cannon)]

[Chorus - R. Kelly]
I'm a gigolo, spending lot's a dough

And how I'm shining, wit the fresh, fresh clothes
Always surrounded, by so many (HO!)

Drop in the Six, 'cause I love them (HO!)

Ma I'm busy on tour, ma, you busy on the floor

But like my favorite records, keep spinning them thangs
Let my hair grow, cause I was looking for a change
Shorty call me the Scare Crow, I'm looking for some brain
In "The Wiz", there it go, here it is, where the show
Cause through yo dress, I can see yo drawls
So shorty just shake it, make a round of applause

And when we parking lot pimping, they surrounding the car

And the way you wear ya jeans, is means to cuss

[Intro: Shawn Stockman]
Hey, you know, sometimes things happen
And when it happens, you gotta deal with the consequences
(The Remedy)

[Verse 1: Wanya Morris, Boyz II Men]
Why in the hell does this keep happening to me
Every time I find someone and think I can be happy?
I'm blind, no (Maybe this time but no)
Oh, it's like just in a matter of weeks, we go from A to Z
And I go from knowing to wondering, then she

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya Morris, Boyz II Men]
(Then she comes along and writes another song)
That changes the one I used to sing, oh
(The song's so beautiful, it can't be wrong)
But if I take this step, it'll change everything
And I'm about to lose it

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
If I can get you to think just like me, we could be happy
(My heart's on the brink, it's not what you think it could be)
If I could get you to think just like me, it would be cool
(And then the love would be everything it should be, oh oh)

[Verse 2: Nathan Morris, Boyz II Men]
I feel this girl shouldn't be on my mind
But she does all the right things
At the wrong damn times
(I should just try it, but no)
I think about crossing that line
I mean, I've been accused so many times for that crime
(I might as well have)

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Morris, Boyz II Men]
But if I did it I would admit it
'Cause it's the path my heart will lead me to
I'm so afraid of what would become of my world
And it's the reason why I stand here so confused
And I'm about to lose it

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Nathan Morris]
If I can get you to think just like me, we could be happy
(Just like me, oh)
My heart's on the brink, it's not what you think it could be
(Not what you think it could be, oh)
If I can get you to think just like me, it would be cool
(If I could get you to think, baby)
And then the love would be everything that it should be

[Verse 3: Shawn Stockman]
Listen, baby, this is hard for me
Don't wanna change what we worked so hard to be
But if you must know the truth, I love both of you
And neither one I want to leave, so please
I know it seems unfair (Baby, don't go)
I know you think that I don't care (Baby, don't go)
I know these feelings I don't share
But it wouldn't be the same if we both wasn't here, yeah

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
If I can get you to think just like me, we could be happy
My heart's on the brink, it's not what you think it could be
If I can get you to think just like me, it would be cool
And then the love would be everything that it should be
If I can get you to think just like me, we could be happy
Ooh, ooh, ooh
If I can get you to think just like me, it would be cool
And then the love would be everything that it should be

[Outro: Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman]
Oh oh oh, la da da da
If I could get you to think, baby
And all we need is understanding to prevail
If my words did glow
With the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played
On the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice
Come through the music?
Would you hold it near
As it were your own?
There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go, no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
It's a hand-me-down
The thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall, you fall alone
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home
I keep laughing
Through the tears I cry
No way life is getting to me
We're all out there
Gotta live and die
No one's above it
May as well love it

Face the music
This is your time to dance
Let your life roll on
When they hit you
Just get up
And go another round

Oh baby, don't you know
I know the lowdown
Everything that's going up
Must go down
Speed it up or slow down
Life's a merry-go-round
Ride it high
'Cause we all hit the ground
I had money
And it all slipped away
Guess I didn't really, really need it
I can make it
Living day to day
Don't look for answers
Follow the dancers

Face the music
'Cause they're playing your tune
Let the night roll on
Take it from me
'Cause I've been the long
Long way around

Oh baby, don't you know
I know the lowdown
Everything that's going up
Must go down
Speed it up or slow down
Life's a merry-go-round
Ride it high
'Cause we all hit the ground

[Verse 1]
Mother, mother, there's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today, yeah
Father, father, we don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today, oh

[Chorus]
Picket lines (Sister) and picket signs (Sister)
Don't punish me (Sister) with brutality (Sister)
Talk to me (Sister), so you can see (Sister)
Oh, what's going on (What's going on)
What's going on (What's going on)
Yeah, what's going on (What's going on)
Ah, what's going on (What's going on)

[Post-Chorus]
In the meantime, right on, baby
Right on, baby, woo
I yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi
Woo, right on, baby, right on, right on
I yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi
A-doo-bi-doo, bip-bip-bid-doo (Bip-bip-bid-doo)
A-doo-bip-bip-bid-doo, bip-bip-bip-bip-bid-doo

[Verse 2]
Mother, mother, everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply 'cause our hair is long
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Picket lines (Brother) and picket signs (Brother)
Don't punish me (Brother) with brutality (Brother)
C'mon, talk to me (Brother), so you can see (Brother)
What's going on (What's going on)
Yeah, what's going on (What's going on)
Tell me, what's going on (What's going on)
I'll tell you what's going on (What's going on)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, hoo, hoo hoo hoo
Right on, right on, baby, right on, right on
I yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi
Woo, woo, right on, baby, right on
I yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi
A-doo-bi-doo, bip-bip-bid-doo
A-doo-bip-bip-bid-doo, bip-bip-bip-bip-bip-bip-bid-doo

[Outro]
Woo, right on, brother, right on
I yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi...
*chatter*
It won't be long
All of God's children must learn 2 love
It won't be long (I said it won't be long)
Before the Second Coming, yeah
It won't be long, no, it won't be long

How many more good men must die before there's gun control
U've got 2 love your brother if U want 2 free your soul (Soul, soul, soul)

It won't be long (It won't be long)
All of God's, all of God's children must learn 2 love
Sweetest little fellow, everybody knows;
Don't know what to call him but he's mighty like a rose!
Lookin' at his mammy with eyes so shiny blue
Makes you think that heaven is comin' close to you
When he's there a-sleepin' in his little place
Think I see the angels looking thro' the lace
When the dark is falling, when the shadows creep
Then they come on tip-toe to kiss him in his sleep
Sweetest little fellow, everybody knows
Don't know what to call him but he's mighty like a rose!
Lookin' at his mammy with eyes so shiny blue
Makes you think that heaven is comin' close to you

[Intro: T-Pain & Pitbull]
It's not you
T-Pain, Mr. Worldwide
Not you
It's not you, woah
Not you

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I know I be, all up in these clubs
Playin' with these girls, travelin' around the world
I know I be, messin with your feelings
Money to the ceiling, it falls down to the floor
I know I be, fist pump, fist pump
Fist pumpin' like a champ
The music got me amped, I'm catchin' leg cramps
I know I be, messin' us up, and that's all that I do
So if we break up
I can tell you it's not you

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Not you, it's not you
Not you, it's me
And I know I be trippin'
But I need you to listen, it's not you
Not you, it's not you
Not you, it's me
Even though I'm messin' up
I can't stay out of this club, it's not you

[Chorus x2: Pitbull & T-Pain]
Baby it's not you it's me
It's not you it's me
Baby it's not you it's me
It's the dog in me (It's not you)

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
I know we be, kissin' all in public
And girl I love it, can't get enough of it
But girl lately, you been talkin' down
Keep me with a frown, I can't keep you around
I know I be, fist pump, fist pump
Fist pumpin' like a pro
Girl you already know, you've seen me do this before
I know I be, messin' us up, but you can't tell me what to do
So if we break up
I can tell you it's not you

[Chorus x2: T-Pain]
Not you, it's not you
Not you, it's me
And I know I be trippin'
But I need you to listen, it's not you
Not you, it's not you
Not you, it's me
Even though I'm messin' up
I can't stay out of this club, it's not you

[Chorus x2: Pitbull]
Baby it's not you it's me
It's not you it's me
Baby it's not you it's me
It's the dog in me

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
They slip, I grip, she dip, I dip
I hit, no text, no twitter
That girls so bad, that thing so thick
And Pain, you can bet I get her
Even the girls wanna hit her
So you know Imma take one with us
More for Voli, pour it like water
For 'sho fill the club like New Orleans
She this, she that, her ass so fat
And her kitty cat's down for a doggin'
Mira mamita ¿verdad que tu 'tas linda?
Rica y bonita
Pero la verdad que yo quiero tu amiguita
It's not you, it's me; I'm sorry, dale!

[Bridge: T-Pain]
So if we break up
I can tell you it's not you

[Chorus x2: T-Pain]
Not you, it's not you
Not you, it's me
And I know I be trippin'
But I need you to listen, it's not you
Not you, it's not you
Not you, it's me
Even though I'm messin' up
I can't stay out of this club, it's not you
Down through the city their fancy cars are such a sight to see
At first look your rich friends that took you innocently
That now they finally called you home to me
Papers told about you lost your life
Of the party and the famous crash that night
Racing on the highway that turns nobody saint
Now you're driving in that long black limousine
Your letter I read early this morning baby
And I read every word you had to say
Your letter I read early this morning baby
And I read every word you had to say
But if you love me like you say you do baby
I wanna know why in the world did you go away?

Your letter said that you're doing ok baby
But then I read: "Please, let me come back home."
Your letter read that you're doing ok now baby
And then you said: "Please, let me come back home"
You said you were so tired, so tired baby
And you would have someone you could call your own

Yes, my memory don't fail me baby
You know I'll remember the day you left
Yeah, my memory don't fail me baby
You know I'll remember the day you left
You know you said baby: "I believe you now baby."
That you were grown and you've been taking care yourself
Oh, and here is my answer to you letter baby
And the words come straight from my heart
Oh, here is the answer to you letter baby
And the words come straight from my heart
Yes, I loved you then I can still love you now baby
But I'm afraid to play the bar
See, see rider, see what you have done
Lord, Lord, Lord, see, see rider, see what you have done
You made me love you, now your man have come
I'm gonna buy me a shotgun, long as I am tall
Lord, Lord, Lord, buy me a shotgun, long as I am tall
Gonna shoot my baby and catch that cannonball

I'm goin' away, baby, won't be back till fall
Lord, Lord, Lord, goin' away, baby, won't be back till fall
If I find me a good gal, won't be back at all

Yes, see, see rider, see what you have done
Lord, Lord, see, see rider, see what you have done
Well, you made me love you, now your man have come

[Chorus: JS, Ronald Isley]
You're my special (Oh), gift (Yeah)
I have searched everywhere, nothing else can compare (Oh), gift (Oh)
You're my special (Well, well, well), gift (No)
I have searched everywhere, nothing else can compare (Ooh baby), gift (Woo)

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley, JS]
As the lights on the tree set the mood on Christmas Eve
(I'm anticipating) Oh girl, you know, got me waiting
Wrapped in such a pretty bow, what's inside, I gotta know
I can hardly sleep, baby 'cause I know that's something there for me

[Chorus: JS, Ronald Isley]
You're my special (Oh, you're so special), gift (Oh, oh)
I have searched everywhere nothing else can compare
(Every, every, every), gift (Everywhere)
You're my special (Oh, you're special), gift (I know)
I have searched everywhere nothing else can compare (Nothing), gift (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley, JS]
I hear sleigh bells ringing, in the streets everybody's singing
(Sharing the love, sharing the joy) Well, well, well
(If they only knew) What I'm dreaming of
As I look under the tree, I know there's something there for me
Girl, I need it, gotta have it, you know I want it, babe

[Bridge: Ronald Isley]
As I sit here by the fire (Oh, I know)
I know that you're my heart's desire (Oh)
And the very thought of you, girl (Oh, you know)
Seems to make my dreams come true (Oh)
Every night and day I wait (Well, well, well)
Hoping soon I'll see your face
Girl, I want you, baby, oh, I need you, babe
Ooh, gotta have you, babe

[Outro: JS, Ronald Isley]
You're my special (Oh, you're special, girl), gift
(Oh, I'm glad you gave it to me, baby)
I have searched everywhere nothing else can compare
(You know, oh, I don't need to search no more, girl), gift
You're my special, gift (Ooh, you got it, baby)
I have searched everywhere nothing else can compare
(Thank you from me, baby), gift
(Lay down under the tree, baby)
You're my special (Oh, you're so special), gift (Oh)
I have searched everywhere nothing else can compare
(Got what I want, got what I need), gift (Got what I need)
You're my special (Yeah), gift
(I know you know, I know)
I have searched everywhere nothing else can compare (Ooh-ooh, baby), gift
(Baby, baby, baby)
You're my special (Well), gift (Oh)
I have searched everywhere nothing else can compare
(See, I've been all over the world), gift

Real sharp on my thing like a razor
Blade come clean like a shape up

But errybody gotta feel the need to say summin
But can't speak up whenever you face em
Thats what I call microphone gangstas
Yea I got em over do'd(?)
Yea I'm raw you know my flow
Cuz b.o.b be actin hard like a Viagra overdose
Talkin that noise on all dem songs
A buncha lil boys and ya don't look grown

But it really don't matta cuz they all just clones
Gotta school, do the work, be a lawyer
Hell yeah I'm all for the cause
Don't wanna get involved with tha law sir
But a nigga still got the moss burgs
And that just fell on tha track and the song (?)
Don't get it wrong this track is my own
Cuz niggas that slip they don't last long
(Chorus)

(Verse 2:)
Hey what it live, breath homie
Me, I'm doin what I always do
Grindin if you wasn't steady hatin you'd be ballin too

All the rich niggas is on our crew
Fuck it, they can't touch us
If stuck-up's what ya call it cool
Ooh, You shoulda seen when I came down in that
Black on Black
Gata hataz face down on the mat

Quick, fast, flash like tin cash on this bitch's tag

(Verse 3:)
You can tell I'ma G from a walk in the stands
Don't care bout the game make em talk in the stands
Watch how you talk when you talk to the man
If it ain't about bread you can talk to da hand
I,I, Show you how to get rich
The game we on, I'll show you how to pitch
Made a play with a hit(?)
And told the police I don't know bout shit
Ay guy, I'm fly, summin like tha air

Homey hold it right there
Home boy hold it down
Spit five at the mall and had them hataz goin dowwwnnnn

[Verse 1]
I wish there was another year, another time
When people sang and poems rhymed
Mmm, my name could be Napoleon

[Verse 2]
A thousand ships, a windy sail
So huge and high, it's tall enough to touch the sky
It's beautiful, but hard to find
But I just wasn't born in time

[Chorus]
Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end

[Verse 3]
I can dream of growing trees
And things that live and grass that's green
In meadows that have never been
But I still place my trust in the Queen

[Verse 4]
(Oh, tell me)
What is life when a man is pressured
Based on wrong or right?
And I don't know what it means
There must be more we haven't seen

[Chorus]
Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end

[Chorus]
Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end

[Chorus]
Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end
Angel come on down from heaven yesterday
Stayed with me just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the love between the moon and the deep blue sea

Then she spread her wings high above me
And she said she gonna come back tomorrow

And I said
Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on, my sweet angel
Tomorrow I will be right by your side

Sure enough, this woman came home to me
Silver wings silhouette against a child's own prize
Oh angel, she said unto me
Today is the day for you to rise

Take my hand, take my hand
You're gonna rise
And then, she took me high over yonder
And I said
Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on, my sweet angel
Forever I will be right by your side

[Verse 1:]
In the still of a moment; my voice can be heard
So listen carefully, there music inside each word

So, take upon my yoke learn of me, I'll be your guiding light

I speak peace unto the storms; even the winds obey Me

Hearken unto my voice, I'll declare, I'll draw near

So, let Me be your song, you'll never have to walk alone

I used to do it for the love a long time ago
And all I ever wanted was love
I used to love without fear a long time ago
And all I ever wanted was love
Then somebody came around and tried to hurt me
Tried to make me feel like I was unworthy
Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty
Truth was they never did deserve me
No!

Chorus:
I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is…

Couldn't tell me I was loved when I needed it
When, all I ever wanted was love
Shoulda told me just because
I'm worth receiving it
But all I ever wanted was love
There's something awesome about the selflessness it
Takes to
Give love and the good that it makes you
True love can never really forsake you
But it took a little while just for me to see
Chorus:
I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is…

I had a paralyzing fear of facing failure
And I couldn't love you perfectly with fear in my head
So I perilously had to face the danger
So I could come back and love you whole instead
All of your soul I said
So I could love you better

Chorus:
I had to lose myself so I could love you better

I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is…
B-Sec:
And so it goes that I never meant to hurt you
Couldn't stay but I never meant to desert you
Whole lot a things I just had to work through
Time to heal and restore my self-worth too
Confrontation of my fears and anxiety
Cried a whole lot years, I suffered quietly
And though it may have taken years I can finally
Tell you that you were always on my mind

Chorus:
I had to lose myself so I could make it better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Make it better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could make it better
Had to lose myself in love
And that was just the way!

Bridge:
Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the misuse I did
Hey baby it's not an excuse I give
And I'd do it all again because for you I live

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the abuse I did
Hey baby it's not an excuse I give
And I'd do it all again because for you I live
Chorus:
I had to lose myself so I could make it better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Make it better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could make it better
Had to lose myself in love
And that was just the way!
And that was just the way it is
Go all the way, yeah, baby
Don't you get turned around

Would you believe

My love (My love, my love)
My love is like a vacuum cleaner
Would you believe

Pullin', pullin', it keeps pullin'
Pullin', pullin', it keeps pullin'

[Outro: Ronald Isley, The Isley Brothers]

Oh, I have slipped the surly bonds of earth
And danced the sky on laughter silvered wings
Sunward I've climbed and joined the tumbling mirth
Of sun-split clouds and done a hundred things
I've wheeled and soared and swung high in the sunlit silence
Hovering there I've chased the shouting winds aloft
And flung my eager craft through footless halls of air

The higher we fly, the farther we go
The closer we are to each other
The darker the night, the brighter the star
In peace go my sisters and brother

Up, up, the long delirious burning blue
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
Where never lark nor even eagle flew
And while with silent lifting mind I trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space
Put out my hand and touched the face of God

The higher we fly, the farther we go
The closer we are to each other
The darker the night, the brighter the star
In peace go my sisters and brother

Everything waits to be noticed
A tree falls with no one there
The full potential of a love affair
Everything waits to be noticed

Twenty-eight geese in sudden flight
The last star on the edge of the night
A single button come undone
The middle child, the prodigal son
Everything waits to be noticed
A trickle underneath a dam
The missing line from the telegram
Everything waits to be noticed

The whispering pains that say you're living
The slow burn of not forgiving
The quiet room, the unlikely pair
The full potential of a love affair

Everything waits to be noticed
Longing for braver days
Cautiously turning a phrase
Going unnoticed

But everything waits to be noticed
The changing light in the upper air
The full potential of a love affair
Everything waits to be noticed
Every Sunday morning before daybreak
Down upon the farm, on the fishpond
All the little ducks, they go paddling
Look out goldfish, you're for breakfast

Sunday morning, hear the churchbells ringing
High up in the trees the birds were singing
In the dewey grass spiders spinning
Rooster calls and cocks his doodle

All around the farm animals stirring
Through the morning mist the bulls are beefing
In the grassy meadows cows are munching
Daisy Bell, it's time for milking

There's such a lot to be done on the farm
In the sunshine, and when it's lunchtime
It's hop down the pub for a pint
Back on the tractor to finish the plowing

Standing all alone, Fred the scarecrow
Hasn't got a clue how the wheat grows
Doesn't mind the rain, hates the cold though
Specially when those icewinds blow snow
All along the lane, bees are buzzing
Little furry things in hedgerows scurrying
In amongst the corn the bunnies are bouncing
Must have springs upon their feet

Behind the cowshed
The plowman is taking a peek
At the farmer's daughter
Who's hanging her undies in the sun

Better get on your boots and join us down on the farm
Better get on your boots and join us down on the farm
Better get on your boots and join us down on the farm
Better get on your boots and join us down on the farm
Better get on your boots and join us down on the farm
Better get on your boots and join us
Down here on the farm

It's a lovely day for country walking
The vicar's on his bike, Billy's skateboarding
Farmer and his dog out back shooting
Gun goes off and hits the tweeting

Lots of smelly stinks around the farmyard
Great big pile of shit behind the rhubarb
Sitting in his pram, baby bunting
Does a burp and starts his grunting
Give him a drink, he's gone pink
Wants his mummy, needs changing I think
Such a lot can be done on the farm
In the sunshinem, and when it's lunchtime
It's hop down the pub for a pint
Sneak out the backway with Nelly the barmaid
To the woods

Better get on your boots and join us down on the farm
Better get on your boots and join us down on the farm
Better get on your boots and join us down on the farm
Better get on your boots and join us down on the farm
Better get on your boots and join us down on the farm
Better get on your boots and join us down on the farm
Better get on your boots and join us down on the farm
Better get on your boots and join us down on the farm
Let me tell you people a low down thing or two
I just can't stand that old evil way she do
She gonna miss me, yeah, you're gonna miss me
You're gonna miss me baby, when I'm dead and gone

Came home this mornin', she wouldn't let me in
She said, "Go away baby, I got too many friends"
You're gonna miss me, yeah, you're gonna miss me
You're gonna miss me baby, when I'm dead and gone

Hard to love a woman when the woman don't love you
She'll treat you so low down 'n' dirty, 'till you won't know what to do
You're gonna miss me, hey, you're gonna miss me baby
You're gonna miss me woman, when I'm dead and gone

Well, bye-bye baby, I hope we meet again
You won't be so evil when you won't have too many men
You're gonna miss me baby, yeah, you're gonna miss me
Yeah, you're gonna miss me woman, when I'm dead and gone

[Chorus]
Could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl

When the day turns into the last day of all time
I can say, I hope that you are in these arms of mine (Oh yeah) (Beautiful)
When the night falls before that day I will cry
I will cry tears of joy cause after you all one can do is die (Oh yeah)

[Chorus]
Could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world (Beautiful)
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl (Beautiful)

[Verse 2]
How can I get through days when I can't get through hours
(Tick tock you don't stop, tick tock you don't stop)
I can try but when I do I see you and I'm devoured
Oh, yes
Who'd allow, who'd allow a face to be as soft as a flower (Oh yeah)
(Beautiful)
I could bow and feel proud in the light of this power
Oh Yeah (Beautiful)

And when the stars fall one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be too far behind
'Cause baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason to ever be shy
'Cause honey this kind of beauty is the kind that comes from inside

[Chorus]
Could you be (Could you be)
The most beautiful girl in the world
So beautiful, beautiful (Beautiful)

The most beautiful girl in the world
Hmm, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
You don't have to tell me you've gone to found someone new
'Cause I can feel his presence, whenever I'm-a kissing you
How can you ask me to try, try and understand
Well, just put yourself in my place
Go on, just see if you can
I'm-a begging you. (Don't, don't you let him)
Baby, please. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
I'm begging you, baby. (Don't, don't you let him)
Oh no. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
So what if he whispers how much he loves you in your ear
But pay no mind 'cause I love you much more my dear, huh
My love are like mountains
That's how strong it is for you
If you ever walk away in to his arms
Which will surely break my heart in two
I'm begging you. (Don't, don't you let him)
Oh no. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
Baby, baby, I'm begging. (Don't, don't you let him)
No, no, no, no. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
Oh, I couldn't stand it, baby
If you leave me for him you would truly be unfair
Now, just ask yourself, whenever you needed me, wasn't I always there
Now, I'm begging you, baby, baby, down on my bended knees
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, please stay here with me
Baby, please. (Don't, don't you let him)
Oh no. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
Baby, baby, please. (Don't, don't you let him)
I couldn't stand it. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
I ain't too proud to beg. (Don't, don't you let him)
And around and around and around
And around and around and around

All you have to do is trust me

N.E.R.D flow, i spaz if im prevoked
I'm about to change the fuckin game, pass the re-mote
Money is everythang, and its every other thing
I'm part of the choir, its the motto that my brotha sang
Cash is the right now, women are the post game
Money-over-bitches dot com check the domain
It's comin too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say yup, once in the blue moon
Oops I mean a red moon... I did it again to 'em
Let me leave a space in for your blood affiliation
I say, heavy metaphors, flow so over weight
I can rap around these other youngins like a cobra snake
Frost bite drizzy nigga, no body as cold as Drake
Keep yo ass in-line, don't be tryin to roller skate
Fuck all the discreet shit, I get on some deep shit
I am twenty-one tell me who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you can tell I'm real cause I'm getting hood lovin I ain't even talkin' street shit
Young angel, young lyin and I'm done tryin

It's on meee, everything is on meee
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin john B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listen back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet
This is for all the stripper cause I know that they gonna bump it tellem back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it
Ain't no pistols here, yo money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back and forth faxes
My money comin full circle, get up on my axis
Nebby Imma kill 'em, only cause I promised
They think I'm being cocky but I'm only being honest
I'm swallowin the goose, got a model gettin loose, and I never party unless I got some bottles and a booth
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this, I'm just having patience cause I want it to make sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit, drop a fo in it and appreciate the greatness.. Drizzy!
Wayne: Yeah, p-p-pass the dro. I am such a beast and you ask them hoes. And they might even say you should leave me alone
Homie scared. Cause they just like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy

And yes I'm falling but up I fall and if ya bitch in heat she can fuck my dog

Never sat on any benches, I got in games
Starter carter ball harder, ten girls penthouse suit ya'll order
Whatever ya'll please.. wine crackers and cheese

This supplement im on got me feeling mighty
My gun and money don't split call that shit Siamese
My watch make the frickin' time freeze
Yah girl bless me she suck my dick when I sneeze
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need

Whatchya know about it my niggas so about it
If we kill everybody they can't go to court about it
Weezy I ignore the liars, baby I ignite the fire, I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer
Got the shoty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me

I dont have a rivalry if so you will have a casualty, oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophy, oops I meant actually
You niggas is just ass to me, and big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying, or I hang ya on the wall like an art gallery
You got short salary, and I got long money, I got cash money, I got young money.. bitch...
Dj Drama: See I told ya'll it'd be well worth the wait right?

Wayne: Dedication threeee
I'm a cork on the ocean
Floating over the raging sea
How deep is the ocean?
How deep is the ocean?
I lost my way
Hey hey hey

I'm a rock in a landslide
Rolling over the mountainside
How deep is the valley?
How deep is the valley?
It kills my soul
Hey hey hey

I'm a leaf on a windy day
Pretty soon I'll be blown away
How long will the wind blow?
How long will the wind blow?
Ohhhh

Until I die
Until I die
These things I'll be untill I die
These things I'll be untill I die
These things I'll be untill I die

These things I'll be untill I die
These things I'll be untill I die
These things I'll be untill I die
These things I'll be untill I die
These things I'll be untill I die
These things I'll be untill I die
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead
Motherless children run a hard road, a hard road, a hard road
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead

Your father will do the best he can when your mother is dead
Your father will do the best he can when your mother is dead
Your father will do the best he can, but he just does not understand
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead

Now, there's some people say your sister might do when your mother is dead
Now, there's some people say your sister might do when your mother is dead
Some people say your sister will do; soon as she married, turn her back on you
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead

You can dig my grave with a bloody spade when I'm dead
You can dig my grave with a bloody spade when I'm dead
You can dig my grave with a bloody spade; see that my digger gets well paid
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead

Jesus won't be no mother to you when your mother is dead
Jesus won't be no mother to you when your mother is dead
Jesus won't be no mother to you; his trials and tribulations won't see you through
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead
It's not a symphony
Surely not a rhapsody
It's just a simple melody I wrote for you

Oh hear my lullaby of love (hear my lullaby of love)
Love that's crying out to you (crying out to you)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I had a price to pay (price to pay)
Ever since that awful day (awful day)
I got up and walked away from you sweetheart

Oh hear my lullaby of love (hear my lullaby of love)
Love that's tearing me apart (tearing me apart)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

La la la la la
Crying out to you
I can't go on like this
After haven't tasted bliss
With every warm and tender kiss you gave to me
Oh hear my lullaby of love (hear my lullaby of love)
Love that haunts my rebelry
Oh hear my lullaby of love (hear my lullaby of love)
Love that needs your symphony
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooooooh

[Verse 1]
Must I forgive you each time?
And say you don't know what you're doing
There are no victimless crimes I know of
Out here in these graffiti ruins, my love

[Chorus]
Oh I am not old, I'm told, but I am not young
Oh, and nothing can be done
Don't start, my heart is a smoking gun
Oh, and nothing can be done

[Refrain]
Nothing can be done
Nothing can be done
Nothing can be done

[Verse 2]
I heard you leaving late last night
I heard you screaming down the mountain
Like you were running red lights
You had some trashcan rock band pounding

[Chorus]
I am not old, I'm told, but I am not young
Oh, and nothing can be done
Don't start, my heart is a smoking gun
Oh, and nothing can be done

[Refrain]
Nothing can be done
Nothing can be done
Nothing can be done

[Verse 3]
Must I surrender with grace
The things I loved when I was younger?
Sweet embrace, must I remember your face so well?
What do I do here with this hunger?

[Chorus]
I am not old, I'm told, but I am not young
Oh, and nothing can be done
Don't start, my heart is a smoking gun
Oh, and nothing can be done

[Refrain]
Nothing can be done
Nothing can be done
Oh, nothing can be done

Hello, hello

Hello, hello, hello, girl
Hello, hello, oh
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, ooh

[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me, it's me, baby
I've thought about us for a long, long time
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong
Something's here that doesn't last too long
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine
I can't help it, baby
Seeing you, yeah, seeing anyone as much as I do you
I take for granted that you're always there
I take for granted that you just don't care
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through, baby
You know why, ah yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
It's important to me
That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change for me, babe

[Chorus]
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
No, I wouldn't change you, change you for the world
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
No, don't change, girl
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Stay as sweet as you are, baby
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
But one thing I want you to do is

[Verse 2]
Think of me, think of me, baby
You know I'd be with you if I could
Come around and see you once in a while
If you ever need a reason to smile
I'd spend the night if you think I should
Well

[Pre-Chorus]
It's important to me
That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change

[Bridge]
Don't change, baby
Oh, keep everything the same, baby
Stay as sweet as you are, baby
Girl, don't you move too far, girl
I'll come around, come around and see you every once in a while
If you ever need, ah, if you ever need a reason to smile, baby

[Outro]
Just don't change, girl
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Ah, oh
(Don't change, don't change)
Keep everything the same, baby
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Think about me, baby
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Keep your mind
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Keep your mind
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Don't change, baby
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, don't change
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Keep every, everything the same
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Stay as sweet as you are
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Sweet as you are
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
No, don't change
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Well, well, well, well, well
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
I wrote a new song
It sounds like one of your songs
It doesn't really matter
I could write a hundred new ones
But I could never make them sound
The way that you do

Everyone dies
It ain't nothing new
On a gloomy afternoon
Lizzy come back to life

Topless in your headdress
Laying by the pool
Cigarette perched on your upper lip
Lizzy how'd you get so cool?

Out on the porch
Drinking beer, skipping school
Listenin' to Mambo Nassau
On a gloomy afternoon
Lizzy come back to life
I wanna go back to New York
And hang out with Patti Smith
And Richard Hell
I wanna dig the African rhythms
I wanna be there when you write
"Where Are the Gazelles?"

One 'cause you're beautiful
One for your soul
One for the memories
And the melodies I stole

From here on out
Everything's ruined
I can't listen to anything new
It all sounds dull coming after you
Lizzy come back to life

Come back to life
Come back to life
Come back to life
Come back to life
Prince

I'll introduce U 2 a headache if U don't get out of my face!
OK baby, now check this out
We gonna walk ‘til the song's over
In other words, meet me at the bar in 32 measures, cool?
Cool
And if U're good, I'll let U work the stick in my ride, waa ha ha!

[Verse 1]
This old heart of mine, been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away, I think you're going to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that go
Bringing you back again (Bringing you back again)
Hurting me more and more (Hurting me more)

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe it's my mistake to show this love that I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by
You've got me never knowing if I'm coming or going

[Chorus]
I love you, yes I do
(This old heart of mine, darling, is weak for you)
Oh, I love you, yes I do
(Yes I do, yes I do)

[Verse 2]
These old arms of mine, miss having you around
Makes these tears inside, start falling down

[Pre-Chorus]
Always with half a kiss, you remind me of what I miss
(Remind me of what I miss, baby)
Though I try to control myself
Like a fool, I start grinnin', 'cause my head starts spinnin'

[Chorus]
I love you, yes I do
(This old heart of mine, darling, is weak for you)
Oh, I love you, yes I do
(Yes I do, yes I do)
I love you
(This old heart of mine, darling, is weak for you)
Oh, I love you, yes I do
(Yes I do, yes I do)

[Verse 3]
I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'
The way you're treating me, leaves me incomplete
You're here for the day, gone for the week

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you leave a hundred times, baby
Hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours, baby, whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it, tell the world about it

[Chorus]
I love you, yes I do
(This old heart of mine, darling, is weak for you)
Oh, I love you, yes I do
(Yes I do, yes I do)
This old heart of mine keeps you in my life
(This old heart of mine, darling, is weak for you)
Oh, I love you, yes I do
(Yes I do, yes I do)
Oh baby, yes I do

[Outro]
This old heart of mine, been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away, I think you're going to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that go
Bringing you back again, hurting me more
I just want to say, baby
I love you, yes I do
(This old heart of mine, darling, is weak for you)
Oh, I love you, yes I do
(Yes I do, yes I do)
This old of mine, been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away, I think you're going to stay
-All right. Stand by. Here we go. Blues My Naughty take seventy-four
-Oh, shit. I hope I don't screw up

Now there are blues that you get from happiness
There are blues that you get from pain
There're blues when you are lonely for your one and only
Blues that are hard to explain

And there are blues that you get from waitin'
But the meanest, the meanest blues that be
They're kind that I got on my mind
Blues there are all very meanest kind
Blues my naughty sweetie gives to me
Oh, yeah

Oh, they're blues you get from women when you see 'em goin' swimmin' and you haven't got a bathin' suit yourself
There are blues that start to flicker when you had a lot of liquor and someone goes and takes it off the shelf
There are blues you get from waitin' on the dock, and you wonderin' if your little boat is gonna rock
Blues you keep a gettin' in a taxicab a pettin' every time you hear the meter jump the clock

And there are blues you get from cryin' when your uncle Will is dyin' and he afterwards forgets you in his will
There are blues you get from kisses when you are walkin' with the missus and another baby shouts, "Hey, Bill!"
Blues that kinda make you hop and really shake and shiver, kinda make you want to end it all in the river
Blues my naughty sweetie gives to me
Oh, play that thing!
Now there are blues you get from women when you see 'em goin' swimmin' and you haven't got a bathin' suit your own self
There are blues that start to flicker when you had a lot of liquor and someone goes and takes it off the shelf
There are blues you get from waitin' on the dock, and you wonderin' if the boat's gonna rock
Blues you keep a gettin' in a taxicab a pettin' every time you hear the meter jump the clock

And there are blues you get from cryin' when your uncle Will is dyin' and he afterwards forgets you in his will
There are blues that get from kisses when you are walkin' with the missus and another baby shouts, "Hey, Patrick!!"
Blues that kinda make you hop and really shake and shiver, kinda make you want to end it all in the river
Blues my naughty sweetie gives to me
Let me hear it again
Oh, blues my naughty sweetie gives to me
Just one more time!
Blues my naughty sweetie gives to me

Yeah!
It all started in 1929 me and Diana had gone to Alaska
To homestead some of that free government land
Forty miles from the nearest gravel road we cut our life in the ponderosa pines
We sweated hard to beat the winter snow
But the cabin's up and we've got lots of times
What have you got planned tonight Diana would you consider laying in my arms
I love you more than ever now Diana I'm sure you're the reason I was born

Jim was born the first year we were here look at him Diana he's almost grown
And the baby's in the cradle fast asleep just think in no time they'll be up and gone
What have you got planned

Well time sure does fly by doesn't it Diana
It's been almost two years now since you've been gone
Think children grew up so fast
But I guess they deserve to see the world now don't they
But you know Diana remembering how you loved me
And how much I love you I don't feel so alone
What have you got planned
What have you got planned
"There must be some way out of here", cried the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion here, I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine, ploughmen dig my earth
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth

"No reason to get excited", the thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us, who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that, and it is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late

All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
Barefoot servants came and went, little children too
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl

[Verse 1]
I've made up my mind and what I'm gonna do
Take it or leave it boy, I'm leavin' you
You drove me outta' my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis
Instead of wastin' my time trying to make you feel good
I'm gonna see what kinda' life is up in front of my hood
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis

[Chorus]
I'm halfway gone but I'm halfway saved
A couple hundred miles from a brand new day
Halfway there is a damn good start from a worn out mind
To a healed-up heart
Thank God I'm finally comin' to my senses
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis

[Verse 2]
I can drive away far and I can run pretty fast
The plan for my future's puttin' you in my past
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis
So don't bother to call and don't bother to write
Cuz' freedom's just ahead in the beam of my lights
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis

[Chorus]
I'm halfway gone but I'm halfway saved
A couple hundred miles from a brand new day
Halfway there is a damn good start from a worn out mind
To a healed-up heart
Halfway gone but I'm halfway saved
A couple hundred miles from a brand new day
Halfway there is a damn good start from a worn out mind
To a healed-up heart
Thank God I'm finally comin' to my senses
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis

[Outro]
I've made up my mind and what I'm gonna do
You can take it or leave it boy, I'm leavin' you
I know you've been cheatin' on me baby
And I know you don't mean me no good
Oh I know you've been cheatin' on me, woman
And I know you don't mean me no good
That's why I blame myself
I didn't treat you like I should

Oh, I was too good to you baby
I gave you everything I own
Yes, I was too good to you woman
I gave you everything I own
That's why I blame myself
Every time you do me wrong

You got your eyes wide open woman
But you're travelling down the wrong road
Oh you got your eyes wide open baby
And you're travelling down the wrong road
Yes, a wine drinkin' and cheatin', woman
Is one thing I can't afford
It's waste of your time
If you want it to be
It's a run that you take
If you're never coming back

It's a shame that you can't
Get a part of this
It's a shame

It's a shame that you can't
Get a part of this
It's a shame

It's a waste of your time
If you want it to be
It's a run that you take
If you're never coming back

It's a shame that you can't
Get a part of this
It's a shame
Singing a song of ruin, I'd
Bet he says nothin' doin'
I'd call it suicide

If when she tries to run away
And he calls her back, she comes
If there's a next time, well, he's okay
Cause she's under both his thumbs
She limp along to his side
Singing a song of ruin, I'd
Now I guess he says nothin' doin'
I'd call it, call it, I'd call it suicide

If when she tries to run away
And he calls her back, she comes
If there's a next time, he's okay
Cause she's under both his thumbs
She limp along to his side
Singing a song of ruin, I'd
Bet he says nothin' doin'
I'd call it suicide
If when she tries to run away
And he calls her back, she comes
If there's a next time, he's okay
Cause she's under both his thumbs
She limp along to his side
Singing a song of ruin, I'd
Bet he says nothin' doin'
I'd call it suicide

Ruin, I'd, ruin, I'd
Suicide, suicide

[Chorus]
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
But I like to do it

[Verse 1]
Most girls I meet are quite savage
Always tryin' to grab up on my package
They say I look yummy and they want a taste
But I'm a human, not a sandwich
Sometimes I feel like LL Cool J
I need love not random booty
But every girl I try to get to know
Ends up tryin' to do me

[Chorus]
I said
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
But I like to do it

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I just wanna dance
Girl I know you like my style
But get your hand out my pants

[Bridge]
I am not a whore
(No no no)
I am not a whore
(I'm not your hoe)
I am not a whore
(I just love the music)
I am not a whore
(But I like to do it)

[Chorus]
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I got to know, Lord, when to pull back on the reins
Death can be the result of the most underrated pain
Satan whispers to ya, "Well, I don't want to bore ya
But when ya get tired of the Miss So-and-so I got another woman for ya."
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind
Lord, take away this trouble in mind
When the deeds that you do don't add up to zero
It's what's inside that counts, ask any war hero
You think you can hide but you're never alone
Ask Lot what he thought when his wife turned to stone
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind
Lord, take away this trouble in mind
Here comes Satan, prince of the power of the air
He's gonna make you a law unto yourself, gonna build a bird's nest in your hair
He's gonna deaden your conscience 'til you worship the work of your own hands
You'll be serving strangers in a strange, forsaken land
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind
Lord, take away this trouble in mind
Well, your true love has caught you where you don't belong
You say, "Baby, everybody's doing it so I guess it can't be wrong."
The truth is far from you, so you know you got to lie
Then you're all the time defending what you can never justify
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind
Lord, take away this trouble in mind
So many of my brothers, they still want to be the boss
They can't relate to the Lord's kingdom, they can't relate to the cross
They self-inflict punishment on their own broken lives
Put their faith in their possessions, in their jobs or their wives
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind
Lord, take away this trouble in mind
When my life is over, it'll be like a puff of smoke
How long must I suffer, Lord, how long must I be provoked?
Satan will give you a little taste, then he'll move in with rapid speed
Lord keep my blind side covered and see that I don't bleed

[Verse 1]
If you can keep your head while all about you
People are losing theirs and blaming you
If you can trust yourself when everybody doubts you
And make allowance for their doubting too

[Verse 2]
If you can wait and not get tired of waiting
And when lied about, stand tall, don't deal in lies
And when hated, don't give in to hating back
Don't need to look so good, don't need to talk too wise

[Refrain]
If

[Verse 3]
If you can dream and not make dreams your master
If you can think and not make intellect your game
If you can meet with triumph and disaster
And treat those two imposters just the same

[Refrain]
If

[Verse 4]
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve you after all of them are gone
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Nothing but the will that's telling you to hold on, hold on

[Refrain]
If

[Verse 5]
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted and misconstrued by some smug fool
Or watch your life's work torn apart and broken down
And still stoop to build again with worn-out tools

[Refrain]
If

[Verse 6]
If you can draw a crowd and keep your virtue
Or walk with kings and keep the common touch
If neither enemies nor loving friends can hurt you
If everybody counts with you but none too much

[Refrain]
If

[Verse 7]
If you can fill the journey of a minute
With sixty seconds worth of wonder and delight
Then the earth is yours and everything that's in it
But more than that, I know you'll be alright, you'll be alright

[Outro]
'Cause you've got the fight, you've got the insight
You've got the fight, you've got the insight
You've got the fight, you've got the insight
The things I once thought exciting
They've all grown tiresome and old
Here's a fool learned a lesson
Love is more precious than gold

You may give her furs and jewel
But they, they will only grow old
Here's a fool learned a lesson
Love is more precious than gold

I once made a decision in my life
A long, long, long time ago
I went for money instead of love
Now I'm so blue and it only goes to show

The things I once thought exciting
They've all grown tiresome and old
Here's a fool learned a lesson
Love, love, it's more precious than gold

You won't need no money
It's more precious than jewel
Get your hand on some loving
You won't need no money
It's more precious than gold
More precious, it's more precious than gold
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the weary land, the weary land
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the shelter in the time of storm
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the weary land, the weary land
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, he's the shelter in the time of storm
Sometimes I feel discouraged and speak my words in vain
But then the Holy Spirit revives my soul again
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the weary land, the weary land
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, he's the shelter in the time of storm
I know I've been converted, and Lord I ain't in a chain
'Cause is my Captain, and the angels done tie my hand
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the weary land, the weary land
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the shelter in the time of storm

Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the weary land, the weary land
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the shelter in the time of storm
I wanna go to heaven, Lord, I wanna go right
I know I gotta keep praying, gotta pray both day and night
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the weary land, the weary land
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the shelter in the time of storm
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the weary land, the weary land
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, he's the shelter in the time of storm
One day I'm up next day I'm down
I run from dusk to dawn
The paranoia seizes me
The nightmares carry on

I'm looking on the bright side
You're looking on the wrong side
You really don't know which side
A devious dream in my mind

But there is no way out and yes
The dye is casting thin
Between the line and razor edge
They crystalize the end

I'm looking on the dark side
You're looking on the outside
You'll never know what's inside
A face to erase what you find

I know what I'm doing
I'm feeling so fine now
Sorry I worried you
Thumbs up truly
I'm okay I thought today
I haven't had a drink for say
An age, and yes I'm feeling fit
A day in which I'm never sick
With both ends on the candle lit
There is no way out and
I can never be my friend
The enemy i fear is me
So where does it all end...
Well, the clock is strikin' twelve
Baby, somebody's gotta go
I said the clock is strikin' twelve
Baby, somebody's gotta go
Gee, but I know I'm gonna miss you, honey
That's one thing I know

When it's twelve o'clock in Memphis
It's one o'clock in San Antone
Twelve o'clock in Memphis, baby
One o'clock in San Antone
When it's midnight in California
Oh, I'll be so all alone

If midnight is an awful hour
Baby, why does it come so soon?
Midnight is an awful hour
Baby, why does it come so soon?
It never brings me happiness
Always leave me filled with gloom
Don't ever gamble, buddy
Unless you're sure that you can't lose
Hey, don't ever gamble, buddy
Unless you're sure that you can't lose
You better take my advice
Unless you want those midnight blues
Funny how we're all so blind
Love is gentle, love is kind in the nighttime
Funny we can be so sad
It doesn't have to be so bad in the daytime
You want to know, where do the songs all go in your lifetime?
One of these days we'll go and find out where they stay

Once upon a lover's song
There was a boy who sang along in the nighttime
Once upon a lover's dream
There was a tale of broken wings in the daytime
You want to know, where do the songs all go in your lifetime?
One of these days we'll go and find out where they stay

And I Know, love will come someday
And I Know, love will find a way
And I Know, love will come some way
And I Know, love will change your day
The songs that I bring, the songs that I sing yeah

Catch a piece of falling star
Try to keep it in a jar till the morning
Catch a summer firefly
Pray that it'll stay alive till the dawning'
You want to know, where do the songs all go in your lifetime?
One of these days we'll go and find out where they stay
And I Know, love will come someday
And I Know, love will find a way
And I Know, love will come some way
And I Know, love will change your day
The songs that I bring, the songs that I sing
Love will come some day

And I Know, love will find a way
And I Know, love will come some way
And I Know, love will change your day
And I Know, love will come some day
And I Know, love will find a way
And I Know, love will come some way
And I Know, love will change your day
And I Know
Ladies and gentlemen

[Verse 1: Wanya Morris, Boyz II Men]
She came to me like a thief in the night
And whispered in my ear
She had my undivided attention
And told me everything I wanted to hear
She said that she wanted to give me a gift
And that she'd give it to the rest of the world
And no matter how many people hear it
She would always be my girl
She makes me wanna say
(Oh, oh...la la la la la la la la la, oh oh oh oh)
Sometimes she's smooth, sometimes she's rough
And I love to see her rock
And sometimes she's a little alternative
But nowadays she's more hip-hop
No matter how you interpret her
She's always at the top of the charts
And if you look around and she can't be found
You can always find her deep in your heart
Music

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
I can't help myself, I love her, she's my everything
(Ooh, ooh, oh)
I won't ever be without her, she's the reason why I sing
I can't help myself I love her, what she does to me
(What she does, baby)
Makes me feel so good about her, music is my everything

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris, Boyz II Men]
Very rarely does she disappoint
She always says something good to me
Whoever wrote the words that come out of her mouth
They know just how to get to me
Well, she's my muse when I get sick to my stomach
When somebody disrespects
They don't value her opinion
They just use her for her sex
She's beautiful, sensual, and I love the way her body works
Sometimes she makes me happy
And sometimes her message hurts
(No, no, no matter what she says to me)
I'll always be around
Some will say she lost her way
But here is where she's found
Music

[Bridge: Boyz II Men]
When she was young and comin up
Nobody really knew where she would go
But now she's really opened up
And now the whole world can feel her
Don't you feel her?

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
I can't help myself, I love her, she's my everything
I won't ever be without her, she's the reason why I sing
I can't help myself I love her, what she does to me
Makes me feel so good about her, music is my everything

[Interlude: Boyz II Men]
La la la la la la la la la
(Let me talk to y'all for a second, man)
La la la la la
(I don't think you understand)
La la la la la la la la la
(This music, is everything)

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
I can't help myself, I love her, she's my everything
(Said I love her, oh yeah)
I won't ever be without her, she's the reason why I sing
(Oh, oh, I can't help)
I can't help myself I love her, what she does to me
(What she does, baby)
Makes me feel so good about her, music is my everything
Music is my everything, music is my ev

[Outro: Wanya Morris]
Now if you're booed up with your baby (Baby)
This is what you say (Say)
Say baby, don't go nowhere
And I promise I'll stay
Let me hear you say "What it do" (What it do)
Uh, say "What it do" (What it do)
Hey, say "What it do" (What it do)
Say "What it do" (What it do)
Hey, what the business is, y'all? (What the business is?)
Hey, what the business is, y'all? (What the business is?)
Hey, what the business is, y'all? (What the business is?)
Huh, what the business is? (What the business is?)
Everybody, put 'em together, come on
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Everybody now, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Come on, everybody say "What it do" (What it do)
Ayy, say "What it do" now (What it do)
There's a stillness in time
Which I cannot define
Does your heart bleed like mine?
(Oh does your heart, yeah)
For a place we can go
Where the troubles of our time are far away
(Hey they're so far awa-ay)
And I had all my life in front of me
Now my darkness days are trouble-free
There are so many wondrous things for you to see
If you find that something's going wrong
Look around at what you're running from
You can wait a thousand years in line
For that stillness in time
I found love in that way
And I'm never sad, and I'm always glad
Anything you give me today
I will be thankful for
People find it hard to be strong
'Cos they don't know where they're coming from
There was nothing left to do but hang on
For a stillness in time
(For a stillness in time
Search the spaces on my mind)
If this world is turning too fast for your head
Just remember how bad times can roll instead
Guess I'll have to search the spaces on my mind
For a stillness in time
You can wait a thousand years in line
For that stillness in time
I found love in that way
And I'm never sad, and I'm always glad
Anything you give me today
I will be thankful for
People find it hard to be strong
'Cos they don't know where they're coming from
There was nothing let to do but hang on
For a stillness in time
Hush little baby, don't you cry
You know your mother was born to die
All my trials, Lord, soon be over
Too late my brothers, too late
But never mind
All my trials, Lord soon be over

The river of Jordan is chilly and cold
It chills the body but it warms the soul
All my trials, Lord soon be over

I've got a little book with pages three
And every page spells liberty
All my trials Lord, soon be over
Too late my brothers, too late
But never mind
All my trials, Lord soon be over

If living were a thing that money could buy
You know the rich would live
And the poor would die
All my trials Lord, soon be over
There grows a tree in Paradise
The Christians call it the tree of life
All my trials Lord, soon be over
Too late my brothers, too late
But never mind
All my trials, Lord soon be over
I've been walking these streets so long
Singing the same old song
I know every crack and crevice out here in Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And white boys get washed down the drain
Like the snow and the rain
Took me years of compromising
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shining on me
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse
In a star spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers coming over the phone
Well I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're walking these streets so long out here in broadway
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked into my shoe
Took me years of compromising
To get to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shining on me
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers coming over the phone
Like a rhinestone cowboy
And offers coming over the phone

[Verse 1]
Don't you feel it growin' day by day?
People gettin' ready for the news, oh yeah
Some are happy, some are sad
We got to let the music play
Oh, yes we have

[Verse 2]
I said what the people need
Is a way to make 'em smile
It ain't hard to do if you know how, oh yeah
Gotta get a message, get it on through
A-mama's goin' to after a while, hey, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, listen to the music
Oh-oh, listen to the music
Oh-oh, listen to the music
(Oh-oh) All the time (Oh, oh)
Shoot me like I never knew, ooh (Woo)

[Verse 3]
Well, I know you know better
In everything you say
Meet me in the country for a day
(Meet me, meet me, come meet me, meet me)
We'll be happy and we'll dance
Oh, yes, we will
We're gonna dance our blues away
Come on, can you feel it?

[Verse 4]
If I'm feelin' good to you
And you're feelin' good to me
There ain't nothin' to do, nothin' to say, ah, yeah
We're just feeling good, we're just feeling fine
We're gonna let, let the music play, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, listen to the music (Hey, hey)
Oh-oh, listen to the music
Oh-oh, listen to the music
All the time (Oh-oh, oh, ah)
Oh, baby, let the record play, woo

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Everybody, oh-oh, listen to the music (Hey, hey)
Oh-oh, listen to the music
Oh-oh, listen to the music

[Outro]
Come on and listen
Somebody, clap your hands (Listen to the)
If you feel that you want to (To the music)
Stomp your feet (Listen to the)
If you feel that it makes you move (To the music)
It's alright (Listen to the)
If you feel that you wanna shout (To the music)
Come on (Listen to the)
Listen to the music (To the music)
In my hands (Listen to the)
In my soul (To the music)
In my body (Listen to the)
Come on (To the music)
Listen to the music (Listen to the)
Ha, ha (To the music)
Ha, I got to feel it (Listen to the)
Wanna move, yeah (To the music)
Can't stop movin' (Listen to the)
Come on (To the music)
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Ron "Riff Raff" Pinnick]
Hey Mike, what's up?
This is Ron, just asking to see what's happenin'
Uh just touchin' base, see how your Easter went
Umm, Just seein' if you gonna see Joe sometime soon too
Cuz he's got my keyboard that I've been trying to get back
I've been trying to call him, and he hasn't returned any messages
So I'm seeing what's the best angle to, uh get it back
What! Niggas can't fuck with us
Get at me dog. My niggas
That's my word!

(DMX)
I'ma cat that sit back and look at shit
'cause crooked shit gets me amped
And what you don't know, will get you rocked in Sleepaway Camp
Grand champ and raise more hell, than a Sorrel
See you at the peephole, bustin' at the doorbell
Though I wasn't coming without mine
You put me on the front line because you doubt mine
Bet your and lost yours, you come to get your I tossed yours
And it cost yours, fuck y'all niggas stupid, I'm the boss dog
What more dirt must I do, plus my crew
Busts at you, and you be like "What's that oooh"
Bust that Clue, do I bring the noise what
Destroy these mutts, is these niggas toys or what
Bring all the pretty niggas thinking they gritty, in one city
Lemme show them niggas shitty some pity, but for fifty
A motherfucker will get a bullet to hum to him, put the gun to him
Hit 'em with something that comes to him, bet it runs through him
Look at what I done to him, no more smiles
Got the whole top half of his head, running wild
But you don't hear me though, so I turn out the lights
We can take it to the streets dog, turn off the mics
If you want war, then you want more, than you can stand
And this 44, will leave you with your dick in the sand
Who the man, and now you cats know for real
Get at me dog, (bark), what the deal
(Styles P)
Y'all niggas fucking with the L.O.X
Your stuck on a rock
Got that Alcatraz flow
You just don't know
Lifetime kid caged in blazin'
Any type of rapper or federal agent
Paniro the made man, blade man
Stand up type of guy, your living a lie
Niggas wanna be pretty and fly but kiddies will die
The dogs run the city, bet fifty on mine
Two grams for you to sniff, how silly am I
Got a lot of jokes don't, kill yo ass won't I
Maybe not if the spot is filled up with po 9
Many niggas get it confused, blame the rules
Only ask the how's not the who's
Better off busting your tool, then we might get the crew
But as far as rap goes, you a motherfucking fool
If you don't want chips, you should have stayed in school
You and 8-ball nigga, you wanna play pool
I'll put you in the side pocket, look at the size of my rocket
Styles don't lie, cop the work then clock it
Boxes full of boots, jeans, suits and watches
Niggas don't pump if they can't make a profit
Stop it, before we pull it back then cop it
Vacant lot niggas come through then we lock it
(WHAT, WHAT, WHAT)
(Jadakiss)
With no Glocks I'm in your town with five locks
Take five blocks, come back with five trucks, with knots
It's the L.O.X, three niggas that listen and watch
And nigga you know, whenever we spit, it's hot
It be that new flow, my niggas, fly niggas
Always high niggas, ready to die niggas
As far as I'm hearing, y'all doing a lot of comparing
Lemme get the one clearance like a sample
'Kiss is the champ and I know that you don't wanna get stamped
Left somewhere cramp, so when it rains, you get damp
Niggas is done, since poppy raised his son
When bringing in drums, to bring all g's to bums
Whether you can flow or not ain't the issue
You don't Jay to kiss you, his lyrics pierce the gristle
Take a puff then a swig
Think about how I'm gonna
Hold it down for Big, my motherfucking nig
Your money is low, and your flow been late
While I be coming through with new shit with tint plates
The only higher than money, is respect
The only thing hotter than my clique, is a TEC
So when I hit you with these last bars around your neck
You gonna know never to fuck around with L-O-X nigga
(WHAT, YEAH)
(Sheek Louch)
My bank account be doubling
While you niggas stay in trouble and
L.O.X. stay fly
Three niggas jig-I
Shit you never seen before, Feds hit the repo law
Kingpin, 10 mil. each of us popular
It's Sheek baby
Chicks hate to see me on the Soul Train
With Don Cornelius
And all they got is alias
To work with
To catch Sheek, y'all niggas besta work quick
Now that I'm eating right, plus living well
So nowadays when I burp, it's fettucini you smell
Ain't that right poppa-san, used to push a Nissan
With a black master full 850 full suspension
While you collect your pension, I ain't worked in years
My stomach is fat from Puerto Rican food, while yours is scarce
Small black haired, chinky-eyed Puerto Rican mama
Keep them laced in Escada, half the closet on product
I learn things, just by watching y'all niggas make the wrong moves
Now I know what not to do, to make more than y'all fools
Y'all think we ignorant, 'cause we don't budge unless we benefit
Cats that take the light that's scarce and see what's at the end of it
P.H. me, because a nigga wisks me up in Jake B
Your shit be so-so, low pro
On a bus before the cars show
On some old joystick shit, no mirrors
I can see behind me through the cameras
Flip plates, make the whole block go bananas

[Pre-Chorus, Chorus, & Bridge]
'Cause after this Corona
I'm tryna have a face down
So when I walk up on her
I'm checking from the waist down
I spend a couple on her
We headed to my place now
So when I walk up on ya
I'm checking from the waist down

[Chorus: Far East Movement]
(Shake that piñata)
Talking 'bout that fanny girl
(Shake that piñata)
Let me hit that

Talking 'bout that fanny girl
(Shake that piñata)
Gimme some of that candy

[Bridge: Pitbull]
Shake that thing girl
Let me see what you got
Now shake that thing girl
Let me see what you got
Now shake that thing girl
Let me see what you got
Now shake that thing girl

[Intro]
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday Mr President
Happy birthday to you

[Verse]
Thanks, Mr President
For all the things you've done
The battles that you've won
The way you deal with U.S. Steel
And our problems by the ton
We thank you so much

[Outro]
Everybody, happy birthday

[Verse: Nathan Morris, Boyz II Men]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire (Open fire, oh)
Jack Frost nipping at your nose (At your nose, oh)
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe (Mistletoe)
Helps to make the season bright (Season bright, oh)
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight (They know that)

[Bridge: Shawn Stockman]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Verse 2: Nathan Morris, Boyz II Men]
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase (Simple phrase)
To kids from one to ninety-two (Ninety-two)
Although it's been said many times
Many ways; "Merry Christmas to you" (They know that)

[Bridge: Wanya Morris, Boyz II Men]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly (If they fly)

[Outro: Wayna Morris, Boyz II Men]
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two (Ninety-two)
Although it's been said many times, many ways
(Merry Christmas) Merry Christmas
(Merry Christmas) Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
1999, and the illusion continues
One begs to ask, "when will it end?"

Unnatural disasters happen seemingly every week
Train crashes, shootings, nuclear accidents
Is there any place of refuge one can flee from this insanity?
Very few of mankind's creations are designed to make you feel good
Unless you get pleasure from seeing the human body
Desecrated by guns, explosions, fights
And any other things these so-called "artists" create
In the name of freedom, many have used art as a means to destroy the human mind
As an excuse to continue we hear "Art reflects society"
How many times has this lie been repeated: "creations are not real"
They say and yet any one of these people can call to mind
Images and complete scenes of horror in graphic detail
They will carry these so-called "unreal" creations around with them for the rest of their lives
These images are now a part of their being
In the name of recreation these people in fact are recreating themselves in their own images
Society then reflects art

In man's decision to further separate from God
His re-creation of himself leaves him in a dysfunctional state of confusion
The mind becomes a burial ground for dead waste
Isolated from the wholeness of God, Earth and his fellow brothers and sisters
This man seeks solace in activities he thinks will stimulate his mind
He begins downloading into his brain a series of manmade creations designed to destroy it
All manmade creations originate from one of two sources
The Tree of Knowledge or the Tree of Life
One of these trees contained deadly fruit, the other - Fruit of Everlasting Life
The one who disregards this fact recreates himself and his kind into extinction
You are reading these words on a machine created by man
As you read, you hear a voice speaking to you the words that you perceive
They make sense to you because you understand (stand under) the spelling
The words are what binds this spell to your illusion
When you hear the truth, like a memory
You recognize it and this recognition releases you from all illusion
Many languages are brilliant in their attempt to confuse you
Con meaning: against, fuse meaning: together
Words and their spellbinding illusions have the power to keep man separate from God
You were born in an all-knowing state of mind
The first words spoken to you begin the spell
The words come from one of two sources
The Tree of Knowledge or the Tree of Life
In ignorance or simply lack of respect for God
Many use words that confuse the minds of humans and turn them into projections of their own illusions
Because of this fact, many people grow up and blindly assume their pre-selected role
Under a dictatorship without even being aware of it
When asked what they are doing here on earth, most will answer with statements
That do not reflect their natural God-given desires
This creates a pyramid-like structure with the dictator on top
And each level under it knowing less and less
Upon reaching the bottom level - which is where the majority is
You will find chaos, disorder, and illusion
With ill as its prefix, illusion is a state of insanity
In the name of democracy, supreme power is vested unto the people in this insane state instead of God
A future re-created, to be ruled by man, is one of isolation and despair
Returning the leadership back into God will allow mankind to achieve its original collective goal
Which is union with God
Ideas contrary to this goal should not be blamed or persecuted - just simply ignored
They originated when man first chose to ignore God's rule
Simply put - in the beginning, the Human was made perfect in God's image
They had no need for knowledge
They were also given freedom of choice
The Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life are reflections of this freedom
The human is now a reflection of their choice
They could have simply chose not to choose
God being centrifugal in nature, freedom was the cause and choice was the effect
In knowing their perfection made in God's image, there was no need to choose
In fact, their were no needs
There was only love in an all-knowing state before the fall
The worst thing you can do is give up your God-given right to choose
For in it - you can choose not to choose
Therein is the final judgement
The illusion ceases and you awaken from your dream
Now the healing begins...
With an all-knowing mind, made in God's image
You can create as your Creator - God intended
With love, honor and respect for every living thing in the universe
Separation ceases, and we all become One Being singing the One song

I am the universe
The sun, the moon and sea
I am the energy
For that is what I believe
I can be contradiction
'Cause that is all I see
But I am the universe
And the universe is me

I am the one song (Ah yes)
And that one song is free
All things come from this one song (Yes they do, uh)
The garden and the tree
If everything, everything is present
What is will always be
This here is the first and the last song
And all that come between

When language falls like a wounded soldier
And it's covered by the sea
All the sadness
All these unanswered questions
Keep me company
(Company, company, company come to me, come to me please!)
Here at the center of it all
(I know)
I know that you can only come from me
(I am the universe)
Yes it will, oh, yes it will
(The sun, the moon and sea)
Where else is it gonna come from but me?

(I am the universe)
Oh my, my my my my my my my universe

(The universe is me)

(I am the universe)
(The sun, the moon and sea)

(I am the universe)

(We are the universe)

(The universe is me)
One truth (One truth)
One song (One song)
One energy
There are times I fear I lose myself
I don't know who I am
I get caught up in the struggle and the strain
With my back against a stonewall
My finger in the dam
Losin' strength and goin' down again

And I take a look around me
My eyes can't find the sun
There's nothing wild as far as I can see
Then my heart turns to Alaska
And freedom on the run
I can hear her spirit callin' me

To the mountains, I can rest there
To the rivers, I will be strong
To the forest, I'll find peace there
To the wild country, where I belong

Oh, I know some times I worry
On worldly ways and means
And I can see the future killing me
On a misbegotten highway
Of prophecies and dreams
A road to nowhere and eternity
And I know it's just changes
Yes, and mankind marchin' on
I know we can't live in yesterday
But compared to what we're losin'
And what it means to me
I'd give my life and throw the rest away

To the mountains, I can rest there
To the rivers, I will be strong
To the forest, I'll find peace there
To the wild country, where I belong
To the wild country, where I belong
My granddad used to tell me, "Boy, when I was just your age, I was a river pilot on a showboat called The Stage
I'd hobnob with them southern belles and ev'ry roustabout. I'd listen to them paddle wheels and hear the leadsman shout!

Chorus:
Mark Twain, it's two fathoms deep below. Mark Twain, heave the gang plank. Start the show
Mark Twain, play those banjos as we go down the Mississippi, 'round the Gulf of Mexico

There were gamblers, crooks and fakers and a minstrel man who'd dance. A singin' gal, Simone Lamour, imported straight from France
It was a floatin' palace, boy, that showboat called The Stage, and granddad was the king of it when he was just my age."

(Chorus)
The calliope is quiet now. The rudder's thick with rust. The main deck and the paddle wheels are covered high with dust
But granddad's in his glory, still standin' on the bow. A halo 'round his pilot's cap and I can hear him now

(Chorus)
Give me a T for Texas, give me a T for Tennessee
Give me a T for Texas, give me a T for Tennessee
Give me a T for Thelma, woman made a fool out of me

If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
I've had more pretty women than a passenger train could haul

I'm gonna buy myself a shotgun, one with a long shiny barrel
I'm gonna buy myself a shotgun, one with a long shiny barrel
I'm gonna shoot me a rounder oh that stole away my gal

I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log
I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log
Than to be in Atlanta, Georgia, treat me like a dirty dog
(I don't have to go for that)

If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
'Cause I've had more pretty women than a passenger train could haul
And that ain't all
I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log
I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log
Than to be in Atlanta, Georgia, treated like a dirty dog

Oh Give me a T for Texas, give me a T for Tennessee
Give me a T for Thelma, woman made a fool out of me
Give me a T for Texas, give me that T for Tennessee
Give me a T for Thelma, woman made a fool out of me
One more time

Give me a T for Thelma, oh that woman made a fool...
I said said oh, that woman made a fool
Out of me, yeah

Bitch fuck your whole crew, straight up
Gonna take a sentimental journey
Gonna set my heart at ease
Gonna make a sentimental journey
To renew old memories

I got my bag, I got my reservation
Spent each dime I could afford
Like a child in wild anticipation
I long to hear that: "All aboard!"

Seven, that's the time we leave - at seven
I'll be waiting up for heaven
Counting every mile of railroad track - that moves me back

I never though my heart could be so yearny
Why did I decide to roam
Gotta take a sentimental journey
Sentimental journey home
This song appears on four albums, and was first released on the Seasons of the Heart. Album, and has also been released on the Earth Songs, The John Denver Collection - Sunshine On My Shoulder and The Very Best of John Denver (Single CD) Albums

A heritage of vision
Was given to us all
To smell the rose's fragrance
To hear the songbird's call
To watch the distant moonlight fill
The coming of the tides
To understand that life is more
Than always choosing sides

And some have seen what can be seen
Of sailing ships and kings
And some are given feet of clay
And some are given wings
And some must struggle just to breathe
Some have a golden spoon
And some will never leave the nest
While some walk on the moon

And don't you know the life that lives
Within the silent hills
Is just as rich and beautiful
And just as unfulfilled
As man with all his intellect
His reason and his choice
Oh, who's to say the nightingale
Has any less a voice
The silver dolphins twist and dance
And sing to one another
The cosmic ocean knows no bounds
For all that lives are brothers
The whippoorwill, the grizzly bear
The elephant, the whale
All children of the universe
All weavers of the tale

So palomino lie back down
And dream yourself to sleep
The hawk flies with the morning dove
The lion with the sheep
As far away as you may go
We'll never be apart
It's in your dreams that you will know
The seasons of the heart

Words and music by John Denver
Ooh, time
Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

So lucky to be
The one you, you run to see
In the evening or when
The day is through

And I
I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so, so new

And time
Time after time
You're gonna hear me
I'm gonna say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you
When you were mine
I gave you all of my money
Time after time
You done me wrong
It was just like a dream
You let all my friends come over and meet
And you were so strange
You didn't have the decency To change the sheets

Oh girl, when you were mine
I used to let you wear all my clothes
You were so fine (so fine)
Maybe that's the reason
That it hurt me so

I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (don't care)
Cuz I love u, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did
When you were mine
When you were mine
You were kinda sorta my best friend
So I was blind (so blind)
I let you fool around
I never cared (didn't care)
I never was the kind to make a fuss
When he was there
Sleeping inbetween the two of us

I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (don't care)
Cuz I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did
When you were mine

When you were mine
U were all I ever wanted to do
Now I spend my time
Following him whenever he's with you

I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (don't care)
Cuz I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more that I did
When you were mine
When you were mine, yeah, oh no
Love you, baby
Love you, baby
When you were mine

Listen as I integrate these words with chords I've made from fingers so warm
Been torn from yours

I time traveled and unraveled the mysteries of the universe
And now I know
Now I know what not to do with you

Open up and jump, the longer you wait the longer you'll hesitate
And as for me I'll let gravity take its course, 'cause I've fallen already

What were those words you said as you were leaving?
Were they recycled from the mouths of dead poets? I'll pretend I didn't notice
Let's depend on springtime to cure our broken hearts

And in the mean time, you and I should just
Manage on, my soul unraveling
Manage on, my soul unraveling
Not uncommon, we're just matter we
I'm chemically inclined to be

Manage on, my soul unraveling
Manage on, my soul unraveling
Not uncommon, we're just matter we
I'm chemically inclined to be
I walked down to the park last night
Warm breeze stirring up the soft moonlight
My mind started drifting to way back when
Yes, I do think about you every now and then

The other day I saw a car like you used to drive
I got a funny feeling down deep inside
And for the briefest moment I felt a smile begin
Yes, I do think about you every now and then

I love my life and I'd never trade
Between what you and me had and the life I've made
She's here and she's real, but you were too
And every once in a while I think about you

I heard a song on the radio just yesterday
The same one you always you asked me to play
And when the song was over
I wished they'd played it again
Yes, I do think about you every now and then
I love my life and I'd never trade
Between what you and me had and the life I've made
She's here and she's real, but you were too
And every once in a while I think about you

I been laying here all night listening to the rain
Talking to my heart and trying to explain
Why sometimes I catch myself
Wondering what might have been
Yes, I do think about you every now and then
Every now and then
Every now and then
Refusing what you are given
You want things to be the old way
Resisting the revolutions
Changes are coming anyway

Unable to thrive to change
The mask doesn't veil anymore
Strip yourself of all your riddles
Do not reject all the lessons

You're not a child anymore
You're not your former self
And what's reality now?
The tools you've used to get by
Aren't the keys to your tomorrows

The wind is blowing
The sea is shifting
The storm is rumbling
Darkness descending
The gales are sweeping
The waves threatening
Horizon is grim
Tempest arriving
Hey skipper, look ahead, navigate
Hey skipper, look ahead, navigate
Hey skipper, use your head, manoeuvre
Hey skipper, look ahead, navigate

Oh the winds can blow but
Your sails can defeat it
The storms may rumble
We all know your hull is fit

That sea is rough now
Mind you do not slip
Could destroy your ship
Put a nail in it

When darkness descends
Your radar will be your sight
The waves may unleash
Your mast will stay standing high

You are the captain
Do you feel equipped?
You have now taken
The helm of your ship

[Verse 1]
I'm taking care of business, woman, can't you see?
I gotta make it for you, and I've gotta make it for me
Oh, sometimes it may seem, girl, I'm neglecting you
Well, I'd love to spend more time --
But I got so many things to do

[Chorus]
Oh, I - I got work to do (I got work to do)
I got work, baby! (I got work to do)
I got a job, baby! (I got work to do)
I got work to do! (I got work to do)
Said, I got work to do! (I got work to do)

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm out here trying to make it, woman, can't you see?
Oh, it takes a lot of money to make, let's talk truthfully
So keep your love lights burning
And a little food hot in my plate
You might as well get used to
Me coming home a little late

[Chorus]
Oh, I - I got work to do
I got a job, baby! (I got work to do)
I got work to do (I got work to do)
I got work to do (I got work to do)
I got work to do (I got work to do)
Wha Ha Ha!

[Verse 3]
I'm taking care of business, woman, can't you see?
I gotta make it for you, gotta make it for me!
Don't wanna make you feel I'm neglecting you
I'd love to spend more time
Oh, but I got so many things to do!

[Chorus]
Whoa, I - I got work to do
I got work, baby! (I got work to do)
Said, I got a job, baby! (I got work to do)

[Part I: The Star Room]

[Intro: Mac Miller]
This next song right here is called "The Star Room"
It's how I open up my album, man
Yeah, ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
This song is the moment you stop lying to yourself, alright?
Hallelujah, thank God I have a future
Prayin' I don't waste it gettin' faded
'Cause I'm smokin' Backwoods 'til I'm coughin' up tar
Feel the surge, energy curve like a lumbar
I don't act hard, I still read Babar
Trippin' out, lookin' at a bunch of Google map stars
They got a app for that

[Verse: Mac Miller]
But me, I’m still trapped inside my head, it kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm livin' paradise, so what I have to worry 'bout?
Dealin' with these demons, feel the pressure, find the perfect style
Makin' sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
And I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form
Difference between love and war inform me, I'm above the norm
Give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts
Rhymin' like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed
Still don't got the heart to pick the phone up when my dad call
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice
And I don't know what I'm runnin' from, but I'm runnin' still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothin' real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fuckin' deal
And money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil
But I want that Rolls Royce that the homie Lennon drove
So, if you don't got some money for me, I'ma send you home
Unconventional, special but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's lettin' me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity, I let 'em go
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow
But that's just me all wildin' out and bein' extra, though

[Interlude: Mac Miller]
I wonder if I lost my way
I wonder if i lost my way
Did I lose my way?
My way
Did I lose my way?
My way, yeah
Ayy, uh, come on, come on
Come on, come on
S-San Diego, come on, come on
So can you feel it?
Said, can you feel it?
Said, can you feel it?
Let's go
Woo
San Diego, California
We gon' start this one like this

[Part II: Killin' Time]

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Said, I'm posin' a question
How many been empty and holdin' aggression?
Close to depression, open your eyes and just focus a second
Fuck a recession, my brother
My mind is my weapon, I'm lettin' it go
Know that I'm pointin' at negative energy, tellin' me "Stop"
They tellin' me "No"
Your aura is somethin' you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, hoes got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feelin' come after the shock
Praise me, I'd rather you not, 'cause
It's drivin' me crazy
The fact that you pay to make me into somethin' I love
You come to the club, searchin' for drugs, drunk, fuckin' these sluts
God loves me, what if he does, what does it mean?
You're wastin' away doing nothin', you're frontin'
Why ain't you chasin' your dreams? Uh
We wonder 'bout life but none of us willin' to learn
The money we earn is somethin' to burn
Why won't they give me a turn–out?
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You're mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?
When them high-rollers homes in Vegas raided with some home invasion
Contaminatin' the place with plague, we just saved the day

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
I waste away in this room spittin' these raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm givin' it back, Tay

[Chorus: Tay Walker]
It's a gift
Of our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
Of our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Okay, forfeitin' the war, he lays his sword down and walks away
Grabs a forty from the corner store and begins to contemplate
Dealin' with death like he work in the morgue
Absorbin' souls forgotten, he lost his way
Starin' down that barrel, thinkin', "Not today"
Life's so precious, said Lord knows life is so precious
Fight to the death, 'til there's nobody left
You're holdin' your breath 'cause you might get infected
Minimalistic, instinctively thinkin' of gettin' ballistic
Be specific, to those in control, we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined
My trigger finger itchin', all I kill is time *Gunshot*
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shootin' lasers
'Cept I'm cool with Vader, blowin' up rooms that's full of strangers
A news anchor the youth can relate to, it's nature
If you a hater, I'll deal with you later, no, thank ya
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors
Said, really though, come on, homie, we major

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
I waste away in this room spittin' out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm givin' it back, Tay

[Chorus: Tay Walker & Mac Miller]
It's a gift
Of our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
Of our time to be alive (One)
No earthly vehicle (Two)

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Said, one, two, three
Said, everybody, put your hands up (Get 'em up)
So get 'em up (Get 'em up)
Said, put your hands up (Get 'em up)
So get 'em up (Get 'em up)

Now go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Beats on repeat beating on me
From every car in the street
There's a constant repeat on repeat
Of your paranoid, heartbreaking beats

On repeat

It's a five song repeat beating on me
With your favourite band that helps you sleep
And here comes the new stylish creep
From every car in the street

On repeat
On repeat

Don't tell nobody what would you really want because
They can tell everybody else what you really want, then you're fucked
So act like it's for yourself or it's all yours and they go and
Tell everybody else that you're really great, we are just people

You're enfranchised and entranced
You're enfranchised and entrenched
But know that it's yours
Real life's a compromise
But your beats half-assed streak is beating on me
Well, my drunken week is helping me sleep

I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would line the streets and come to every show, no one wants that
I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would flee the schools and come to every show, drugged and unwashed
I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would line the streets, come to every show, unwashed and drugged and

Beats on repeat beating on me
On your radio, on your radio
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio

Beats on repeat beating on me
Beats on repeat beating on me
I know you don't love me no more
No more, no, no more
And I don't wanna be hurt anymore
Anymore
I love so hard
Everything I did was no joy
If I can't love you right, baby
I don't have to love you at all

I know you don't want me no more
No more, no, no more
And I need someone else
Who's gonna love me more
Love me more
Ain't no need me cryin' now
After you have put me down
If you don't want me no more, baby
Ain't no use you hangin' round

I know you don't want me no more
No more, no, no more
And I need someone else
Who's gonna love me more
Love me more
Ain't no need me cryin' now
After you have put me down
If you don't want me no more, baby
Ain't no use you hangin' round
I know you don't want me no more
I know, I know
And I don't wanna be hurt anymore
Anymore
Love me more
After you have put me down
Ain't no use you hangin' round
You don't want me no more, baby
Ain't no use you hangin' round
Come all you rounders if you wanna hear the story about a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the roller's name on a 68 wheeler course he won his fame
Caller called Casey bout half past four he kissed his wife at the station door
He climbed in the cabin with his orders in his hand
Said this is the trip to the Promised Land
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin Casey Jones orders in his hand
Casey Jones leanin' out the window taking a trip to the Promised Land

Through South Memphis Yards on a fly rain been a fallin' and the water was high
Everybody knew by the engine's moan that the man at the throttle was Casey Jones
Well Jones said fireman now don't you fret Sam Webb said we ain't a givin' up yet
We're eight hours late with the southbound mail
We'll be on time or we're leavin' the rails
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin...

Dead on the rail was a passenger train blood was a boilin' in Casey's brain
Casey said hey now look out ahead jump Sam jump or we'll all be dead
With a hand on a whistle and a hand on a brake north Mississippi was wide awake
I see railroad official said he's a good engineer to be a laying dead
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin...
Headaches and heartaches and all kinds of pain all the part of a railroad train
Sweat and toil the good and the grand part of the life of a railroad man
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin...
Now, my baby's a country girl
And she just can't help herself
Yes, my baby's a country girl
And she just can't help herself
And every time I tell her I'm gonna leave her
She say I don't want nobody else

I sat around and cried
'til the tears run down my cheek
Yes, I sat around at night and cried
'til the tears run down my cheek
I said Baby, don't you worry
I got you plenty milk and meat

One day baby, you gonna think your dad's gone
Oh, baby. Don't every think your dady's gone
Well, you know he right there with you
Standing in blood and all

Well, I buys her everything she need
She don't even have to go nowhere
My baby gets everything she needs
She don't even have to go nowhere
Now, God aughta bless me, aughta bless me
I even bought that girl some help
Weren't for lipstick and powder
No I don't know what my baby would do
Weren't for lipstick and powder
I don't know what in the world that girl would do
But I love that woman in this story I'm tellin' you

Baby, honey, do you feel alright?
Hey, baby, I wanna know do you feel alright?
I wanna love you baby
Ff you tell me daddy you knew I ain't tired tonight
Went to a party
The New York style
I met a lady
Make a sane man wild
She said the words only her lips could say
She made me want to throw my life away
But when I asked her
She said "Maybe tomorrow, B.B."
And that's a story everybody knows

I took her flying
Out across the sea
I thought I had her
I know that she had me
And when we landed
It was Paris, France
Seemed like a nice place
For some French romance
But when I touched her
She said "Maybe a little later, B.B."
And that's the story everybody knows
We went to Berlin
And to Stockholm too
And on the Moscow
Then to the Peking Zoo
As far as travel, she couldn't get too much
Somewhere in Oakland
She let me have just a little touch
And then she said "I'm late for beauty appointment
I've got a headache, And I believe I'm coming down with the flu"
And that's the story everybody knows
We'll be lovers, lovers, lovers
Got to make you understand
We'll be lovers, lovers, lovers
I wanna hold you in my hand
We'll be lovers, lovers, lovers

Wanna be a part of you
And I wanna make you part of me (Sweet inspiration)
Oh, we can make it (Make it), make it for the world to see

Of a flame, of burning desire

[Verse 1]
Caught in the middle, Carol, we're middle class
We're middle aged, we were wild in the old days
Birth of rock n' roll days, now your kids are coming up straight
My child's a stranger, I bore her but I could not raise her

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long

[Chorus]
Down at the Chinese Café
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing, "Oh my love, my darling"
One more time

[Verse 2]
Uranium money is booming in the old hometown now
It's putting up sleek concrete, tearing the old landmarks down now
Paving over brave little parks, ripping off Indian land again
How long, how long, short-sighted business man?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long

[Chorus]
Down at the Chinese Café
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing, "You give your love so sweetly"
One more time

[Verse 3]
Christmas is sparkling out on Carol's lawn
This girl of my childhood games with kids nearly grown and gone
Grown so fast like the turn of a page
We look like our mothers did now when we were those kids' age

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long

[Chorus]
Down at the Chinese Café
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing, "Oh my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me"

[Outro]
(Time goes - where does the time go
I wonder where the time goes)
Lovers in ancient times

Now it begins -- I see it in your eyes
And I know how you feel -- you long to touch the sky
The flame of life, let it eat your heart out every night
But you're not alone

This is your world -- this is your world

Lovers in ancient time, caught in the fire
Only the strong survive -- how can we face tomorrow
Live an illusion, don't let it fade and die
Something deep inside you, a wing and a prayer will guide you
Something deep inside you
Something deep inside you, a wing and a prayer will guide you
Something deep inside you

Spoken:
Go now, girl, don't look back. this is your one big chance
I place my fingers to your lips and I tell you my love flies with you
On a wing and a prayer, on a wing and a prayer
No muscle and bone -- rhythm is the key
There's everything to play for -- you're everything to me
The game of life -- win it and your love comes tumbling down
You'll never be alone
This is your world -- this is your world

This is your world -- this is your world

Lovers in ancient time, caught in the fire
Only the strong survive -- how can we face tomorrow
Live an illusion, don't let it fade and die
Something deep inside you, a wing and a prayer will guide you
Something deep inside you
Something deep inside you, a wing and a prayer will guide you
Something deep inside you

Something deep inside you, a wing and a prayer will guide you
Something deep inside you
Spoken:
Way past your bedtime (Crowd laughs and then subsides)
Only kiddin', kids

Long ago and far away, I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast but now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine, Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Chills run up and down my spine, Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you
How beautiful do the words have 2 be
Before they conquer every heart?
How will U know if I'm even in the right key
If U make me stop before I start?

CHORUS:
If I came back as a dolphin
Would U listen 2 me then?
Would U let me be your friend?
Would U let me in?
U can cut off all my fins - But 2 your ways I will not bend
I'll die before I let U tell me how 2 swim
And I'll come back again as a dolphin
Why does my brother have 2 go hungry
When U told him there was food 4 all?
This is the man that stands next 2 the man
That stands 2 catch U when U fall (Oh!)
CHORUS
If I'm under water, will U find me? (Find me {x4})
Will U shine a light and try 2 guide me?
It's happened before, I've knocked on your door
But U wouldn't let me in
How beautiful do the words have 2 be
Before they conquer every heart? (Oh!)
If I came back as a dolphin
Would U listen 2 me then?
Would U let me be your friend?
Would U let me in?
U can cut off all my fins - But 2 your ways I will not bend
I'll die before I let U tell me how 2 swim
Come back in the end as a dolphin (Oh)
(I'll come back, baby)
(Let me in, let me in) As a dolphin
(Be my friend) Dolphin
(Yeah, yeah)
Dolphin - As a dolphin x3

[Verse 1]
Oooh...
There I go again falling in love all over
Oooh...
The cycle never ends
You just pray you don't get burned
Oooh...
This fire inside of me, don't nobody realize
Oooh...
What you are to me, but baby you got to learn

[Chorus]
I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
You got to know how I feel about cha
How I'll always want you near
I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
I'm counting every minute
Of every hour 'til you are here

[Verse 2]
Girl, can't you understand
I never used to go dancing
I, I was the kind of man who'd rather stay at home
Now, when I think about how much I miss you
I want to jump for joy and thank Him I'm not alone (I am not alone)

[Chorus]
I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
You got to know how I feel about cha
How I always want you near
I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
I'm gonna count every minute
Of every hour 'til you are here, oooohh

[Verse 3]
Here I go again falling in love all over
Oh, the cycle never ends
You pray you don't get burned, ow

[Chorus]
I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
(I'm, I'm making you a coat of cashmere
Baby, cashmere)
You got to know how I feel about cha (You got to know, yeah)
How I always want you near
I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
(How I feel about you, how I feel about you, oh)
I'm counting every minute of every hour
'Til you are here

When I get my arms around you, baby
There's so many things I wanna do
I'm gonna hold you
I'm gonna kiss you
Like you... like you...
I'm gonna tell you a bedtime story, baby
One you never heard before
I said, one you never heard before
About a girl, about a boy
And all the joy
All the things that you enjoy
How to stay in love, how to stay so happy
Baby girl, there's so many things
So many things I wanna do
I wanna...
I wanna...
I wanna...I wanna...I wanna...I wanna...
I wanna make you a pretty, pretty coat of cashmere
Cause you got to know how I feel about you, baby
How I feel about you, baby
I'm gonna make a little pretty coat
I'm gonna count every second, every minute
Each and every hour of every day
'Til you come on back
Come on back to your little man
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the walls
In the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who is as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life I see I need love, I need love, I need love
How about this?
(When you're near, the murmuring of the breeze)
(Becomes a symphony)
(A rhapsody)

And when I hear you call
So softly to me
I don't hear a call at all
I hear a rhapsody

And when your sparkling eyes
Are smiling at me
Then soft through the starlit skies
I hear a rhapsody

My days are so blue when you're away
My heart longs for you, so won't you stay?

My darling, hold me tight
And whisper to me
Then soft through the starry night
I'll hear a rhapsody
(My days are so blue when you're away)
My heart longs for you, so won't you stay?
(Forever and ever, won't you stay?)

My darling, hold me tight
And whisper to me
Then soft through a starry night
I'll hear a rhapsody
Got ripplin' waters to wake me
To be more than my woman in love
All pine trees are pointin' to see easily
To see heaven above

Blue spruce flamin' on the grate in the evening
Takes the chill away fine
Cut the telephone line
The story's the same

There's a worn red chair by the window
That you found at a sale down the way
When some old women said that they
Needed more room for the winter

People like pullin' at the stuffing
When they sit down
So it passes the time
Cut the telephone line
The story's the same
Ooh, like a bubble on a windy day
Start to flutter when I hear you say
That you feel too good to go away
And you make me feel fine
And you made the world a warmer place
By the sparkle of your diamond face
On a gray spot with a little lace
And you make me feel fine
Warm as a mountain in sunshine
On the edge of the snowline
In a meadow of columbine

Oh little Gennifer
I'd give a penny for
What you've got on your mind
Seems like most of the time you're lyin' there dreamin'

Maybe in your vision you see how
Our mission is slightly less than divine
Cut the telephone line
The story's the same

Now, ripplin' waters flow through the ceiling
And the walls there, their keepin' me warm
And the closest I've been with my family for days
Is my music
But the silently stare in the morning sky
Is like hearing her calling my name
Cut the telephone line
The story might change

Ooh, like a bubble on a windy day
Start to flutter when I hear you say
That you feel too good to go away
And you make me feel fine
Warm as a mountain sunshine
On the edge of the snowline
In a meadow of columbine
If I had wings
Like Noah's dove
I'd fly up the river
Just to see the woman that I love

Fare you well, oh my honey
I say, "Fare you well"

When I woke up this mornin'
It was drizzlin' rain
All around my heart
Well there was an ache and pain

Fare you well, oh my honey
I say, "Fare you well"

Now when you wore
Your apron low
You couldn't keep me
No you couldn't keep me from around your door
Fare you well, oh my honey
I say, "Fare you well"

And now you wear
Your apron high
You say you never
No you never, you scarcely ever see me passin' by

Fare you well, oh my honey
I say, "Fare you well"
Oh fare you well
Goodbye woman I know I've done you wrong
Oh fare you well
There's a whole lot of talk around town
About the way you're carrying yourself
Whole lot of talk around town, woman
About the way you're carrying yourself
You're jiving everybody in town
But old B., that's me
I know what you've been putting down
You got a rambling mind
Just don't wanna stay at home
You got a rambling mind, woman
You just don't wanna stay at home
You ain't got no job in town
And I know what you've been putting down
Everybody wants you, baby
Everybody but me
I said every
Everybody wants you, woman
Everybody but me
You've been jiving everybody in town, baby

But I know what you've been putting down
You went out late last night
To a dinner show and a dance
You went out late last night, baby
A dinner show and a dance
You must've been a perfect clown
'Cause I know what you've been putting down
Yeah, you came home
Early this morning, woman
With a new hat, a new dress
And a new pair of shoes
Came home early this morning, woman
With a new hat, a new dress
And a new pair of shoes
You ain't been visiting
Your relatives in town
I know what you've been putting down
Well, things have been goin' wrong
Long enough to know that everything is just right
I've been walkin' in the dark
Long enough to know when I've finally seen the light
I've been losin' long enough
To know when I've finally have won
And even a blind man can tell
When he's walkin' in the sun

Well, I've cried enough tears
To recognize this feeling called a smile
I've been bottom rung long enough
To know when I'm doin' it in style

I've been runnin' so long enough
To know when there's no more need to run
And even a blind man can tell
When he's walkin' in the sun

Oh, the wind is at my back
And I'm sailin' on a ship that's overdue
I've blown so many chances
That I ain't gonna blow this one with you
And I've seen enough bad times
To know when the good times have begun
And even a blind man can tell
When he's walkin' in the sun

And even a blind man can tell
When he's walkin' in the sun
And even a blind man can tell
When he's walkin' in the sun

And even a blind man can tell
When he's walkin' in the sun
There's a land that is fairer than day
And by faith we can see it apart
For the father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there
In the sweet bye and bye
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet bye and bye
We shall meet on that beautiful shore

We shall sing on that beautiful shore
For the melodious songs of the blessed
And our spirits shall sorrow no more
Not a sight for the blessing of rest
In the sweet bye and bye
To a bountiful father above
We shall offer our tribute of praise
For the glory as gift of his love
And the blessings that hallow our days
In the sweet by and bye
In the sweet by and bye

Givin' a shout out to all these parasites (parasites?...you understand me?)
These mosquitos (mosquitos), mosquite ho's
Swarmin' around my wallet tryin' to suck me dry (hell yeah)
But money come too haaard...to give it all to a woman (I know that's right, hell yeah)
We all do stupid things....payin' too much for pussy don't have to be one of em'
So fellas, don't get pussy-whoopped (say what?)....
Whoop that pussy (while yer bullshuttin'...looky here boy)
And we ain't talkin' bout all women (henh)...
But if the maxipad fits, go ahead and wear it bitch (henh....do you undersmell me?)

(Check this out loco) Babay (uhoh), you are the woman...of my dreams
(yes you...go on an do your thang)
And I really want to put a woman like you.....somewhere on my team
You have a sense of humor (unh..c'mon) you sexy and you smart (you so intelligent)
But when you tried to take my money, honey...you broke my fuckin' heart
(c'mon cuz...where you at loco? ...You broke my fuckin' heart)
I said baby, yeah I need you...to step on out my car
(step on out my car....don't forget your panties and your bra)
Cuz now I know exactly what you are...
(Ladies and gentlemen, fresh off parole...the Quarterpiece Quartet)

[Chorus]
You gold diggin' bitch...usin' yer pussy tryin' to get rich...maybe
(what you say baby? You need some what? You need some money?)
If your pussy ain't free...it's not for me, baby
(you know you fucked up, don't ya? you know you fucked up, don't ya? don't ya?)
You's a gold diggin' bitch...usin' yer pussy tryin' to get rich...maybe
(n-n-n-n-n-n-no...you'd...you better not skip this song, you better not skip this song)
If your pussy ain't free (shit)...it's not for me, (I'll be sittin' up there) baby
(watchin' them male bashers Ricky Lake and Queen Latifah, so listen to this shit, biatch)

See, I finally figured out why these ho's be hoin'...
Pussy is the only thing a bitch got goin'
It must be Sunday, cuz you got no class...
With the G-string goin' up the crack o'yer ass (crack o'yer ass)
Yo, you didn't speak back when I spoke to you (spoke to you)
Why? Do I look broke to you?
You put your head down, baby, then you passed me (passed me)
You hit the dance floor and started dancin' nasty (nasty)
And it's a trip when a stripper start to strip
All the home boys feel obligated to tip
Baby, even though I love the way you grease your thighs
I'm savin' my money for some chile cheese fries
Please! Don't make me laugh ho (laugh ho)
Take yo gold diggin' hands off my afro (afro)
Give you money for dancin'? Come on boo
I wouldn't give it to you, if you let me cum on you
Ooh I never found a gold diggin' woman arousin'
I'm a stingy black boy from the year two thousand
Payin' a broad is preposterous...
Unless you stick your dick down her esophagus (eww)
And even if you did that, you still a trick...(still a trick)
You need to make the woman pay for your dick (you know..)
You the one huffin'
You the one puffin'
She the one layin' there, ain't doin' nuthin'
And I bet you ate the pussy hopin' for good luck
Nine times outta ten you didn't get your dick sucked
Bitch too busy, thinkin' bout
Takin' all the money out yer bank account
So get out my Cadillac, real slow...
And go back home to your dil-do
If your lookin' for a trick, Miss Gold Digger...
You need to go talk to a old nigga
You gold diggin' bitch...usin' yer pussy tryin' to get rich...maybe
(all these little undercover prostitutes, cuz)
If your pussy ain't free...it's not for me, baby
(get to the house and the bitch stick out her hand and shit)
You's a gold diggin' bitch...usin' yer pussy tryin' to get rich...maybe
(you know...I ain't tryin' to be too niggerish on the microphone, you know what I'm sayin' cuz?)
If your pussy ain't free...it's not for me, baby (hey, let's flip it with finesse, for the ladies)
(Honey) Man, this girl walked up to me the other day... (you can't have my money)
I ain't even fuckin' her...she want me to jeopardize my life...
Take her to the wrong neighborhood way across town...
(Honey) And got mad at me when I asked her for some money for some gas in my Cadillac
(you can't have my money) I told her like this eyea! Bitch I ain't playin'
It ain't like you my woman.....you know what I'm sayin'?
Talkin' bout a man s'posed to take care of a woman
I told her like sugar free, I said now wait a minute baby, hold on (hold on)
That's drama...naw, naw, that's some shit you got from your mama
Now I ain't fixin' to break nary fingernail goin "oops" upside yo head
Talkin' bout "take me shopping"
I told her like "be legit"...check this shit out, I say, hey man
I said"Hit me when your welfare check is comin'...
And maybe we can go to the mall, or sumpin'...punk bitch
(Hey what's Nate Dogg tell them bitches man? Hey let me concentrate and say..)
Cuz I-I-I (uh-oh) have never met a girl (whay you playin' me...hey comeon y'all)
That I love, in the whole wide world
(What Ice Cube say, hey check it out, he say)
Last night she sucked my dick...
Now she kissin' Little Man...
Won't he suck my dick and let's cut out the middleman-man-man-man-man-man-man-man
You might have belonged to another
We might never have met
You might have chosen another
For you are a much better bet
You could have married a captain of a luxury ship at sea
There was a wizard at polo was a socialized bee
Remember the movie director who made five thousand a week
And there was a diamond collector who had the same technique
You knew a prince, a duke and a lord
You had your choice of the three
You might have belonged to another
By luck you settled for me

[Intro]
Check

[Verse 1]
Pack it up and leave it, leave it all behind you
Started fresh in someone else’s town
And though we may be leaving, I’ll be right beside you
To pick you up until you come around

[Chorus]
So please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy on yourself
Please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy on yourself

[Verse 2]
Down here can be tough, without your friends beside you
You built it up, just to break it down
So when you’re feeling rough, I’ll be right behind you
To pick you up until you come around

So please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy on yourself
Please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy on yourself

Sue wants a barbecue, Sam wants to boil a ham
Grace votes for bouillabaisse too
Jake wants a weinie bake, steak and the layer cake
And he'll get a tummy ache too
We'll rent a tent or a teepee, let the town crier cry
And if it's on a ditty, this is what I'll reply

In the cool, cool, cool of the evening, tell 'em I'll be there
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening, better save a chair
Oh, when the party's a-getting a glow on, and singing fills the air
In the shank of the night when the doing's all right
You can tell 'em I'll be there
(musical interlude)
Oh when the party's a-getting a glow on, and the singing fills the air
In the shank of the night when the doing's all right
You can tell them I'll be there
In the shank of the night when the doing's all right
You can tell them I'll be there
Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers
And you know the next day
They're fighting one another
They'll work it out between them two
They'll kiss and make up
Oh, you know lovers always do now
They're in a problem they can't solve now
Oh, don't you get yourself involved, baby
They may argue with each other now
Oh, but (Incomprehensible)
You know they'll work it out now
Between them two
They'll kiss and make up
I know 'cos lovers all always do
Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers
And you know the next day
They're fighting one another
They'll work it out between them two
They'll kiss and make up
Lovers always do
Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers
You got me sitting up on the shelf
While you're out bewitching someone else
Do I live, do I die
Do I laugh, do I cry
What game am I supposed to loose this time ?

You got chains attached to my head
You spreading magic honey all in your bed
What is it you want ?
Just a puppet that talks
Or maybe just a lover who makes love to the dead

Step onto the stage...just a few more minutes...
Let's see what kind of juggler you really are
Say without that whip and those bloody boots
Which are rented...you actually could become

A morning star...
But you rang your last bell
Even your planets, they've gone to hell
And your world turns to nothing but a bubble
In a shotgun jar
And now you don't know who you really are
So instead of trying to make me your slave
Why don't you just...call it a day
Either way I'm gonna win
So save yourself some wind
Don't make me to be the last to see
You to your grave...
Well well, ball and chain...for sale
New day come...masters gone to hell...
Well well, ball and chain...for sale
Sunrise come...master's dying in hell...
I know why I've waited, know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone exactly like you
Why should we spend money on a show or two
No one does those love scenes exactly like you
You make me feel so grand, I'd like to hand the world to you
You seem to understand each foolish little scheme I'm scheming
And the dream I'm dreaming
Now I know why my mother taught me to be true
She meant me for someone exactly like you
(musical interlude)
You make me feel so grand, I wanna hand the world to you
You seem to understand each foolish little scheme that I'm scheming
And the dream that I'm dreaming
Now I know why my mother, she taught me to be true
She meant me for someone exactly like you

[Verse 1]
Sparkle on the ocean
Eagle at the top of a tree
Those crazy crows always making a commotion
This land is home to me

[Verse 2]
I was talking to my neighbor
He said, "When I get to heaven, if it is not like this
I'll just hop a cloud and I'm coming right back down here
Back to this heavenly bliss."

[Chorus]
You see those lovely hills
They won't be there for long
They're gonna tear 'em down
And sell them to California
Here come the toxic spills
Miners poking all around
When this place looks like a moonscape
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Post-Chorus]
Money, money, money
Money makes the trees come down
It makes mountains into molehills
Big money kicks the wide wide world around

[Verse 3]
Black bear in the orchard
At night he's in my garbage cans
He's getting so bold but no one wants to shoot him
He's got a right to roam this land

[Verse 4]
I feel like Geronimo
I used to be as trusting as Cochise
But the white eyes lies, he's out of whack with nature
And look how far his weapons reach

[Verse 5]
Spirit of the water
Give us all the courage and the grace
To make genius of this tragedy unfolding
The genius to save this place

More patience, you take my get you in more places

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Ooh, boy, you looking like you like what you see

[Verse 4: Slim Thug]
I'm checking on you boo, do what you do
And while you dance, I'ma glance at this beautiful view
To keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue 'em with glue
I'm in a trance, all eyes on you and your crew
Me and my man's don't dance, but to feel y'all bump and grind
It won't hurt if you gon' try one time
They all hot, but let me see, this one's mine
It's Slim Thuga and DC outta H-Town

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Ooh, boy, you looking like you like what you see (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
Whose hairstyles are out of this world
Whether it's straight or bouffant or it's curled?
My baby (My baby, my baby), hey hey hey
My baby, baby, pretty baby

[Bridge: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
Hair soft like a baby lamb and I love to run my fingers through it
I hope she digs me the way I am, but if I have to change
You know I'm gonna do it for my baby
(I'm gonna do it for my baby)

[Verse 2: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
Personality contains more gold
Than any bank in this world could hold
My baby (My baby, my baby), hey hey hey
My baby, baby, pretty baby

[Bridge: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
Enough gold in her personality to set Fort Knox to shame
This golden girl belongs to me
Let nobody try to stake his claim
(Stake his claim on my baby)

[Chorus: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
(My baby) She's cute as can be
(My baby) This girl's got a hold on me
(My baby) Has a kiss so sweet, it knocks me off my feet
She makes my life complete
Oh yeah, she's my baby
Oh yeah, she's my baby
And I love her so
Yeah, I love my baby so

(My baby) She's cute as can be
(My baby) The girl's got a hold on me
(My baby) Has a kiss so sweet, it knocks me off my feet
She makes my life complete

[Verse 3: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
Who has my mind in a kind of a haze?
Who has me walkin' around in a daze?
My baby (My baby, my baby), hey hey hey
My baby, baby, pretty baby

[Bridge: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
She gives me a feeling I can't explain
She sets my soul on fire
But I don't feel hurt and I don't feel pain
All I feel is a strong desire for my baby
(Strong desire for my baby)

[Outro: David Ruffin]
Oh yeah, my baby, got personality to satisfy me
Oh baby, that's my baby, my baby, my baby

[Verse 1]
No tongue in the bell and the fishwives yell
But they might as well be mute
So you get to keep the pictures, that don't seem like much
Cold white keys under your fingers
Now you're thinking that's no substitute
It just don't do it like the song of a warm, warm body loving your touch

[Verse 2]
In the court they carve your legend with an apple in its jaw
And the women that you wanted, they get their laughs
Long silk stockings on the bedposts of refinement
You're too raw, they think you're too raw
It's the judgement of the moon and stars, your solitary path
Draw yourself a bath

[Chorus]
Think what you'd like to have for supper
Or take a walk, a park, a bridge, a tree, a river
Revoked but not yet cancelled, the gift goes on
In silence, in a bell jar, still a song

[Verse 3]
You've got to shake your fists at lightning now
You've got to roar like forest fire
You've got to spread your light like blazes all across the sky
They're going to aim the hoses on you
Show 'em you won't expire
Not till you burn up every passion, not even when you die

[Verse 4]
Come on now, you've got to try
If you're feeling contempt, well then you tell it
If you're tired of the silent night, Jesus, well then you yell it
Condemned to wires and hammers
Strike every chord that you feel
That broken trees and elephant ivories conceal
It's ...
...
Unexpected moment
The most inopportune

Some see the flesh
Before they see the bones
Some see the bones before
Before they see the flesh

It's ...
...
Unexpected moment
The most inopportune

Some never see the bones at all
Some never see the flesh at all
Some never see the flesh at all
Oh never never flesh at all

To explain
I was meant to exorcise his pain
I was meant to exorcise
Ba da da dum, ba da da
Torn to pieces, limb from limb
From there be broken beyond repair
Here's what the pebble of reforging
Some may enter that is easy failure

Torn to pieces, limb from limb
From there be broken beyond repair
Here's what the pebble of reforging
Some mention at easy failure

To explain
I was meant to exorcise his pain
I was meant to exorcise

Some never see the bones at all
Some never see the flesh at all
Some never see the flesh at all
Oh never never flesh at all

To explain
I was meant to exorcise his pain
I was meant to exorcise his pain
I was meant to exorcise his pain
I was meant to exorcise his pain
I was meant to exorcise his pain
I was meant to exorcise his pain
I was meant to exorcise his pain
I was meant to exorcise
Old Train, I can hear your whistle blow
And I want to be jumping on again
Old Train, I've been everywhere you go
And I know what lies beyond each bend

Old Train, each time you pass
You're older than the last
And it seems I'm too old for running
I hear your rusty wheels grate against the rails
They cry with every mile
And I think I'll stay awhile

Old Train, I grow weary at the miles
And I miss the freedom that was mine
Old Train, just to think about those times
I'll smile when you're highballing by

Old Train, each time you pass
You're older than the last
And It seems I'm too old for running
I hear your rusty wheels grate against the rails
They cry with every mile
And I think I'll stay awhile

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques'fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
And lastly through a hogshead of real fire
In this way Mr. K will challenge the world

The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feats on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late
Messers K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry the Horse dances the waltz
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
You took me way back in the country
You fed me on love and greens
You laid my head upon a feather bed
And I sure had some mighty sweet dreams

Don't you know we got something going on
You and me, me and you
Love can be a song if you like the tune
So sing to me, I'll sing to you
It goes ooh -
Just let the feelings flow
It goes ooh -
That's the way our love song goes

Mornings come easy in the country
Never had this feeling before
Ever since you found me
Love has been around me
And I'll never be lonely no more

Don't you know we got something going on
You and me, me and you
Love can be a song if you like the tune
So sing to me, I'll sing to you
It goes ooh -
Just let the feelings flow
It goes ooh -
That's the way our love song goes

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Witches gather at black masses
Bodies burning in red ashes
On the hill the church in ruins
Is the scene of evil doings
It's the place for all black sinners
Watch them eating dead rat's innards
I guess it's the same
Wherever you may go
Oh, Lord, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Carry banners which denounce the lord
See me rocking in my grave
See them anoint my head with dead rat's blood
See them stick this stake through me
Lord hold me back I just gotta go
They got a hold of my soul now
Lord can my brain escape what blood I'm seeing
Look in my eyes and bear it all, yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
On the scene, a priest appears
Sinners falling at his knees
Satan sends out funeral pyre
Casts the priest into the fire
It's the place for all bad sinners
Watch them eating dead rat's innards
I guess its the same
Wherever you may go
Oh, Lord, yeah!

[Instrumental Outro]
Be careful, it's my heart
It's not my watch you're holding, it's my heart
It's not the note that I sent you that you quickly burned
It's not a book I lent you that you never returned
Remember, it's my heart

This heart with which so willingly I part
It's yours to take, to keep or break
But please, before you start
Be careful, it's my heart

[Verse 1]
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide-open sea
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old willow tree
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawn's early light

[Verse 2]
In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And he'll show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon
And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
"Hey, bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side"
And he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly

[Verse 3]
In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow
Underneath the street lamps

[Verse 4]
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
Well, he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky
And he aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love

[Outro]
In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam
It starts with just a little glance now
Right away you're thinkin' 'bout romance now
You know you ought to take it slower
But you just can't wait to get to know her

A brand new love affair is such a beautiful thing
But if you're not careful think about the pain it can bring

It makes you feel so bad
It makes your heart feel sad
It makes your days go wrong
It makes your nights so long

You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Right now you think that she's perfection
This time is really an exception
Well you know I hate to be a downer
But I'm the guy she left before you found her
Well I'm not saying you won't have a good love with her
But I keep on remembering things like they were

She made me feel so bad
She made my heart feel sad
She made my days go wrong
And made my nights so long

You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
Jungle cats battling through musty brush
Monkey's ciphering with fly feather birds with
Unincarcerated visions, signified dandelions get
Crushed by overstressed orangutans, just to let
Mama nature know they ain't no joke
While bad ass boa constrictors squeeze out life
And as hot as day, night makes no opportunity to let the natives do their thing
I believe that hip hop is so universal that
It has already invaded the rainforest
And endangered species know exactly what it is truly
It's just a little sad that negative inevitably follows the most righteous
Next we got flaw skin sex hitting switches, right next to Versace rocking bullfrog bitches flashy nasty piranhas with platinum front teeth
But whatever the case may be, true hip hop will remain underground
Where ants and moles hold it down
With basement parties bumping Gym Class Heroes and Brain games
All the same, I myself may never make it to the rainforest
But we share a common love
That's just me thinking out loud again, let me stop
It's ten A. M. And I just woke up
Walked to the window and opened the shades up
Sun so bright that I can hardly see
But I'm a black man
So I pass on a tan
Dip to the bathroom take me a shower
But first called up my girl told her be ready in an hour
I was still a bit tired man I'm laggin'
Grabbed the tooth brush to kil the dragon
Ooh have mercy great day in the morning
Turn on the water and I'm stretchin' and yawnin'
Tryin' to get a blender to hot with the cold
Man I'm young but why I feel so old
Get it just right then step to the mirror
Rubbin' my eyes to make my vision get clearer
Everything looks a-o. K
And today is gonna be a lovely day
1 - (a lovely day)
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
So I jet out the crib and hop in the benzo
Today is my girls day and all of my friends go
Just me and her top down on the highway
If you're gonna do it then why not do it the fly way
First a car wash next the barber shop
Then off to my girls crib that's my next stop
A dozen roses a card and candy
I'm a true mackadocious mr. Romanty
She hoped in and she asked where we're goin'
Yo we like a twig in the nile we just flowin'
Maybe to the beach or maybe hook up a picnic
But yo it doesn't matter cause today we just kickin' it
I threw in my homemade slow tape
And off to the beach for some beautiful landscape
Man this is a bonafide lovers delight
Got the ocean on the left the mountains on the right
I said yeah cause that's the way I was feelin'
Free as a bird got the clouds for a ceiling
I wish that I could rest my gas and fly away
Today has been a lovely day
Repeat 1
It's dark outsid
Ah...
Well, I been working up a fever trying to
Straighten up the mess in my mind about this place
I can't contain myself anymore
Can't you see it's written all over my face
Why don't you get on your feet
It's about time you got to think
What ever happened to peace
Well open your eyes and you'll see children laughing
Voices singin', hearts a-beatin' ah...

You're always talkin' right and talkin about
The world and its corruption and moral decay
But what you gonna do about it, nothing
'cause you're more like children than children while they play
Why, you're so clean through and through you won't shake hands
With a negro who's maybe cleaner then you
Well listen around and you'll hear children laughin'
Voices singin', hearts a-beatin' like they always do
So what's wrong with you, ah...
You're so blown up with anger about the world
You write the songs about
Yet you don't even know your neighbors name
Now you want to go the the moon and live there
When you know it'll only end up the same
How can he give you any gratitude
With your endless sickenin' attitude
You strive to get ahead
But you leave each other dead
Can't you see, children laughin'
Voices singin', hearts beatin' like they always do
So what's wrong with you, ah...

Children laughin', voices singin' hearts beatin'
Children laughin', voices singin
I know perfectly well
I'm not where I should be
I've been very aware
You've been patient with me

Every time we break up
You bring back your love to me
And after all I've done to you
How can it be

You still believe in me

I try hard to be more
What you want me to be
But I can't help how I act
When you're not here with me

I try hard to be strong
But sometimes I fail myself
And after all I've promised you
So faithfully
You still believe in me

I wanna cry...

[Intro: Ronald Isley & Gordon Chambers]
La da da da da da
I just came here to chill
Oh

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley & Gordon Chambers]
We been kickin' it for quite some time
Lots of private parties where we're wined and dined
Tonight I'm in a different mood
Just want to get close to you
(No RSVP necessary)
Tonight it's me and you, girl

I just came here to chill
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]
You're a special lady
The world can see
Nobody makes a room shine
Like you and me (Nobody, nobody)
You always know just what to wear
Nails just right, lovely hair
No need to put your makeup on
I'm not Mr. Biggs, 'cause tonight I'm just Ronald Isley

[Chorus: Ronald Isley & Gordon Chambers]
Didn't bring my diamonds
You don't have to put a dress on

See I, I just came here to chill

[Bridge: Ronald Isley & Gordon Chambers]
I don't mind a little champagne
But no private chefs or restaurants
Just a little home cookin' on the spot, yeah
No invitations with our names
No shakin' hands with all the you-know-whos
My focus is on you

[Chorus: Ronald Isley & Gordon Chambers]
Didn't bring my diamonds
You don't have to put a dress on
See I, I just came here to chill

The party's only you and me
See I, I just came here to chill

[Bridge: Ronald Isley & Gordon Chambers]
No Escalades parked in the valet
(Parked in the valet)
No red-eye flights, I'm stayin' in LA
No movie stars with fancy cars
No backstage passes to the latest show
Tell R. Kelly we ain't coming no
No relatives, no friends we know
'Cause I just came here to chill

[Chorus: Ronald Isley & Gordon Chambers]
Didn't bring my diamonds
You don't have to put a dress on
I just came here to chill
There'll be no other VIP
The party's only you and me
See I, I just came here to chill

[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white

[Outro]
And may all your Christmases be white
May they be white
Be white

[Intro]
MC T on a hit and to make sure I don't miss
Kick the beat as this fool persists

[Verse 1]
Step off me, get the hell off, well I'm riding
Flowing with this funky beat, you suckers keep on tryin'a
Diss this, uh-uh, I ain't having it
Sucker duck, understand my schedule work too heavy
I'm a man, I mean, sometimes it seems hammer claim
But I can still cop a lean and explain to you
An MC who's got beef, I'm giving grief to disbelief
You said that I was new to this well put me on your hit list
I'm 'quipped to rule, and I squash all the bull

[Hook]
We got our own ideas!
We got our own ideas!
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Antogonistic action, it's just a fraction
Of what I feel for you, I'll take my time in a rhyme
Yo, let's bust a move, I'm steppin' with confidence
Yes I know it's evident, a backseat to you that's irrelevant
You see it's like this, you shot and missed, and now it's my turn
You learn, you mess with the fire, you burn. and it's a heat up
Situation sticky
You're the duck, huh, I won't be picky, I'm bassin'
You're chasing a dream that I'm livin'
You stupid pigeon, cause even with the high flow, I keep a low pro
You step off on me, and that's a sho' nuff n.o
I mean a no-go
Yeah, something like that

[Hook]
We got our own ideas! (yeah, yeah)
We got our own ideas! (yeah, yeah)

Fuck it, you're tryin' to step on my tip, yeah

[Verse 3]
I'm a brother with a purpose (pump it up, T)
So I'll take my time and serve this right
Despite the negativity
Never want society to get the best of me
You sold out, just another fool, holdin' out
On the pockets of my brothers tryin' to get clout
Step back, cast the vapors, your vision's blurred, check out my behaviour
Calm, cool, never sweat the issue (so what you're saying?)
What I'm saying is that we're past due
Gotta stand up and be counted, can't you see the trouble keeps mountin', boy
And I won't stand for it, so get off
Cause I'm about to have a fit
You can't step unless you step legit
Enough talk y'all, this is it, let's get ill with this
Yeah, yeah

[Modified Hook]
Suckers are trying to step off on my tip
We got our own ideas!
Suckers are trying to step off on my tip
We got our own ideas!
Suckers are trying to step off on my tip
We got our own ideas!
Suckers are trying to step off on my tip

[Verse 4]
As I roast, you toast - can't stand the heat of the aftermath
The worst you ran with you dis just to get a laugh
The brother you ridiculed
They say you're the king of rules
Yeah, time for school, time for walking
I'm stalking, you're talking
As you run your mouth down, I'm chalking up another way of
Gettin' paid in dividends
In the end, my friend, its just a verbal blend
Yeah, get with that

[Modifed Hook]
What's up?
We got our own ideas! (yeah)
What's up?
We got our own ideas! (yeah)
Brothers be jocking, freaks keep clocking
Brothers be jocking, skeezers are clocking

[Outro]
Trying to get to this
Clocking, I got my own ideas

See ya next year, 91, in full effect

We got our own ideas! (yeah, yeah)

Wants every downtown man she meet

Don't tell me not to stare at you
I see the danger in your eyes
I would go anywhere with you
Into your private paradise
Into your bedroom point of view
Into the depth of hell for you
I would lead where others would not try
By your side

Think about it, don't worry
Take a lifetime, don't hurry
Doesn't matter what your game is

Pray for the sacred and the strong

Into your bedroom point of view
Into your private paradise
Open the gates and let me through
Into the depth of hell for you
I would lead where no other man would try
Oh by your side
I can't speak
Think about it, don't worry
Take a lifetime, don't hurry
Don't you blame me 'cause I love you
What your game is, yeah
I'd like to play with your toys

Barker sing me a song
Instead of counting trees
Collecting aeroplane numbers now, Mr. Barker
Live it up, shine my shoes
Fly me to the moon
Never before have I seen the light, Mr. Barker
Then the moment of depression fell around, Mr. Barker
And the changes of expression to a frown, My friend Barker
There must be something there
Shiner of the light, we demand we are here, Mr. Barker
Then the moment of depression fell around, Mr. Barker
And the changes of expression to a frown, my friend Barker
There must be something there
Shiner of the light, we demand we are here, Mr. Barker

Collecting aeroplane numbers now, Mr. Barker
Live it up, shine my shoes
Fly me to the moon
Never before have I seen the light
Barker sing me a song
Instead of counting trees
Collecting aeroplane numbers now, Mr. Barker
Live it up, shine my shoes
Fly me to the moon
Nnever before have I seen the light
I couldn't figure why
You couldn't give me what everybody needs
I shouldn't let you kick me when I'm down
My baby
I find out everybody knows that
You've been using me
I'm surprised you
Let me stay around you
One day I'm gonna lift the cover
And look inside your heart
We gotta level before we go
And tear this love apart
There's no fight you can't fight this battle of love with me
You win again, so little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth, no other could see me through
You win again, some never try but if anybody can, we can
And I'll be, I'll be following you
Following you, oh girl
Oh baby, I shake you from now on
I'm gonna break down your defenses, one by one
I'm gonna hit you from all sides, lay your fortress open wide
Nobody stops this body from taking you
You better beware, I swear
I'm gonna be there one day when you fall
I could never let you cast aside
The greatest love of all
There's no fight you can't fight this battle of love with me
You win again, so little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth, no other could see me through
You win again, some never try but if anybody can, we can
And I'll be, I'll be following you
Following you
You win again, so little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth, no other could see me through
You win again, some never try but if anybody can, we can
And I'll be, I'll be following you
Following, following you
You win again, so little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth, no other could see me through
You win again, some never try but if anybody can, we can
There's no fight you can't fight this battle of love with me
You win again, so little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth, no other could see me through
You win again, some never try but if anybody can, we can
There's no fight you can't fight this battle of love with me
You win again, so little time, we do nothing but compete
When I feel the need for something
And I don't know what it is
I just think of the first thing
That comes to my mind
It's my baby, it's my baby
Every time

When I get the taste for something
And I don't know what it is
I just think of the one thing
That I'm really missing
It's my baby's kiss, it's my baby's sweet kisses
Every time

For every locked door
My baby has a key
'cause she can cure everything
That's ever wrong with me

When my arms reach out for something
And I don't know what it is
I just close, close my eyes
And the first thing I visualise
It's my sweet baby, my baby
Every time
When I feel the need for something
My baby, my baby

When I get the taste for something
My baby, my baby

When my arms reach out for something
My baby, my baby

When I get the need for something
My baby, my baby

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Listen baby

[Verse 1]
You need direction, love and affection
Someone to be there, a man that truly cares
Put your trust in me, and I will set you free
I know of a better place
And I happen to be going that way

[Chorus]
Take a ride, with me, baby
On a highway that leads to love
Come with me, sail free under the sky way
Just both of us
Take a ride, with me, baby
On a highway that leads to love
Come with me, sail free under the sky way
Just both of us

[Verse 2]
Relax, enjoy the ride
'Cause soon we will be there
Leave troubles way behind
'Cause joy is waiting there
So hold on to my hand
Picture us on an island
Making love under pouring rain
You and me will be like castaway

[Chorus]
Take a ride, with me, baby
On a highway that leads to love
Come with me, sail free under the sky way
Just both of us
Take a ride, with me, baby
On a highway that leads to love
Come with me, sail free under the sky way
Just both of us

[Bridge]
Soon we'll reach our destiny
Once were there we'll know we're free
Your body screaming as we lay
Girl, our love, take us away

[Chorus]
Take a ride, with me, baby
On a highway that leads to love
Come with me, sail free under the sky way
Just both of us
Take a ride, with me, baby
On a highway that leads to love
Come with me, sail free under the sky way
Just both of us

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Take a ride, with me, baby
On a highway that leads to love
Come with me, sail free under the sky way
Just both of us
Take a ride, with me, baby
On a highway that leads to love
Come with me, sail free under the sky way
Just both of us
Well My bad luck is falling, falling down like rain
Bad luck is falling, falling down like rain
No matter why I do, seems like my luck won't never change

I felt kinda lucky
My luck was running slow
The last hand I caught four aces
And the police broke down the door
I said, Lord
Lord, what can a poor boy do?
Well, ain't it bad when you can't make no money
Seems like all the bad breaks will come to you

Yeah, I got home this morning
She was looking kinda funny
She said, "Don't come in daddy
Daddy, unless you got some money"
And I said, Lord
Lord, what can a poor boy do?
Well, ain't it bad when you can't make no money
Without your woman turning her back on you
Well, now I asked my woman for some dinner
She looked at me like a fool
She said "I'm playing checkers, daddy
And I think it's your turn to move
I said, oh
Lord, what can a poor boy do?
Well, ain't it bad when you can't make no money
And your woman turning her back on you
We were live on arrival
Safe home at last
No cannon fire dockside
No flags half-mast

We were sold out for silver
And a string of black pearls
On the loneliest island
At the edge of the world

Like destiny's children
Souls lost at sea
No room on the lifeboat
You can hold on to me

Now the voyage is over
We're back on dry land
In our eyes are the stories
The rope and the brand

Like destiny's children
Souls lost at sea
No room on the lifeboat
You can hold on to me
Blues with a feeling
That's all I've got today
Blues with a feeling
That's all I've got today
I'm gonna find my baby
If it takes me all night and day

What a lonesome feeling
When you're sad and blue
What a lonesome feeling
When you're sad and blue
When the one you love
Has run off with somebody new

What a lonesome feeling
When you're sad and blue
What a lonesome feeling
When you're sad and blue
When the one you love
Has run off with somebody new
You better get up and do it now, you better get up, my friend, and how
The land that you love the best, is asking you to invest
With a personal request from Mr. Morgenthau
Dig down deep, to buy the bonds that buy the tanks
Palmers for our fighting Yanks, dig down deep
Dig down deep to buy the bonds that keep us free, supply the sky, the land and sea
Dig down deep. put your hand on your gismo, citizen, everybody must do his part
It's the easiest piece that the citizen to show the world we finish what we start
Dig down deep, the boys are giving all for you, so the least that you can do
Is dig down deep
I know someday we'll find a way
For the right words to say
Our love is here to stay

Chorus:
I'll always be here for you
(i'll always be here for you baby)
I think i'm falling for you
(i'm falling in love with you)
It's only you (you.. you.. oh..)
I think i love you..
Lord, it's a low down dirty baby
Low down shame the way you treat me
Yes, it's a low down dirty baby
Low down shame the way you treat me
Alright baby, have it the way you want it to be

Well, I ain't gonna cry, I ain't gonna cry no more
Yes, I ain't gonna cry, I ain't gonna cry no more
Well, I'm gonna tell you baby
I ain't gonna work no more

Well, a low down shame
Low down dirty shame
Yes, it's a low down dirty
Low down dirty shame
Well, to love someone
That you gonna (???)
Tell me how you been
Well, it's so good to be seein' you again
Lady, you're so fine
I wish there was a way I could share your time

I need someone in my life
'Cause I'm lonely, yeah, for your lovin'
You make me feel so alive
You're the woman and nobody else will do

That's why I'm aimin' at your heart, aimin'
Aimin' at your heart, aimin', aimin'
Aimin' at your heart, aimin'
Aimin' at your heart

Why don't you love me, don't be shy
Like the wings of an eagle, let your feelings fly
Precious shinin' star
Do I need me a rocket to be where you are

I need someone in my life
'Cause I'm lonely for your lovin'
Ooh, girl, you make me feel so alive
You're the woman and nobody else would do
That's why I'm aimin' at your heart, aimin'
Aimin' at your heart, aimin', aimin'
Aimin' at your heart, aimin'
Aimin' at your heart

Aimin' at your heart

And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
God bless you, please Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey

We'd like to know a little bit about your for our files
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself

Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home

And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey

Hide in the hiding place where no one ever goes
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes

Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids

Jesus loves you more than you will know
God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey

Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidate's debate
Laugh about it, shout about it
When you've got to choose
Every way you look at this you lose

Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio
Our nation turns it's lonely eyes to you
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson
Jotting Joe has left and gone away

Slow it down for a minute now baby

Don't seem like my old lady
Let's go and play the song we used to play
Can we reignite the flame
'Cause things just ain't the same

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We can talk (...)
We can talk until we're crazy
We can focus on it now
Or we can focus on it later
We can start another fight
We can argue and fuss all night
But I propose that we go to the floor
And we slow dance

[Chorus]
Tonight I wanna dance
Can you do that with your man, yeah?
Tonight I wanna groove
And let the music make you move
Move, yeah

[Verse 2]
Can we wait just a minute
Turn that TV off for a minute

Let's go and play the songs we used to play
On that old school radio
Let the music soothe your soul

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Forget about the world
I'm groovin' with my girl
Forget about the news
Let's put on our dancin' shoes
Let's not talk about the war
Don't know what they're fightin' for
I propose that we go to the floor
And we slow dance

Tonight I wanna dance
Can you do that with your man, yeah?
Tonight I wanna groove
And let the music make you move

I have been lying under a pillow of dreams
And feeling moments of swimming in cream
This is the start of the end, Goodbye
Hours of facing my life, have damned

You are a good friend
Friendly as good friends can be
Your father wants you to live on his knee
This is the start of the end, climb by me
Red sides and blue sides within, remind me

I have been lying under a pillow of dreams
And feeling moments of swimming in cream
This is the start of the end, Goodbye
Hours of facing my life, have damned
When I stop loving you
The way I do
There'll be no moon to shine
No sky of blue

When our two lips
No longer cling
There'll be no bird to sing
There'll be no spring

When I stop wanting you
Forever more
There'll be no ocean waves
To kiss the shore

This world will crumble
And the skies will fall
My heart won't beat at all
When I stop loving you

This world will crumble
And the skies will fall
My heart won't beat at all
When I stop loving you
Do I want to be with you as the years come and go?
Only forever if you care to know
Would I grant all your wishes and be proud of the task
Only forever if someone should ask

How long would it take me to be near if you beckon
Offhand I would figure, less than a second
Do you think I'll remember how you looked when you smiled
Only forever, that's putting it mild

[Intro]
Oh, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ah, oh, look it here

[Verse 1]
(The lights go out)
The lights go out, the smell of doom
Is creepin' into your lonely room
The bed's on fire, your fate is sealed
And you're so tired and the reason is Camille ('Mille)

[Chorus]
Shockadelica, the girl must be a witch
She got your mind, body, and soul hitched
Shockadelica, you need a second opinion
But she never wears a stitch so you can't take her home

[Verse 2]
She got you tied with a golden rope
She won't let you play your guitar
And when you've cried enough, maybe she'll let you up
For a nasty ride in her shockadeli-car, she'll make you beg, girl (Please)

[Chorus]
Shockadelica got you in a trance
'Cause when this woman says, "Dance," you dance
Shockadelica, you need a second opinion
But you just can't leave her alone, with her you got no mind of your own

[Post-Chorus]
Shockadelica, Shockadelica
Doobie, doobie, doobie, yeah
Shockadelica, Shockadelica
Doobie, doobie, Shockadelica

[Verse 3]
The lights go out, the smell of doom
Again, it's creepin' into your lonely room
Is this a dream or is this real? (Or is this real?)
Or is this just a mirage you feel?
Shockadelica, Shockadelica

[Chorus]
Shockadelica, she must be witch
She got your mind, body, and soul hitched
Shockadelica, you need a second opinion
She never wears a stitch, you can't take her home
Shockadelica, she got you in a trance
When this girl say, "Dance," baby, baby, baby, you dance
Shockadelica, you dance and you dance
You dance, you dance, you— ohh

[Post-Chorus]
Shockadelica (She must be a witch, yeah, she got my mind)
Shockadelica, doobie, doobie, yeah (Body, and soul hitched)
Shockadelica (I need a second, I need a second opinion)
Shockadelica, doobie, doobie, doobie

[Verse 4]
The lights go out, the smell of doom
Again is creeping into your lonely room (Is this a dream?)
Is this a dream? Or is this real? (Or is it just a mirage?)
Or is this just a mirage you feel (Is this just a mirage?)
Is it just a mirage? (Is this just a mirage?)
Or is it just a mirage? (Or is this just a mirage?)
Or is it just a mirage? (Or is this just a mirage?)
Or is it just a mirage?
Shockadelica
Searching for fragments of old yesterday
I stand at the edge of my childhood to find
I long for the shadows that danced at the end of the day...
How delicate the tracery of her fine lines
Like the moonlight lacetops of the evening pines
Like a song half heard through a closed door
Like an old book when you cannot read the writing anymore

How innocent her visage as my child lover lies
Pressed against the rainswept windy windows of my eyes
Like an antique etching glass design
That somehow turned out wrong
I keep looking through old varnish
At my late lover's body
Caught on ancient canvas
And decaying...disappearing
Even as I sing this song

How secretly and silently my sorrow disappears
You can't see it with your eyes or hear it with your ears
It's like a Watermark that's never there and never really gone
I keep looking through old varnish
At my late lover's body
Caught on ancient canvas
And decaying...disappearing
Even as I sing this song
Even as I sing this song
Even as I sing this song
Long distance information
Give me Memphis, Tennessee
Try to find the party
Trying to get in touch with me
She would not leave her number
But I know who placed the call
'cause my uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information
Get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here
From Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side
Just beyond the ridge
Just a half a mile
From the Mississippi Bridge

Help me, information
More than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her
And all the fun we had
We were pulled apart
Because her mom would not agree
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee
The last time I saw Marie
She was waving me goodbye
With hurry homedrops on her cheek
That trickled from her eyes
Marie is only six years old
Information please
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee
My baby moves at midnight
Goes right on till the dawn
My woman takes me higher
My woman keeps me warm
What you doin' on your back aah
What you doin'on your back aah?
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah
She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman gives me power
Goes right down to my blood
What you doin' on your back aah
What you doin'on your back aah?
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah
My baby moves at midnight
Goes right on till the dawn
My woman takes me higher
My woman keeps me warm
What you doin' on your back aah
What you doin'on your back aah?
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah

Ooh, take a stroll through your mind sometime

[Bridge: Dennis Edwards, Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin]
Welcome to the circles, yeah
Yes, we'll decide, shorty - you dig?
'Cause you people look at us like we're freaks
Dingdongding, ain't no big thing, yeah

There is no young, there is no old
Reach out and touch your soul
Tell me, have you ever been off the ground
For a long, nice and slow, here we go

[Verse 3: Paul Williams]
Seems like every Monday morning I've got the blues
And every Tuesday, listen, I get some bad news
Listen, Wednesday's worse 'cause I ain't got a dime to my name
I done worked so hard all week
Thursday, my body iust racked with pain
Here come the good part
Friday the eagle flies, huh, and so do I
I wonder do you hear me when I said
The eagle flies on Friday and so do I
Yeah, just music

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks]
Take a stroll through your mind sometime
You'll be surprised at what you might find
Take a stroll through your mind sometime
You'll be surprised at what you might find, yeah
I remember romance
Bubblebaths at night
Breakfast in the afternoon
Love by candlelight
Love by candlelight

I remember romance
And lying in her arms
Her hair across my shoulder
Her breast upon my arm
So soft upon my arm

I remember romance
And laughing at the moon
Dancing at the rainbow's end
And losing her too soon
And losing her too soon

I know we both are sorry
I know we both still care
Oh how could we have lost it
A love beyond compare
A love beyond compare
Hey, yeah - I wanna shoop, baby

Na, na, na, na, na, na, baby
(My heart)
With my heart
There's somethin' about the ocean rising up to meet the shoreline
Somethin' about a river the way it runs to meet the sea
There's somethin' about a rainfall and it's like the gift of living
There's somethin' about the water that makes me sing
Oh, somethin' about the mountains rising right straight up to heaven
And somethin' about a canyon in the shade of a cottonwood tree
Somethin' about the desert in the afterglow of evening
There's somethin' about the west that makes me sing
There's somethin' about the way you love me baby
There's somethin' about the way your lips meet mine
There's somethin' about the way you like to touch me
It really turns me on and makes my little light shine

There's somethin' about the way you love me baby
There's somethin' about the way your lips meet mine
There's somethin' about the way you like to touch me
It really turns me on and makes this little light shine
There's somethin' about the forest in the latter days of August
There's somethin' about the country on the very first day of springtime
There's somethin' about a wheatfield, oh you know I love the prairie
There's somethin' about the land that makes me sing
This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we've ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and Spring were new
I'm not afraid of Autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames and love live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and I'll smile

I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and I'll smile
A diamond necklace played the pawn
Hand in hand some drummed along, oh
To a handsome man and baton
A blind class aristocracy
Back through the opera glass you see
The pit and the pendulum drawn
Columnated ruins domino

Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping?

Hung velvet overtaken me
Dim chandelier awaken me
To a song dissolved in the dawn
The music hall a costly bow
The music, all is lost for now
To a muted trumpeter swan
Columnated ruins domino

Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping, Brother John?
Dove-nested towers the hour was
Strike the street quicksilver moon
Carriage across the fog
Two-step to lamp lights cellar tune
The laughs come hard in auld lang syne

The glass was raised, the fired rose
The fullness of the wine, the dim last toasting
While at port, adieu or die

A choke of grief hard hardened I
Beyond belief, a broken man too tough to cry

Surf's up, mm mm mm
Aboard a tidal wave
Come about hard and join
The young and often spring you gave
I heard the word
Wonderful thing
A children's song

Child, child, child, child, child
The child is father of the man
Child, child, child, child, child
The child is father of the man
A children's song
Have you listened as they played?
Their song is love
And the children know the way

That's why the child is father of the man
Child, child, child, child, child
Child, child, child, child, child
Na na na na na na na na
Child, child, child, child, child
That's why the child is father of the man
Child, child, child, child, child
I'm just a lonesome ship passing through the night
I'm just a lonesome bird flyin' on a midnight flight

All I got for you is me
So darlin' can't you see
We'll make love all through the night
Make love all through the night

Lay your troubles down on the chair
You've got to shake those blues right out your hair

I'm just a lonesome ship passing through the night
I'm just a lonesome bird flyin' makin' a midnight flight
(Chorus)x2
Hey let em talk, Let em hate
It aint my fault they at the bottom, let em stay
Let em say whatever. Let em lie
Let em snitch, let em bleed, let em die

(T.I.)
Been through whatever together
I mean whatever the case
My partnas tell on me, never
We'll do whatever it take
Had no idea in the world
When we was peddlin' yay
That we'd be on top of the world
And still be together today
Man all we got is eachother
This bond aint never gon' break
You know they say never say never
Well I say never today
Don't care whatever the charge
Be it Federal or State
Don't care whoever the broad
And he made whatever mistake
No talking down on the squad
Just know whatever you say
You would be straighten my nigga??
Check you right there in your face
I hear you hatin on my nigga
Well Ima tell him you hate
Came in the gates wit my niggas
And dats right where Ima stay
Don't matter what the conditions dat he run in wit police
We there the day that he sentenced
Be there the day he released
And all the days in between
You get whatever from me
Take care of the house and the kids
And girl she get whatever she needs

Shh

Watch as the room rocks, mentally moonwalk
Mixed media slangs banging in your boom-box
Verbal violence, lyrical stylist
In a time when rock/hip-hop rhymes are childish
You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
Rapping to a beat doesn't make you an emcee
Lack of skills and facility you're killing me
And a DJ in your group just for credibility
I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes
You're not an emcee if someone else writes your lines
Rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
'Cause rock and hip-hop been collaborating for years
But now they're getting randomly mixed-and-matched up
All after a fast buck and all the tracks suck
So how does it stack up? None of it's real
You wanna be an emcee, then help us out yall, come on!

Mr. Hahn!

Check this out
Co-co-co-co-coming at you
Co-Coming at-co-coming at you
Peep the style and the kids checking for it
The number one question is how could you ignore it
LP back in the cut over basement tracks
With raps that got you backing this up like, rewind that
We're just rolling with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life living
Not to be forgotten but still unforgiven
But in the meantime there are those
Who want to talk this and that so I suppose
That it gets to a point feelings got to get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt, Chester!

I try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me (You say it!)
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening (That's right!)
Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
I told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening
Yup!

This song is called "It's Going Down", you ready?
Help me out, yall!

When I say it's going, you say down!
It's going - Down!
It's going - Down!
When I say it's going, you say down!
It's going - Down!
It's going - Down!
When I say it's going, you say down!
It's going - Down!
It's going - Down!
When I say it's going, everybody down
When I say it's going, you say down!
It's going - Down!
Check it out, It's going down
The rhythm projects around the next sound
Reflects a complex hybrid dialect now
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down
The melting pot, of a super-futuresque style
The combination of a vocal caress, with lungs that gasp for breath
From emotional stress, with special effects, and a distorted collage
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage
It's going down

The logical progression on the time line
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey now, it's going down

A logical progression on the time line
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
(You guys ready?) Take you on an audible odyssey now, it's going down

Put it out for the world to see
LP and X-Men to the tenth degree (It's going down!)
Nobody in the world is safe when we melt down the wax in your record crate (It's going down!)
Put it out for the world to see, LP and X-Men to the tenth degree (It's going down!)
Nobody in the world is safe when we melt down the wax in your record crate

Ladies and Gentlemen, make some noise for our DJ
He goes by the name "Mr. Hahn"
You wanna listen to a little bit of Mr. Hahn right now?
We'll do it like, We'll drop the beat now, come on!
Mr. Hahn

If your feeling that then make some noise!
Yes? Your feeling it? Make some noise on this side, go!
People on this side, make some noise!

Thank you guys very much!

Thanks
This is my swan song
Whatever I do now, I do it well
This is my swan song
I fell in love with you I love you well
And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing
My love will build a castle in the air

This is my last chance
A chance to show the world that I am strong
This is my last dance
I'm walking off the floor where I belong
And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing
My love will build a castle in the air

La...

And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing
My love will build a castle in the air

This is my swan song
I fell in love with you
I love you well
I love you well
I love you well
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help from my friends
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?

No, I get by with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you but I know it's mine

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I just need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends
Life is just a bore
It's a drag to leave my door
Guess I'll have to say
I just cry my life away
I'll buy a top hat to brighten up my lonely life
And they can see that I've got the money for the things money brings

Put it on my head and each time I head to bed
Put it in a box near my dirty shoes an socks

I'll but a top hat to brighten up my lonely life
And they can see that I've got the money for the things money brings

I like that top hat
Do you?
Yes
Would you like to buy that?
Of course. how much is that ?
3 pound 6 then please sir 
Thank you
I'll but a top hat to brighten up my lonely life
And they can see that I've got the money for the things money brings
And until she comes and she brings me happiness
This is what I want , nothing more, nothing less

All alone for so long
All the hope I had in finding love was almost gone
Then an angel came along

Now I see (Now I see), 'cause I found my soulmate

You know, you know, la da da da da, la da
Love you so, babe, oh oh
You're all I need, baby

[Guitar solo]
Bye bye baby
Remember you're my baby
When they give you the eye
Although I know that you care
Won't you write and declare
That though on the loose
You are still on the square
I'll be gloomy
But send that rainbow to me
Then my shadows will fly
Though you'll be gone for a while
I know that I'll be smiling with my baby
By and by
(Bye, bye baby, so long!)
Bye bye baby (just you remember that you're my baby when.)
When they give you the eye
(And although we know that you care
You just write and declare)
That though on the loose
You are still on the square
I'll be gloomy (gloomy)
But send that rainbow to me
(Then the shadows will fly)
Though you'll be gone for a while
I know that I'll be smiling with my baby by and by
With my baby by and by (bye, bye baby)

[Verse 1]
Wished I could sing you
Sing you the song I sang once, brown eyed girl
(Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
If you could deal with it, baby, I would, girl
(I would, girl) Sing it all night
You want a lover
You need not look no further than my shadow
(Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
Time passes slowly here without you, baby
Nothing's new
Here in the darkness, all is still
Needing you near me, if you will

[Chorus]
Brown eyed girl (Well)
Brown eyed girl
Brown eyed girl (Well)

[Bridge]
No, I just don't have
Just don't have the time now, baby, no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, baby
Wish that I, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well (Well), well (Well)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wish that I
Wished I could tell you, tell you the thoughts
Tell you the thoughts I'm thinking, brown eyed girl
(Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
If I could deal with it, baby, I would
Tell it all now
Been writing you letter that unfolds
Telling you secrets of my soul, oh

[Outro]
Brown eyed girl (Well)
Brown eyed girl
Oh, brown eyed girl
Brown eyed girl
Brown eyed girl (Brown eyed, brown eyed, yeah)
Brown eyed girl
Brown eyed girl (Yeah, hey, hey, hey)
Brown eyed girl (Yeah)
Brown eyed girl (Brown eyed, brown eyed girl, yeah)
Brown eyed girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Brown eyed girl (Ooh, hoo, hoo, brown eyed, I love you)
Brown eyed girl (I love you, girl, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Brown eyed girl (Well, well)
Brown eyed girl
Baby, I see this world has made you sad
Some people can be bad
The things they do, the things they say
But, baby, I'll wipe away those bitter tears
I'll chase away those restless fears
That turn your blue skies into gray

Why worry?
There should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
These things have always been the same
So why worry, now?
Why worry, now?

Baby, when I get down I turn to you
And you make sense of what I do
And, no, it isn't hard to say
But, baby, just when this world
Seems mean and cold
Our love comes shining red and gold
And all the rest is by the way
Why worry?
There should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
These things have always been the same
So why worry, now?
Why worry, now?

Why worry?
There should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
These things have always been the same
So why worry, now?
There should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
These things have always been the same
So why worry, now?
Why worry, now?
(Why worry? Why worry, now?)
(Repeat and Fade)
I 'm tired of tracing vapor trail, ghost letters in the sky
Living life in daydreams, watching precious time get by

Circle around this great big world, just chasing smoke, and never
Touching ground

Like a skywriter, rebel without a cause, drifting without an aim

But I can't seem to give up this flying game
I'm a wing walker, working without a net
That's all I've ever been
And I wonder if I'm ever coming down again

Some people say I'm losing touch with harsh reality
Because I can't accept the way it is with you and me
Stop living in the past, like some old pilot from a war that
Wouldn't end

Like a barnstormer, safe with my heart and wings
How could I ever fall
So serenely do I glide above it all
I'm a skywriter, I can't forget you yet
For whatever that it's worth

And sometimes I think I'm never coming back

Skywriter - I can't forget you yet
For whatever that it's worth

And sometimes I think I'm never coming back to earth
Went down last night to take a look around
Met little Sadie and I blew her down, went right home, went to bed
Forty-four colt smokes under my head
And I began to think what a deed I'd done
Grabbed my hat and away I run, made a good run, but a little too slow
They overtook me in Jericho
I'm standin' on the corner ringin' the bell
Along came the sheriff from Thomasville
Says "Young man, your name's Brown
Remember the night you blew Sadie down?"
Oh, yes sir, my name is Lee
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree
First degree and the second degree
Got any papers won't you read 'em to me
They took me downtown all dressed in black
Put me on the train and sent me back
Sent me back to the county jail, I had nobody to go for my bail
The judge and the jury they took the stand
The judge hold the paper in his right hand
Forty-one days, forty-one nights
Forty-one years to wear the ball and stripes

How soon the flame of love can die
How soon goodnight becomes goodbye
You're gone now and life goes on now
And everything seems out of tune

But time can bring a change of heart
And love can make another start
Someday, you may come back to me to stay
But who can say how soon
But who can say how soon
Since you've been gone
I've been walking around
With my head bowed down to my shoes
I've been living the blues
Every night without you
I don't have to go far
To know where you are
Strangers all give me the news
I've been living the blues
Every night without you
I think that it's best
I soon get some rest
And forget my pride
But I can't deny this feeling
That I carry for you deep down inside
If you'd see me this way
You'd come back and you'd stay
Oh, how could you refuse?
I've been living the blues
Every night without you
I think that it's best
I soon get some rest
And forget my pride
But I can't deny this feeling
That I carry for you deep down inside
If you'd see me this way
You'd come back and you'd stay
Oh, how could you refuse?
I've been living the blues
Every night without you
Image of mine are you just a myth
Aiming for the stars and a need to exist
Singing your life to its final bar
Staging all the scenes to avoid who you are

Idol of mine will you lead me on?
Build for me the dreams that I'm longing to own
Make me secure - be my fallacy
You are all my world if for only today

And live forevermore...

Heroes I call for you
Legend to feed my heart and soul
Heroes I cry for you
Legend will bleed your heart of soul
Somebody done changed
Somebody done changed the lock on that door
Somebody done changed
They done changed the lock on that door
'Cause the key I got won't fit that lock no more

Now I came home last night about half past ten
Tried to get the key in the lock but I couldn't get it in
'Cause somebody done changed
They done changed the lock on that door
'Cause the key I got won't fit that lock no more
I looked through the window to see what I could see
She was talking to someone else
I know it wasn't me
She said, "daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, you don't have to go
'Cause I done changed, I done changed that lock on my door"

She changed the bed around, even painted the door
She even changed the carpet, I mean on the floor
My baby changed
Oh she done changed the lock on my door
'Cause the key I got won't fit that lock no more
Well, I walked down the street, lookin' where I used to go
She's got a mean black snake, and I can't go there no more
My baby changed
She done changed the lock on my door
And the key I got won't fit that lock no more
I need somebody
I feel so lonely
Somebody to share
My scarcity
All cut from the world
(I need somebody)
Unrelated
(I need somebody)
(I need somebody)
This time I need somebody
(I need somebody)
To be family
(I need somebody)
(I need somebody)
Some to inspire
(I need somebody)
The dying fire
(I need my body)

Surrounded
The world
On top
Disconnected
Digging my soul
Holding my breath
To repossess
I need somebody
(I need somebody)
I feel so lonely
(I need somebody)
This time I need somebody
(I need somebody)
To be family
(I need somebody)
Some to inspire
(I need somebody)
The dying fire
(I need my body)

My heart
My heat
My sweat
My feet
I bleed
My bones
And my blood too
Need somebody
Is my body

But I loved her!

Girl, what you feel is for real
And believe me, it's okay

...led an enormous band. 
Oh, but I know he's very lucky too, because when Mingus dies there's gonna be the same funeral they had for Duke Ellington, in a big church and the whole country's going to say, wow, he was so far out, you know what i mean?
No man, no big church! I'm going to be buried man—I got my shit all figured out!
You're going to get a big funeral—you're famous!
Vedanta Society, India, I'm going to be buried in India!
I know, but you're going to get a big funeral in this country, and they'll play your music for two days. 
Who's going to do that?
It's far out isn't it, y'know what I mean?
You want me to hurry up, man!
No I don't want you to hurry up, but in the future, I know you're going to get a beautiful funeral, alright? I can see it. 
But I got it all planned, man!
You're going to be here many more years. 
You know the Vedanta Society in India? Yoga?
Yeah. 
Well I'm going to be buried by that church. 
Yeah?
So they gotta find another place to do it, that's all. 
Plenty of time to go. You have another fifty years. You're lucky!
Uh, Duke lived to be seventy-seven years old, right?
Right. 
I'm gonna cut him!
Coltrane was very strong, you know. 
I'm gonna cut Duke!

This Train she bound for glory this train
This Train she bound for glory!if you wanna get to Heven well you ought to be holy
Like a sound you hear
That lingers in your ear
But you can't forget
From sundown to sunset
It's all in the air
You hear it everywhere
No matter what you do
It's gonna grab a hold on you
California soul, California soul

They say the sun comes up every morning
And if you listen oh so carefully
The winds that ride on the high time
Whistle in melody
And so the people started to sing
And that's how the surf gave birth untold
To California soul, California soul

When you hear the beat
You wanna pat your feet
And you've got to move cause
It's really such a groove
Puts a brand new kind of thinkin' in your mind
And you can't go wrong
Cause you're groovin' all day long
California soul, California soul
They had the melody and the beat
But it still didn't seem complete
Until they saw two lovers kissin
They knew just what was missin
So happy they were rockin and reelin
Because that added that lovin feeling
To California soul, California soul
Like a sound you hear
That lingers in your ear
Oh Backstreet, one time, here we go

I could tell when I stepped in the room
And I saw you standing there
(????) by the way that your body moved
I couldn't help the way I stared
There was some mysterious force
Leading me here to you

So I stood there watching
And I was hypnotized
By the rhythm of you body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost inside your world with you

Chorus
Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms she's gotta be
Let's get it on
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ Mr. DJ please play it for me
Now it feels like it could be romance
As we dance across the floor
Every move that your body makes
Only makes me want you more
And it seems like time's movin' fast
How can we make it last
(make it last now) make it last somehow

As we keep on dancing
I am hypnotized
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in you eyes
I was lost inside your world with you

Chorus

Close your eyes (close your eyes)
And imagine (just imagine) the sound
Let the music (let the music) put you in a zone
I get lost lost inside a groove
When you do the things you do
Come on and work you body, work your body

Hey! Mr. DJ, jam all night long
Hey! Mr. DJ, play that song for me
Hey! Mr. DJ, jam all night long
Hey! Mr. DJ, play that song for me
Chorus

Keep it coming Mr. DJ
Repeat to fade

We felt that it's okay singing
Beatles songs and stuff but it's nice to leave 'em
With a bit of a message and the world being

In a kind of state as it is these days
We choose as one of our messages ecology
Because man, if we don't sort it out, not one will
So, that's gonna be the theme of today's show

Oobu joobu, ecology
Alright, let's go straight to the sound check
And this time it's in Las Vegas

(Jason Derulo)
Mmmm, that it's all for the best?
Of course, it is

[Verse 1]
I was so wrong for so long
Only tryna please myself
Girl, I was caught up in her lust
When I don't really want no one else, so no
Know I should have treated you better
But me and you were meant to last forever
So let me in, give me another chance
To really be your man

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do, yeah
But when I become a star we'll be living so large, I'll do anything for you
So tell me, girl

How could I live with myself
Knowing that I let our love go?
And ooh, what I'd do with one chance
I just gotta let you know
I know what I did wasn't clever
But me and you we're meant to be together
So let me in, give me another chance
To really be your man

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star we'll be living so large, I'll do anything for you

Tell me, tell me what to say, I

[Spoken Intro]
I mean everybody say, what if?
What if I could fly? What if man could fly for real?
Wouldn’t that be somethin'?
Man, I would surely touch the sky if I could just fly
You know we have our dreams
We always say, what if, what if this, what if that
What if you and me were together? What if?
Forever! I mean, eternity for real! What if?

Uh-huh, if, yeah, baby

[Verse 1]
Listen, if I were a painter, baby, I’d paint a picture of us
Somewhere on a private island makin' love, yeah
Now if I were a pirate, baby, I’d discover, yeah
You for me 'cause girl you are a treasure, yeah
If I was a dream, baby, here’s what I’d do
Allow every good dream you dream to come true, yeah
If I were a promise baby, then you could bet, yeah
That every promise made to you girl will be kept, yes, it would
If I was a magician baby, then you’d have no fear
'Cause I’d snap my fingers and make your worries disappear
If I were...

[Chorus]
If I were all these things then girl to you I’d give all these things
Fly you straight to Heaven and step with you while the angels sing
I’d ask you to marry me, give you the sun for a diamond ring
If I could, I’d do those things

[Verse 2]
Now, if I were a preacher, baby, my sermon would be
About how God opened up Heaven and rained you on me, yeah
If I was a doctor, baby, I surely would
Give you somethin' for your pain that’ll make you feel real good
Now, if I were a psychic, baby, then our love would last
'Cause I’d go into the future
And prevent all break ups from comin' to pass
Lord, if I were feeling down, baby, and really goin' through
All friends are gone then I know that I can count on you
One more, if we were at a club, baby, and this jam came on
I’d grab you by the hand and tell you, "Let’s step to this song"
If I were...

[Chorus]
If I were all these things then girl to you I’d give all these things
Fly you straight to Heaven and step with you while the angels sing
I’d ask you to marry me, give you the sun for a diamond ring
Baby, if I could, I’d do those things

[Bridge]
If I could blink my eye and be a giant eagle in the sky
Girl, I would swoop down and fly you straight into the sun
Ooh, if I could pick a number out of every number, girl, you’d be
My number one, oh oh, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
If I were all these things then girl to you I’d give all these things
Fly you straight to Heaven and step with you while the angels sing
I’d ask you to marry me, give you the sun for a diamond ring
If I could, I’d do those things

If I were all these things then girl to you I’d give all these things
Fly you straight to Heaven and step with you while the angels sing
I’d ask you to marry me, give you the sun for a diamond ring
If I could, I’d do those things

If I were all these things then girl to you I’d give all these things
Fly you straight to Heaven and step with you while the angels sing
I’d ask you to marry me, give you the sun for a diamond ring
If I could, I’d do those things

[Outro]
Chocolate Factory, y'all
Like I said, we're just down here having fun
You know, drinky drinkin' and toasty toastin'
You know what I'm sayin'
How y'all doin'? Y'all having fun tonight? (YEAH!)
It's about 20 ladies down here
They just came down to visit, you know what I'm sayin'
Just to have a little fun
And show some support for the Happy People album, you know
How many of y'all step?
Kevin Jones said, there's a bear in the woods
And if you don't believe it
Just ask Wesley Orbison and Lance Johnson
'cause they saw him, too
I was drivin' my jeep across the field
And when I came in to the edge of the woods
I saw Kevin Jones
Comin' down out of a tread
I stopped my jeep
And Kevin jumped up on the running board
And there it's when he said
There's a bear in the woods
And I looked right at Kevin
And I said, now Kevin, tell me the truth
And he looked at me right in the eye
He said, I'm not kiddin' you, Uncle John
He said, there's a bear in the woods
And if you don't believe it
Just ask Wesley Orbison and Lance Johnson
'cause they saw him, too
I kept on lookin' right at Kevin and I said
Now tell me truth, Kevin
He said, it is, it's a bear, it's a black bear
He said, it's not a big bear, but it's a bear
It's a black bear
I've seen him goin' down the trail there
I kept on lookin' at Kevin and I got to thinkin'
Now Kevin Jones said, there's a bear in the woods
Kevin was seven years old and I'm a lot older than he is
And I've done a lot of things that he hadn't done
And one of those things that I've done that he hadn't, is to lie
So I got to thinkin', if Kevin Jones says
There's a bear in the woods, who am I to doubt it
Well, I kind o' grinned at Kevin
And he jumped down off of the running board
And I started my jeep back up
And headed down the road in the woods
As I went away
I hollered back at Kevin and I said
Hey Kevin, watch out for that bear in the woods!
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention, do you?
I know you don't listen to me
'Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you?
But on and on
From the moment I wake, to the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line, just to see if you care
Oh, she want me to change?
Well I changed for good
I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say
Don't you shiver
Shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you
So you know how much I need ya
But you never even see me, do you?
And is this my final chance of getting you
Sining on and on
From the moment I wake, to the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line, just to see if you care, if you care
Oh, she want me to change?
Well, I changed for good
I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say, to say, to say
Don't you shiver
Don't you shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you
I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you, for you
I will always be waiting
And it's you I see but you don't see me
And it's you I hear so loud and so clear
Sing it loud and clear
And I'll always be waiting for you
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need you
But you never even see me
It's early in the morning and I can't get right
'Cause I had a little date with my baby last night

Now it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

I went to all the places where we used to go
I went to her house but she don't live there no more

And it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
I went to her girlfriend's house, but she was out
I knocked on her door and her mother started to shout
"Get away from here!"

Too early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
Went to Jenny Lou's to get something to eat
The waitress looked at me, she said, "B., you sure look beat"
It's early in the morning, baby
Early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

Had a lot of money when I first started out
I couldn't find my baby, now my money's run out

Now it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

It's early in the morning
I ain't got nothin' but the blues
Ten and ten is thirty, if you tell me it is so
Let's get down and dirty, baby. Let's get sweet and low
Any way you call the shot, That's how it's gonna be
You can serve it cold or hot, It's all okay by me
Tie me with a ribbon bow, Wrap me in cellophane
Send me out to steal the show or Samba in the Rain
Samba in the rain oh baby, Samba in the rain
Let's get down and dirty, Don't bother to explain
Don't care if they call a cop and say we are insane
We'll keep goin' til we drop. Samba in the rain
How many hours in a day? They tell me twenty four
There could be a couple less. I know there ain't no more
We can do the dirty bop, The Darktown Strutter's Ball
Just as long as we don't stop, We'll dance right up the wall
We can do the bump and grind The Apache in Spain
We can do the never mind or Samba in the rain
Samba in the rain oh baby, Samba in the rain
Let's get down and dirty. Don't bother to explain
Don't care if they call a cop and say we are insane
We'll keep goin' til we drop. Samba in the rain
Once again I don't follow trends, they just follow me
Just like Israelitis thru the Red Sea
It might take U some time b4 U'll want 2 c
The Undisputed truth and get FREE
My level is now what U must learn 2 rise above
Talk 2 D'Angelo or better yet usetlove

How is it that a brutha always wanna keep another one back?
I'm 2 far right 2 get left goin' sideways, Jack
How is that a brutha always wanna keep another one back?
Never We mind what U do, in Moneyapolis - We da MACK!

5 little Indians tryin' 2 steal from my stack
A groove or 2 later, all the critics tell them what they lack
A bowl of them 'O's is like sugar, and no smack
How is it that a brutha always wanna keep another one back?

How is it that a brutha always wanna keep another one back?
I'm 2 far right 2 get left goin' sideways, Jack
How is that a brutha always wanna keep another one back?
Never We mind what U do, in Moneyapolis - We da MACK!
And I... woke this morning 2 a drum roll - RATATAT

Who's that brushin' they teeth in the bathroom
Slender, fine and black?
Never she mind what U do, in Moneyapolis I'm the MACK

How is it that a brutha always wanna keep another one back?
I'm 2 far right 2 get left goin' sideways, Jack
How is that a brutha always wanna keep another one back?

4 every royalty point of urs I make a mill$advance
That's y in videos U never c me dance
Y should I, when minorities get half a chance?
In truth: U r 2 me, simply - my biggest fan

Come 1, come all 2 the download ball
There's no curfew 2 hurt U - No substitutions
School's now in session
Put down the Smith & Wessons
Real renegades don't invite grenades 2 make the grade
This is a brain raid - Who rise above the lies
Raise above these days
New ways disguised as a craze
Uh, gotcha back against the status they thrown at us
Back against the wall again - HIgh trees catch a lot of wind
Last band standin'
Gotta knack 4 overstandin'
Accordin' 2 plan and look up in the sky
No cable wire
God bless the child
Is that my song playing on the radio?
"It could b G, I can't remember, I wrote it in '84!"
Y'all keep groovin' - U know I got nothin' but love 4 sho
Take it - like Clarence said:
"I got a million of them -
And they're all different, U know."

How is it that a brutha always wanna keep another one back?

I'm walking behind you on your wedding day
And I'll hear you promise to love and obey
Though you may forget me, you're still on my mind
Look over your shoulder, I'm walking behind

Maybe I'll kiss again with a love that's new again
But I shall wish again I was kissing you

'Cause I'll always love you wherever you go
And though we are parted, I want you to know
That if things go wrong, dear, and fate is unkind
Look over your shoulder, I'm walking behind

So if things go wrong, dear, and fate is unkind
Look over your shoulder, I'm walking behind
By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising
She'll find the note I left hanging on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leaving
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before
By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working
She'll probably stop for lunch and give me a call
But she'll just hear the phone keep on ringing, on the wall, that's all
By the time I reach Oklahoma she'll be sleeping
She'll turn softly and call my name out low
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her
Though time and time again I tried to tell her so
She just didn't know I would really go

[Verse 1]
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
I'm standing here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn
The taxi's waiting, he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could die

[Chorus]
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

[Verse 2]
There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I'll think of you
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring

[Chorus]
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

[Verse 3]
Now the time has come to leave you
One more time, let me kiss you
Then close your eyes and I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times I won't have to say

[Chorus]
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

[Outro]
I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

I woke up one morning
Waking with the rising sun
Woke up one morning
Awakin' with the rising sun, ahh
Thought about my baby
Did I just do what she done

Well, I shoulda loved you more
I know I didn't treat her right
Oh, yes, I shoulda loved you more
I know I didn't treat her right
I know that a woman needs
Rollin' every day and night
Oh, yeah

Break:

Well, my heart beat like a hammer
My eyes plumb full of tears
Yes, my heart beat like a hammer
My eyes plumb full of tears
She's been gone about an hour
But it seems like a thousand years
Don't ever dog your woman
You know you're gonna ruin yourself
Don't ever dog your woman
You know you're gonna ruin yourself
Know that a woman she'll
Run off with somebody else
Oh, yeah
A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance
All our days, we searched for just one love, wait for that one kiss
In a word, we spend our life just waiting to give our hearts away
Searching all our lives for that special day
And then one day you come upon a smile, unlike, unlike any smile
In a word, the searching is done, you come upon the only one
She stands there looking at you, simply says, how do you do
And all the searching is through

[musical interlude]

In a word, the searching is done, you come upon the only one
She stands there looking at you, and simply says. how do you do
And all the searching is through
Away in a manger no crib for his bed
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing, the poor baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes
I love thee Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my side 'till morning is nigh

Be near me Lord Jesus, I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever and love me, I pray
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care
And fit us for heaven to live with thee there

Away in a manger no crib for his bed
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay
There was a moon out in space
But a cloud drifted over its face
You kissed me and went on your way
The night we called it a day

I heard the song of the spheres
Like a minor lament in my ears
I hadn't the heart left to pray
The night we called it a day

Soft through the dark, the hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song, no bluer was he than I

The moon went down, stars were gone
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn

There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day

There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day
Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place
I kiss the morning goodbye
But down inside you know we never know why

The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes
And the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall
But i give you it all

I am a woman in love
And i'd do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right i defend
Over and over again
What do i do ?
With you eternally mine
In love there is no measure of time
They planned it all at the start
That you and i live in each others heart

We may be oceans away
You feel my love
I hear what you say
No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall
But i give you it all

I am a woman in love
And i'd do anything
To get you into my world
And keep you within
It's a right i defend
Over and over again
What do i do ?

I am a woman in love
And i'm talkin' to you
I know how you feel
What a woman can do
It's a right i defend
Over and over again
I am a woman in love
And i'd do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right i defend
Over and over again
What do i do ?
Singing carols, stringing popcorn, making footprints in the snow
Memories, Christmas memories, they're the sweetest ones I know
Cookies taking in the kitchen, calls in rhythm everywhere
Proxies, Christmas memories, float like snowflakes in the air
Oh the joy of waking Christmas mornings, the family round the tree
We had a way of making Christmas morning as merry as can be
I close my eyes and see shining faces
Of all the children who now have children of their own
Funny, but comes December, and I remember every Christmas I've known
All alone
I'm so all alone
There is no one else but you

All alone
By the telephone
Waiting for a ring-a-ting-a-ling

I'm all alone
Every evening
All alone, feeling blue

Wondering where you are
And how you are
And if you are all alone too

I wonder where you are (remembering)
And how you are (remember me)
And if you are (I loved you)
All alone (I loved you)
Too
It's getting near dawn
When lights close their tired eyes
I'll soon be with you my love
To give you my dawn surprise
I'll be with you darling soon
I'll be with you when the stars start falling

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love

I'm with you my love
The light's shining through on you
Yes, I'm with you my love
It's the morning and just we two
I'll stay with you darling now
I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love
I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love

I'm with you my love
The light's shining through on you
Yes, I'm with you my love
It's the morning and just we two
I'll stay with you darling now
I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up

I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love
Annabelle Lee, Annabelle Lee

Oh the moon never beams
Without bringing me dreams
Of my beautiful Annabelle Lee
And the stars never rise
But I see the bright eyes
Of my beautiful Annabelle Lee

Were never apart for I gave her my heart
She gave her heart to me
And I love with a love
That is more than just love
My adorable Annabelle Lee

Yes he gave his warm heart to sweet Annabelle Lee
For he loved her so dearly you see
To think of her charms
Have been here in my arms
To think she loves only me
Heaven offers no more
I've been there before
In the arms of my Annabelle Lee
Annabelle Lee
Hey there, mister, build a fence 'round your sister, it's the
The boys' night out
Hey there, buster, it's the Indians after Custer, it's the
The boys' night out

They're out to do the town, and before they're through
It's bound to be likened to
The night they lost the Titanic and the Wall Street panic
What they're seeking is a little cheek to cheeking, it's the
The boys' night out

And that moon's about as big as a honey dew
It's the boys' night out, and they're so romantic, I'll give you a clue
What the boys are out after, the girls are out after too

They're out to do the town, and before they're through
It's bound to be likened to
The night they lost the Titanic and the Wall Street panic
What they're seeking is a little cheek to cheeking, it's the
The boys' night out
And that moon's about as big as a honey dew
It's the boys' night out, and they're so romantic, but I will give you a clue
What the boys are out after, the girls are out after
What the boys are out after, the girls are out after too
I've been out here so very long
Lost all of my direction
Baby, when you came my way
Thought I'd found protection

But a strong wind came into my life
Took me, took me by surprise
I can't seem to control these tears
Falling from my eyes

Going down one time
Going down two times
Now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love

Baby, I depended on you
For our love navigation
Now you've gone and deserted me
Can't you feel my desperation?

I'm in the middle of a love storm
Miles from the shore
I look around and all I can see
Is water coming over me
One time
Going down two times
Now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love

Listen to me now

I'm in the middle of a love storm
Miles from the shore
I look around and all I can see
Is water coming over me

Been one time
I've been down two times
Right now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love

Going down one time
I've been down two times
Right now I'm worrying
Hey, hey, the sea of love

Listen to the man
There it goes one time
Going down two times y'all
Can't you see the man drowning?
Can you see his desperation?
Drowning, drowning, hey, hey
Can't you see the drowning man?
Drowning right there on dry land
Getting kind of worried
Down in the sea of love

Hey, down one time
Been down two times
Yes, I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love
Come you phoney super patriotic people that say
That hatin' and fearing is my only way
That this here country has got to be
You're thinkin' of yourselves, you ain't thinkin' of me

You're not thinkin' of any George Washington
You're not thinkin' of any Thomas Jefferson
But you say that you are and you lie and mislead
You use their names for aims, for your selfish greed

Don't speak to me of your patriotism
When you throw the Southern black boy in prison
An' you say that the only good niggers are the ones that have died
Don't think I'll ever stand on your side

Though you make it so hard for me to love
My face will never feel the slap of your glove
My cards will never buy..
My hands will never buy the cards that you play
My feet will never walk down the road that you lay
Get out in the open, stop standin' afar
Let the whole world see what a hypocrit you are
I ain't jokin' and it ain't no gag
You bin hidin' too long behind the American flag
Get at 'em boys, go back home
Back to the girl you love
Treat her right, never wrong
How mountain girls can love

Ridin' at night in a high cold wind
On the trail of the old lonesome pine
Thinking of you baby
Feelin' so blue
Wondering why I left you behind

Get at 'em boys, go back home
Back to the girl you love
Treat her right, never wrong
How mountain girls can love

There's a lake in the hill
Where my true love goes
That's when she's thinkin' of me
Why I'm not there only heaven knows
Heaven knows that's where I'd rather be
Get at 'em boys, go back home
Back to the girl you love
Treat her right, never wrong
How mountain girls can love
Oh, my Monday woman
Starch and iron my clothes
Monday woman
Starch and iron my clothes
My Tuesday woman
Pays my room rent and board

Oh, my Wednesday woman
Buys my hat and shoes
Wednesday woman
Buys my hat and shoes
And my Thursday woman
Woman always singin' the blues

Well, I feel like jumpin'
From the treetop to the ground
Feel like jumpin'
From the treetop to the ground
Because my friday woman
Woman just talks all the time
Well, I don't want no woman
Got to give my money to
Don't need no woman
I got to give my money to
She'll spend it all on a bar
The woman don't mean no good
This song appears on two albums, and was first released on the Aerie Album, and has also been released on The Country Roads Collection Album

All of my memories lay in the life of the highway
All of my nights in old motels a sleepin' alone
All of my days on the road with no one beside me
All of my dreams of a place that I can call home

Somewhere in the shade near the sound of a sweet singin' river
Somewhere in the sun where the mountains make love to the sky
Somewhere to build me a faith, a farm and a family
Somewhere to grow older, and somewhere a reason to try

'Cause I'm tired of big cities and so tired of big city ways
Scrathin' off sunset, and walkin' around in the maze
Some sweet taxi dancer tryin' to save me from bein' alone
Ah it's much worse than lonely there is no place that I really belong
I want to be home

I'm leavin' this city life In my mind I'm flyin' away
I'm leavin' tomorrow and all of the old yesterdays
I'm leavin' the trash cans the bright lights of telephone lines
I'm leavin' my sorrows of all of my memories behind
I'll see what I find
Somewhere in the shade near the sound of a sweet singin' river
Somewhere in the sun where the mountains make love to the sky
Somewhere to build me a faith, a farm, a family
Somewhere to grow older, and somewhere a reason to try
Somewhere to grow older, somewhere to laydown and die

Words and music by John Denver
If I could be with you, I'd love you strong
If I could be with you, I'd love you long
I want you to know that I wouldn't go
Until I told you, honey, why I love you so

If I could be with you one hour tonight
If I was free to do the things that I might
I'm tellin' you true, I'd be anything but blue
If I could be with you

I want you to know that I wouldn't go
Until I told you, baby, why I love you so

If I could be with you one hour tonight
If I was free to do the things that I might
I'm tellin' you true, I'd be anything but blue
If I could be with you

If I could be with you
Lord , Lord , Lord, is there a place for me
In the scheme of things, in the service of the King
Lord , Lord , Lord, there is no job too great
As I grow in faith, there,s no job too great

Lord , Lord , Lord, there is no road too long
'Cause you made me strong, there's no road too long
Lord , Lord , Lord, there,s no stream too wide
With you by my side, there,s no stream too wide

Let me help someone thru the darkest hour
Let me shine , shine , shine, like the beacon's tower

Let my light be strong and myself be small
Let me know the truth that I'm one with all

Lord , Lord , Lord, there's no job too small
'Cause I,m one with all, there's no job too small

Lord , Lord , Lord, is there a place for me
In the scheme of things, in the service of the King
Lord , Lord , Lord, there is no job too great
As I grow in faith, there's no job too great
Lord , Lord , Lord , Lord oh Lord , Lord , Lord
Lord oh Lord, Lord , Lord , Lord, oh Lord , Lord , Lord
Lord , Lord , Lord

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear

Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
This is my December
This is my snow-covered home
This is my December
This is me, alone

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
And I (Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed)
And I (Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that)
And I (Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed)
And I (Take back all the things
That I said to you)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kelli Ali]
And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington]
This is my December
These are my snow-covered trees
This is me pretending
This is all I need

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
And I (Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed)
And I (Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that)

And I (Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed)
And I (Take back all the things
That I said to you)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kelli Ali]
And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kelli Ali]
Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to
I live alone, that hasn't always been easy to do for just a single man
Sometimes it's nice the walls talk back to me
They seem to say, wasn't yesterday a better day?
Always alone, at home or in a crowd
A single man off on his private cloud
'Cause in a world that few men understand
I am what I am, the single man
Once was a time, I can't remember when
The house was filled with love, but then again
It might have been imagination's plan
To help along a single man
My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of may, no twinkling stars
No hide away, no softly guitars

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make the most fantastic dream come true
My romance doesn't need a thing but you
A military regime in democratic disguise
That lies in all impunity
That takes apart what it took
People years to build
Public institutions
That promised a decent life

Self-determination should be a fact
Not essentially a right

There are the lobbies
Insurance companies
Who want to change the whole country
Into a vast commercial counter
For the pure consumer
The promise to give the generals a better place

Self-determination should be fact
In the face of corruption
Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like when you're older must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels thru the town
And they tell him take your time it won't be long now
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
Late last night I was dreaming
I was dreaming of your charms
I was standing
On the edge of love, darling
With you in my arms

Well you whispered sweet things
And told me
That you loved me and always be true
And you'd stand
On the edge of love with me
If I'd stand with you

I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to slip and fall
Standing on the edge of love, darling
Waiting on your call
You know I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to lose my mind
Standing on the edge of love, darling
Waiting on you one more time
Now a young man's mind will wander
Wander to distant shores
If you'll just come here
And stand with me
I won't wander no more

I promise to stop all of my gambling
Even stop staying out late all night
Might even settle down and have babies
Treat ourselves right

'Cause a young man's dreams are many
Lord, so few come true
So if you'll just come here
And stand with me
I'll stand with you

That's why I say you know
I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to slip and fall
Standing on the edge of love, darling
Waiting on your call, that's why I say
You know, I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to lose my mind
Standing on the edge of love, darling
Waiting on you one more time
That's why I'm standing, standing
Standing, yes, I'm standing
Standing on the edge of love
Waiting on you one more time

That's why I'm standing, standing
Standing, yes, I'm standing
Standing on the edge of love
Waiting on you one more time

That's why I'm standing, standing
Standing, yes, I'm standing
Standing on the edge of love
One more time
It's late December, the New Year's never coming
Time passes slowly in a two-room walk-up flat
The sun is silent, there's a cold rain gonna come on
And no one to talk to
But my lady's yellow cat
Raindrops falling on the flowers in the window box
Plastic roses that I planted yesterday
I didn't think they'd die so soon
But they're all withered now
Seems like everything I touch
Turns out that way

Well I guess I'll just go walkin'
The cat's no good for talkin' to
He don't know what I'm sayin'
And the rain is always
Playin' on my mind
On my mind

Street lights drifting through the blinds that cover window panes
Blending softly with the bare lights overhead
Then together they run swiftly through my memory
An eerie image of a strange and empty bed
Wind is whippin' up the papers in the streets below
I got some books to read
But it seems they've all been read
Clouds are crowded in a misty
Driftin' sky above
And I wish to hell
I could remember what I said
Well I guess I'll just go walkin'
The cat's no good for talkin' to
He don't know what I'm sayin'
And the rain is always
Playin' on my mind
On my mind

One crystal wine glass on a table filled with scarlet stains
Stands alone and empty where there once were two
The jug is silent on the table by a broken plate
The wine is gone, my lady, and so, my love, are you

Well I guess I'll just go walkin'
The cat's no good for talkin' to
He don't know what I'm sayin'
And the rain is always
Playin' on my mind
On my mind
On my mind

[Intro]

When it comes to rocking
And natural finger popping
Baby, you sure do swing
And when it comes to rocking
And natural finger popping
Daddy, you're the king
Baby, you've got me beat
Up and down
Inside and out and across
But in the middle of the night
When the moon is shining bright
Lord, you're the boss

Talking about dancing
And down home romancing
Daddy, you make me scream
Talking about dancing
And down home romancing
Baby, you're the queen
Man, when push comes to shove

You're a horse
But in the middle of the night
When the moon is shining bright
You're the boss
You're the best of everything
You're a peach
You're so sweet
You're a diamond
You're the gem
You're the best of everything
Daddy, you're my man

Which way the wind is blowing
Baby, you're so wise
And when it comes to knowing
Which way the wind is blowing

My inside ostrich, outside candy
It's seven days of the week, seven different bentleys
I'm sittin on ourvis, six plus twenty
I'm looking very pretty in my S550
My 80 carat chain got me something like fifty
This multicarat jacob got me looking p. diddy
It's Young Gucciracci, come and smoke ten wit me
And imma X ya off, cuz ya know I got plenty
That Larry Byrd yay for the kyshaun tickets
Them outta town boys get diyon wit it
I'm sittin so high that I'm looking at pigeons
And its a car show everytime I hit Visioin
I'm standin on sixes, should I say set?
I'm sqautting on rims, but should I say limpin'?
454 thats a real big engine, how much I spent on it?
Nigga that ain't yo business
Humongous, enourmous, Gucci ridin' jurassic
26 inches beatin' hard in traffic
Windows tinted, bubble kush we pass dat
All my bitches keep thrax we match dat

[Chorus]
I'm a giant
Ya see how I'm ridin'
I'm 26's glidin', let 'em know that I'm a giant

Ya see that I'm a giant
I'm 26's glidin' let 'em know that I'm a giant
I'm a giant
I'm on a giant high
I'm riding giant fly
I'm 26's in the damn sky

I'm a giant

I'm going to my oldschool
From bumper to bumper fool
Dropped a hundred stacks now it cost more than pickin' hummers do
Just like diamonds my cars are so colorful
Rims pimped out what the fuck I need Xzibit for?
Change lanes then change hues, from light green to donk blue
Yeah the paint chameleon so they swagger and they change too
Shine harder, grind harder, Air Ones look like tap water
Chrome wheels look like silver quarters and my see-through top like bathwater (damn)
26 inches and the rims look like pickle juice
26 inches sittin' on the skirt tails y'all, look, really not difficult
Jumped in the hot tob, shawty off the bentley coupe
Inside look like blood and the guts like tomato soup

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm Gucci Mane La'Flare, Call me Delta Airlines 'cause I'm sittin' in the air
Like I'm standing on a chair, the rapper of the year got 'em ridin' in my leer here
With diamonds in my ear, and plus I smoke that purp, so check my footwork
Sixes on the skirt, I already done mounted it
Million dollars worth of notes already done counted it
Man that fuckin' paint job Gucci good Lord
Swerve on 'em shawty, work it work it real hard
When shawty rolled up he was sittin' on some deuces
Gucci rides sixes offset snoopy
Then a nigga throw up money like Huey
6,000 pounds of purp coming in tuesday
Dammit man I'm shinin' I always get loaded
He asked me for a brick like I got the shit on me

[Chorus]
"YEAH, I SEE WE GOT A FEW FRIENDS LAYIN' ROUND IN HERE,"
"HI JIMI"
"yeah, did you know I can do A little number for you right here. You all
Together? You all together? "
"YEAH, WE'RE ALL TOGETHER" (Cheers)
"I'D LIKE TO THROW A LITTLE BLUES ON YA HERE"
"YEAH HERE WE GO, IT CALLED 'GET MY HEART BACK TOGETHER' OR SOMTHIN' LIKE THAT"

Well I

Waitin' for that train, waitin' for that train
To take me from this lonesome town, it happens

Thanx A lot
See you later man
It's just me and my guitar

[Verse 1]
Do you think
You could fall for a woman like me?
'Cause I find it hard to trust
I need too much
And I really don't believe in love, no no
Do you think
That I could be the girl of your dreams?
Sometimes I don't let things go
Get emotional
And sometimes, I'm just out of control

[Chorus]
You need to stop for a minute
Before you get too deep up in it (Too deep)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me (Woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it (No, no, no)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me

[Verse 2]
Do you think
That I could be the one that you seek?
'Cause baby, I'm one step ahead
You're two steps behind
But baby, I don't mind
Do you think
That I could make you real happy, baby?
Just don't get me wrong
My lovin' is so strong
But I ain't tryna lead you on

[Chorus]
You need to stop for a minute (No, no)
Before you get too deep up in it (No no, yeah)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems (Seems)
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me (Woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it (Without it)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me

[Break]
Woman like me
A woman like me
Woman like me, oh

[Chorus]
You need to stop for a minute (Stop for a minute)
Before you get too deep up in it ('Fore you get too deep up in it)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
You need to think about it (Think about it, baby)
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it (No, no)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me

[Outro]
Woman like me
Woman like me
A woman like me
O say can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets red glare and bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say does that star spangled banner yet wave
For the land of the free
And the home of the brave?
Oh, seven years of hard luck comin' down on me
From the Florida border, yes, up in Nashville, Tennessee
I worked in every joint you can name, yes-a, every honky tonk
Along come Mister Yankee slicker sayin "baby, you're what I want"

Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Want to give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA

Oh, nine thousand dollar just sowed the wind
But we smiled at the Yankee slicker with a big old southern grin
They gonna take me out to California, gonna make me a super star
Just pay me all my money, mister, maybe you won't get a scar

Want you to sign the contract
Want you to sign today
Wanna give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA

Oh, Slickers steal my money since I was seventeen
If it ain't no pencil pusher then it got to be a honky tonk queen
But I signed my contract, baby, and I want you people to know
That every penny that I make, I want to see where my money goes
Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA
Getting to know you, getting to know all about you
Getting to like you, getting to hope you like me
Getting to know you, putting it my way, but nicely
You are my cup of tea
Getting to know you, getting to feel free and easy
When I am with you, getting to know what to say
Haven't you noticed? Suddenly I'm bright and breezy
Because of all the beautiful things and new things
I'm learning about you day by day
Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out

Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa
Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out

I've been told do what you do with it
We keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa
Tired of seeing some play thing acting like a toy
Tired of watching some fool trying to be your boy
And I don't like being the one seeing you in tears
Standing in the shadows staring out at love again

But I'll be the one

I'm the one reminding you that you've got a choice
I'm the one to let you know that I hear your voice
Time and again I catch you smiling from within
But standing empty hearted standing in the wings again

I'll be the one

Now I can't be the one to catch you everytime you fall
I ain't the one to answer everytime you call
But maybe I'm gonna to be the one
One to see you through it all
Yes, it was the worst thing in my life
The worst thing I ever witnessed to
The worst thing in my life
The worst thing I ever witnessed to
When the woman that I love
Went to say it was really through

Yes I said take it easy baby
A lot of things came before we part
Yes I said take it easy baby
A lot of things came before we part
Yes, a lot of the foolish things you've doin' baby
I want to know what do you think you're doing to me
Because you think you've so sweet

Yes, don't say that you want to leave me baby
But think of the shape you'll be in
Yes, don't say that you want to leave me baby
But just think of the shape you'll be in
I want to know you'll hate you ever met me
And you'll hate the day when we began
Why should you acusse me baby
Without me givin' you a cause
Want to know why should you acusse me baby
Without me givin' you a cause
I know I've been good to you baby
As if I was Santa Claus

Yes, you don't think much of your life baby
Baby to put yourself on the spot
Yes, you don't think much of your life baby
Honey to put yourself on the spot
Yes, when the people see me clowin' woman
Well I wonder what you got
I want to get married
But no woman will hear my plea
I want to get married
But no woman will hear my plea
Yes, it seems somehow
I can't get one to walk down the aisle with me

Well, I've only been in love
But three times in my life
Yes, the first, I couldn't satisfy her
But I've only been in love three times in my life
Yes, the second one was a juice head
And the third was another man's wife

Yeah, they say, join the navy
If you really wanna see the world
Well, but I say, join B.B. King
Baby if you really want to be loved

Aw, my time is gone
Babe and I really must say goodbye
Aw, my time is gone
Babe and I really must say goodbye
So you women better watch out
I must have that wife before I die
You're tellin me this town ain't got no heart
Well, well, well, you can never tell
The sunny side of the street is dark
Well, well, well, you can never tell
Maybe that's cause it's midnight
In the dark of the moon besides

Maybe the dark is from your eyes
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
You know you got such dark eyes

Nothin' shakin' on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

You think you've seen this town clear through
Well, well, well, you can never tell
Nothin' here that could interest you
Well, well, well, you can never tell
It's not because you missed out
On the thing that we had, to start
Maybe you had too much too fast
Maybe you had too much too fast
Maybe you had too much too fast

Nothin' shakin' on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

Since I'm passing your way today
Well, well, well, you can never tell
I just stopped in cause I want to say
Well, well, well, you can never tell
I recall your darkness
When it crackled like a thundercloud

Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
When I can hear it beat out loud

Nothin' shakin' on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
Nothin' shakin' on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
How can you forget moments in the moonlight
Moments of a love that used to be
As I stare in space, I still see your face
And once again I'm lost in your thrilling embrace
Though the spell is o'er, somewhere in the moonlight
Mem'ries of your kiss will live anew
And we'll meet, my love, as I keep dreaming of
Moments in the moonlight with you
Fritha realizing somehow that Rhayader will not
Return and is still looking out to sea when she
Spies the Snow Goose. She is filled with a sweet
Sadness as she follows her princess home in as if
To land only to fly away, out of sight lost forever
I've got a sweet little angel
I love the way she spread her wings
Yes got a sweet little angel
I love the way she spread her wings
Yes, when she spreads her wings around me
I get joy, and everything

You know I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a $20 bill
Oh yes, I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a $20 bill
Whoah, you know I ask her to buy a little drink of liquor
And she gave me a whiskey still

Oh, if my baby should quit me
I believe I would die
Oh if my baby should quit me
Lord I do believe I would die
Yes if you don't love me little angel
Please tell me the reason why

[Verse 1]
The big man arrives, disco dancers greet him
Plainclothes cops greet him
Small town, big man, fresh lipstick glistening
Sophomore jive from victims of typewriters
The band sounds like typewriters
The big man he's not listening

[Chorus 1]
His eyes hold Edith, his left hand holds his right
What does that hand desire that he grips it so tight?

[Verse 2]
Edith in the ring, the passed-over girls are conferring
The man with the diamond ring is purring
All claws for now withdrawn
One by one they bring his renegade stories to her
His crimes and his glories to her
In challenge they look on

[Chorus 2]
Women he has taken grow old too soon
He tilts their tired faces gently to the spoon

[Verse 3]
Edith in his bed, a plane in the rain is humming
The wires in the walls are humming
Some song, some mysterious song
Bars in her head beating frantic and snowblind
Romantic and snowblind
She says his crime belongs

[Chorus 3]
Edith and the Kingpin, each with charm to sway
Are staring eye to eye, they dare not look away
You know they dare not look away

[Intro]
She
She
She

[Verse 1]
Lock the bus, undo the chain
Getting all too hot, gotta head on Fifth and Main
I look like you, I feel the same
You don't even know my name
I got this tied up to my cell
Well everybody's gone to the everybody shell

[Chorus]
Are you coming through, do you want me to
Take your body
It would be so cool, to be cool with you
I said lordy lordy

[Verse 2]
I draw like blood into the drain
There ain't an element that stays off in my brain
A dirty sun will burn away
Do you even want to stay

[Chorus]
Are you coming through, do you want me to
Take your body
It would be so cool, to be cool with you
I said lordy lordy
Where'd ya get that bruise, do you want me to
Take your body
I must still, taking your bod away

[Instrumental Solo]

[Chorus]
Are you coming through, do you want me to
Take your body
It would be so cool, to be cool with you
I said lordy lordy
Where'd ya get that bruise, do you want me to
Take your body
I must still, taking your bod away

[Instrumental Outro]
Chorus
I still love you 

[my love]
I still need you 

[my heart]
I love you honey 

[bunny]
You are the only one 

[believe me]
And I hope I be the only one for you
Can't you see
I still love you, I still need you

Yes I've done something wrong
And I'm so sorry about that
I'm so sorry about everything

Forgive me - I thought you'd always be mine
I thought I could never lose you
But now I know - I feel - I believe
There's an other guy
You love - an other heart in your mind

Chorus - repeats
I'm so scared
That I could lose you now
I'm so scared
That I could see you
With an other person in your arms
Oh help me my god
Tell me that I'm wrong
Tell me that this is not the truth

Bridge
Do you still love me
Do you still need me
Do you still know that I'm here for you
If you need me too

Chorus - repeats

Bridge - repeats

Far away upon a hill on a sunny mountain side
Many years ago we parted, my own true love and I
From the sunny mountain side

Oh she clung to me and trembled, when I told her we must part
And she said don't go my darling I know twill break my heart
When we two are far apart

Carry me back to old Virginia back to my clinch mountain home
Carry me back to old Virginia back to my old mountain home

My mother's old and feeble and my father's getting gray
Carry me back to old Virginia for its there I want to stay

Oh I held her in my arms leaned her head upon my breast
And I told her that I'd wed her when I come back from the west
To my old clinch mountain home

In my hand I hold a picture of the old home far away
And the picture of my sweetheart
I'm thinking of today
On the sunny mountain side
Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

Wake up in the mornin' fix you somethin' to eat
'fore I go to work I even brush your teeth
Get home in the evenin' and you're still in bed
Got yourself a rag tied 'round you're head

Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

I'm tellin' you baby you'd better change your ways
I'm tellin' you baby I mean what I say
Last time tellin you to stop that jive
Gonna find yourself outside

Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

Last time tellin' you baby you'd better change your ways
Last time tellin' you baby I mean what I say
Last time tellin you to stop that jive
Gonna find yourself outside
Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you
I'm leavin' you
Leavin' you
I got the feelin'
I'm 'bout to go
'bout to go
Go down all that lonesome road
Down that lonesome road
Down that lonesome road
By myself
You're so evil
'cause you're so evil
That's why I'm leaving you alone
Leaving you alone
You got the devil in you, woman
You got a devil in you, woman
Someday it's gonna be the death of you
It's gonna be the death of you
I'm gonna get my .44
Get my .44
Shoot a few holes in you
Yes I'll put you six feet under
Put you six feet under
Put you six feet under the ground
Six feet under the ground
And woman I shed no tears
Woman, I shed no tears
I go away with a smile on my face
Go away with a smile on my face
You got what you're due woman
You got what you're due
I'd be glad I won't see you anymore
See you anymore
Georgia
I swear
I've never seen such a smile
Gorgeous enough
To make an angels heart run wild
Your lazy eyes and small town lies
Have got me in your spell
Your drive-in boys and backseat noises
Oh you learned so well
Oh oh oh
So how was I to know
You got me you got me... by now

Georgia
Your daddy was high
The night he dreamed of you
Georgia the stars were flying
The night that you came through
Christmas in your eyes
Oh what a nice surprise
Oh oh oh
And now I miss you so
But baby I'm comin' back to you
Georgia
We will be together dear
If they ever let me out of here
They will say that its not true
But I did it all for you
Georgia
Won't you tell them for me dear

Georgia girl
I never lived through a night like that
Sure enough
Got your loving where I like it at
Moonlight through the pines
Oh oh oh
But how were we to know
That wasn't moonlight
They were searchlights
Oh no

Georgia
We will be together dear
If they ever let me out of here
They will say that its not true
But I did it all for you
Georgia
Won't you tell them for me dear
Georgia
We will be together dear
Oh my dear
If they ever let me out of here
Oh, life is so peculiar
You get so wet in the rain
You get so warm in the sunshine
It doesn't pay to complain

When I get up each morning, there's nothin' to breathe but air
When I look in the mirror, there's nothin' to comb but hair
When I sit down to breakfast, there's nothin' to eat but food
Life is so peculiar, but you can't stay home and brood

Yes, life is so peculiar
A fork belongs with a knife
Corn beef is lost without cabbage
A husband should have a wife

Life is so peculiar, but as everybody says
That's life (that's life)

(Oh, life is so peculiar)
(The desert's only got sand)
The ocean's only got water
You never know where you stand
When I get out to dinner, there's nothing to wear but clothes
Whenever I get sleepy, there's nothin' to do but doze
Whenever I get thirsty, there's nothin' to do but drink
Life is no peculiar that it makes you stop and think

Yes (Life is so peculiar) it's so peculiar
A fork belongs with a knife (a fork belongs with the knife)
Corn beef is lost without cabbage
(A husband should have a wife)

Life is so peculiar, but as everybody says
(That's life) That's right
Keep yo' hands in the air, cause we gon' take you there
And I know it ain't fair, but we just don't care..

Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me

If I'm gonna rob, I'ma rob all night
If I'm lookin for somethin it's probably a fight
If I'm goin fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead, then the head
(better be right)
If I gots to play I'ma play til I win
Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty can't stand shorty friend
Cause honey friend fuck
(many many men)
Stay wit the rats cause the rats is real
Wanna fuck, then we fuck, already know the deal
Shit, fuck what you look like, just show the real
And I keep spot that we can go to chill

(hoes)
Only reason I come around is for the

Pipework - I lay it down for the
{hoes)

Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me, c'mon!)
Ain't no other cats got love for me

There's a chip on your shoulder, girl
And by God it'll make you fall
If you let it take a part of your soul

I see the love in your brother's eyes
And the love in your mother's cries
Sister don't test the ones you love

Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us

[x2]

Cause your roots will rot away
And your fruit, it won't grow
Your bark will wear thin, body hollow

I see the love in your brother's eyes
And the love in your mother's cries
Sister don't test the ones you love

Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us

[x4]
Don't test the ones you love
It'll only tear us down
If you want to feel alive
Then learn to love your ground

[x2]

Love your ground

Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us

[x4]
Wish that i could wind/ like a spiral spare through time/ to your body next to mine/ warm and satisfied/ wish that i could catch/ a night train to the past/ climb aboard and hear you ask/ darling come inside

Memories, memories/ sweet, sweet memories/ of days gone by/ that make me cry/ memories, memories, memories/ sweet memories/ that make me sad/ they take me back/ to you/ (memories, memories/ ah ah ah ah ah ah ah/ ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)

Watching falling stars/ on the grass by my own car/ making love there in the dark/ thinking we're alone/ old man shined his light/ trying not to act suprised/ he left hard and all uptight/ told us to get on home

Memories, memories/ sweet sweet memories/ of love we shared/ of love we shared/ memories memories/ sweet memories/ of love we shared/ we will never/ share them again/ (memories memories/ ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah/ ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't be so quick to, walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body
Please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you, wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you
Till the break of day
Dance with me

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Guy time, but I don't mind
Just wanna rock you, girl
I'll have whatever you have
Come on, just give it a whirl
See, I've been watching you
I like the way you move
So go ahead, girl, just do
That ass shaking thing you do

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
So you grab your girls
And you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me
In the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right
So you pass to the left and you sail to the right

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't be so quick to, walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body
Please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you, wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you
Till the break of day
Dance with me

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
I don't mean no harm
Just wanna rock you, girl
Make a move, but be calm
Let's go, let's give it a whirl
See, it appears to me
You like the way I move
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
Pull you close and share my groove

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
So you grab your girls
And you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me
In the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right
So you pass to the left and you sail to the right

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't be so quick to, walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body
Please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you, wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you
Till the break of day
Dance with me

[Verse 3: Vanessa Marquez & Justin Timberlake]
Talk to me, boy
No disrespect, I don't mean no harm
Talk to me, boy
I can't wait to have you in my arms
Talk to me, boy
Hurry up 'cause you're taking too long
Talk to me, boy
Bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song

[Verse 4: Vanessa Marquez & Justin Timberlake, Both]
So what did you come for?
I came to dance with you
And you know that you don't wanna hit the floor
I came to romance with you
You're searching for love forever more
It's time to take a chance
If love is here on the floor, girl

[Bridge 2: Justin Timberlake]
Hey
Dance with me
Yeah
Come on, baby

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't be so quick to, walk away
Come on dance with me
I wanna rock your body (I wanna rock your body)
Please stay
Come on dance with me
You don't have to admit you (you don't have to admit), wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you
Till the break of day
Come on dance with me

[Verse 3: Vanessa Marquez & Justin Timberlake]
Talk to me, boy
No disrespect, I don't mean no harm
Talk to me, boy
I can't wait to have you in my arms
Talk to me, boy
Hurry up 'cause you're taking too long
Talk to me, boy
Bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song

[Verse 6: Justin Timberlake]
Don't be so quick to walk away
(Just think of me and you)
Don't be so quick to walk away
(We could do something)
Don't be so quick to walk away
(I like the way you look right now)
Don't be so quick to walk away
(Come over here baby)
Daddy daddy come and look
And see what I have found
A little wau away from here
While digging in the ground

Come away Melinda
Come in and close the door
It's nothing but a picture book
They had before the war

Daddy daddy come and see
Oh daddy come and look
There's four or five Melinda girl
Inside this picture book

Come away Melinda
Come in and close the door
There were lots of little girls like you
Before they had the war

Daddy daddy come and see
Oh daddy hurry do
There's someone in villages
Who's all grown up like you
Come away Melinda
Come in and close the door
That someone is a mother
Like you had before the war

Daddy daddy come and see
Such things I've never seen
Happy faces all along
And all the ground is green

Come away Melinda
Come in and close the door
It's just the way it used to be
Before they had the war

Daddy daddy come and see
And tell me if you can
Why can't it be the way it was
Before the war began

Come away Melinda
Come in and close the door
The answer lies in yesterday
Before they had the war
So far this love is delightful
The face of seduction was you
But I listened for each and every footstep
In this Real Cool World

Questioning saintlike and fantastic heroes
Feeling like lost little children in fabled lands
So I listen for each and every friendship
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Starry-eyed life but somehow believing in nothing
You whisper sweet nothing but reading between your lines
I listen color me doubtful
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World
You came from nowhere
You came from nowhere
You held me you shook me
Hey

It's a Cool World
It's a Cool World

It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Mmmm
Real Cool World

And the tune remaind me of you
You're my baby
Yes, you're my baby
Well, you're my baby
For you seem to be true to me

Well, she never takes my money
She never leaves me alone
She's the type of woman that
I would love to have in my home
She's my baby
Yes, she's my baby
Well, she's my baby
'Cause she seems to be true to me
Well, you know my secret

So don't bother my baby
And please don't try
She's my baby
Yes, she's my baby
Well, she's my baby
'Cause she seems to be true to me

Don't know what it is
But you can't get enough of it
It's not that funny is it?
Don't - blame - me!
Please, please, please!
I didn't wanna bleed so
I didn't wanna be this late
So don't make me wait!

Well it's not that funny is it
No one to turn you on
All your hope is gone
'Cause it's not that funny is it?
So don't - blame - me!
Please, please, please!
You're here 'cause I say so
Didn't wanna be this late
So don't make me
Don't make me wait!
Here comes the nighttime looking for a little more
Workin' on checkin' out somebody outside the door
Yeah...
Yeah...
Alright, alright
Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen right here
Right here I want to tell you a little story
This is about a country boy from down home
This young man has never been north before
I want you to listen to me, I got something to tell you

He heard about Chicago
He worked hard over here, made all of that money, 800 dollars
After caring for his crop, he called his cousin in Chicago
And he said, "Cousin, I'm on my way"
He picked all of that cotton
I said this is about a country boy like myself, B.B. King you know
So when he get to Chicago, his cousin meet him and bring him out to the club
He said, "Set him up!", cous's payin' for
Had all the go-go girls set up, waitin' up
They carried him downtown and put him up in one of the pleasure hotels
They brought him back out and said, "Set him up!", cous's payin' for
His money got a little lighter, they lured him out from the Lute and brought him down to Robert's
And then he said, "Set him up!", cous's payin' for
And then the 800 dollars, bein' more money then my man had ever had, began to run out
Then they moved him out and put him down with the ...
And then, ladies and gentlemen, the go-go girls would get fewer
His friends was fewer
All his buddies are startin' passin' him on the other side of the street
And then it happened all his buddies were gone
And my man knew only one thing to do, it was getting cold there, like it is today
You know what I'm talking about
He went down to the railroad yard
And one of the few ladies that had helped him to spent his money, came by to see him
And she said "You fool!, you fool!", I wouldn't have spend your money, but the rest of them was spending your money so I decided to spend my portion too, you know
But ladies, God bless 'em, wonderful something's aren't they?
They always like to feel like they're needed, and she knew my man needed her bad
He gotten sick, he's layin' down there under the boxcar
Couldn't read so well, so you know if he couldn't read so well, he couldn't write too well
You know what I'm talkin' about?
So this is a letter back down home, I know what I'm talkin' about
It go like this:

I've had my fun, whoah, if I don't get well no more
Whoah, I've had my fun, people, ooh, if I don't get well no more
Yes, my health is faillin' on me now, people
Ooh, and I'm goin', goin' down slow

Yes, tell my mother, people, please tell her the shape I'm in
Ooh yes, tell my people, mother, tell her the shape I'm in
Tell her to pray for me, people, ooh, to forgive, people, my sins

Oohooh mother, mother I live alone with my prayers
Ooh, tell my mother, people, tell her this is all in prayers
Yes, if you don't see this old body, mother
Hey, you know I'm out in the world somewhere
Tomorrow is Sunday
Now there's only one day left to go
Till you walk by
Below my window
The weekends drive me mad
Holidays are oh too sad
'Cause you don't go
Below my window

No one knows I'm here
One day I just disappeared
And I took these two grey rooms up here
With a view
When you walk by
Below my window

You look so youthful
Time has been untruthful
Heaven knows I loved you
30 years ago
Hot days your shirt's undone
Rainy days you run
Oh and then you fade so fast
Below my window
No one knows I'm here
One day I just disappeared
And I took these two grey rooms up here
With a view
Only when you walk by
Below my window
When you walk by

Below my window
Below my window
Hey hey
Below my window
Below my window
Below my window
Well, I walked up to her and I asked her if she wanted to dance
She looked awful nice and so I hoped she might take a chance

When we danced I held her tight
Then I walked her home that night
And all the stars were shining bright
And then I kissed her

Each time I saw her I couldn't wait to see her again
I wanted to let her know that I was more than a friend

I didn't know just what to do
And so I whispered: "I love you"
And she said that she loved me too
And then I kissed her

I kissed her in a way that I'd never kissed a girl before
I kissed her in a way that I hope she liked for evermore

I knew that she was mine so I gave her all the love that I had
Then one day she'll take me home to meet her mom and her dad
Then I asked her to be my bride
And always be right by my side
I felt so happy that I almost cried
And then I kissed her

And then I kissed her
And then I kissed her
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words, oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lotta kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em

I'm gonna smile and say, "I hope you're feeling better"
And close with "Love," the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe that it came from you

I'll be glad I got 'em

I'm gonna smile and say, "I hope you're feeling better"
And then I'll close with "Love," the way you do
I'm gonna sit down, write myself a letter
And make believe it came
Though I know it's not the same
I'll make believe it came from you
If I attend church all day Sunday, come back home and raise
I think I feel hur or shall I go a little further, do a little more?
Ain't nobody's bizness what I do
If one day I have ham and bacon
And the next day, ain't nothin' shakin'
No, it ain't, ain't nobody's bizness what I do
Nobody's bizness what I do
Grooving around in a trench coat
With the satin on trail
Seems to be all around in tin and lead pail, we pale
Jiving on down to the beach
To see the blue and the gray
Seems to be all and it's rosy-it's a beautiful day!

Will you please keep on the track
'cause I almost want you back
'cause I know what you are
You are a gigolo aunt, you're a gigolo aunt!
Yes I know what you are
You are a gigolo aunt, you're a gigolo aunt!

Heading down with the light, the dust in your way
She was angrier than, than her watershell male
Life to this love to me - heading me down to me
Thunderbird shale
Seems to be all and it's rosy - it's a beautiful day!
Will you please keep on the track
'cause I almost want you back
'cause I know what you are
You are a gigolo aunt
Grooving on down in a knapsack superlative day
Some wish she move and just as she can move jiving away
She made the scene should have been-superlative day
Everything's all and it's rosy, it's a beautiful day
Will you please keep on the track
'cause I almost want you back
'cause I know what you are
You are a gigolo aunt...
(Boy, this one here pulls the juice out of you.)

At the end of my rainbow
I seek no golden prize
For the key to my kingdom
Is the glow in your eyes

Gain and power and riches
Are thrills I'll never miss
For the key to my kingdom
Is the thrill of your kiss

Baby, I have more
Than fame and fortune
Every time I hold your hand
And my darling
When our lips meet
All the world's at my command

Yeah, if you ever
Ever should leave me
My world would tumble down
Because you're the key to my kingdom
And your love is my crown
Oh I have more than fame and fortune
Every time I hold your hand
And my darling
When our lips meet
All the world's at my command

Yes, yes, if you ever
Ever should leave me
All of my world would tumble down
For you're the key to my kingdom
And your love is my crown
Yeah, you're the key to my kingdom
And your love is my crown
Yeah, you're the key to my kingdom
And your love, your love is my crown
Rainin' in my heart
Since we been apart
I know I was wrong
Baby please come home

You got me cryin'
'Bout to lose my mind
Don't let me cry in vain
Try my love just once again

Spoken:
Honey, I need your love
Darlin', you know why
If you would come back home
There'll be no need for me to cry

Sings:
Rainin' in my heart
Since we been apart
I know I was wrong
Baby please come home
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hotspot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They took all the trees, put them in a tree museum
And they charged the people
A dollar and a half just to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees, please
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

I said, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Ah ha ha ha
Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes
Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes

Conversation, Mississippi related
He's searching for the softball diamond
Prancin' like a bad ass who never seen a church house, Another jolly face in the choir
He's reaching and a kissin' her mouth

Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes
Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes

Screamin' at the cousin that never gets no lovin'
The hairy monkeys covered tonight
Falling over tables, a black eye with no way home
And pouting underneath the street lights
He's reaching and a kissin her mouth

Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes
Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes
And no-one seems to like it out loud
Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes
Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes
Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes
Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes
Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes
Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes
Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes
Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worried, woman
And it's you, I hate to lose
Nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Yes, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Speaking of worries and sorrow, luv
You know, I had my share
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worried, woman
And it's you, I hate to lose
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worried, woman
And I missed you, I hate to lose
All the friends I belived in
I believed in for a while
They had their flair
They had their style
But nobody quite got it right
Nobody knew just how it feels to be me...

But sometimes when I'm dreaming
And I dream a lot these days
I need someone who understands
Who leads me through the haze
It's only when I'm dreaming
That I fall in love for real
But I wake up screaming
Sometimes when I'm dreaming

And it's now that I need a friend
I reach out for the phone
Nobody's there, nobody's home
Though it may not be right to give up the fight
I'm sailing away
Now I'm on my own
Alone...
But sometimes when I'm dreaming
And I dream a lot these days
I need someone who understands
Who leads me through the haze
It's only when I'm dreaming
That I fall in love for real
But I wake up screaming
Sometimes when I'm dreaming

But I wake up screaming
Sometimes when I'm dreaming

[Verse 1]
If there's one rule to this game, everybody's gonna name it
Be cool
If you're worried or uncertain, if your feelings are hurtin'
You're a fool if you can't keep cool

[Chorus 1]
Charm 'em, don't alarm 'em, keep things light
Keep your worries out of sight
And play it cool, pay it cool
Fifty-fifty fire and ice

[Verse 2]
If your heart is on the floor
'Cause you've just seen your lover comin' through the door with a new fool
Be cool
Don't you sweat it, start right in right now tryin' to forget it
Be cool

[Chorus 2]
Don't get riled, smile, keep it light
Be your own best friend tonight
And play it cool, play it cool
Fifty-fifty fire and ice

[Verse 3]
Don't get jealous, don't get over-zealous
Keep your cool
Don't whine, kiss off that flaky valentine
You're nobody's fool

[Bridge]
Be cool fool, be cool
(Lots of other fish in the sea)

[Chorus]
Play it cool, play it cool
Fifty-fifty fire and ice

[Verse 4]
So if there's one rule to this game
Everybody's gonna name it
Be cool
If you're worried or uncertain, if your feelings are hurtin'
You're a fool if you can't keep cool

[Chorus]
They want you to charm 'em, don't alarm 'em, keep things light
Keep your worries out of sight
And play it cool, play it cool
Fifty-fifty fire and ice

CHORUS
Here and now..you've got to live your life...
Don't worry how-- just go hard tonight..
C'mon--Dance like it don't matter...
VERSE 1
Once upon a rhyme, not long ago
Flat tops were in and you cut your afros..
I went to a club on the hip-house scene..
With Doc Marten's and a pair of baggy jeans..
It might've been Queens..or the Bronx, I think..
..and it was 18 to party, 21 to drink..
I blinked in darkness, the suckers let me in..
The night of my life was about to begin..
Inside now.. NOTHING could stop me...
..Three songs later..met the first... Nice body...!
..a good lookin' girl--
From her voice, I could tell she was a Brooklyn girl..
The world stopped...It seemed to vanish..
I asked what she was...half Black, half Spanish..
Not that it mattered, just conversatin..
She went to the bar and I took her invitation...
CHORUS
Here and now..you've got to live your life...
Don't worry how-- just go hard tonight..
C'mon--Dance like it don't matter...
VERSE 2
Everybody move, nobody front...
It was February--Black history month..
I turned my beeper off so I wouldn't be on call..
There were 99 bottles of beer on the wall..
..but..none would fall...so I started to reach..
She had two orgasms and a sex on the beach..
Such each...ice cube..and still wanted more..
You know what I was thinkin'? Mmmm..Lipstick on a straw...
I said to the cutie "This is where hello stops.."
...then I flavored her tongue with three different jello shots..
..tasted it off her, her eyes got softer..
She said "You gonna dance now?" -- I said "Thanks for the offer..."
Lost all control; the strobe lights was blinding...
Krs was rhyming...this girl was grinding..
My inhibitions were totally shattered..
...and that's when she told me to "Dance like it don't matter..."
CHORUS
Here and now..you've got to live your life...
Don't worry how-- just go hard tonight..
C'mon--Dance like it don't matter...
VERSE 3 - Krs-One
Dance like it don't matter, on stage a dope rapper...
I see Greenie on the dance floor--- go dada!
Pockets don't grow skinny they grow fatter..
Music pumpin' so damn hard, the glass shatters..
...but...there's Greenie, dancin' to the CD..
I'm gonna be me, I hope this cat sees me..
Party all packed and the drinks are goin' up..
While KRS raps, it's Greenie blowin' up
Dancefloor.. I got the whole spot leanin...
Hear it, the spirit--you got the whole place fiendin'..
Real emceeing, real streets you seein'..
Kickin' live lyrics to live huiman beings..
This is what we do, we're not in a trance..
Like my man Lelu, we like to dance..
Can you dance? Can you move your body?
Can you move somebody? Are you new in the party?
There's the hottie--but her man got the shotty..
...and I'm the emcee that puts the boogie in your body...
Hold on, baby
(Hold on, baby)
Hold on, my little honey
(Hold on, baby)

Hold on, he's tryin'
(Hold on, baby)
To take your love from me now

When he tries
Please don't let him
My advice will be
Better forget him

Hold on, baby
(Hold on, baby)
Hold on, my little honey
(Hold on, baby)

Don't you know he's only tryin'
(Hold on, baby)
To take your love from me now?
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby

Hold on, baby
(Hold on, baby)
Hold on, my little honey
(Hold on, baby)

Don't you know he's only tryin'
(Hold on, baby)
To take your love from me now?

I don't blame him, baby
You're so fine
If he thinks he's gonna get you
He's out of his mind

Hold on, now
(Hold on, baby)
Hold on, now
(Hold on, baby)

Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Gorgeous girls are bound to meet
To talk of stars and kings and feet
Through the chromosomes of space and time
Me I'm fast like bad infection
Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress

Telling lies

Shadow falls in shrinking smiles
See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure
Come straggling in your tattered remnants
You come to me with tears and blame
I'm your future
I am tomorrow
I am the end
Telling lies

It's the wrong time, and the wrong place
Though your face is charming, it's the wrong face
It's not her face, but such a charming face
That it's all right with me

It's the wrong song, in the wrong style
Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile
It's not her smile, but such a lovely smile
That it's all right with me

You can't know how happy I am that we met
I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget
Don't you want to forget someone, too?

It's the wrong game, with the wrong chips
Though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips
They're not her lips, but they're such tempting lips
That, if some night, you are free
Then it's all right, yes, it's all right with me
If my words did glow
With the gold of sunshine
And my tunes
Were played
On the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice
Come through the music
Would you hold it near
As it were your own?

It's a hand-me-down
The thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better
Left unsung
I don't know
Don't really care
Let there be songs
To fill the air

Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
Reach out your hand
If your cup be empty
If your cup is full
May it be again
Let it be known
There is a fountain
That was not made
By the hands of men

There is a road
No simple highway
Between the dawn
And the dark of night
And if you go
No one may follow
That path is for
Your steps alone

Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

You who choose
To lead must follow
But if you fall
You fall alone
If you should stand
Then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way
I would take you home

Man Smart, Women Smarter
Let us put men and women together, see which one is smarter
Some say men, but I say no, women got the men like a puppet show
It ain't me it's the people that say, men are leading women astray
I say, it's the women today, smarter than the men in every way
That's right the women are smarter, the women are smarted that's right
Little boy sitting in the corner and cry, big man come and ask him why
He said "I can't do what the big boys do", the man sat down and he cried too
It ain't me it's the people that say, men are leading women astray
I say, it's the women today, smarter than the men in every way
That's right the women are smarter, the women are smarted that's right
Ever since the world began women been imitating the ways of men
But listen cause I've got a plan, give it up just don't try to understand
It ain't me it's the people that say, men are leading women astray
I say, it's the women today, smarter than the men in every way
That's right the women are smarter, the women are smarted that's right
Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make the morning last
Just kicking down the cobble stones
Looking for fun and feelin' groovy

Hello lamppost
What cha knowing?
I've come to watch your flowers growing
Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?
Doot-in' doo-doo
Feelin' groovy

Got no deeds to do
No promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me
Life, I love you
All is groovy
Up in a meadow in Jasper, Alberta
Two men and four ponies on a long, lonesome ride
To see the high country and learn of her people
The ways that they live there, the ways that they die

One is a teacher, and one a beginner
Just wanting to be there, wanting to know
And together they're trying to tell us a story
That should have been listened to long, long ago

How the life in the mountains is living in danger
From too many people, too many machines
And the time is upon us, today is forever
Tomorrow is just one of yesterday's dreams

Cold nights in Canada and icy blue winds
The man and the mountains are brothers again
Clear waters are laughing, they sing to the skies
The Rockies are living, they never will die

Up in a meadow in Jasper, Alberta
Two men and four ponies on a long, lonesome ride
Oh, at first it was like heaven in your heart and in your arms
And paradise discovered in the sweetness of your charms
Yes, and every day a miracle to awake and be with you
And every night in your embrace another dream come true

But castles sometimes crumble some rivers still run dry
And fairy tales are witches tales when the truth becomes a lie
And a pocket full of promises won't buy a diamond ring
And every word you said to me just didn't mean a thing

It's over now, you've gone too far, I can't take anymore
Be careful now don't hurt yourself when you walk through that door
I can hardly stand to look at you it makes me want to cry
Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye

Now I suppose I'll never know why things turned out this way
And why the one you love the most is the one you drove away
Yes, and I suppose I'll never, ever really understand
How I could think that you'd make me a happy married man

So now I sit and contemplate the reason for it all
The climb to heights of ecstasy the failure and the fall
If a broken heart is purposeful it's in the lesson learned
No matter what the reason is it hurts when you get burned
Now I don't care, I don't think I'll ever love again
Kemosabe used to me good and trusted friend
But now it stands for therapy and all the tears I cry
Get your tongue out of my mouth 'cause I'm kissing you goodbye
Bye-bye, goodbye
Get your tongue out of my mouth 'cause I'm kissing you goodbye

[Verse 1]
Signs and wonders that the television shows (whoa)
Hate and poverty for the more, lets me know
That life is a stage and we're all in the show
Starring the World, 'cause we all blow
(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)
If we just give each other a chance
(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)
We might just fall in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Picture us (in a land)
Where there's no more (no more war)
Shaking hands with my (brother)
And respecting my (my sisters), my my my
(I'm offering) a dance that heals
(A melody) you can feel
Love is the key
All it takes is you and me

[Chorus]
If I could make the world dance

Then they would sing something like this
If I could make the world love
(if I could make them love, if I could make the love one another)
Then it would feel something like this

[Verse 2]
Tell me why can't more hungry people overcome
When they've got the means to build bombs, yeah
We're so quick to say God Bless America
But take away In God We Trust
Tell me what the hell is wrong with us?
(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)
If we just give each other a chance then
(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)
We might just fall in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Picture us (in a land)
Where there's no more (no more war)
Shaking hands with my (brothers)
And respecting my (sisters), my my my

People, there's got to be (there's got to be)
A place that we can go (a place that we can go)
And dance out the day
So meet me at the
Spot that we used to go
And just step the night away
Please let's just rewind time
And go back'cause I miss those days

[Chorus]
If I could make the world dance

[Outro]
Chocolate Factory
If I could make the world dance
I truly would
Marvin Gaye inspired me to write that one, y'all
Just as Frankie Beverly inspired me to write "Love Street"
You know every day is a special occasion, y'all
You know why? 'Cause you woke up this morning
Happy People, baby
You were my adored one
Then you became the bored one
And I was like a toy that brought you joy one day
A broken toy that you preferred to throw away

If I expected love when first we kissed
Blame it on my youth
If only just for you I did exist
Blame it on my youth
I believed in everything
Like a child of three
You meant more than anything
All the world to me
If you were on my mind both night and day
Blame it on my youth
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray
Blame it on my youth
And if I cried a little bit when first I learned the truth
Don't blame it on my heart
Blame it on my youth
Aspen, Colorado on a Saturday night
Jesse wishes she was at home
Upset because her baby just ain't treatin' her right
So afraid of being alone
Said she heard some stories he's been runnin' around
Said somehow she knows it's all true
She says a breaking heart can make a terrible sound
She said she don't know what to do

Think about a bad time, can't get much worse
Think about a hard time, take it to the wall
This won't be the last time, sure ain't the first
The bigger they are, the harder they fall

You might say she's caught between a rock and a hard place
You might say she just can't win
Some just can't recover from a slap in the face
Some just get right up and start all over again

Think about a bad time, can't get much worse
Think about a hard time, take it to the wall
This won't be the last time, sure ain't the first
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Think about a bad time, can't get much worse
Think about a hard time, take it to the wall
This won't be the last time, sure ain't the first
The bigger they are, the harder they fall

Aspen, Colorado on a Saturday night
Jesse wishes she was at home
She's mad because her baby just ain't treatin' her right
So afraid of being alone
So afraid of being alone
Nobody wants to be all alone
She don't want to be all alone
So afraid of being alone
We don't want to be all alone
Anymore it doesn't matter who's right or wrong
We've been injurin' each other much too long
And it's too late to try to save what might have been
It's over; nobody wins

Make believin' in forever is just a lie
And it seems a little sadder each time we try
'Cause it's a shame to make the same mistake again and again
It's over; nobody wins

We've gone too far, too long, too far apart
The lovin' was easy; it's the livin' that's hard
For there's no need to stay to see the way it ends
It's over; nobody wins

We've gone too far, too long, too far apart
The lovin' was easy; it's the livin' that's hard
For there's no need to stay to see the way that it ends
It's over; nobody wins
It's over; nobody wins
Here's a song called Virgie that I wrote for Aunt Virgie Haughs and I dedicate it to her husband, to her children and the countless people that loved her so much

Virgie, your house was always warm
And my bed was always ready when I came
Virgie, in the middle of the night
You would welcome friends of mine without a name

And you could always hear and see
The turning of the key
And your laughing voice to me was like a song

Virgie, your spirit sweet and free
Is living still with me though you're gone
Hmmmmm....

Virgie, you spoke soflty and kind
And you never said a word to critize
Virgie your children love you so
More that we ever let you realize

And they are all I knew
That I could bring my cares to you
And when I was wrong you never put me down
Virgie, there's so much I could say
But I can't find the way to write it down
Can't find the way to write it down...
Hmmmmm.....
(Allen Collins - Ronnie VanZant)

I said baby mama, I don't know your name
But I said baby, sugar I can play your game
Every night when we leave the hall
I see you hanging around
You wanna ride in my big black car baby
Wanna go uptown

(Chorus)
I know who you are baby
I know what they call you girl
Never put you down baby
I'm just like you baby, I'm on the hunt

I know lady
People gonna talk about you and me
Let me say one thing mama, sugar I do as I please
And if you wanna love me baby, I'm your man
And all those high-falutin' society people
I don't care if they don't undertand
(Chorus)
My daddy told me a long time ago
Said there's two things son
Two things you should know
And in these two things you must take pride
That's a horse and woman, yeah
Well both of them you ride
Scared of losing all the time
You wrote it in a letter
He was a friend of mine
He heard you could see your future
Inside a glass of water
The ripples and the lines
And he asked, would I see heaven in mine?
That is just the way it was
Nothing could be better
And nothing ever was
Oh and they say you can see your future
Inside a glass of water
The riddles and the rhymes
Will I see heaven in mine?
Oh Oh Oh Oh I
Son, don't ask
Neither how full nor empty is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast
So he wrote it on a wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
Televisions selling plastic figurines of leaders
Saying nothing at all
And you chime
Stars in heaven align
Oh Oh Oh Oh I
Son, don't ask
Neither how full nor empty is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast
Oh what are we drinking when we're done?
Glasses of water
Well, the rain was a-failin'
And the ground turned to mud
I was watching all the people
Running from the flood
So i started to pray
Though i ain't no prayin' man
For the lord to come a helpin'
Knowing he'd understand
Deliver your children to the good good life
Give'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night
And if a thing goes wrong you'd better make it right

Well, i had me a woman
She was good and clean
She spent all day with the washing machine
But when it come to lovin'
She was never around
She was out getting dirty
All over town
Chorus

Well, i was low on money
And my truck broke down
I was on my way to the lost and found
So i took it to a dealer
I said make it run
Well, i ain't got no money
But i got me a gun

I said you robbed me before
So i'm robbing you back
And if it don't put you straight
It'll put you on the right track
Well, i ain't no devil and i ain't no saint
But i can tell a dealer by the colour of his paint

Chorus

If you want good eggs
You gotta feed that hen
And if you wanna hear some more
Well, i'll sing it again
The world is just a great big onion
And pain and fear are the spices that make you cry
Oh, and the only way to get rid of this great big onion
Is to plant love seeds until it dies, uh huh

Hey world! We got a great big job to do
Yeah, we need you
And everybody who loves truth
Don't you know we've got to clean up this place
And reach far high and oh yeah
Yes we do
We gotta be headstrong about rightin' the wrong
And make a mountain of happy souls, oh;
Oh

The world is just a great big onion
And I don't care, it's the face people like to wear
Yes it is now
And the only way to get rid of this great big onion
Every one single soul's got to do their share
Tell about it, baby!
So come on, let's knock on every door
Tell them love is the answer
Whether they're rich or poor, oh yeah
For we don't care what you do
How you look, or your status claim, baby
No no, because brothers and sisters
From now on, is gonna be everyone's name, oh oh

The world is just a great big onion
And pain and fear are the spices that make you cry
Yes it is
And the only way to get rid of this great big onion
Is to plant love seeds
Now everybody, got to plant love seeds
Come on and plant love seeds
Until it dies
The world is just a great big onion

[Verse 1]
He is three, one's in the middle unmoved
Waiting to show what he sees to the other two
To the one attacking, so afraid
And the one that keeps trying to love and trust, getting himself betrayed

[Chorus 1]
In the plan, oh, the divine plan
God must be a boogie man
God must be a boogie man!

[Verse 2]
One's so sweet, so overly loving and gentle
He lets people into his innermost sacred temple
Blind faith to care, blind rage to kill
Why'd he let them talk him down to cheap work and cheap thrills

[Chorus 2]
In the plan, oh, the insulting plan
God must be a boogie man
God must be a boogie man!

[Verse 3]
Which would it be, Mingus, one or two or three?
Which one do you think he'd want the world to see?
Well, world opinion's not a lot of help
When a man's only trying to find out how to feel about himself

[Chorus 3]
In the plan, oh, the cock-eyed plan
God must be a boogie man
God must be a boogie man!

[Outro]
He is three

"Now you got to fight, my brother

Today, while the blossoms still cling to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries, I'll drink your sweet wine
A million tomorrows shall all pass away
'Ere I forget all the joy that is mine, Today

I'll be a dandy, and I'll be a rover
You'll know who I am by the songs that I sing
I'll feast at your table, I'll sleep in your clover
Who cares what the morrow shall bring

Today, while the blossoms still cling to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries, I'll drink your sweet wine
A million tomorrows shall all pass away
‘Ere I forget all the joy that is mine, Today

I can't be contented with yesterday's glory
I can't live on promises winter to spring
Today is my moment, now is my story
I'll laugh and I'll cry and I'll sing

Today, while the blossoms still cling to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries, I'll drink your sweet wine
A million tomorrows shall all pass away
'Ere I forget all the joy that is mine, Today
Today, while the blossoms still cling to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries, I'll drink your sweet wine
A million tomorrows shall all pass away
'Ere I forget all the joy that is mine, Today
Now... now it's over baby
I can come home to you
Just as I should do

And you're... waiting there for me
Just as you should be
Hope to see you soon

Now that you've got all the things
That you need
And you're still waitin' for me

So good to be here
So good to see your face
So good to be loved by you
And we are both here waiting

All I can say or do, yeah
Is give my love to you
Just as I should do
I can't imagine me leaving you
Wasting my time
When I wanna be with you baby

So good to be here
So good to see your face
So good to be loved by you

Everyday it's hard to make you stay
Stealing your heart
You're gonna run away from me, baby

So good to be here
So good to see your face
So good to be loved by you
Every day in every way
I want to keep you girl in every way
Looking at the news today is a cold depressing thing
We see our nation stained and the whole worlds up in flames
People starving all over the land
What a low down dirty shame and abroad
We see the same we have our selves to blame
Well it's been said that we should share
What the master gives to us
Well the time has come to help someone less fortunate than us

Save the world, feed the hungry people
Clothe the little babies lend a helping hand
Save the world, feed the hungry people
Show them we love and care

I took a walk into town this morning a beggar followed me
He said he needed food to eat and spare some change please
I took him into the closest grill and paid for all he could eat
It warmed my heart as he said thank you ma'am to me
Well it saddened me as walked a little further
Just to see that there is more than one
On every corner without a place to sleep
Save the world, feed the hungry people
Clothe the little babies lend a helping hand
Save the world, feed the hungry people
Show them we love and care

We've got to feed the hungry mind soul and body
Shelter feed and cloth everybody with much as we can
Please stretch out your hand

Save the world, feed the hungry people
Clothe the little babies lend a helping hand
Save the world, feed the hungry people
Show them we love and care
OOOOOOO MMM MMM MMMMMMM

We don't have no plastic L.A. friends
Ain't on the edge of no popular trend
Ain't never seen the inside of that magazine GQ

Or some waitress busting ass at some liquor stand
If you got soul we hang out with people just like you

Well my hairs turning white
My necks always been red
My collars still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you
Guess you could say we've always been Red White and Blue

Ride our own bikes to Sturgis pay are own dues
Smokin camels and drinking domestic brews
If you want to know where i've been just look at my hands
Yeah i've driven by the white house and spent some time in jail
Mama cried but she still wouldn't pay my bail
I ain't been no angel but even god he understands
My hairs turning white
My necks always been red
My collars still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you
Guess you could say
We've always been red white and blue

Yeah that's right.....

My daddy worked hard and so have I
We paid our taxes and gave our lives to serve this great country
So what are they complaining about
Yeah we love our families
We love our kids
You know it's love that makes us all so rich
That's where were at
If they don't like it they can just...get the hell out! Yeah!

My hairs turning white
My necks always been red
My collars still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you
Guess you could say
We've always been red white and blue

East of the Sun and West of the Moon
We'll build a dream house so lovely
Near to the sun in a day, near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Living our love in memory
Just you and I, forever and a day

Love will not die, we'll keep it that way
Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life, too lovely tune
East of the Sun and West of the Moon, dear
East of the Sun and West of the Moon

Just you and I, forever and a day
Love will not die, we will keep it that way
Way, up among the stars we'll find
East of the Sun and West of the Moon, dear
East of the Sun and West of the Moon

Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life, too lovely tune
East of the Sun and West of the Moon, dear
East of the Sun and West of the Moon
Well
Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life, too lovely tune
East of the Sun and West of the Moon, dear
East of the Sun and West of the Moon
They said I had it bad
Addicted to what we had
Heart rate's slow, fading fast
Vitals low might not last
Strapped down while sirens ring
Holding on, trying to breathe
Not like this, I can't leave
Look what you've done to me

I've overdose overdose overdose on you
They said I've overdose overdose overdose on you
'Cause I want you close. Need you the most
Without you, I'm just through
So I've overdose overdose overdose on you

Rushing me, switching lanes
IV's going through my veins
Blood tests say no cocaine
They don't know you're the blame
Cause you're deep inside of me
So this is goodbye to me
But for you, I'll die happily
One more hit, I'll be free
'Cause I've overdose overdose overdose on you
They said I've overdose overdose overdose on you
'Cause I want you close. Need you the most
Without you, I'm just through
So I've overdose overdose overdose on you

'Cause I know that you would kill me
'Cause I'm sweatin, tweakin, feenin
Never been so high
But damn I love this feeling
Cause I'm achin, breakin, shakin
Will I make it through the night?
And now my body's cold
I'm losing, cause I was abusing it. Oh no
Can't nobody help, I did it to myself
And that's why I'll do it again and again

I've overdose overdose overdose on you
They said I've overdose overdose overdose on you
'Cause I want you close. Need you the most
Without you, I'm just through
'Cause I've overdose overdose overdose on you
Father oh father please hear me
My song is a cry of desperation
All of the words I hear
Have lost their meaning

My life is a well of confusion
Drowned out by the sound of the lost and lonely
Only the voice inside
Speaks your name to me

If they only knew the things that I know
If they only could see the things that I see
If they only knew the things that I know
If they only could see the things that I see

My brothers at opposite tables
Like fire and water against each other
Only a fool can't see
The obvious ending

Are we as ashes to wildwood
Is life just a fire that can only consume us
Is there no vision of love
To bind us together
If they only knew the things that I know
(You are only every thing that I know)
If they only could see the things that I see
If they only knew the things that I know
(You are only every thing that I know)
If they only could see the things that I see
If they only knew the things that I know
(You are only every thing that I know)
If they only could see the things that I see
If they only knew the things that I know
(You are only every thing that I know)
If they only could see the things that I see
If they only knew the things that I know
At the end of a rainbow
You'll find a pot of gold
At the end of a story
You'll find it's all been told
But our love has a treasure our hearts always spend
And it has a story without any end

At the end of a river
The water stops its flow
At the end of a highway, there's no place you can go
But just tell me you love and you are only mine
And our love will go on till the end of time

At the end of a river, the water stops its flow
At the end of a highway, there's no place you can go
But just tell me you love and you are only mine
And our love will go on till the end of time
Till the end of time
Rubber Ring

Yeah

What She Said

[Verse 1]
What she says
"How come someone hasn't noticed that I'm dead
And decided to bury me? God knows, I'm ready"
La-la-di-da-da-da

[Verse 2]
What she said was sad
But then, all the rejection she's had
To pretend to be happy could only be idiocy
La-la-di-da-da-da

[Chorus 1]
What she said was not for the job or
Lover that she never had
No, no, no, no, no

[Verse 3]
What she read
All heady books she'd sit and prophesise
It took a tattooed boy from Birkenhead
To really, really open her eyes

[Verse 3]
What she read
All heady books she'd sit and prophesise
It took a tattooed boy from Birkenhead
To really, really open her eyes

[Chorus 2]
What she said
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an early death
And I need to cling to something"

[Chorus 2]
What she said
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an early death
And I need to cling to something"
No, no, no, no, no

Monday morning you sure look fine
Friday I got travelling on my mind
First you love me then you fade away
I can't go on believing this way

I got nothing but love for you
So tell me what you really want to do
First you love me then you get on down the line
But I don't mind, no, I don't mind

I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
I got to get some peace in my mind

Monday morning you sure look fine
Friday I got travelling on my mind
First you love me then you say it's wrong
I can't go on believing for long

But you know it's true
You only want me when I get over you
First you love me, then you get on down the line
But I don't mind, no, I don't mind
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
I got to get some peace in my mind

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
She is my first love
Graceful in all her ways
Folding the hillside
Turning the sky from night into day
She won't fail to take my breath away

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
So soft this silence
She brings before the dawn
A time of twilight
When all the world waits to be reborn

[B part]
Nobody knows her name
No one knows how she came to be here at all
Giving her loving
Hoping to everyone

[C part]
Old as the hills
Young just like the rising sun over fields
That lie away beneath her feet
Ev'ry time we meet
She takes my breath away

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
People keep on learnin'
Soldiers keep on warrin'
The world keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long
Powers will keep on lyin'
While your people will keep on dyin'
The world keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long

[Chorus]
So darn glad he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on Earth, I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin' 'til I reach the highest ground

[Verse 2]
A-teachers a-keep on teachin'
A-preachers a-keep on preachin'
World, keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh no
Lovers a-keep on lovin'
While believers keep on believin'
Sleepers just stop sleepin'
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh no

[Chorus]
So darn glad he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on Earth, I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin' 'til I reach the highest ground

[Outro]
And Stevie knows that, uh, nobody's gonna bring me down
('Til I reach the highest ground)
'Cause me and Stevie, see, we're gonna be sailing on the fuckin' funky sound
('Til I reach the highest ground)
Bustin' out, and I'll break you out, 'cause I'm sailing on
('Til I reach the highest ground)
Just, uh, sailin' on, sailin' on the higher ground
('Til I reach the highest ground)
To compose and decompose, to decompose

The ebb and flow of the darkness, the ebb and flow de ma paresse

To compose, to decompose and recompose

From a minute to another, from minuscule to the full grandeur

To compose, decompose, I wander and I slip

Get all those ghosts out of my sight, they devour all of my might
(Girl)
So what are you doing back?

(Man)
Well, I set back and thought about
The things we used to do
It really meant a lot to me
You mean a lot to me

(Girl)
I really mean that much to you?

(Man)
Girl, you know it's true

I'm in love with you, girl, 'cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you pack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true?
You're soft, succulent, so sweet and thin
That's kind of like a vision upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's, oh, so true
Together we're one separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
'Cause you contain a quality, you that I admire
You're pretty plain and simple, you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love, girl, I'm in so love, girl
I'm just in love, girl, and this is true
Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you

This is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain
My emotions starts up when I hear your name
Maybe your sweet, sweet voice would ring in my ears
Then delay my system, girl, when you are near
And with your positive emotion, love-making enjoyin'
That's for me to bust, it's like a girl and a boy
These feelings I get I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I
Now what you're wearing I don't care, or as I've said before
No reason that I like you, girl, just for what you are
If I said I'd think about it, you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love, girl, I'm in so love, girl
I'm just in love girl, and this is true

Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love
Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
Can't think of anything I'd rather do
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
Can't think of anyone as lovely as you

A casual stroll through a garden
A kiss by a lazy lagoon
Catching a breath of moonlight
Humming our favorite tune

This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
Can't think of anything I'd rather do

This is a lovely way to spend an evening
Can't think of anyone as lovely as you
Happy here, here with you

A casual stroll through a garden
And a kiss by a lazy lagoon
Catching a breath of moonlight
Humming our favorite tune
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you
I love spending all with you
(Uh, oh, uh, oh, uh, oh, uh, oh, uh, oh)
Sometimes when we fight, I think maybe I
Should just let you leave and push you out of my life
But I don't decide 'cause I know that I
Just can't survive without you

And I know inside I never let you go
'Cause I'm sure you're the one
Even through the rain it's clear, you're the one I want
And no matter how we fuss and fight, girl
You should always know, I just can't stop loving you

That's why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
That's why I can't say go
(Uh, oh, uh, oh)
I said, "That's why I can't say go"
(Uh, oh, uh, oh, uh, oh)

Baby I've tried, to tell you goodbye
One look from your eyes
And those dumb thoughts say goodbye
It's foolish to try when I know that I
I just can't survive without you

And I know inside I never let you go
'Cause I'm sure you're the one
Even through the rain it's clear that you're the one I want
And no matter how we fuss and fight, girl
You should always know, I just can't stop loving you

That's why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
That's why I can't say go
(Uh, oh)
To see through the night, you are my light
So even when we fight I know it's going to be alright
You have my soul, I'm just letting you know

That's why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
That's why I can't say go
I said, "That's why I can't say go"

All the way and all around
Take my hand and say you'll follow me

It's long been on my mind

Can't accept this feeling and I don't think I want to

Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change

Won't you fly high free bird?
Yeah
It's been almost a year since that beautiful weekend
It was more than a lifetime ago
How it happens to mind after all of this time
And brings tears to my eyes I don't know

It's the thought of you
And the way that it hurts to be so much in love
The thought of you
Brings it all my way

I know that it's late, I'm sorry I called
I'm surprised to have found you at home
It's just once in awhile I remember your number
I was hoping that you'd be alone

For I thought of you
And the way you can turn it around with a smile
The thought of you
Brings it all my way

I know that it's over, but I can't discover a way to erase how I feel
I remember the nights and the passionate fights and I know that I love you and I always will
And I want you to know that I'm always here for you
Any day, any night, any time
It happened before, it could happen once more
There's a chance that you might change your mind

For I thought of you
And the way that it feels to be safe in your arms
The thought of you
Brings it all my way

I know that it's over, but I can't discover a way to erase how I feel
I remember the nights and the passionate fights
And I know that I love you and I always will
It's been almost a year since that beautiful weekend
It was more than a lifetime ago
Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see

Another day goes by, and still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and see

Take a good look around and if you're lookin' down
Put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart
The sun machine is coming down
And we're gonna have a party
The sun machine is coming down
And we're gonna have a party

The sun machine is coming down

[Verse 1: Wanya & Mike]
Lying here
With my arms above my head
Hungry for your love
Waiting to be fed
Your body speaks to mine
And I understood every word
Told me that you needed me
At least that's what I heard
I'm trying to hold on
But I don't know for how long
(Don't make me wait too long)

[Chorus]
Love me, lovely
Love me, lovely
Lovely, love me right
Breathe me, taste me
Touch me, take me
In your arms tonight
All I wanna do is
Watch you, watch me
Feel you
Fill me up with pure delight
That makes it easier to
Love thee, lovely
Love me, lovely
Lovely, love me right
Love me right

[Verse 2: Shawn & Mike]
Why don't you tell me
What you want from me, girl
Let me dive into your ocean
So I can find your precious pearls
(I can find your precious...)
As the moon invades our bedroom
And reveals the sweat on your back
It increases my intensity
To go there and never come back
I'm trying to hold on
But I don't know for how long
(I need you)

[Chorus]
Love me, lovely
Love me, lovely
Lovely, love me right
Breathe me, taste me
Touch me, take me
In your arms tonight
All I wanna do is
Watch you, watch me
Feel you
Fill me up with pure delight
That makes it easier to
Love thee, lovely
Love me, lovely
Lovely, love me right
(Love me)
Love me right

[Bridge: Wanya & Nathan & (Mike)]
Oh how you tease me
Driving me crazy
Want you to please me
So come on lady
(Girl, come on)
Coz I'm 'bout to touch
She takes a step back
See her getting excited
By the way I react
Moving in slow
I can smell her perfume
(You smell so good)
She's moving closer still
I know my time's coming soon
(Oh, here it comes)
Baby, are you ready
Can't take it no more
I don't think you're ready
For all that I have in store
I'm trying to hold on
But I don't know for how long
(Come on, girl, I need you
Take me right now)
(Love me
Love me
Love me right now
Touch me
Touch me
I'll make you feel so good)
Lovely lady, love me right
(Right now)
Take me in your arms tonight
(Take me here, baby)
Fill me up with pure delight
(That's what I'm talking about)
Lady, won't you love me right
(I want you so bad)

[Chorus]
Love me, lovely
Love me, lovely
Lovely, love me right
Breathe me, taste me
Touch me, take me
In your arms tonight
All I wanna do is
Watch you, watch me
Feel you
Fill me up with pure delight
That makes it easier to
Love thee, lovely
Love me, lovely
Lovely, love me right
Love me right...

[Verse 1]
When it all began
We were perfect then
Somehow we have lost our way
(Our way)

We keep going there
And I know you're scared
We will make it back one day
(One day)

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, no more, no more
No more fighting now
'Cause together there's nothing
That we can't do

[Chorus]
Throw one up for love
Sew one up for love
Put one up, put one up
Don't give up just stand up
One up for love
(One up for love)
One up for love

Don't you wanna stand up for love?
Everybody all around the world
(One up for love)
One up for love

[Verse 2]
So many are angry
Too many are broken in
And the smoke keeps rising up
(Ah)

You know
With all this confusion
(All this confusion)
Everybody's losing
When's it gonna be enough?
Whoa yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So, no more, no more
No more fighting now
'Cause together there's nothing
That we can't do

[Chorus]
Throw one up for love
Sew one up for love

Put one up, put one up
Don't give up, just stand up

One up for love
(One up for love)
One up for love

Don't you wanna stand up for love?
Everybody all around the world
One up for love
One up for love

[Bridge]
No more
No more excuses
We don't need to fight
Find a way to bring it back to love
(Bring it back, bring it back)

No more
We can change the world
We can change the world this time

[Chorus]
Throw one up for love
Sew one up for love

Put one up, put one up
Don't give up, just stand up

One up for love
(One up for love)
One up for love

Don't you wanna stand up for love?
Everybody all around the world
One up for love, one up for love

(One up for love, one up for love)

[Outro]
Oh
One up
(One up for love)
Oh, oh, oh
One love

(Put one up for love)
For love
Oh
One love
One up for love

(One up for love)
(One up for love)

[Verse 1]
Oh no, I see
A spider web is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I'd said

[Verse 2]
Oh no, what's this?
A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done

[Chorus]
And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm

[Verse 3]
Oh no, I see
A spider web, and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble

[Chorus]
Singing out, I never meant to cause you trouble
I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm

[Outro]
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me

[Verse 1]
Let us put men and women together
See which one is smarter
Some say men, but I say no
The women got the men like a puppet show

[Chorus]
It ain't me, it's the people that say
That the men are leading the women astray
But I say that the women today
Are smarter than the men in every way
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
The women are smarter that's right
(That's right)

[Verse 2]
Little boy sit on the corner and cry
Big man come and he ask him why
Says I can't do what the big boys do
Man sat down and he cried too

[Chorus]
It ain't me, but the people who say
That the men are leading the women astray
But I say that the women today
Are smarter than the men in every way
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
The women are smarter that's right
(That's right)

[Verse 3]
Ever since the world began
Women been imitating the ways of men
But listen, boys cause I've got a plan
Give it up, don't try to understand

[Chorus]
It ain't me, it's the people that say
That the men are leading the women astray
But I say that the women today
Are smarter than the men in every way
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
The women are smarter that's right
(That's right)
They say they love each other
I've no doubt they do
They say they'll always be together
That may not be true

They come from different places
Different points of view
They find themselves in different spaces
Everything is all brand new

Two different directions
Too many different ways
One always on the road somewhere
The other one always stays
Too often unhappy
Too often on your own
When you are moving in different directions
True love is all alone

Old stories start to surface
Patterns from long ago
And loving quickly turns to anger
For reasons they don't even know
The strongest heart can be broken
With one insensitive word
The deepest feelings remain unspoken
No one is seen and nothing heard
Two different directions
Too many different ways
One always wants to work things out
The other one wants to play
To ready for changes
To much that just can't wait
When you are moving in different directions
True love can turn to hate

If opposites attract each other
What's the reason for
One being like an open window
One just like a closing door

Two different directions
Two many different ways
One likes to see the morning sunrise
The other one sleeps in late
To many tomorrows
To many times too late
When you are moving in different directions
True love may have to wait
If you are committed to different directions
True love will have to wait
It was a sad wedding, a very sad wedding
And the tears came tumblin' from my eyes
We fell in love, first day we met
Then later on we were wed
And as we stood there greeting all our friends
Here's what I heard somebody say
It was a sad wedding, oh, how I cried
Oh, how beautiful was the bride
It was a sad wedding, a very sad wedding
And the tears came tumblin' from my eyes
I was so nervous, I just couldn't wait
To see you walk down the aisle
Then suddenly there was music, all my fear was gone
And you came walking with a smile
We had our reception
Then we were on our way
Off to our honeymoon
When you threw your bouquet
And rice flew over our heads
I overheard somebody say
It was a sad wedding, oh, how I cried
Oh, how beautiful was the bride
It was a sad wedding, a very sad wedding
And the tears, tears, tears
And the tears, tears, tears
And the tears came tumblin' from my eyes
And the tears, tears, tears
And the tears, tears, tears
And the tears
In the still of the moment; my voice can be heard
So listen carefully;There's music inside each word
I am the composer; Of the melody of life
Take my yoke upon you'll learn of me;I'll be your guiding light

I am the director; Be part of my symphony
I speak peace into the storms;Even the winds obey me
Let me be your soul;You'll never have to walk alone
I'll help you;Carry on... Carry on

I am the music;Within the inner ear
Harken unto my voice;I'll declare I'll draw near
I am the rhythm;To every beat of you heart
If you place your trust in me;I'll never ever part
Let me be you soul;You'll never have to walk alone
I will help you;Carry on

When the notes are formed(and make)
And make a special sound(music inside of music)
Music iside the music(it lifts you when you are down)
It lifts you when you are down(I'm more than)
More than the beat of time(so much more than)
More than the lyric more than the rhyme(I am more than)
More than just a melody(more than just a rhyme)
More than just a rhyme(I'm... more than just a melody come on to me---come on to me)
(Ad libs)
More than just a melody
I am your closest friend I'll be there to the end
More than just a rhyme
Shelter in the time of storm and you'll never have to be alone ah yeah
More than just a melody
Troubles will last always when you realize that I am
More than just a rhyme
You dont have to be alone when you realize that I am so much more
More than just a melody
I'm more, I'm more than a rhyme more than the melody more than the beat of time
More than just a rhyme
You won't have to face each day alone because I am more
More than just a melody
More than just a song you sing;More than the beat
(More than)More than just a melody
More...than anything that you've experienced in this life
More than just a melody
More..................than
More than just a melody(fade out)

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
A chick always knows what they gon' do
From the minute they say "hi"
To the giving of their number
From the moment they reply

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]
So don't ever think you've got the upper hand
On believe you're running game
'Cause your game's been peeped even before you speak
And offer her your name
'Cause you'll have her like

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
Ooh, ooh, (All giddy, she'll be like ooh), ooh

(Sex with you if it's the last thing they ever do)

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman, Wanya Morris]
See, it ain't about the jewels
Or how much dough you got
Not even 'bout the car you drive
But it's the feeling she gets
When you spit the right shit
You can tell by the look in her eye

So at dinner when you kick it
And you're trying to figure out
If she's gonna give you some
As long as you stay fresh and you're not acting pressed
Most of all don't say nothing dumb and you'll have her like

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
Ooh, ooh, (All giddy and shit, like, ooh), ooh
(They know they're gonna have) Sex with you (Yeah)
(And they know from the gate) how long they're gonna wait
Ooh, ooh
(Oh, oh, you should hear them talkin', the minute you walk in, they know)
(They're gonna have) sex with you
(Sex with you if it's the last thing they ever do)

[Bridge: Boyz II Men]
Make sure you say all the things that keeps smile on her face
(Keep a smile on her face)
Don't be too cool to express yourself
Even though it might not be your way
(Even though it might not be your way)
If you're around your crew and you happen to do something special
Don't be afraid to tell her it's you
And you won't regret it
So next time you're trying to find the lines
Or a clever thing to say
Just be yourself and no one else
'Cause your gonna get it anyway
All the ladies if you hear us say yeah
Real soft like yeah
And if you feel us let me hear you say yeah
'Cause we're up on the game that you're playin'
We know what you're sayin' is

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
Ooh, ooh (Ooh), ooh, ooh-ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
(They know they're gonna have) Sex with you
(Oh, oh, see, they already decided) how long they're gonna wait

('Cause it's all about this little game we play)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ah-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro: Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman]
Morris-Stockman-Morris, Ph.D., The Remedy
I said it's alright, I said it's alright
As I stand alone on this moonful night
For the first time I feel alone in life
As I watched the moon kissed the star-lit skies
I feel the need for your lips to press close to mine

For so long, I've been afraid to love
But right now I feel a need for love
And you have the love, love I need. (Right now)
Aw, to comfort me

Ooo, and I'm ready for love. (Ready for love)
I'm truly ready for love. (Ready for love)
Your wonderful sweet, sweet love. (Sweet, sweet love)
Ooo, and I'm ready for love

I tried to shield my heart from love tender touch
'Cause to lose a love, aw, would hurt so much
But as I softly walked in my solitude
I search my heart and I found there's a need for you

And for the first time I feel alone
'Cause I need a love, aw, to call my own
And only you, have the love, the love I need
Aw, to comfort me
Ooo, and I'm ready for love. (Ready for love)
I'm truly ready for love. (Ready for love)
Your wonderful sweet, sweet love. (Sweet, sweet love)
Aw, and I'm ready for love

I ready (right now.)

And for the first time I feel alive
Have the tender love, deep down inside
And just as soon as I see a smiling face
I rush into your warm embrace

Right now, I'm ready for love
I'm truly ready for love
Your wonderful sweet, sweet love
Right now, I'm ready for love
Comfort me, baby. (?)
Aw, I'm ready for love
Wonderful sweet, sweet love
Aw, I'm ready for love

[Intro]
This, this...
She said goodbye
This, this...

[Chorus]
This love
This love has taken its toll
This love
This love has taken its toll
This love
This love has taken its toll
This love
She said goodbye too many times before

[Bridge]
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
I'll fix these broken things (Taken its toll)
Repair your broken wings
I'll fix these broken things (Taken its toll)
Repair your broken wings
Taken its toll...

[Chorus]
This love
This love has taken its toll
This love
This love has taken its toll
Taken its toll...

[Verse 1]
Can't you see we were meant to be, oh baby
Down for each other for eternity, oh baby, baby
Let me know if you're out of my life
(Don't hang on) Don't hang on to my heart and say bye-bye
Oh baby, I used to be the one that you could call on
Now you like to play around
Hit me up on what went wrong

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna hold on to your love, baby (I'm not gonna hold on)
If the chances are that I'm gonna fall off (that I'm gonna fall off)
I'm not gonna hold on to your love, baby (to your lovin', baby)
If the chances are that I'm gonna fall off (that I'm gonna fall off)

[Verse 2]
Memories like the corner of my mind, oh baby
You know just what to do to make my love come down
I know just what you need, but you don't come around
Let me know if you're out of my life (of my life)
Don't hang on to my heart, say bye-bye, oh baby
I used to be the one that you could call on
Now you like to play around
Hit me up on what went wrong

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna hold on to your love, baby (not gonna hold on)
If the chances are that I'm gonna fall off (fall off, fall off)
I'm not gonna hold on to your love, baby (not gonna hold on)
If the chances are that I'm gonna fall off

[Bridge]
I'm not gonna hold on to your lovin', baby
Look at what you're doing to me, baby, oh oh
(Hold on) Look at what you're doing to me, baby, oh oh

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna hold on to your love, baby
If the chances are that I'm gonna fall off
I'm not gonna hold on to your love, baby
If the chances are that I'm gonna fall off
Well I was found in the transit lounge
Of a dirty airport town
What was I doing on the road to ruin
Well my mama laid me down
My mama laid me down

Round my hand was a plastic band
With a picture of my face
I was crying left to die in
This God forsaken place
This God forsaken place

Only mama knows why she laid me down
In this God forsaken town
Where she was running to, what she ran from
Though I always wondered I never knew
Only mama knows
Only mama knows

I'm passing through I'm on my way
I'm on the road, no ETA
I'm passing through, no fixed abode
And that is why I need to try
To hold on I've gotta hold on, gotta hold on
Was it planned as a one night stand
Or did she leave in disgrace?
Well I never will I ever see my father's face
See my father's face?

Only mama knows why she laid me down
In this God forsaken town
Where she was running to what she ran from
Though I always wondered I never knew
Only mama knows
Only mama knows

Only mama knows why she laid me down
In this God forsaken town
Where she was running to what she ran from
Though I always wondered I never knew
Only mama knows
Only mama knows
I've gotta hold on. I've gotta hold on
You've gotta hold on
The children of Bethlehem
One cold winter's night
Were wakened by singing
And a heavenly light
With whispers and murmurs
On pattering feet
The children of Bethlehem
Came into the street

The people were sleeping
All safely in bed
The children heard singing
In the sky overhead
They heard
"Peace will be with you
Whoever you are
Oh, come to the stable
Come, follow the Star"

And the children of Bethlehem
That cold winter's night
Came down to the stable
They followed the light
Now the roosters were crowing
At the dawning of day
The baby lay sleeping
In the manger he lay
The children of Bethlehem
Came in two by two
They came to the manger
That the Star brought them to
They came to the manger
Where the sweet Baby lay
The children of Bethlehem
Showed us the way
Eyes that send me chasing after feelings that I lost one day
Why befriend me when the brandy tells me what they want to say?
Playing big protector is a grand disguise
'Til you contradict yourself with brandy eyes

No beginning -- still no end to let me shrug and walk away
Silly grinning, teasing talk that promises a kiss some day
I would put you out of mind if I were wise
But wisdom has no power over brandy eyes

Maybe I'm wrong
If I am please pardon me and pat my head

Sing an old song
Sing of one more foolish heart that's being misled
Take the points for winning and donate the prize
And keep on a-scoring with those brandy eyes

[Verse 1]
Putting your patience to the test
Putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
Never yours but someone else's voice

[Verse 2]
Slipping your body through the street
Sending your girlfriends to the night for cheap
Wearing a jacket made of meat
Sending a letter with war so sweet

[Hook 1]
And now you've see that
Waves turn to gray
Life in the shade
A violent cloud
That's on USA
Platinum's on the rise
Windows in disguise
I'm just tryin' to find
A mountain I can climb, yeah

[Verse 3]
Putting your patience to the test
Putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
Never yours but someone else's voice

[Hook 2]
And now you see that
Waves turn to gray
Life in the shade
A violent cloud
That's on USA
Porn on the rise
Circles in disguise
I'm just tryin' to find
A mountain I can climb, yeah

[Outro]
Putting your patience to the test
Putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
Never yours but someone else's voice
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't hide
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again 'cause I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be
When I'm with you I want to stay there
And if I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life

Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you
Got to get you into my life
Standing on the corner, suitcase in my hand
Jack is in his coat, and Jane is her vest, and, me
I'm in a rock'n'roll band. Huh!
Ridin' in a Stutz-Bearcat, Jim
Y'know, those were different times!
Oh, all the poet, they studied rules of verse
And the ladies, they rolled their eyes
Sweet Jane! Whoa! Sweet Jane, oh-oh-a! Sweet Jane!

I'll tell you something
Jack, he is a banker
And Jane, she is a clerk
Both of them save their monies, ha
And when, when they come home from work!
Ooh! Sittin' down by the fire, oh!
The radio does play
The classical music there, Jim
"The March of the Wooden Soldiers"
All you protest kids
You can hear Jack say, get ready, ah
Sweet Jane! Come on baby now! Sweet Jane! Oh-oh-a! Sweet Jane!
Some people, they like to go out dancing
And other peoples, they have to work. Just watch me now!
And there's even some evil mothers
Well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt
Y'know that, women, never really faint
And that villains always blink their eyes, woo!
And that, y'know, children are the only ones who blush!
And that, life is, just to die!
And, everyone who ever had a heart, oh
That wouldn't turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played a part, whoa
And wouldn't turn around and hate it!

Sweet Jane! Whoa-oh-oh! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane. Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane. Sweet Jane

Heavenly wine and roses
Seems to whisper to her when he smiles. ah
Heavenly wine and roses
Seems to whisper to her when he smiles. hey!
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, oh
Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane!

[Verse 1]
Drift all you like from ocean to ocean
Search the whole world
But drunken confessions and hijacked affairs
Will just make you more alone

[Verse 2]
When you come home I’ll bake you a cake
Made of all their eyes
I wish you could see me dressed for the kill

[Chorus]
You’re my man of war
You’re my man of war
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
So unplug the phones, stop all the taps
It all comes flooding back
To poison clouds and poisoned dwarves

[Chorus]
You’re my man of war
You’re my man of war
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
For you, big boots

[Spoken Word]

Now it's gone, gone, gone, those years have passed away
It's gone, gone, gone, there's truth in what I say
It's gone, gone, gone, there's nothing more to say
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again

Well, I'm an old man now and I'm born to win the race
People won't believe me but there's truth in what I say
Many hearts were broken and a lot of tears were shed
The sky was black and the battlefield was red

Now it's gone, gone, gone, those years have passed away
It's gone, gone, gone, there's truth in what I say
It's gone, gone, gone, there's nothing more to say
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again 

Now, Stonewall Jackson stepped right up and then he said to me
He said: The battle is getting rough, son, guess we better flee
There's grapeshot all around us and the field is black with lead
You better start running boy before you lose your head

Now it's gone, gone, gone, those years have passed away
It's gone, gone, gone, there's truth in what I say
It's gone, gone, gone, there's nothing more to say
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again
Well, the cannons roared around us and the field was black with lead
I picked a soldier dressed in blue and filled him full of lead
I picked out six more soldiers there sitting on a mound
I fixed my bayonet to my gun and really mowed them down

Now, it's gone, gone, gone, those years have passed away
It's gone, gone, gone, there's truth in what I say
It's gone, gone, gone, there's nothing more to say
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again
I can't get no, satisfaction. I can't get no satisfaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try, I can't get no, I can't get no
When I'm driving in my car and that man comes on the radio
And he's telling me more and more about some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, Oh, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say
When I'm watching my tv and that man comes on to tell me how white my shirts 

[?]
When I'm riding 'round the world and I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that
And I'm trying to make some girl
Who tells me, baby maybe come back later next week
Cause you see I'm on a losing streak

[Verse 1]
It came to pass
Like lightning striking from above
Electric flash
Just like lightning striking from above

[Chorus]
Struck by precious love
Precious, precious love, so hopeless and so inspired
Why do you dream flat tires?
You dream flat tires, you dream flat tires

[Verse 2]
With a jack and a spare you're there
Trying to get to where love is
Coming in on a wing and a prayer
Trying to get to where love is

[Chorus]
'Cause love is precious love
You said it was precious when first you felt my fire
Before you dreamed flat tires
You dreamed flat tires, you dream flat tires

[Bridge 1]
"Woman she bounce back easy
But a man could break both his legs"
Are you telling me that to tease me
Or just to hear me beg?
"Please don't go!"

[Verse 3]
Cause I know that you love me
But when are you going to let love be
Just a vague flirtation
Or extra special company?

[Chorus]
'Cause love is precious love
Everybody knows it's precious when first they feel that fire
Before they dream flat tires
They dream flat tires, they dream flat tires

[Bridge 2]
"Woman she bounce back easy
But a man could break both his legs"
Do you tell me that to tease me
Or just to hear me beg?
"Please don't be cold"

[Outro]
I know that you love me
But, what are you going to let love do?
(Flat tires, love, love is precious, flat tires
Love, love is precious, flat tires, love
Love is precious)

Yes, they braggin' about your sugar baby
They been braggin' about it all over town
Well, the bootleggers want to buy it to make liquor baby
But you don't want to sell them about four or five pounds
Yes I'm crazy about my coffee sweet in the morning
Same thing with my tea at night
I love my coffee sweet in the morning baby
Same thing with my tea at night
Well, if I don't get my sugar three times a day
Oh yes, I don't feel right
Thirty days, lord and thirty nights
I'm comin' home on an airplane flight
Mama waitin' at the ticket line
Tell me son why do you stand there cryin'

[Chorus]
It was the needle and the spoon
And a trip to the moon
Took me away, took me away

I've been feelin' so sick and tired
Got to get better, lord before I die
Seven doctors couldn't help my head, they said
You better quit, son before your dead

[Chorus]
Quit the needle. Quit the spoon
Quit the trip to the moon
We gonna take you away. Lord, we gonna take you away

[Spoken]
It was the needle and the spoon
I've seen a lot of people who thought they were cool
But then again, lord I've seen a lot of fools
Well, I hope you people, lord can hear what I say
You'll have your chance to hit it some day

[Chorus]
Don't mess with the needle or a spoon
Or any trip to the moon
It'll take you away Lord, their gonna bury you boy
Don't mess with the needle
Now I know, I know, I know...
Another day another mountain
Whose to say they never move
Cos we moved one after another
Till there was nothing left to prove
And then we turned around and tossed it
After all that we'd been through
And when I look at what it cost us
I guess it's time I face the truth
Maybe I lost it
Yeah lost it
When I lost you
The night we climbed above the ruins
The gypsy sang those ancient Spanish blues
I saw a man awake but still dreaming
I saw myself in love with you
I walk around
I think about it
And all the things that we went through
To tell you the truth
Maybe I lost it
Yeah lost it
When I lost you
I had it in the palm of my hand
And maybe I lost it
Yeah lost it.... yeah
I walk around
I think about it
And all the things that we've been through
To tell you the truth
Maybe I lost it
Yeah Yeah
I had it in the palm of my hand
And maybe I lost it
I lost it when I lost you
I had it in the palm of my hand
And maybe I lost it
Yeah I lost it
When I lost you
I had it... had it... I had it
Oh I had it yeah
When I lost you
Had it in the palm of my hand
And baby I lost it
I lost it when I lost you...

Oh
That's it here we go
Put my love in the air
If the curtains are open I don't care, let 'em stare
Out the room, on the wall, every step on the staircase
Baby let me make your day
'Twas in the year of '92
In the merry month of June
I left my mother and a home so dear
All for that girl on the greenbriar shore

My mother, she says, "Son, don't go
Don't leave me here alone
Don't leave your mother and a home so dear
Never trust a girl on the greenbriar shore"

But I was young and reckless too
And I craved a reckless life
I left my mother and a home so dear
And I took that girl to be my wife

Her hair was dark and curly too
And her lovin' eyes were blue
Her cheeks were like the red red rose
That girl I loved from the greenbriar shore

The years rolled on and the months rolled by
She left me all alone
Now I remember what my mother said
"Never trust the girl on the greenbriar shore"

[Chorus]
Love, thy will be done
I can no longer hide, I can no longer run
No longer can I resist Your guiding light
That gives me the power to keep up the fight

[Verse]
Oh Lord, love, thy will be done
Since I have found you, my life has just begun
And I see all of Your creations as one perfect complex
No one less beautiful or more special than the next
We are all blessed and so wise to accept
Thy will, love, be done

[Refrain]
Love, thy will be mine
And make me strive for the glorious and divine
I could not be more, more satisfied (Satisfied)
Even when there's no peace outside my window, there's peace inside
And that's why I no longer run (I no longer run)
Love, thy will be done

[Chorus]
Love, thy will be done
I can no longer hide, I can no longer run
Oh love, thy will be done
Thy will, love, be done

[Refrain]
Oh, no longer can I resist (No)
The guiding light (Guiding light)
The light that gives me power to keep up the fight
I couldn't be more satisfied (No)
Even when there's no peace outside my window, there is peace inside
And that's why I can no longer run
Love, thy will be done
Love, thy will be done
Love, thy will be done, oh

[Chorus]
Love, thy will be done
I can no longer hide, I can no longer run
Oh love, thy will be done
Thy will, love, be done

[Outro]
Oh love, thy will be done
I can no longer hide, I can no longer run
Oh love, thy will be done (Sing it)
Thy will, love, be done (Glory, glory, glory)
Thy will, love, be done (Glory)
Thy will, love, be done
I was on my way
To getting close to you
Until you flipped the script on me
Another personality
I was just that close
To putting karats in your ring
Until I peeped your card
Now you threw it before you started, baby

I was just a touch away
From playing the fool for you
'Til you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up
I was just a touch away
From playing the fool for you
'Til you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up, babe

You were almost in
About to take you home with me
Until you opened up my eyes
And showed me your other side
You were inches from the room
Just about to take control
Now that I know it was all an act
I got to get that bracelet back
I was just a touch away
From playing the fool for you
'Til you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up
I was just a touch away
From playing the fool for you
'Til you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up, babe

What made you think you could lie to me
Baby, and get away with it?
Come back down to reality
When it comes to love, you just don't get it

I was just a touch away
From playing the fool for you
'Til you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up
I was just a touch away
From playing the fool for you
'Til you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up, babe

Having never lived like a lap full of g's
When all the time you was just try-na trap me
Closer, and closer, and closer to me
Trying to get rooted like the ground and trees
Now I wanna get tight like the harmonies
All you wanna do is just scheme, scheme, scheme
Riding in my gators, sittin' on my things
Drinking and smoking up all my weed
I was just a touch away
From playing the fool for you
'Til you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up
I was just a touch away
From playing the fool for you
'Til you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up, babe
I can only give you love that lasts forever
And the promise to be near each time you call
And the only heart I own for you and you alone
That's all, that's all

I can only give you country walks in springtime
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall
And a love whose burning light will warm the winter night
That's all, that's all

There are those I am sure who have told you
They would give you the world for a toy
All I have are these arms to enfold you
And a love, time can never destroy

If you're wondering what I'm asking in return, dear
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and evermore
That's all, that's all
Been on the road too long
Most of these changes should be past and gone
Clarify my position
Must be some kind of fool, I'm a musician

I got nothin' to do but today

Already on my way
Goodbye, I can't stop to say
Just quietly slipped away
Lose myself, it's the only way

I got nothin' to do but today

You think I'm not myself
You're confusing me with somebody else
I'm not so easily deceived
I am a blues man, I know when to leave

I got nothin' to do but today
Oh, like today
Oh, but today

[Cee-Lo Green]

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two
Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

[Intro]
Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

[Verse 1]
Steal away, steal away
Steal away to Jesus
Steal away, steal away home
I ain't got long to stay here
Green trees are bending
Poor sinner stands a-trembling
The trumpet sound within my soul
I ain't got long to stay here

[Bridge]
Steal away, mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Steal away home
I ain't got long to stay here

[Verse 2]
My Lord calls me
He calls me by the thunder
The trumpet sound within my soul
I ain't got long to stay here

[Outro]
Mmm, mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Steal away home
I ain't got long to stay here
Dear ladies, dear ladies
It's your boy, January
And I would like to welcome all of you to
The Love Letter album

Now this album is dedicated to the girls who stood beside me

And even to the bootleggers that couldn't afford to buy me
Even the ones who want to have my babies
This is my love letter to you
You don't like crazy music
You don't like rocking bands
You just wanna go to a movie show
Sit there when holding hands
You're so square but I don't care

I don't why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you, baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square but I don't care

You don't know any dance steps that I do
You only know I love you
Baby, I do, I do 

[Incomprehensible]

I don't why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you, baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square but I don't care
I don't why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you, baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square but I don't care
Why I married me a bad girl, tell you the reason why
Bad girls will even do things on the sly
Look for your supper to be good and hot
She never even put a stew bone in the pot

She's on the road again, sure as you're born
Natural born easy on the road again

Friend come by, say looking for his hat
Wants to know where your husband's at
I don't know, he's on his way to the pen
Come on pretty mama, let's get on the road again

Went to my house the front door was locked
Went 'round to my window, but my window was locked
Jumped right back, shook my head
Big old rounder in my folding bed
Jumped into the window, broke the glass
Never seen that little rounder run so fast

Come on pretty mama, let's get on the road again
Let's get started
Move in for the kill
So sincere
I'm here to bend your will
A man without a face
I give you love you've never known
We can hold each other, sight unseen
Touchin' on our darkest dream
You can wish for something bad
Lovers' lips you never had

All she wants is your love
All she wants is your love

We're the party with no name
And we go from flame to flame
We've got one claim to fame
We're the party with no name
Make those footsteps to the floor
You can't see us anymore
Ain't no time for the shame
For the party with no name
Easy money
Get yourself a job
It's my invitation
Been alone too long
A soul without a space
A party with no mane
Truth is there, but she don't see
Her life is just a mystery
I'd give her more than I could give
I'd even die that she could live

All she wants is your love
All she wants is your love

We're the party with no name
And we go from flame to flame
We've got one claim to fame
We're the party with no name

All she wants is your love
All she wants is your love

We're the party with no name
And we go from flame to flame
We've got one claim to fame
We're the party with no name
Hello this is Dr. Dre. I'm not in right now
But if you leave your name and number at the sound of the beep
I'll be sure to give you a call as soon as I return

Hello, Dre, this is Patricia. My husband's out of town
And I was wondering, do you make house calls?

Ridin' in my car alone not doin' anything
Stopped the answering service because I knew my phone would ring
Heard it ring once so I picked it up and said hello
It's Dr. Dre, baby, not your average gigolo

[Chorus]
Cuz I make house calls, it's Dr. Dre the maniac
House calls, the human aphrodisiac
I love those house calls to the girls that's all alone
House calls, when your husband's not at home

It's a quarter after two, I said I'd show around three
Her husband's out of town and she would like some surgery
Stopped at the stores so I could get a little wine
But all they had was Thunderbird 1979
So I left the store, got in my car, drove to her house and then
Knocked on the door and heard this sexy voice that said come in
Opened the door to see what I got from this house call
Tall, dark and lovely, 5 ft 8 in a camisole

[Chorus: 2x]
Now my name is Dre, 6 ft tall with wavy hair
The one that comes around when your man just doesn't care
So if ya feelin' sexy late at night and you're all alone
Just think about the doctor, pick up the telephone

[Chorus: 2x]
Hello this is Dr.Dre. I'm not in right now
But if you leave your name and number at the sound of the beep
I'll be sure to give you a call as soon as I return

Dre, this is Rene. Do you take American Express?

Dre, this is Alicia. You know what the mood is

Yo Doc, Lonzo, Two jaccuzis free. Bring yo trunks

Yo, it's me again. About those trunks. Forget 'em

Yo Dre man, wassup, huh? Cathy's back in town

Dre, I think (inaudible) knows about us

Say fool, you left ya driving license over here last night
Now I'm a have to whoop yo ass
It's a strange song
'Bout a boy who went wrong
Who tried to make it up
Inside his heart and start again
To make a manse

For livin' his strange life
He's never made a change life
Until one day he found himself alone
With only him
And oh how dim his future seemed

On that day
He searched to find a better way to be a man
And as he tried
He cast away his foolish pride
And I understand

His strange song
Then he came a sing along
Where every note was just a proper one
To hum and sing and have a thing
That's groovy with
On that day
He searched to find a better way to be a man
And as he tried
He cast away his foolish pride
And I understand

His strange song
Then he came a sing along
Where every note was just a proper one
To hum and sing and have a thing
That's groovy with
Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening?
In the lane
Snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking
In a winter wonderland
Gone away
Is the bluebird
Here to stay
Is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking
In a winter wonderland
In the meadow
We can build a snowman
And pretend
That he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married?
We'll say No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream, by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking
In a winter wonderland
In the meadow
We can build a snowman
And pretend
That he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun
With Mr. Snowman
Until the other kids
Come knock him down
When it's cold
Ain't it thrilling
When your nose
Gets to chilling
We'll frolic and play
The eskimo way
Walking
In a winter wonderland
Walking
In a winter wonderland
My mind's telling me no
But my body, my body's telling me yes
Baby, I don't want to hurt nobody
But there is something that I must confess to you

Girl you need someone, someone like me, yeah
To satisfy your every need

Baby, you'll never find another me

To make love to you baby constantly

I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump n' grind
I don't see nothing wrong, come on, come on

[Intro, Marvin Gaye, spoken]
Hey homeboy, how come everywhere you go
You have to go in a limousine, man?

[Other man]
Hey, man that's my thing

[Marvin]:
I know it's your thing
Every time I see you, you're awful clean
You got your rings, jewelry on
Y'know

[Other]:
Flashin' cash is what I need

[Marvin]:
I can understand it

[Verse 1]
Oh
I got the baddest cool
Could never be the fool
The ladies wait to get down with me
The love I make's superb
To doubt me is absurd
The latest and the greatest, you see

[Verse 2]
Oohh oo oohh
I want to have your spot
And more than what you got
I bought the baddest house I could find
All it must be said I'm greatest in the bed
And when I love a lady she's mine
I know I'm really hot
My diamonds shine a lot
Check out here this 450 SE babe (Ego trippin' out)

[Chorus]
I'm what's its all about
Ego tripping out (hey, tripping out, hey tripping out, you're tripping out, your tripping out)
Ahh ha hey hey
Without a doubt
I know we ego tripping out
Sometimes it's a shame
But it caused so much pain
He don't want you, baby
I know you ego tripping out
'times it's a shame but it can't do without
Without a doubt
I know you're ego tripping out
Hey she don't know it
But ain't it a shame, all the pain to come

[Verse 3]
I'm better than the rest
Check out the way I dress
And got a lot of money to spend
The best club in town
Is where I get down
You're lucky if I choose you my friend

[Verse 4]
Walk the greatest walk
I got to be the talk
I've got the greatest show in town
Woohoo! Rock with your other man then roll over to me
So I can thrill your soul baby
Aoow check out the love man standing tall and bold
Can fulfill your needs, too cold, baby
Needless to say, I'm your greatest play
Ego tripping out, ooh, ego tripping out
Yeah, ego tripping out, woooh!

[Outro]
In my mind what it's for
Got a sweet tooth for the chick on the floor
Walking in my shoes
Walking to the beat
Still got some love inside
And some good old body heat
Aoow
Oh, baby
Spread the news
Only here to deepen my soul
No it ain't about money
Aoow
Turn the fear into energy
'cause the toot and the smoke
Won't fulfil the need
Aoow hey, hey
Only one way
Only one way
Wooh!
Feel the feelin, energy of the kiss

[Intro]
Say you're with it
I know you feel it
Wooo
Oooohhh

[Verse 1]
Baby, can't you see that he's no good
Honey, he don't treat you like he should
Baby, I know
Just what to do to make it right
Let me lead you
To the best love
That you ever had
In your life

[Pre-Chorus]
So baby when you feel the need
Don't hesitate to reach
Right out and call me
(I'll give you everything...baby...baby)
I'll supply your everything
Make it so good for you
That you'll end up falling in love with me

[Chorus]
Are you down
Say you're with it
Let it go
I know you're feeling me
Don't try to fight it
I'm gonna help you find the way
Baby c'mon, baby c'mon, baby c'mon

[Verse 2]
Sister, you're the finest thing I know
He gotta be crazy
To think of ever letting you go
I know you want me
To ease that pain you feel
I got a plan girl
Just take my hand and follow me

[Pre-Chorus]
To a place where you can be
All the things you couldn't be
When you were with him
(All the things you couldn't be)
I got all the qualities
That a man would need
To make you end up
Falling in love with me
(Falling in love with me)

[Chorus]
Are you down
Say you're with it
Let it go
I know you're feeling me
Don't try to fight it
I'm gonna help you find the way
Baby c'mon, baby c'mon, baby c'mon
Are you down
Say you're with it
Let it go
I know you're feeling me
Don't try to fight it
I'm gonna help you find the way
Baby c'mon, baby c'mon, baby c'mon

[Bridge]
Girl, I know you wanna be with me
So baby, c'mon
Girl, you know that I can
Set you free
So baby, c'mon
I know you want to be with me

[Chorus]
Are you down
Say you're with it
Let it go
I know you're feeling me
Don't try to fight it
I'm gonna help you find the way
Baby c'mon, baby c'mon, baby c'mon
Are you down
Say you're with it
Let it go
I know you're feeling me
Don't try to fight it
I'm gonna help you find the way
Baby c'mon, baby c'mon, baby c'mon
Are you down
Say you're with it
Let it go
I know you're feeling me
Don't try to fight it
I'm gonna help you find the way
Baby c'mon, baby c'mon, baby c'mon
This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do
1 - You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and all the things that come along with
Make me
You make me
Before anything became between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things that I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about was you
And how you make me wanna
Repeat 1
Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should have been you
And what's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do
Should I tell my baby bye-bye
Should I do exactly what I feel inside
Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together
Repeat 1
At this point the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her
But I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it
Why all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it
But the feeling's just too strong
You make me wanna
You make me wanna

[Man speaking]
We going to Cuba wit' this one
Yea, I been rehabilitated, rejuvicated
And most important:relocated
So now, with no further to do

[Hook 2x]
Now ladies stand up
Or if you wit' me shake ya titties
Throw your hands up
And all the ballers poppin' bottles throw a grand up
And if you feeling like I'm feeling keep them hands up
And keep ya hands up

[Verse 1]
Hey, from the sunrise to the midnight star
I'm by far the hottest new thing the South seen
Bringing sixteen bars, got six clean cars
Vert's, Hoops, four doors, do momo's, and Tahoes
Star hoes, yo hoes is our hoes
Keri pullin up to the Shark Bar on the Northstar
Wit' a Puerto Rican porn star
We in La Vida La Loca
See you can't flow like me or rock a show like me
Get dough like me
Shouldn't signed 'em, he ain't gon' blow like me
But give me a quarter of his bonus and half his budget
And I guarantee he go double but if you don't, you in trouble
It's gon' take him three coupes just for him to recoup'
Or witness shawty flop, like the last three groups
While I'm in Cancun' 'round see-thru's on a three week cruise
It'll take more than the likes of these fools to make me lose
Sheesh, floppin is something I can't see
Ladies, obey the chorus
Shake ya titties for me please

[Hook (2x)]

[Verse 2]
Uh, I came to blow the spot
Hit the club wit' cheddar knots
Ridin wit' a badder bitch
You gonna get or ever got
Try me boy, you better not
Shawty and I'm very hot
Toting forty cap, forty five nine's every Glock
Blow you up in that very spot you standing in
Then vanishing
Undo this manana then, throw away this can and then
Back to poppin mo and blow and dro and money handlin'
You and your lil' posse can not stop me and this clan I'm in
While you slanderin', you better ask ya gul who the man again
Turning out a superstar back into a fan again
Damagin' all who peek, line 'em all in the street
I'll do 'em one at a time wit' one line on one beat
Say ya almost gold, that's what I sold in one week
Got a flock of freaks, while you hold on to one biich
I'm like a Pez dispenser, shawty, I spit treats
The nigga who even sound good on a bullshit beat

[Hook (2x)]

[Verse 3]
Well pussy nigga, you can like it, you can love it
You can bite it, you can dub it
But you can't do it how we does it
When we ballin' in public
Where the grill full of gold or Seville full of hoes
Wood wheels and some Voe's or hun'ed gold spokes
I park at the club and a hun'ed hoes choke
Spark up some dubs, let them hun'ed hoes blow
I run game to get the hoe once they act like I can't run it no mo'
I stunt them hoes broke and her money po' po'
You can't smoke the way we smoke if you ain't smokin' no dro'
Drink the way we drink wit no Hen' and no Mo'
You can't ride the way we ride if you ain't slammin Benz do's
Can't ball wit' me if you got eight but can only spend fo'
You ain't VIP like me and can't be searching your coat
Ain't no P.I. like me if you ain't workin' no hoes
Can't do the shit we do, the way we do wit' no dough
That's like trying to win a ballgame, if you ain't takin no score

[Hook (4x)]
Here's a newcomer that starts
Its Hit Parade career tonight at number 9
Frank Sinatra's going to sing it for you
So it's out to Hollywood for Frank Sinatra
And the song that's ninth this week, "No Love, No Nothin'"

No love, no nothin' until my baby comes home
No sir, no nothin' as long as baby must roam
I promised her, I'd wait for her till even hades froze
I'm lonesome, Heaven knows but what I said still goes

No love, no nothin' and that's a promise I'll keep
No fun with no one, I'm gettin' plenty of sleep
My heart's on strike and though it's like an empty honeycomb
No love, no sir, no nothin' till my baby comes home

No love, no nothin', that's a promise I'll keep
No fun with no one, I'm gettin' plenty of sleep
My heart's on strike and though it's like an empty honeycomb
No love, no sir, no nothin' till my baby comes home
Sittin' in my car outside your house
(Sittin' in my car outside your house)
'Member when you spilled Coke all over your blouse?
T-shirts, cut-offs and a pair of thongs
(T-shirts, cut-offs and a pair of thongs)
We've been having fun all summer long
All summer long, you've been with me
I can't see enough of you
All summer long, we've both been free
Won't be long 'til summer time is through
Summer time is through, not for us now
Miniature golf and Honda's in the hills
(Miniature golf and Honda's in the hills)
When we rode the horse, we got some thrills
Every now and then we hear our song
(Every now and then we hear our song)
We've been having fun all summer long
Won't be long 'til summer time is through
Summer time is through, not for us now
Every now and then, we hear our song
(Every now and then, we hear our song)
We've been having fun all summer long
We've been having fun all summer long
(We've been having fun all summer)
We've been having fun all summer long
(We've been having fun all summer)
We've been having fun all summer long
(We've been having fun all summer)

[John Legend]
If this world were mine, I would place at your feet
All that I own, you've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees
And you'd be always beside me, be all that I need
If this world were mine, I'd give you anything

[Imani Uzuri]
If this world were mine, I would make you a king
With wealth untold you could have anything
If this world were mine
I'd give you each so sunny and blue
And if you wanted the moonlight, I'd give you that too
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything

[John Legend]
Oh baby, you're my inspiration
And there's no hesitation
When you want me, all you gotta do is call me

[Imani Uzuri]
Oh baby, you are my constellation
And I feel so much sensation

If you believe...
The life and land around you is good, so good, so good
You never had it so good, you never had it so good
You never had it so good, you never had it so good
You never had it so good, sister
Smiles of happy faces, different styles and races
Still we're one big neighborhood
You never, I mean never, ever had it so good, so good, so good, so good
Ice cream on your apple pie, that's good, that's good
Mountain streams of fish fry, yum yum, that's good
Flag that you can wave about, that's good, that's good
A wide spread you can see right outside good, that's good
What our forefathers said still goes, any American knows
You never had it so good, you never had it so good
You never had it so good, you never had it so good
You never had it so good, sister
Smiles of happy faces, different styles and races
Still we're one big neighborhood
You never, I mean never, ever had it so good, so good, so good, so good
The corn upon the splendid plain, that's good, that's good
And frozen foods in cellophane, that's good, that's good
A hot dog in a bleacher's seat, that's good, that's good
A town hall where the people meet, that's good, that's good
Old John Hancock, he said it fine, he put it right on the line
You never had it so good, you never had it so good
You never had it so good, you never had it so good
You never had it so good, sister
Smiles of happy faces, different styles and races
Still we're one big neighborhood
You never, I mean never, ever had it so good, so good, so good, so good
Not ever!
A heart that's true, there are such things
A dream for two, there are such things
Someone to whisper "Darling, you're my guiding star"
Not caring what you own but just what you are

A peaceful sky, there are such things
A rainbow high where heaven sings
So have a little faith and trust in what tomorrow brings
You'll reach a star because there are such things

So have a little faith and trust in what tomorrow brings
You'll reach a star because there are such things

[Verse 1]
The girls of steel, like the way my body feels
They need to put their hands on
But ooh it gets 'em gone
Thinkin' 'bout the way things might have been
In another life, if you were my wife
And I don't mean one, but the two of you every night
(ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord knows I'll do my best
I mean it'd be a test
Baby in the middle, baby in the middle, taking all requests

[Chorus]
Love to the left of me, love to the right
Come on make a noise somebody
Party tonight (oh yeah!)
Love to the left of me, love to the right
Come on make a noise somebody
Party tonight (oh yeah!)

[Verse 2]
The girls of soul, like the way my booty goes
They say the curves deserve another glance
Come on pretty baby give me a chance
To prove my brotherhood
I'll make you real good
I'll do ya, I'll do ya
I'll do ya like you wanna should

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord knows I'll do my best

I think about the three of us g-going on (love to the left of me)
The notion of the ocean (love to the left of me)
Sailing under me (love to the right)
It's enough to make a man want to marry
And I don't mean one
But the two of you's, naturally (love to the left of me)

Are there really angels?

Or are they just in our minds?
It all comes out in the wash...
...in time
Oh my darling I was so lonely
Searching for you and for you only
Oh my darling I love you so

Oh my darling my love is true
Longing for you, no one else will do
Oh my darling I love you so

When I first saw you dear I knew you were alone
I said to myself that I'd make you my own
Your brother caught us kissing
I though he would surely tell
Until he started playing those wedding bells

Now my darling I'm yours forever
Don't ever leave me, leave me never
Oh my darling I love you so

Oh yes it's true, now I have you
And best of all I know now
That I'll never have to be blue
Oh baby, I love you so
I mean you, baby

[Intro]
Yeah, true to the light, you know what I'm saying?
This is going out to all of the tigers out in the hood
'Cause that's where I'm on my way back to
So check it out

[Chorus]
Uh, back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Uh, back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Uh, back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Uh, back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)

[Verse 1]
Finally the TDRE is representing the PA
So back up and all you loud mouths shut the hell up
It's time to talk about the rumors we been hearing
Stab me in my back and when I see you, chump you cheering
You really jealous 'cause we're doing things, going places
I should smack the phony smile off your face
Before I made it, it was Jack Rules Town
Yeah, so give me 30 cash for a fifty dollar food stamp
That's the way it was and still is
But people say we sold out since we hit the business uh
Uh, so I decided to produce a gangsta swing
To take it back to the hood of things

[Chorus]
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)

[Verse 2]
Uh, you used to be down, uh, you used to be poor, uh
But now you're all that, because you do tours
People call me Campbell because they think I'm suit
Up on myself because I made a little loot
You got famous model Benz, a Rollie through the hood
Yeah, and the old dirty burger joint still smellin' good
Uh, to show you ain't a damn thing change
So come correct fool when you flex my name
And if you don't punk, I gotta let you know
Good Times is our favorite show
Yeah, so here's a little funky gangsta swing
To take you back to the hood of things

[Chorus]
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Uh, back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)

[Break]
Ayo, R can we smack 'em with a third verse?
Hell yeah!

[Verse 3]
Well it's the third time the wreck shop'll get busy
I'm with friends so way more open up so I can make my entry
I'ma talk about the shit that been killing me
'Cause you been bumpin' your guns like Wrigleys G
Sayin' he sounds like this, he sounds like that
He sounds like this, he sounds like that
Oh, what the fuck sounds like a nut in the middle of your gut
Because you're full of jealousy because my fans love me
Allah gave me talent, uh, so all praises to the Lord, see
That's why I had to smack you with a gangsta swing
To take you back to the hood of things

[Chorus]
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)

[Verse 4]
Well it's the 4th runner-up, last but not least
It's the C-K-E-L to the Y, G
You see my brother sold crack for a Benz
That's when I had to step right up and put my two cents in
How come you don't shoot craps like you used to?
None of your business, get out of my face, fool
Uh, because you're makin' me nervous
And I'm about to knock you in your teeth
Some say stone styles'll try to baffle
I'm the real record and you just a weak sample
Yeah, that's why he came up with a gangsta swing, uh
To take you fools back to the hood of things

[Chorus]
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)

Back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)
Closing my eyes reliving a time when love was strong
Feeling your change of heart a sign when love went wrong
I'm tired of analyzing everything you say
Trying to hold on to what went before the day
We threw it away

It seems now there isn't any need to keep hanging on
The mood in the night of a lonely room has gone on too long
I've looked from every angle I have found and yet
Trying to hold on and pick up the pieces we've left
Or try to forget

Today's
(A last chance to decide)
Goodbye
(Unless you change your mind)
And I won't ask again
I never could pretend

Today's
(A last chance to decide)
Goodbye
(Unless you change your mind)
But I won't ask again
Oh no
No I won't ask again
I've looked from every angle I have found and yet
Trying to hold on and pick up the pieces we've left
Or try to forget
Checkered flag, checkered flag, checkered flag for Harry Braff
Checkered flag, checkered flag, checkered flag for Harry Braff
Goodbye Harry Braff, it's so good to see him win the race
And the crowd, feeling proud to spend all day out there
And getting a good view of Harry Braff, Harry Braff

Realise Harry Braff and the Mayor of Gordon cheers him on
Ev'ry mile, see him smile with the dust in his eyes
Ev'ryone's crying for Harry Braff. Harry Braff

Goodbye! Harry Braff. Goodbye! Harry Braff
Goodbye! Harry Braff. Goodbye!

Checkered flag, checkered flag, checkered flag for Harry Braff
Checkered flag, checkered flag, checkered flag for Harry Braff

Goodbye! Harry Braff. Goodbye! Harry Braff
Goodbye! Harry Braff. Goodbye!
Harry Braff. Harry Braff. I'm a coming'
Yes your talkin' about your woman
Wish to god, man, you could see mine
Your talkin'about your woman
Wish to god, man, you could see mine
When she start lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind

Her daddy must have been a millionaire
I can tell by the way she walks
My baby's daddy must have been a millionaire
I can tell by the way she walks
When she start walkin'
The deaf and dumb begin to talk

I remember one Friday morning
We were layin' down across the bed
Man was in the next room dyin'
Knelt down and raised up his head
And said ain't she pretty
The world know she's fine
She start lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind
Hey, I declare my baby's pretty
The whole state knows she's fine
Oh, I declare my baby's pretty
The whole state knows she's fine
Oh, when she starts lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind
I know you wanted me to be more like that
But did you know why
But did you know why

I know you wanted me to be more like that
But did you know why
But did you know why

I Couldn't go forever
If I planned it
If I wanted
But it's too much to make
Too much to own
To take and to claim

What's in your mind
What's in your mind
What's in your mind
What's in your mind
What's in your mind
What's in your mind
What's in your mind
What's in your mind
You keep on telling on me to watch the way I talk
But did you know why
But did you know why

But I have never asked you for all your advice
But did you know why
But did you know why
Alright there: Once again. I'd like to say good evening to every body. My brothers are gonna go back and ah., refresh themselves, so this is a convenient time to introduce you to our most wonderful musicians. On bass guitar, let's here it for Eugene Woody Smith Alright!
Hmm. hm. ym. What did I tell you. Ha ha
Hm hm hm
This handsome young man here we call him the Tom Jones of the Temptations Organization. On lead guitar. Bill Neale!
Alright Bill
Now that was soulful. Alright'
On the drums, the very rythmic, Aaron Smith. Alright Aaron!
He really makes you feel like dancin'. Now Aaron is no relationship to Bill, and Bill is no relationship to Eugene - I can see that
Yeah. I think it is rather obvious. But whenever the Temptations need rythm. we always send for our Smith Brothers. Right
Now that's right, that's right
Now. the young man with whom I was just speaking, he really needs no introduction because as many of you know we've learned so much from him in the past years, words
Are actually inadequate. I'm speaking of the Temptations' own Cornelius Grant, and the Orchestra! Go now take a bow
Now seeing as how I've introduced you to everybody else, it is only proper and fitting that we introduce ourselves to to you by name and Astrologically. Hey fellows!!

Recently when we were out on tour
We felt that it's okay singing
Beatles songs and stuff but it's nice to leave 'em
With a bit of a message and the world being

In a kind of state as it is these days
We choose as one of our messages ecology
Because man, if we don't sort it out, not one will
So, that's gonna be the theme of today's show

Oobu joobu, ecology
Alright, let's go straight to the sound check
And this time it's in Las Vegas
Where the Walker runs down to the Carson Valley plain
There lived a young maiden, Darcy Farrow was her name
The daughter of old Dundee, and a fair one was she
The sweetest flower that bloomed o'er the range

Her voice was as sweet as sugar can be
Her touch was as soft as a bed of goose down
Her eyes shone bright like the pretty lights
That shine in the night out at Yerington town

She was courted by young Vandermeer
A fine lad was he, as I am to hear
He gave her silver rings and lacy things
He promised to wed before the snows came that year

Her pony did stumble and she did fall
Her dying touched the hearts of us one and all
Young Vandy in his pain put a bullet through his brain
We buried them together as the snows began to fall

They sing of Darcy Farrow where the Truckee runs through
They sing of her beauty in Virginia City too
At dusky sundown to her name they drink a round
And to young Vandy, whose love was true
Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There's nothing in life but you

I'll never regret the things I'm giving
They're easy to give when you're in love
I'm happy to do whatever I do for you

For you maybe I'm a fool, but it's fun
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand
Darling, it's grand, they just don't understand

Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There's nothing in life but you

For you maybe I'm a fool, but it's fun
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand
Baby, it's grand, they just don't understand
Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There's nothing in life but you

[Verse 1]
What you decide to be is what you are
Your only way ahead, your way to go far
Your reason's the key to who you really are
The decision's in your head it can't be far
Prejudice confines the best of you
Break the shackles, it's up to you
Be your own master, owe it to you

[Refrain 1]
Self doubt, denial will kill you

[Verse 2]
"It's harder" means more work to be who you are
It might mean hardship, it might take a while
Struggle, conflict, crisis; they're all at the bar

[Refrain 2]
Don't let anyone close your heart

[Verse 3]
Bounders are vulnerable creatures who
Project their fear and weakness upon you
Refuse to play the role that they want you to

[Refrain 3]
You can take your life in your hands
Don't let anyone close your heart
Revive the noble side of you
You can overcome in the end

[Verse 4]
What I decide to be is what I am
My true and best way ahead's in my command
My reason's the key to my development
I want to stretch myself to be who I am
Push them off is the best I can do
While canalising onto better things
If it has to explode then it will

[Refrain 4]
Self doubt, denial has killed me
I don't let anyone close to my heart
Don't want to be taken apart
I can gain myself in the end
Gotta jump down, spin around and pick a bale of cotton
Gotta jump down, spin around and pick a bale a day
Gotta jump down, spin around and pick a bale of cotton
Gotta jump down, spin around and pick a bale a day

I saw 'skeeter on my head
Blinked his eye and I killed him dead
Gotta jump down, spin around and weed a patch o'turnip
Gotta jump down, spin around and weed a patch a day
Gotta weed a patch o' turnip
Gotta jump down, spin around and weed a patch o'turnip
Gotta jump down, spin around and weed a patch a day

I saw a gal in calico
She tripped and fell, and she didn't say hello
Gotta jump down, spin around and cook a mess o'greens
Gotta jump down, spin around and cook a pot a day
Gotta cook a mess o'greens
Gotta jump down, spin around and cook a mess o'greens
Gotta jump down, spin around and cook a pot a day
I got a pig who's nice and greasy
All you ladies shake it easy
Gotta jump down, spin around and tote a pail o' water
Gotta jump down, spin around and tote a pail a day
Gotta tote a pail a day
Gotta jump down, spin around and tote a pail o' water
Gotta jump down, spin around and tote a pail a day

I don't know but I've been told
A gopher really don't live in a hole
Gotta jump down, spin around and sweat a pail o' water
Gotta jump down, spin around and sweat a pail a day
Gotta sweat a pail a day
Gotta jump down, spin around and sweat a pail o' water
Gotta jump down, spin around and sweat a pail a day
So now U want 2 leave me, but why U will not say
Then don't tell me why, just tell me that U'll never go away
Oh, don't give up now, girl, we've been through so much more
Oh, can't U see U're the only thing that I'm living 4

The world's a cold and empty place
Without a love 2 keep U warm
Oh, hold me in your arms 2night
Don't U know we'll make it, make it through the storm

Our love is pain and pleasure but I keep holding on
Cuz I never want 2 lose your love, gotta help me make it strong
Just hold me tight, I'm yours 2night, your love will keep me warm
Hold me in your arms 2night, we'll make it through the storm

The world's such an empty place
Without a love 2 keep U warm
Oh, hold me in your arms 2night
Don't U know we'll make it, make it through the storm

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

[x2]
(We're gonna make it, we got 2 make it)
(We're gonna make it) 

[repeats in BG]
Make it through the storm
The wind, the wind, your heart is so cold
I can make it
Make it through the storm

Your love, your love, your love is pain and pleasure
U, it's U, it's U I'll always treasure
We'll make it through the storm 

[x2]
Close your eyes
Rest your head on my shoulder and sleep
Close your eyes
And I will close mine
Close your eyes
Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep
Close your eyes
Oh this is divine
Music play something dreamy for dancing
While we're here romancing it's love's holiday
And love will be our guide
Close your eyes
When you open them dear
I'll be near by your side
So won't you close your eyes
I drank up all the bottle
But my thirst won't go away
Called you on the phone girl
But there ain't much I could say
Do I get some consolation
Seems there's nothing to be had

I wonder why why why
I wonder why why why why
Must a good love go bad

Time wise I'd find someone else
But now it ain't no good
God I can't get over you
But when your here I could
No it just don't stand to reason
And it's about to drive me mad

I wonder why why why
I wonder why why why why
Must a good love go bad
I can't get used to leaving you
It's hard to face the fact
It's over now you're gone for good
Ain't no turning back
Can I find some consolation
Seems there's nothing to be had

I wonder why why why
I wonder why why why why
Must a good love go bad

Its cold and dark in here tonight
Its like some kind of curse
I thought things were bad enough
Couldn't get much worse
No it just don't stand to reason
And its about to drive me mad

I wonder why why why
I wonder why why why why
Must a good love go bad
We like, f*ck a hush on the bus that rush
Acting mad dumb singing bum-stiggedy bump
Plus we was mad young, I remember acting a fool
We laughing at the monkeys f*cking at that park zoo
Yo it was crazy cool raising hell at West Street school
Forget what the teacher said, yo, we made our own rules
Remember back in the day carving names in desks
Not even knowing six years later I would see your death
We was just little kids doing childish shit
Til we got to middle school and got wild and shit
And that's when we started chasing girls
Not even thinking about grades
We was in a new world, our visions started to fade
We was still homeboys acting out and such
Even though we didn't hang out as much
I told myself I'd never cry
I know, I know know why
I never even said goodbye
But now I'm asking myself why
'cause I know, I know know why
I never even said goodbye
And now we in the High School
Smart fish in the lake
We study trying to keep it real
Staying far from the fake
Its funny how the first month of school started to fly
Before I knew it your life was
Gone in the blink of an eye
And now I'm stuck in denial
This shit can't be
God tell me why you had to take Noah from me
Why the f*ck you had to go and take Noah from me?
I told myself I'd never cry
I know, I know know why
I never even said goodbye
But now I'm asking myself why
'cause I know, I know know why
I never even said goodbye
School was crazy there the next day
They didn't think I would last
Seeing phoney bitches trying to get the f*ck out of class
Now I tried to play "hard" until I lost my cool
That's when I ran to a stall to shed a tear or two
Or three or four, I broke down and cried puddles
Now everytime I see your picture, my anger doubles
And everytime I see your picture, my anger doubles
I told myself I'd never cry
I know, I know know why
I never even said goodbye
And now I'm asking myself why
'cause I know, I know know why
I never even said goodbye
The only viable sun what we have in common, we have nothing common
I live with it's companions, I live with it's companions
They can illuminate within it's commandment to illuminate
To attenuate, to illuminate, to accentuate for we are old fellows
Illuminate but we are...

Like falling two in half from visible to invisible
Into the intercourse that illuminates
Each fragment of the screen, put into the ball
Of which it's part, observe the failing of it's tendencies
There's no above, there's no below
Two months (?), the only dynamic sun
Drifting
On a sea of forgotten teardrops
On a lifeboat
Sailing for
Your love

Sailing home

Drifting
On a sea of old heartbreaks
On a lifeboat
Sailing for
Your love
Sailing home

[Verse]
I just want to ask a question:
Who really cares
To save a world in despair?
Who really cares?
There'll come a time (There'll come a time)
When the world won't be singin' (When the world won't be singin')
Flowers won't grow (Flowers won't grow, no)
Bells won't be ringin' (No bells will be ringin')
Who really cares? (Who really cares?)
Who's willing to try (Who is willing to try)
To save a world (To save the world)
That's destined to die (That is destined to die)
When I look at the world (When I look at the world)
It fills me with sorrow (It fills me with sorrow)
Little children today (Children today)
Are really gonna suffer tomorrow (Really suffer tomorrow)
Oh, what a shame (Oh, what a shame)
Such a bad way to live (Such a bad way to live)
Ah, who is to blame (Who is to blame)
We can't stop livin' (When we can't stop livin', oh oh ooh oh)
Live (Live), live for life (Live for life)
But let live everybody
Live life for the children
(Live life for the children, oh, for the children)
You see, let's, let's save the children
Let's save all the children
(Save the babies, save the babies)
If you wanna love, you got to save the babies
All of the children

[Outro]
But who really cares?
Who's willing to try?
Yeah, to save a world
Yeah, save our sweet world
Save a world that is destined to die
Oh, oh, oh, la, la la la, la la la
Oh, oh, dig it everybody
It's the right kind of love, it's the right kind of night, you're the right kind of girl

You know it, so come on girl stay, I got a love
It's the right kind of love, it's the right kind of night
You're the right kind of girl, and we're right on time
It's the right kind of love on the right kind of night

Oohh baby, I could do with a girl like you, I could do with a girl like you
I could do with a girl like you
See what I can do with a girl like you

It's you and me together, it's the right kind of love...
Love the days
She's gone for the moment
I don't know which way she was going
Lord, it's been
A long warm November
I know now
She acts like her mother
I've been holding on
Here forever
And I don't know where she's gone
But hopefully
She knows not to come back now

Kick in the door, get on the floor
Went on a woman prowl (Woo Hoo)
Something to kiss the night away
When I'm taking back that (Woo Hoo)
Baby you know that I can hold my own
When I'm feeling (Woo Hoo)
Baby, you know, that I could just sail away
Gone away
So gone in the moment
Still can’t tell which way she was going
Shaping up
And growing right on me
Taking my advice
Like her father
I've been holding on
Here forever
And I don't know where she's gone
But hopefully she knows not to turn around

Kick in the door, get on the floor
Went on a woman prowl (Woo Hoo)
Something to kiss the night away
When I'm taking back that (Woo Hoo)
Baby you know that I can hold my own
When I'm feeling (Woo Hoo)
Baby, you know, that I could just sail away  x2

She's going to prowl when the storm comes
And it'll come, and it'll come, and it'll come
Instead she says, "Can't get none"

Kick in the door, get on the floor
Went on a woman prowl (Woo Hoo)
Something to kiss the night away
When I'm taking back that (Woo Hoo)
Baby you know that I can hold my own
When I'm feeling (Woo Hoo)
Baby, you know, that I could just sail away  x2
She's going to prowl when the storm comes
And it'll come, and it'll come, and it'll come
Instead she says, "Can't get none"

[Paul] Hoo!

[All]
Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen (Hoo!)
As the slow ray round about
Deep and crisp and crispy
Brightly show the boot last night
On the mosty cruel
Henry Hall and David Lloyd
Betty Grable too

[John] Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice. (Huh!) We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already, but we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit, and after that, well cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show

[All] (whistling)

[John] This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because "Love Me Do" got into the top twenty, and we can't believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pass you over to Paul, (Arf-arf! Arf-arf!) I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October. (Huh!) I'd like to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens. In the meantime:

Garry Crimble to you
Garry Mimble to you
Getty Bable, dear Christmas
Happy Birthday me too

[Paul] This is Paul here. Everything that John said goes for me too, 'specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, 'cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we'll try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like Jelly Babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, we've been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, we've gone right off Jelly Babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing

[John] Yes! Yes! Oh yes!

[Paul] Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows 'cause it's, you know, it's great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio...

[John] Yes, we enjoy that very kindly!

[Paul] ...to make new records, which is what we've been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, I'm running over my time, and people are telling me to stop and Ringo...

[All] Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop shouting, those animals!

[Paul] ...so I'll finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription

[John] Ja, das wird uns danke schon
Und denn gruss von even
Ja, denn gruss von even schon
Ja, das wird wunderschon, boy
Danke schon

Ja, Ringo!

Hello, Ringo here
As you know I was the last member to join The Beatles. I started to play drums in the group 1962, ha-ha-ha! Have been in a couple of other groups...

(Oh, just wish the people a merry, happy, go on, for Christmas, Christmas)
Merry, Happy New Year, and folks, Happy Christmas and may, may everything you wish be granted
(Sing, sing us Wenceslas, King Wenceslas)
King Wenceslas:

Well, good King Wenceslas looked out (Oh ho!)
On the feast of Stephen (Hey!)
When the snow was on the ground (Yeah!)
Deep and crisp and even (Oh yeah!)

Hooray!

Thank you, Ringo! Thank you, Ringo! We'll phone you! (Ha ha ha!)
I'm George Harrison. Nobody else has said anything yet about our fan club secretaries, Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose, not to mention Freda Kelly in Liverpool. (Good old Freda!) So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great, big thank you to Ann, Bettina and Freda for all the hard work they've done, and we just hope you can go on pleasing you for a long time, 'cause it's gonna, 'cause it to your reaction are to our records that really matters
And I'd just like to say:

Brightly was the shone that night
Though the winter cruel
When a pork pie came inside
Gathering winter cruel

Rudolph, the red nosed reindeer (Ho!)
Had a very shiny nose (A shiny nose!)
When ev'rybody picked it...

Ha, ha, ha, ha...
Oh yeah! Oh!

Rudolph, the red nosed Ringo (Rudolph!)
Had a very shiny nose

Merry Christmas everybody!
Sweet voices calling wild, echoing around this child
Sweet Faith I'll be joining you, when my story's over
Dee doo doo doo dah dee doo doo
Doo doo doo dee doo doo doo dee doo dah day

Small secrets in the wind, blowing till the end begins
Oh my children stand by me till my story's over
Dee doo doo doo dah dee doo doo
Doo doo doo dee doo doo doo dee doo dah day

If I were you and you were me those voices they would cease to be
They won't be free to torment me again
But in my bed again last night, those voices spoke of wrong and right
They spoke of darkness and of light
They spoke of weakness and of might
The spoke of people in the snow
And distant places long ago
The spoke of fire and falling rain
Of health and wealth and death and pain

Nah....
Sweet voices calling wild , echoing around this child

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!
Christ, the Saviour is born
Christ, the Saviour is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
There's a hungry road, like my lonely hopes, gonna eat me up inside
There's a drifting spirit, coming clean, in the eye of a life born of fire
Tell Monday I'll be round next week, I'm running ahead of my days
In this shotgun chance, that's scared of us, I've seen the error of my ways

Oh-oh
Woooh-oh

Well we've wrapped ourselves in golden crowns, like sungods spitting rain
Found the way home written on this map, like red dye in my veins
And the hardest of times that come around, the fear of losing grows
I've lost and seen the world shut down, it's a dark lesson no-one knows

(Chorus)
And I've poured out the pleasure, and dealt with the pain
I'm standing in the station, waiting in the rain
I'm starting to feel a little morsel again
But love is lost like a runaway train
Well I'm out of control, and out of my head
I'm tearing like a demon in no-man's land
Trying to get a grip on my life again
Nothing hits harder than a runaway train
(Solo)

Oh-oh
Mmmmm-mmm

And I've poured out the pleasure, and dealt with the pain
I'm standing in the station, waiting in the rain
I'm starting to feel a little morsel again
But love is lost like a runaway train
Well I'm out of control, and out of my head
I'm tearing like a demon in no-man's land
Trying to get a grip on my life again
Nothing hits harder than a runaway train

And I've poured out the pleasure, and dealt with the pain
I'm standing in the station, waiting in the rain
I'm starting to feel a little morsel again
But love is lost like a runaway train
Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah
I just don't understand how love became your problem
Hearts that should not cry
No words are missing but it's not understood
It's time to take me back to school
So fine just as you are
I could be the life you save
I'll be there when you need your

World of girls and boys think about the kill before you draw the bow...and cut me low
Like an arrow through the heart, arrow through the heart, oh
Arrow the heart, arrow through the heartbreak and the pain never smile out in the rain
Never to be seen again, nothing makes you die; like an arrow through the heart

High flying bird you can never love nobody
But I will not loose my dream
Birds of feather, they are never out flown
Against the sky it's beautiful
But an arrow through the heart, arrow through the heart, oh arrow through the heart
Arrow through the heart break over you, steady hand your aim is true
Bring me to my knees again, I'm too young to die. I'm too young to die
My silver moon
My golden sun

All those girls and boys think about the kill before you draw the bow....and cut me low
Like an arrow through the heart, arrow through the heart
0h arrow through the heart,arrow through the heart...
Oh, we call the sun ol' Hannah
Blazing on my head
Yes, we call the sun ol' Hannah
And her hair is flamin' red

Why don't you go down, ol' Hannah
Don't you rise no more
If you come up in the mornin'
Bring judgment sure

Well I look at ol' Hannah
She was turnin' red
Well I look at my partner
He was almost dead

Said if you get lucky
Or make it on your own
Please go down by Julie's
Tell her I won't be long

Kept sayin' I was a good man
But they drove me down
Yes, I was a good man
But they drove me down
Well, it look like ev'rything
Ev'rything I do
Yes, it looks like ev'rything
I do is wrong
When you move right up close to me
That's when I get shakes all over me

Quivers down my backbone
I got the shakes in my kneebone

I got the ( ? ) in my ( ? ) bone
Shakin' all over

When you move and say goodnight to me
That's when I get shakes all over me
The night is young and you're so beautiful
Here among the shadows, beautiful lady, open you heart
The scene is set, the breezes sing of it
Can't you get into the swing of it, lady, when do we start?
When the lady is kissable and the evening is cool
Any dream is permissible in the heart of a fool
The moon is high and you're so glamorous
And if I seem over amorous, lady, what can I do?
The night is young and I'm in love with you
Shake, shake, quiver, quiver
Been awakened by a cold shiver
Winds blow and change, change
Sweet rushing through my veins

Good lord, I just might die
Taken over by the high tide
Feel the rain against my skin
Drown my soul in the water again

Move on me
Move on me
I think you oughta make a move on me
Move on me
Move on me
I think you oughta make a move on me
Move on me
Move on me
Let the water make a move on me
Move on me
Move on me
I think you oughta make a move on me, mmm
Shake, shake, shoulda learned
Get too close and I might get burned
By the sweet heat, the sweet lies
So betrayed by the look in your eyes

Good lord, I know so well
I wanna get to heaven with a taste of hell
Still on my lips and down within
Quench my soul in your water again
Oh, in your water again

Come on and move on me
Move on me
I think you oughta make a move on me
Move on me
Move on me
I think you oughta make a move on me
Move on me
Move on me
Let the water make a move on me
Move on me
Move on me
I think you oughta make a move on me, mmm

Give me two hands I can hold
I'll tell you things I've never told
If you move on me
If you move on me, oh ah
I need something I can feel
Something pure, something real
Move on me
Make a move on me
Make a move on me
Won't cha make a move on me
Won't cha make a move on me, yeah
Make on move on me

Move on me
Move on me

Move on me
Move on me
Move on me
Move on me
Out of the lonely blue
U went away and left me
(I... I hear your voice)
Without, without one single word
(I... I hear your voice)
Night after night like a ghost from the past
(I... I hear your voice calling in the night)
Your voice is all I heard
I can't take it, baby (I...)
Don't let me die like this

I remember just like it was yesterday
I woke up, baby, and U were gone
I didn't even wanna carry myself up outta bed
Let alone, I didn't wanna carry on

Cuz I could hear (I hear your voice calling in the night)
I can't stop it no matter how hard I try
I can hear (I hear your sound calling in the dark)
In a word, I feel like I wanna die
I started lookin? lookin?from dusk till dawn
4 ways that I wouldn't miss U so much (I hear your voice)
I even bought a new dress, uh, but when I put it on
I could still, huh, still feel your touch

And I can hear (I hear your voice calling in the night)
I can't stop it no matter how hard I try
I can hear (I hear your sound calling in the dark)
In a word, I feel like I wanna die (I...)

My friends tell me that I need a new love
A bird in hand beats 2 in the bush (I hear your voice)
What my friends don't know, huh, and I ain't about 2 tell'em
Is that U're the only bird, U're the only one who knows what buttons 2 push

It don't take no scientist 2 tell U what's wrong with me
It don't take good vision, huh, 2 see what any fool could see
(I hear your voice calling in the night)
That I just need your body, I just need your f-f-face
Right where it counts - no, not in another place
(I hear your voice calling in the night)
I'm talkin?about all up, talkin?about all down
Every inch, U see? I don't need U cross town
U better read my lips, I need it here with me
I can't stop it no matter how I try
(I hear your sound calling in the dark)
In a word, I feel like I wanna die
(I hear your voice)
I can't take it, baby
(I hear your voice)
Don't let me die like this
No!

I... I hear your voice {x2}
I... I hear your voice calling in the night
I...
You've made your decision to leave
There's no turning 'round
Now that you've got a reprieve
You must stand your ground
Some of the others are weak
So you must be strong
$155 won't last very long...

Ma, will we make out
Do you think that this old car
Will last?
Pa, is there some doubt
If our bad luck will
Stay in the past?

Well I'm hoping it's so
But you can't really know til the end
They tell me that all things must change
But they begin again
Listen to the motor and the road
And how does it feel?
Listen with your ears and your hands
On the steering wheel
Ma, will we make out
Do you think that this old car will last?
Pa, is there some doubt
If our bad luck will stay in the past?

Listen now boys
What your ma has told you
There is no way we can tell...
We've got to face this road together
And have some faith
In ourselves

Ma, will we make out
Do you think that this old car will last?
Pa, is there some doubt
If our bad luck will
Stay in the past?

Ma
Will we make out...?
From which everything comes
The minimum and the maximum
Represent universe in the most
Distinguishable way
Concentrate, internal side
Which make of a being
A substance and not
A phenomenon
Concentrate
To go from the external
To internal
From the composed to
The simple

Perception, appetition
Constitute
Action of the very souls
The action, perception

What can be conceived as the
Most remote manifestation
Of things to be
It is what contains last of
All reasons
Current existence, reality
I often have wondered in deep contemplation
It seems that the mind runs wild when you're all alone
The ways that it could be, the ways that it should be
The things I'd do differently if I could to them again
I've always loved springtime, the passing if winter
The green of the new leaves, and life going on
The promise of morning, the long days of summer
And warm nights of loving beneath the night stars
I'm just an old cowboy, from high Colorado
I'm too old to ride anymore, too blind to see
I sleep in the city now, away from my mountains
Away from the cabin we always called home
I dreamed I left there, on an old Palamino
And Whispering Jesse rode right by my side
I longed to hold her, to hear her soft breathing
The touch of her cool hands on my fevered brow
Whispering Jesse
Still rides in the mountain
She still sings in the canyon
Still lives in my heart
Late last night I was dreaming
I was dreaming of your charms
I was standing
On the edge of love, darling
With you in my arms

Well you whispered sweet things
And told me
That you loved me and always be true
And you'd stand
On the edge of love with me
If I'd stand with you

I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to slip and fall
Standing on the edge of love, darling
Waiting on your call
You know I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to lose my mind
Standing on the edge of love, darling
Waiting on you one more time
Now a young man's mind will wander
Wander to distant shores
If you'll just come here
And stand with me
I won't wander no more

I promise to stop all of my gambling
Even stop staying out late all night
Might even settle down and have babies
Treat ourselves right

'Cause a young man's dreams are many
Lord, so few come true
So if you'll just come here
And stand with me
I'll stand with you

That's why I say you know
I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to slip and fall
Standing on the edge of love, darling
Waiting on your call, that's why I say
You know, I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to lose my mind
Standing on the edge of love, darling
Waiting on you one more time
That's why I'm standing, standing
Standing, yes, I'm standing
Standing on the edge of love
Waiting on you one more time

That's why I'm standing, standing
Standing, yes, I'm standing
Standing on the edge of love
Waiting on you one more time

That's why I'm standing, standing
Standing, yes, I'm standing
Standing on the edge of love
One more time
Well, the traffic agent told me that everything was taken care of
But here am I, got the kids got the wife, nowhere to stay tonight
Yeah, the hotel in Benindorm, still be building it
Won’t be finished soon, won’t be finished soon
Yeah, the hotel in Benindorm, still buildin’, buildin’, buildin’

We go to the beach and we go for a swim
But sooner or later yea
We’re gonna need to lay our poor burden down

The hotel in Benindorm still isn’t finished
I guess we gonna just have to hang around
The hurt doesn't go away, the tears never cease to fall
You cover them over with people and places
Hoping you'll want to break away
Oh my darling, the pain doesn't go away
When love doesn't want to stay
And inside your laughter, the world's laughing too
Saying you'll never make one more day
All the nonsense of it and oh, the pain doesn't go away
The tears never cease to fall, the hurt doesn't go away
The pain doesn't go away
I don't mean to hurt you, baby and I'm sorry if I do
I don't really mean to hurt you, woman, and I'm sorry if I do
Why should I make myself miserable baby
Baby, you know I'm human too

Oh, please don't hate me
Because I know we just don't belong
Oh baby, please don't hate me
I know we just don't belong
I found me someone who wants me
Baby, won't you please set me free

I have to admit you've been an angel, baby
And I'm grateful for the wife you've been
Oh, I have to admit you've been an angel, baby
And I'm grateful for the wife you've been
Oh, but now my heart belongs to another
So to hold me baby, is really a sin

I want you to try to forgive me
Babe and please try to understand
I want you to please, please forgive me baby
Babe and please try to understand
You know I didn't make myself, woman
And it's not my fault there's somebody else

Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm sick of these rappers slash actors pl-pl-pl-playing a part
All they talk about is they money, je-je-je-jewels and cars
So put pha-pha-phatoms and bentleys and how they squeeze 'til it's empty
How they move; yay, hooray!
Another dope boy wannabe
All in the club talkin' 'bout
Wha-wha-what what they got
Pull out the club on 26's

The boy know his alphabet, so now he think he a G
Run a little Pac so he think he a thug
Bu-bu-bu-but all eyes on me
They used to wanna be like mike
Now they just want a piece of the mic
They cut fucked-up deals in music
Imagine if they got 25 to life

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
They'll be singing like Whitney
Before, before she met Bobby
These boys think think they hard
Knowin' they green like wasabi
They'll be singing like Whitney

You heard me?
Whose garden was this
It must have been lovely
Did it have flowers
I've seen pictures of flowers
And I'd love to have smelled one

Whose river was this
You say it ran freely
Blue was it's colour
And I've seen blue in some pictures
And I'd love to have been there

Tell me again, I need to know
The forest had trees, the meadows were green
The oceans were blue
And birds really flew
Can you swear that it's true

Whose grey sky was this
Or was it a blue one
You say they were breezes
I've heard records of breezes
And I'd love to have felt one
Tell me again, I need to know
The forest had trees, the meadows were green
The oceans were blue
And birds really flew
Can you swear that it's true

Whose garden was this
It must have been lovely
Did it have flowers
I've seen pictures of flowers
And I'd love to have smelled one

Tell me again, I need to know
Tell me again, I need to know
Tell me again, I need to know
The last train is nearly due
The underground is closing soon
And in the dark deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows

His restless eyes leap and snatch
At all that they can touch or catch
And hidden deep within his pocket
Safe within its silent socket
He holds a coloured crayon

Now from the tunnel's stony womb
The carriage rides to meet the groom
And opens wide the welcome doors
But he hesitates, then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows

And the train is gone suddenly
On wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany
And he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand
Now from his pocket quick he flashes
The crayon on the wall he slashes
Deep upon the advertising
A single-worded poem comprising
Four letters

And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding
The poem across the tracks resounding
Shadowed by the exit light
His legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night
Yesterday, love was such and easy game to play
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly, I'm not have the man I use to be, no
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go?
I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

What now my love? Now that you've left me?
How can I live, through another day?
Watching my dreams turning to ashes
And my molds into bits of clay

Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am not so numb, I've become unreal
I walk the night without a goal
Stripped of my heart and my soul
Oh, oh, what now my love? Now there is nothing
Only my last, my last goodbye

Why she had to go?
I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such and easy game to play
So easy now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Oh, I believed in yesterday

What now my love?
What now my love?
What now my love?
Well since she put me down
I've been out doin' in my head
I come in late at night
And in the mornin' I just lay in bed
Well, Rhonda you look so fine
And I know it wouldn't take much time
For you to help me Rhonda
Help me get her out of my heart
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda yeah, get her out of my heart
She was gonna be my wife
And I was gonna be her man
But she let another guy come between us
And it shattered our plan
Well, Rhonda you caught my eye
And I can give you lotsa reasons why
You gotta help me Rhonda
Help me get her out of my heart
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda yeah, get her out of my heart
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda yeah, get her out of my heart
When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I'll dry them all
I'm on your side
Oh, when times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I'll comfort you
I'll take your part
Oh, when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubles water
I will lay me down
Sail on, silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All of your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh, if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
On TV of course I am the man
Comcast follow me like twitter with them legs
Cause I can make you famous like a giant in japan
She told she a fan with model friends they from france
I'm like Yes (Yes)
VPS up on her Neck (Neck) Lace (Lace)
Get together tonight it's so late it's breakfast
Eat this question Hur
How do you want it Like Pac Said (Pac said)
Then I bang bang bang like pop said (pop said)
Baby you can be my slave
I'm fucking tyga man and your girl let's say the same
I'm a get these suckers like my name is keenan Wayans
Cus they hating on me and it's a low down dirty change
She good with the math
And I be in them ass minus your boyfriend
Now let me multiple that ass (mu mu mu multiple that ass)
You know I like it from the back
Terminator I'll be back don't be sad
You gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
You gave me a song I learned to sing
You showed me some beauty
Through the windows of your soul
And you showed me a world I've never seen

Each giving to the other love an' givin' it away
We spent the precious time we knew was borrowed
'Cause you gave me the courage
To live with yesterday
And you gave me tomorrow

You brought me a candle to light my way to bed
You erased those shadows I'd been seeing
You brought me a pillow to rest my weary head
You taught me a gentle way of dreaming

And even if you leave me
I'll be richer when you go
I'm richer with the lovin' gift you gave me
'Cause you gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
And you gave me a baby
A stick, a stone, it's the end of the road
It's the rest of a stump, it's a little alone
It's a sliver of glass, it is life, it's the sun
It is night, it is death, it's a trap, it's a gun
The oak when it blooms, a fox in the brush
The nod of the wood, the song of a thrush
The wood of the wing, a cliff, a fall
A scratch, a lump, it is nothing at all
It's the wind blowing free, it's the end of a slope
It's a bean, it's a void, it's a hunch, it's a hope
And the riverbank talks of the Waters of March
It's the end of the strain, it's the joy in your heart
The foot, the ground, the flesh and the bone
The beat of the road, a sling-shot stone
A truckload of bricks in the soft morning light
The shot of a gun in the dead of the night
A mile, a must, a thrust, a bump
It's a girl, it's a rhyme, it's a cold, it's the mumps
The plan of the house, the body in bed
And the car that got stuck, it's the mud, it's the mud
Afloat, adrift, a flight, a wing
A cock, a quail, the promise of spring
And the riverbank talks of the Waters of March
It's the promise of life, it's the joy in your heart
A point, a grain, a bee, a bite
A blink, a buzzard, a sudden stroke of night
A pin, a needle, a sting, a pain
A snail, a riddle, a wasp, a stain
A snake, a stick, it is John, it is Joe
A fish, a flash, a silvery glow
And the riverbank talks of the Waters of March
It's the promise of life in your heart, in your heart
A stick, a stone, the end of the load
The rest of a stump, a lonesome road
A sliver of glass, a life, the sun
A night, a death, the end of the run
And the riverbank talks of the Waters of March
It's the end of all strain, it's the joy in your heart
I turn my head, there's nothing there
All I own is my thoughts for my fears
I close the door to keep out the bad
I plug my ears to keep out these fears

And I cryâ€¦

So hold me close for I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold me. (Repeat)

I listen to these voices or is it this
House that's giving me chills
As I lie upon this little girls bed
Who's at the door? Who's walking near?
Or has my imagination spilled?
This little girl all grown up still fears

Oh and I cry!

CHORUS(2x)
Where can I go where can I hide
From these evil sufferings?
Oh these images painted on my walls
They say there's a place that I can
Hide in the shadow of your wings
Oh Lord, bring me to this place of refuge

No more tears

CHORUS(4x)
The sky fell down when I met you
The green of the countryside has turned to blue
I had the moon right on my fingertips
And when first we kissed, there were stars on your lips

To be with you just made it seem
That walking on snowy clouds was not a dream
You gave to me all this and heaven too
When the sky fell down and I met you

[Verse 1]
Far away
I may just stay away
Like some folks' holiday
That's my time

On any other day
May come a Saturday
Or might just stay this way
It's my time

[Verse 2]
Moments come and go
Like the winds blow
Empty like a fool
I'm laying cool anyway

Anyway
Just have to do today
Like some folks' holiday
It's my time
It's my time
O lord I, I will serve You
I will serve You everyday
All my life I, I will praise You
Hear me calling now I pray

I will worship You only
Now I bow before Your throne Lord
Holy Father hear me calling
This is Your servant's prayer, Lord

When I'm sad You make me happy
Keep me safe from hurt and harm
When I'm burdened or I'm lonely
Comfort me within Your arms

Never leave me, ever keep me
You I'll follow anywhere Lord
Holy Father hear me calling
This is Your servant's prayer Lord

I give to You my life
My all I give to Thee
O Lord receive my offering today
This is Your servant's prayer
You gave to me Your love
Your son at Calvary
O Lord receive my Offering today
This is Your servant's prayer
Drowsy morning sunlight, gentle kisses for my love
It's Sunday, it's Sunday

She needn't waken, I'll fix the eggs and bacon her way
While she just dozes
Lately I've taken to bringing her a flower on her tray
She's fond of roses

We'll talk away the morning, read the papers, misbehave
Enjoying each other
The world is ours to play in, we'll take a walk or stay in
Long and lazy hours to have and hide away in for one day
Thank goodness, it's Sunday

It is Sunday, it's Sunday

Lately I've taken to bringing her a flower on her tray
She's fond of roses

We'll talk away the morning, read the papers, misbehave
Enjoying each other
The world is ours to play in, we'll take a walk or stay in
Long and lazy hours to have and hide away in for one day
Thank goodness, it's Sunday
Introducin' Chance the Ruthless
Trip 'shrooms and lucy
Dreams is lucid
Loosely based on music
Swallow my mucus
Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus
Deuces Douches, deuce deuce I'll shoot ya (BANG)
Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha
They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit
They use of illusion could confuse Confucius
Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing, 'til my voice get raspy
Last week suspended
Last night kissed Va$htie
Parleyed with Ashley
Always in the hallway, so I never been classy
(Ha ha ha) Shut up

Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
(Igh, igh, igh, igh!)
Acid acid, get it? Acid
Melts through plastic, I spit fired
Pad my palette, talkin' paper
If this was work, I'd get higher
Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered
Fart and get bitch-slapped, like bourbon mixed with jack
Lickety-split, Look it! He slipped on a shell
From peelin' banana splits back
Give me my Kit-Kat
Don't break me off shit, batch, fack is you mean bitch?
Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch
Zen with that chakra
I eat it like Idi Amin, Ya Kna Wha Mean
Hit me back when that mean shit

Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
(Igh, igh, igh, igh!)

Introducin', It's Bronsonlino
With my hair slicked back, I look like Rick Pitino
3 Japanese dykes in my El Camino
Lettin' trees blow, oh
I rep the East Coast, I got a team of hoes like Pat Summit
I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in a black hummer (get to the chopper)
I splash summer like a fast brother
With a number on his back, ain't no fumblin', in fact, I'm
Back, acid in my hat
Shoot then pass the gat, it's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag
My new shorty got a gymnastic back
87 emerald green on a classic jag
She had the cleft palate, I ordered chef's salad
She had the club foot, with that little arm
I couldn't help but laugh, she ordered Chicken Parm
I had the full Bulls warm-up with the Pippens on
Suck my motherfucking dick, it's the young Randy Velarde
Queens, baby
Blow me
I'm headed down a highway, got my suitcase by my side
Blue skies hangin' over my head, I got five hundred miles to ride
I'm goin' down to Memphis town to play a late night show
I hope the people are ready there 'cause the boys are all ready to go

Well, I'm a whiskey rock-a-roller, that's what I am
Women, whiskey and miles of travelin is all I understand

Yes, I was born a travelin' man and my feet still burn the ground
I don't care for fancy music if your shoes can't shuffle around
I got a hundred women or more and there's no place I call home
The only time I'm satisfied is when I'm on the road, Lord

Well, I'm a whiskey rock-a-roller, that's what I am
Women, whiskey and miles of travelin' is all I understand

Sometimes I wonder where will we go
Lord, don't you take my whiskey and rock 'n' roll

Take me down to Memphis town, bus driver, get me there
I got me a queenie, she got long brown curly hair
She likes to drink Old Granddad and her shoes do shuffle around
And every time I see that gal, Lord, she wants to lay me down
Well, I'm a whiskey rock-a-roller, that's what I am
Women, whiskey and miles of travelin' is all I understand

Sometimes I wonder where will we go
Lord, don't you take my whiskey and rock 'n' roll
Well, the rocks is my pillow
The cold ground is my bed
The highway is my home so I might as well be dead

I'm walkin' and walkin', seems I have no place to go
Yes, mama's dead and gone
And papa throw me from his door

I have one pair of shoes
Don't even have a change of clothes
And this road I've got to travel, yes, it's so chilly and cold

Yes, I'm going to have religion and learn how to pray
I need help, now people, seem that's the only way

I'm travellin' and travelin'
Seem like this road has got no end
I ain't got nobody, people
In this whole world to call my friend

I've got so much trouble, people, sometimes I could cry
I've got so much trouble, so much trouble
Sometimes I could cry
Yes, sometimes I could just break down
Seem like I could just break down and die
We call him Yella, he is the best
He rocks the house on the DMX
When he's on the beatbox, he cannot miss
So listen to the beat, as he rocks like this...

Yes, Yella is his name, and he's created
The big beat sound, so devastated
Party people in the place, you beware of the shock
'Cause Yella (Yella) Yella is on the beatbox, huh!

To feel the beat, it's time for you
To rock with the devastatin' Wreckin Cru
You got snare, hi-hat and bass in your face
So come on Yella boy, let's wreck this place, huh!

The headlines read "We are in Town"
The World Class Cru is gonna throw down
We are here, and here to stay
And we came to raise hell, and not to play
As we grow stronger, you get weaker
Sucker MC put your ear to the speaker
There is no doubt that we are best
We don't have to scratch just to make the beat fresh
The beat will blast and we'll outlast
There is no other that's in its class
It's not a 808 or a Drum-you-lator
It's a DMX and it is greater
It makes a sound that's so unique
Huh! To rock your butt and move your feet
Now sucker MC's we will impress
'Cause Yella (Yella) Yella on the DMX, huh-huh!
Party people in the place, we're not through
We're gonna show just what we're gonna do
So listen up close and don't miss a word
'Cause it is the hardest rap you ever heard
Like a blast from heaven, a blaze from hell
Who's comin' on the mic? Well, it's Cli-n-tel
So sucker MC's, you better beware
'Cause I will be your next nightmare
Yes, I am fresh, the MC wizard
When it comes to cold raps, huh, I'm a blizzard
Well, I'm the genius, the mastermind
Super def creator of MC rhymes
So come a little closer and you will see
Who? The Cli-n-tel's in the place to be
Now comin' on the mic without delay
A little "Bom bom bom"... It's Dr Dre
I'm the physician who's gonna start dishin'
All them things that you've been missin'
If it's for answers that you have been fishin'
Take a bite of this for your nutrition
I'm the real doctor, that is final
All you other suckers are made of vinyl
I won the election to issue injections
To who? Sucker MC's who wish for perfection
Next in line there's Lonzo
Producer of the groove, grandmaster of the show
The head debater, there is none greater
Because he is the Cru's creator
You put us all together, you've got the best
While Yella throws down on a DMX, huh-huh!
Whoa, now!
Screwface know-a who fi frighten!
Screwface know-a who fi frighten!
Like I told, they say, "Coward, man"
Gonna keep some bones
And all violent man gonna weep and moan
He that exalted him say, "Yeah!"
Shall be obeyed
Remember Jah - Jah children deh!
Don't dread no pain
Where do we go now
To the rivers of ungodly waters, we'll fear no foe
(fear no foe, fear no foe)
Wherever I go
Not even the pestilence
That crawl at night
Can't do - wo-wo-wo - me no wrong (just can't do me no wrong)
Oh, now!
I tell you already
I tell you again
(Screwface know-a who fi frighten!)
Screwface know-a who fi frighten!
Screwface know-a who fi frighten! Wo, now!
(Screwface know-a who fi frighten!) Screwface will frighten
Screwface!
(Screwface know-a who fi frighten!) Long time gone, y'all!
(Screwface know-a who fi frighten!) Screwface will frighten
Screwface!
Wo, yeah! Now!
(Screwface know-a who fi frighten!)
What's going on? (Work it harder, make it better)
Could this be my understanding? (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
It's not your fault (More than ever, hour after hour)
I was being too demanding (Work is never over)

I must admit (Work it harder, make it better)
It's my pride that made me distant (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
All because (More than ever, hour after hour)
I hoped that you'd be someone different (Work is never over)

(Work it harder, make it better)
There's not much I know about you (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
(More than ever, hour after hour)
Fear will always make you blind (Work is never over)
(Work it harder, make it better)
But the answer is in clear view (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
(More than ever, hour after hour)
It's amazing what you'll find face to face (Work is never over)

Amazing what you'll find face to face (Work it harder, make it better)
Amazing what you'll find face to face (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
Amazing what you'll find face to face (More than ever, hour after hour)
Amazing what you'll find face to face (Work is never over)
Amazing what you'll find face to face (Work it harder, make it better)
Amazing what you'll find face to face (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
Amazing what you'll find face to face (More than ever, hour after hour)
Amazing what you'll find face to face (Work is never over)

Work is never over
Work it harder
Make it better
Do it faster
Makes us stronger

More than ever
Hour after hour
Work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over

I turned away (Work it harder, make it better)
'Cause I thought you were the problem (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
Tried to forget (More than ever, hour after hour)
Until I hit the bottom (Work is never over)

But when I faced you (Work it harder, make it better)
In my blank confusion (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
I realized you weren't wrong (More than ever, hour after hour)
It was a mere illusion (Work is never over)

(Work it harder, make it better)
It really didn't make sense (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
(More than ever, hour after hour)
Just to leave this unresolved (Work is never over)
(Work it harder, make it better)
It's not hard to go the distance (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
(More than ever, hour after hour)
When you finally get involved face to face(Work is never over)
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over

Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over

Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over

Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over

They got music so high you can't get over it
So low you can't get under it, uh-huh

Join in and be what you wanna be

Talking 'bout paying some dues
People walking around reciting poetry, yeah
Ooh, screaming guitars, and a thousand coloured lights
People, I'm telling you this place is really out of sight, yeah
Hey, you can have your fortune told
You can learn the meaning of soul
I guarantee you this place will blow your mind

After rain (whoa)
Created time
Now which one's mine
Gave pictures frames (whoa)
Created man
Gave him woman
Why did you do that for me?

[Chorus]
These are the questions asked
Before I lay me down and go to sleep
(ooh, sometimes I wonder)
Sometimes I wonder why you decided
To keep your hands on me (hands on me)
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders
There's still one mystery:
How did you manage...to love me?

[Verse 2]
You breathe the life
Right into me
Then made my heart beat (whoa)
Created the mountains
All of the deep seas
Flowers and the trees (whoa)
You made tomorrow come again
You calm the strong winds (whoa)
After all I've done
You gave me a son
Tell me why would you do that for me?

[Chorus]
These are the questions asked (yeah)
Before I lay me down and go to sleep
(right in the middle of my prayers)
Sometimes I wonder why you decided (oh yeah)
To keep your hands on me (hands on me)
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders
There's still one mystery
How did you manage...to love me?
(How did you manage that?)
How did you manage...to love me?

[Outro]
Said I've got to know how
(How did you manage to love?)
After all the wrong I've done, oh Lord
(How did you manage to love?)
After I've been so bad oh Lord, how, oh, how
(How did you manage to forgive me)
Even when I didn't believe you believed in me Lord, how
(How did you manage to forgive me?)
Jesus, you sacrificed your life for me
(How did you manage to forgive me?)
Ooh Lord, tell me
(Why did you pay the price...for me?)
Ooh, yoooo, ooh, why...
(How did you manage to love?)
Just to look in your eyes again
Just to lay in your arms
Just to be the first one always there for you
Just to live in your laughter
Just to sing in your heart
Just to be every one of your dreams come true

Just to sit by your window
Just to touch in the night
Just to offer a prayer each day for you
Just to long for your kisses
Just to dream of your sighs
Just to know that I'd give my life for you

For you all the rest of my life
For you all the best of my life
For you alone, only for you

Just to wake up each morning
Just to you by my side
Just to know that you're never really far away
Just a reason for living
Just to say I adore
Just to know that you're here in my heart to stay
For you all the rest of my life
For you all the best of my life
For you alone, only for you

Just the words of a love song
Just the beat of my heart
Just the pledge of my life, my love for you
Hey, read all about it, read all about it
Paper, mister?

Down in Nashville, Tennessee
A little fella shouted this to me
Buy a paper, know the news
Or else I gotta sing the Newsboy Blues

Dig a nickel from your jeans
A nickel buys a lot of jelly beans
Hey there, mister, don't refuse
I hate to have to sing the Newsboy Blues

See the headlines, what do you read?
See the want ads, what do you need?
Read the funnies, what do you say?
I haven't even sold a single paper today

Tell you what I'm gonna do
Gimme a nickel and I'll sing for you
Tap the rhythm with my shoes
My little song is called the Newsboy Blues
See the headlines, what do you read?
See the want ads, hey, what do you need?
Read the funnies, what do you say?
I haven't even sold a single paper today

Tell you what I'm gonna do
Gimme a nickel and I'll croon for you
Tap the rhythm with my shoes
My little song is called the Newsboy Blues

I'll beat the rhythm with my shoes
My little song is called the Newsboy Blues

Paper
Get your evening paper here, what do you read?
Get your evening paper
If you lose your money, great god, don't lose your mind
If you lose your money, great god, don't lose your mind
If you lose your woman, please don't fool with mine

I'm gonna buy me a bulldog, watch my lady while I sleep
I'm gonna buy me a bulldog, watch my lady while I sleep
Women these days, they're so doggone crooked
Till they might make off 'fore day creep

Well, you can't watch your wife, outside women too
You can't watch your wife, outside women too
When you're out with your women, wife will be at home
Cookin' your food, doin' your dirt, buddy, what you tryin' to do?

Oh, you can't watch your wife, outside women too
Oh, you can't watch your wife, outside women too
When you're out with your women, wife will be at home
Cookin' your food, doin' your dirt, buddy, what you tryin' to?
I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl
That girl that girl

Every time I came around
She made her body go down
Her physical was so crazy
She could make a blind man see
Ooh

Before then, we got separated
She was gone before I could say shit
And I ain't looking for no replacement
No, whoa, whoa, whoa

If I gotta almost search the whole club
Trying to get to her before she sobers up
Let me see you throw your hands up
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? Where did she go?
I've been looking for her all night

Where did she go?
Where did she go?
Where did she go?
I've been looking for her all night

I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl
That girl, that girl

I must've seen her beauty at the bar
Under the strobe lights, looking like a star
(Looking like a star, girl)
But everyone started rushing me
Looking through the crowd, shawty left the scene, oh

Before then, we got separated
She was gone before I could say shit
And I ain't looking for no replacement
No, whoa, whoa, whoa

If I gotta almost search the whole club
Trying to get to her before she sobers up
Let me see you throw your hands up
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? Where did she go?
I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night

Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night

Club closing up, I'm still looking for you
Walked up to the ladies room
No luck, so I'm headed to the DJ booth

Next thing I know
She tell my show, "This ain't you
Looking at you, you wanna take me home
So tonight, I just might put you on"

I'm looking for the girl, I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl, that girl, that girl
I'm looking for the girl, I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl, that girl that girl

Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night

Dance Ballerina Dance
Dance, ballerina, dance
And do your pirouette in rhythm with your achin' heart
Dance, ballerina, dance
You mustn't once forget a dancer has to dance the part
Whirl, ballerina, whirl
And just ignore the chair that's empty in the second row
This is your moment, girl
Although he's not out there applauding as you steal the show
Once you said his love must wait its turn
You wanted fame instead
I guess that's your concern
We live and learn
And love is gone, ballerina, gone
So on with your career, you can't afford a backward glance
Dance on and on and on
A thousand people here have come to see the show
As 'round and 'round you go
So ballerina, dance
Dance, dance!

[Verse 1]
They said you wouldn't make it so far (aha)
And ever since they've said it it's been hard
But never mind that night you had to cry
Cause you had never let it go inside
You worked real hard and you know exactly what you want and need so believe
And you can never give up
You can reach your goals
Just talk to your soul and say

[Chorus]

I believe I will (oh I will)
I believe I know my dreams are real (my dreams are real)
I believe I stand (oh yeah)
I believe I dance (oh yeah)
I believe I grow real soon (that's why)
That is what I do believe

[Verse 2]
Your goals are just a thing in your soul (aha)
And you know that your moves will let them show
You keep creating pictures in your mind
So just believe that they will come true in time
It will be fine leave all of your cares and stress behind
Just let it go
Let the music flow inside
Forget all your pain and just start to believe

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Never mind what people say
Hold your head high and turn away

Looking to the sky
I will achieve all my needs
I will always believe
Whoa oa oa YEA

Speak low
When you speak love
Our summer day
Withers away
Too soon, too soon

Speak low
When you speak love
Our moment is swift
Like ships adrift
We're swept away too soon

Speak low
Darling, speak low
Love is a spark
Lost in the dark
Too soon, too soon

I feel
Wherever I go
That tomorrow is near
Tomorrow is here
And always too soon
Time is so old
And love so brief
Love is pure gold
And time, a thief

Late
Darling, we're late
The curtain descends
Everything ends
Too soon, too soon

I wait
Darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me?
Speak love to me
And soon

Time is so old
And love so brief
Love is pure gold
And time, a thief

We're late
Darling, we're late
The curtain descends
Everything ends
Too soon, too soon
I wait
Darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me?
Speak love to me
Speak love to me
Speak love to me

Speak low to me
But speak to me
Speak to me soon
What's that I hear now, ringing in my ear?
I've heard that sound before
What's that I hear now, ringing in my ear?
I hear it more and more

It's the sound of freedom calling
Ringing up to the sky
It's the sound of the old ways a falling
You can hear it if you try
You can hear it if you try

What's that I see now, shining in my eyes?
I've seen that light before
What's that I see now, shining in my eyes?
I see it more and more

It's the light of freedom shining
Shining up to the sky
It's the light of the new ways a shining
You can see it if you try
You can see it if you try
What's that I feel now, beating in my heart?
I've felt that beat before
What's that I feel now, beating in my heart?
I feel it more and more

It's the rumble of freedom calling
Climbing up to the sky
It's the rumble of the old ways a falling
You can feel it if you try
You can feel it if you try
You can if you try!
Man, the other day
I was trying to figure out how many letters was in the alphabet
It took me all day, but you know I did it
You wanna know how many letters there are?
26 letters in the alphabet!

26 letters in the alphabet
I wear a shower cap so I don't get wet
I put on my shoes so my feet don't hurt
And go to the floor with Ernie and Bert

When I'm on the floor, I'm singin'
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
When I'm on the floor, I'm singin'
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

I got lots of friends, so I don't need pets

They got kicked out and they can't come back
So they're standing outside, singin'
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Yeah, they're standing outside, singin'

(chorus)

[Gonna find me a gypsy and get my fortune told,]

[I'm gonna find me a gypsy and get my fortune told.]

[I'm gonna say please, missus gypsy, tell me what the future will hold.]
(Honey, a deck of cards and a crystal ball)
(Won't tell you a thing that you don't already know)
(The future will almost certainly be whatever you want it to be,)
(What with rockets, spaceships, computers, inventions)
(Little buttons you can push, and push,)
(Let your imagination burst into flame)
(And it will let you do whatever you damn well choose to do)

Given a choice I would choose to have a magic wand that I could use
To draw a melody, from that enchanted maze of grass
And keys and wood and wind and steel
(speaks)
And I would stand there, big and brave, and quietly say
Ladies and Gentlemen, play for me, play for me
(and the orchestra plays a beautiful melody)
One day high above the horizon appears the
Familiar shape of the great white bird. Rhayader in
His joy sends for Fritha
Now you niggas gon' see I'ma G. Bet chu bitch gon' remember me
Needs no muthafukin' intro as I walk with the swagga like I'm 6'4. Skinny nigga doe, fresh like mentos. Look at me real close, rap nigga been in Vogue. Ha! But I neva pose but I make ho's- Marilyne Monroe; strip down no clothes. Bring it back like six fo' nintendo's. Blow! On my holy o' catch the holy ghost. Damn! Listen to the sound; Metal rounds. Neva play around; Kid. I'm no play ground. Niggas puppy chow, eatin' wit dey face down. Niggas try ta tell. One shot kill, now who you gon' tell, Nigga?

[Verse 1]
When I wake up in the morning time and see the sun, I say:
Halleleujah, thank you Jesus for waking me up today
I think about his goodness and the wonderful things he's done:
Forgiving me, setting me free and casting my sins away
And soon as I was about to fall, he stepped right in on time
You picked me up, and let me know you had nothing but love for me
And those lonely nights when I thought that I gonna lose my mind (my mind)
Lord, You were my company

[Chorus]
And now I feel joy (when I think about you)
I feel strength (when I think about you)
No pain (when I think about you)
And no rain (when I think about you)
I get glad (when I think about you)
And raise my hands (when I think about you)
Shout your name (when I think about you)
(When I think about you)

[Verse 2]
And in the midst of the storm you were the shelter in my life
Even though (I was doing wrong) and even though (I fell off)
No one can help me out, the way you helped me whenever I was in need
When trouble was chasing, I was weak, you kept your hands on me
My God you sacrificed you life that I might live for eternity
Despite my faults, you heard my cry (yes you did) and forgave my
No one can understand, the way you understand when it comes to my heart
Lord, you gave me a brand new start

[Chorus]
And now I feel joy (when I think about you)
Feel strength (when I think about you)
There is no pain (when I think about you)
No rain (when I think about you)
I get glad (when I think about you)
Raise my hands (when I think about you)
Shout your name (when I think about you) Oh Lord
(When I think about you)

[Bridge]
Listen, even though your doubts will come (doubts will come)
Believe he gave his only son (all of the world)
To all the world, He chose to love (oh, yes he did)
So how can we not (how can we not) send our praises up

[Chorus]
I feel joy (when I think about you)
Feel strength, yeah (when I think about you)
There's no rain (when I think about you)
No more pain (when I think about you)
I get glad, oh (when I think about you)
Then I raise my hands (when I think about you)
Shout your name (when I think about you) Oh I
(When I think about you)
I feel joy (when I think about you)
And peace (when I think about you)
Feel your presence (when I think about you)
Coming over me (when I think about you)
Then I start to fall, yeah (when I think about you)
Down to my knees (when I think about you)
And begin to pray (when I think about you) Lord help me
(When I think about you)
When I see the light (when I think about you)
Start to shine right through (when I think about you)
It's a brand new day (when I think about you)
And my hearts renewed (when I think about you)
And all my fears are gone (when I think about you)
Oh ooh, away (when I think about you)
When my day looks cloudy (when I think about you)
It's gonna be okay (When I think about you)
Hey, yeah, oh ooh (when I think about you)
Ooh Lord (when I think about you)
How you gave me love (when I think about you)
(GAVE ME LOVE)
And I gave you nothing (when I think about you)
(GAVE YOU NOTHING)
How you woke me up (when I think about you)
(HEY)
And, started me on my way (when I think about you)
See you did not have to do it (when I think about you)
But you did it any old way (when I think about you)
(Any old, any old, any old way) (when I think about you)
Yes you did, yes you did (when I think about you)
Yes you did, yes you did (when I think about you)
Yes you did (when I think about you)
HEY (HEY) HEY (HEY) (when I think about you)
HEY (HEY) HEY (HEY) (when I think about you)
HEY (HEY) HEY (HEY) (when I think about you)
HEY (HEY) HEY HEY HEY WOO (when I think about you)
Oh yes (uh) (when I think about you)

(when I think about you)
(when I think about you)
(when I think about you)
Frank: Who's got eyes that sparkle like a lily sprinkled with dew? Lily Belle
Who's got lips that's fresh as autumn rain when summer is through? Lily Belle
Frank and The Charioteers: Would you like a sunbeam on a rainy day
You can catch a sunbeam when she smiles your way

Frank: And who's got all the leaves that flutter so they're ready to fall, Lily Belle
Birdies take one look at her, and stop their singing to call, "my, you're swell"
Oh and incidentally, there's one more thing to tell
If your eyes are open and you think you're seeing a dream, it's

Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder
Now the years of threading daisies lie behind you
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and paints and beads
I will show you games where the winner never wins

Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free
I will hold a lighted lamp and we shall walk together

Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine
That it could happen this way, could you?
I will show you games where the winner never wins

Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

[Verse 1]
Start off with a hug, lead into embrace
Oh girl, I'm glad to see you, oh face to face
Not a day of age
Oh, and by the way
I forgot to say how much I missed you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
And just like déjà vu, I say
Running into you this way
I wanna keep you here
I gotta have you near

[Chorus]
Can I have a kiss from you
Can I have a kiss from you
For old times' sake, oh baby
Can I have a kiss from you (Can I have a kiss)
Can I have a kiss from you (Can I have a kiss)
For old times' sake, no, oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
Been a long time since I've called you mine
Sure would love to see
Us back together like we used to be
So let me take you out, so much to talk about
Like things we used to share
And how to get it back, my dear

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like déjà vu, I say (Oh, I say)
Running into you this way
I wanna keep you here
I gotta have you near

[Chorus]
Can I have a kiss from you (Can I have a kiss)
Can I have a kiss from you (Can I have a kiss)
For old times' sake, oh baby
Can I have a kiss from you (Can I have a kiss)
Can I have a kiss from you (Can I have a kiss)
For old times' sake

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, well, yeah, well, well, well
Well, well, well
Can I, can I, can I, can I
No, oh, no no no no no
Can I have a kiss, baby
I need, oh, want it
Reminisce, reminisce

[Pre-Chorus]
And just like déjà vu, I say
Running into you this way
I wanna keep you here
I gotta have you near

[Chorus]
Can I have a kiss from you (Oh) (Can I have a kiss)
Just a simple kiss from you (Can I have a kiss)
For old times' sake (I know, I know, I know, I know)
This is no mistake, baby
Can I have a kiss from you (Baby) (Can I have a kiss)
Just a simple kiss from you (Can I have a kiss)
For old times' sake
A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four
Uh, this song's about jellyfish
And their bellyfish
Ain't no foolyfish
I don't droolyfish
Goes like this:

Jelly, jelly, jellyfish
When you squeeze me, I go squish
Peanut butter jellyfish
Put me onto your sandwich

Said jelly, jelly, jellyfish
When you squeeze me, I go squish
'Cause I'm a jellyfish
I'm a jellyfish

My friends are fish and they go to school
They think I'm crazy and they think I'm cool
'Cause I'm a jellyfish
I'm a jellyfish
Jelly, jelly, jellyfish
When you squeeze me, I go squish
'Cause I'm a jellyfish
I'm a jellyfish

Got no eyes, I got no head
I've got no house, I got no bed
'Cause I'm a jellyfish
I'm a jellyfish
Jellyfish
They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knees to Idols made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the Fourth Man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn

Now the prophet Daniel tells about
Three men who walked with God
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
Before the wicked king they stood
And the king commanded them bound and thrown
Into the fiery furnace that day
But the fire was so hot that the men were slain
That forced them on their way

Now when the three were cast in and the king rose up
To witness this awful fate
He began to tremble at what he saw
In astonished tones he spake
Did we not cast three men bound
Into the midst of the fire
Well, Lo, I see four men unhurt
Unbound and walkin' down there;
There's Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
And the fiery coals they trod
But the form of the Fourth Man that I see
Is like the Son of God;
Up every mornin' before the sun takin my lovin on the run
Breakin my back till the day is done I'm gonna punch that time clock
And have some fun ain't no easy way to get myself out

So - I keep on workin' like a workin' man do
I gotta buy my baby shoes I keep on workin' it's the only to do
I make my livin' by the sweat of my brow oh workin' just like you - uh

I was raised on the poor side of town I made my livin' movin' around
I never let no one dog me down - oh I was taught to stand my ground
Like was always changin' that's just the way it is

So I keep on workin' like a workin' man do
I got to buy my baby shoes I keep on workin'
It's the only thing to do I make my livin' by the sweat of my brow

Oh - workin' just like you uh oh oh oh oh - I keep on workin'

Ooh - I keep on workin'like a workin' man do
I need to buy my baby shoes
I keep on workin' it's the only thing to do
I make my livin' by the sweat of my brow oh - workin' just like you
Aaah ah ah ah aaah ah ah ah I keep on workin' - workin'
I keep on workin' - workin' I keep on workin' - workin'
I keep on workin' - workin' uh oh oh oh
Started off the day with a thought
That took me far away
I think I found a place
Where I know I can be forever

It's down in San Miguel
(Lookin' for lookin' for lookin' for a lady down in)
Could be in Mexico
(Lookin' for lookin' for lookin' for a lady)
Where you don't need no dough
I know I'm gonna go
(Lookin' for lookin' for lookin' for a lady to love)

Lookin' for the ladies of love

I go where I'm going
Goin' straight ahead
Down in to San Miguel
Over the top
We cross the border now
Headin' in to San Miguel
That's where I'm gonna go
(Lookin for lookin for lookin' for a lady down in)
Hope you will be comin' too
(Lookin' for lookin' for lookin' for a lady)
You can kick off your shoes
Come on it's time to go
(Lookin' for lookin' for lookin' for a lady to love)

Lookin' for the ladies of love

Ow ow

Yiyiyiyiyiyi

It's down in San Miguel
(Lookin for lookin for lookin for a lady down in)
Could be in Mexico
(Lookin' for lookin' for lookin' for a lady)
Where you don't need no dough
I know I'm gonna go
(Lookin' for lookin' for lookin' for a lady to love)

Lookin' for the ladies of love

La la la la

...
On a little street in Singapore
We'd meet beside a lotus-covered door
A veil of moonlight on her lonely face
How pale the hands that held me in embrace
My sails tonight are filled with perfume of Shalimar
And temple bells will guide me to the shore
And then I'll hold her in my arms, and love the way I loved before
On a little street in Singapore

[Verse 1]
Holy war, genocide, suicide
Hate and cruelty
How can this be holy?
If I had a heart I'd cry

[Verse 2]
These ancient tales, the good go to heaven
And the wicked ones burn in hell
Ring the funeral bells
If I had a heart I'd cry

[Chorus 1]
There's just too many people now
Too little land
Much too much desire
You feel so feeble now
It's so out of hand
Big bombs and barbed wire
We've set our lovely sky
Our lovely sky on fire

[Chorus 2]
There's just too many people now
And too little land
Too much rage and desire
It makes you feel so feeble now
It's so out of hand
Big bombs and barbed wire
Can't you see our destiny?
We are making this Earth our funeral pyre

[Verse 3]
Holy Earth, how can we heal you?
We cover you like a blight
Strange birds of appetite
If I had a heart I'd cry

[Outro]
If I had a heart I'd cry
If I had a heart I'd cry
Take me in your arms
And never let me go
Whisper to me softly
While the moon is low
Hold me close and tell me
What I wanna know
Say it to me gently
Let the sweet talk flow
Come a little closer
Make love to me

Kiss me once again
Before we say good-night
Take me in your loving arms
And squeeze me tight
Put me in a mood
So I can dream all night
Everybody's sleeping
So it's quite all right
Come a little closer
Make love to me
When you're near
So help me, dear
Chills run
Up and down my spine
Don't you know
I love you so
I won't be happy
Till you're mine
When I'm in your arms
You give my heart a treat
Everything about you
So doggone sweet
Every time we kiss
You make my life complete
Baby don't you know
You swept me off my feet
Now's it's time to tell you
Make love to me

When you're near
So help me, dear
Chills run
Up and down my spine
Don't you know
I love you so
I won't be happy
Till you're mine
When I'm in your arms
You give my heart a treat
Everything about you
So doggone sweet
Every time we kiss
You make my life complete
Baby don't you know
You swept me off my feet
Now's it's time to tell you
Make love to me

[Verse 1]
Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon, dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path, and I'll pray
Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud, cry out

[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love?
And is it over now?
Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

[Verse 2]
Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale, up for sale

[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love?
And is it over now?
Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love?
Now tell me, is it over now?
Do you know how
To pick up the pieces and go home, go home, go home

[Outro]
Pale shadow of a woman
Black widow
Pale shadow of a dragon
Dust woman
Mm, pale shadow of a woman
Mm, black widow
Mm, pale shadow, she's a dragon
Dust woman, woman, woman
Train roll on
On down the line, won't you
Please take me far away

Now I feel the wind blow
Outside my door means I'm
I'm leaving my woman at home, Lordy

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Oh my baby's gone with the wind

And I don't know
Oh where I'm going
I just want to be left alone

Well when this train ends
I'll try again oh but
I'm leaving my woman at home, Lordy

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on
Tuesday's gone
Train roll on
Many miles from my home, see I'm
I'm riding my blues away, yeah

Well Tuesday you see
Oh she had to be free, Lord but
Somehow I got to carry on, Lordy

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind, oh
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on
Roll on
'Cause my baby's gone
I'm riding my blues babe
Trying to ride my blues
Ride on train
Ride on train
Ride my blues babe
Come back to me babe
Come back to me oh train
Roll on train
Wooaahh...
Ride on train
Tuesday
We were just a plain ol' hillbilly band with a plain ol' country style
We never played the kind of songs that'd drive anybody wild
Played a railroad song with a stomping beat
We played a blues song, kinda slow and sweet
But the thing that knocked them off of their feet was, ooh-wee

When Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie in the strangest kind of way

Play it strange!

Well, we did our best to entertain everywhere we'd go
We'd nearly wear our fingers off to give the folks a show
Played jumping jive to make 'em get in the groove
We played sad songs, real slow and smooth
But the only thing that'd make 'em move was, ooh-wee

When Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie
You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is still just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say "I love you"
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why
But lately you don't talk to me
And darling, I can't see me in your eyes
I hold you near but you're so far away
And it's losing you, I can't believe
To watch you leave and let this feeling die
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
And tomorrow if I'm here without your love, you know I can't survive
Only my love can raise you high above it all
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
We can take the darkness and make if full of light
But let your love flow back to me
How can you leave and let this feeling die?
This happy room would be a lonely place when you are gone
And I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on
No other woman's love could be as true, I'm begging you
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, away
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, away
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

S saturday night in toledo, ohio
Saturday night in toledo, ohio, is like being nowhere at all
All through the day how the hours rush by
You sit in the park and you watch the grass die
Ah, but after the sunset, the dusk and the twilight
When shadows of night start to fall
They roll back the sidewalks precisely at ten
And people who live there are not seen again
Just two lonely truckers from great falls, montana
And a salesman from places unknown - ces unknown
Oh add all together in downtown toledo
To spend their big night all alone
You ask how I know of toledo, ohio
Well I spent a week there one day
They've got entertainment to dazzle your eyes
Go visit the bakery and watch the buns rise
Ah, but let's not forget that the folks of toledo
Unselfishly gave us the scales
No springs, honest weight, that's the promise they made
So smile and be thankful next time you get weighed
And wive and wet wive
Let this be our motto
Let's let the sleeping dogs lie - ping dogs lie
And here's to the dogs of toledo, ohio
Ladies, we bid you goodbye
Words and music by randy sparkes
Louie, Louie, me gotta go. Louie, Louie, me gotta go
A fine little girl, she wait for me. Me catch the ship across the sea
I sailed the ship all alone. I never think I'll make it home
Louie, Louie, me gotta go. Louie, Louie, me gotta go
Three nights and days we sailed the sea. Me think of girl constantly
On the ship, I dream she there. I smell the rose in her hair
Louie, Louie, me gotta go. Louie, Louie, me gotta go
Me see Jamaican moon above. It won't be long me see me love
Me take her in my arms and then. I tell her I never leave again
Louie, Louie, me gotta go. Louie, Louie, me gotta go
We were a wonderful pair, so they tell me
We had a heaven to share, so they tell me
Everyone says that we lived in a dream just yesterday
It's strange how a beautiful scheme can fade away
Our love was out of a book, so they tell me
We had that far-away look, so they tell me
And then heaven tumbled, and now we are through
How in the world can it be?
I can't tell myself that it's true
So they tell me

Our love was out of a book, so they tell me
We had that far-away look, so they tell me
And then heaven tumbled, and now we are through
How in the world can it be?
I can't tell myself that it's true
So they tell me
Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no-one dared
Disturb the sound of silence
'Fools,' said I, 'you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you,'
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said 'The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls'
And whispered
In the sound of silence
I'm hurting deep inside
And it's like that always
The passion was not ours to keep
To keep...

The feelings justified
You're giving me this heartache
Rejection comes in and cuts so deep
So deep...

Now everywhere I turn
All my bridges burn
Why can't you see all I need come set me free

'Cause I still can feel you always
My love can heal you always
It too can heal you always
Alright, always

I still can feel it, always
I still believe it, always
I can't conceal it, always
All night, always
Everywhere I go
It's like you're there beside me
Possession makes my heart pretend
Pretend...

'Cause I just can't let go
What I did ever found me
To give affection once again
But to win

I feel I'm trapped inside
(I feel I'm trapped inside)
You've tooked all of my pride
Why can't you see all I need come set me free
I need come set me free

'Cause I still can feel you always
My love can heal you always
It too can heal you always
Alright, always

I still can feel it, always
I still believe it, always
I can't conceal it, always
All night, always
When all the world is a hopeless jumble
And the raindrops tumble all around
Heaven opens a magic lane

When all the clouds darken up the skyway
There's a rainbow highway to be found
Leading from your windowpane

To a place behind the sun
Just a step beyond the rain

Somewhere, over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I dreamed of
Once in a lullabye

Somewhere, over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Some day I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are
Far
Behind me
Where laughter falls like lemon drops away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere, over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh, why can't I?
I'm a king bee buzzing around your hive
Now I'm a king bee darling buzzing around your hive
Yeah, I can make some honey babe if you let me fly up inside
Cause I'm young and able to buzz all night long
I'm young and able mama, lord to buzz all night long
And you know together we can make some honey
Like the world ain't never known

Cause I'm asking king bee, won't you be my queen
Now I'm a king bee rider, won't you be my queen
Because you know we can make some sweet little honey
Like the world ain't never seen
Drive your car up in my driveway
Cut your bright lights way down low
Drive your car up in my driveway, mama
Cut your bright lights way down low
I'm gonna wind up your transmission
Till your motor won't run no more

[Verse 1: Andy, Jorma, Akiva]

Black girls!
You are attracted to us!
Asian girls!
You are attracted to us!
Latinas!
You are attracted to us!
Attracted to us!

[Chorus: Andy, Jorma, Akiva]
But you're never gonna get it
Never, never gonna get it
No, you're never gonna get it
Because we're shy, we're shy, we're shy
We're all so shy
You're never gonna get it
We're so sweet and shy

[Bridge: Beck, Andy, Jorma, Akiva]
All you pretty girls
We know you want our bodies
But we're more the introspective types
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Andy, Jorma, Akiva]
But you're never gonna get it
Never, never gonna get it
No you're never gonna get it
Because we're shy, we're shy, we're shy
We're nice and shy
You're never gonna get it
We're polite and shy

[Outro: Andy, Jorma, Akiva, Beck]
You are attracted to us!
(You are attracted to us!)
'Cause we are shy

[Verse 1]
Somebody said, I was living in the life
Somebody told me, I was living in the life
Think that you might know, you find that you're really wrong
My patience come and go but my living has got to go on

[Chorus]
And if you think it's easy it's only 'cause
You ain't me, and I ain't you
Check out the difference between the two

[Verse 2]
Somebody said, it was easy in my life
Somebody told me, I had made it in my life
Try to understand my determination when
You can only stand on the outside looking in

[Chorus]
And if you think it's easy it's only 'cause
You ain't me, and I ain't you
Check out the difference between the two

[Verse 3]
Somebody said, I was living in the life
Somebody told me, I was living in the life
Try to understand my determination when
You can only stand on the outside looking in

[Outro]
Oh, you ain't me, and I ain't you
There's a helluva difference between the two
And I wish I knew how
It would feel to be free
I wish that I could break
All the chains holding me
I wish I could say
All the things that I'd like to say
Say 'em loud say 'em clear
For the whole round world to hear
I wish I could share
All the love that's in my heart
Remove every doubt that keeps us apart
And I wish you could know
What it means to be me
Then you'd see and agree
Every man should be free

I wish I could live
Like I'm longin' to live
I wish I could give
What I'm longin' to give
And I wish I could do
All the things I'd like to do
You know they still are quite a few
Yes Sir...
And I'm way way over due
I wish I could be like a bird up in the sky
How sweet it would be
If I found out I could fly
So long to the sun
And look down upon Ihe sea
And I sing because I know
How it feels to be
And I sing because I know
How it feels to be
And I sing because I know
How it feels to be free
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Outside my window a robin builds a nest
At last winter's gone away to rest
Once again the leaves have returned to the trees
I can just feel that soft summer breeze

[Chorus]
There's magic in the air
Winter's disappeared, it's Summer

[Verse 2]
Children will be playing in the park
Days will be longer 'til dark
Nights will be warm
In the star-filled skies
For a girl and a guy

[Chorus]
There's magic in the air
Green grass everywhere, it's Summer

[Verse 3]
Lovers will walk the beach hand in hand
While others build castles in the sand
And that golden globe
I just know
Summer's here

[Verse 4]
Now that summer's here
There'll be millions of things to do
Vacation near or far
Whatever pleases you
Summer is the happiest season of them all
So everybody, get together and have yourself a ball

[Chorus]
There's magic in the air
Green grass everywhere, it's Summer

[Verse 1]
What do you want from me, now you got me?
Now my fingers bleed, now they stare at me
I'm a coward now
I hold my peace
Now you tie me up to your feather bed
And I twist and turn in a Chinese burn
You won't let go
You won't let go

[Refrain]
You're inside of my head
Inside of my head

[Verse 2]
What do you want from me, now you got me?
Now my energy, you suck from me
And I'm holding on
For dear life
Quit smothering me, quit laughing at me
I've got a disease, an English disease
It will not go
It will not go

[Refrain]
You're inside of my head
Inside of my head

[Verse 3]
Whatever you put in that syringe
Whatever you really said to him
He's sitting there inside of me
And you bother me, you possess me
You're there again, ahead of me
And I won't let go, I won't let go

[Refrain]
You're inside of my head
Inside of my head
Inside of my head, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Inside of my head

[Chorus 1]
I'm worried, worried as a man can be
I'm worried, worried as a man can be
I'm worried 'bout my baby
She goin' away from me

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm worried 'bout my baby
And I wonder where she gone
I'm worried 'bout my baby
And I wonder why she gone
I hope someday my baby love will return

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I hope someday my baby love will return
I hope someday my baby love will return
If she don't come back to me, my whole life will go to ruin

[Chorus 1]
I'm worried, worried as a man can be
I'm worried, worried as a man can be
I'm worried 'bout my baby
She goin' away from me
They build you up to watch you fall
Tell you, you can do it all
But they really wanna see you down in
The shadows
Cos they can't ever learn to fly
They don't wanna see you in the sky
But they really wanna see you down in
The shadows

[Pre Chorus]
(I know I know) they don't believe in us
(I know I know) we're meant to be
Because
We both share our lives in the light

[Chorus]
And I Say...
They ain't never go'n get us 

[x4]

Tell me are these words familiar
That man, he ain't good enough
But they really wanna see you down in
The shadows
They won't tell it to your face
All you gotta do is fall from grace
But they really wanna see you down in
The shadows

[Pre Chorus]
I know I know they don't believe in us
I know I know we're meant to be
Because
We both Share our lives in the light

[Chorus]
They don't know about the things we
Do, They don't understand it's just us
Two
Why they always tryina intervene, They
Don't understand that it's our dream
Well, to the left, to the left,we should
Tell them to get to the left
Why they always tryina intervene, They
Don't understand that it's our dream...

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 1]
Shake hands, genocide, molasses
Jet powered caravans, molasses
I'm too good, you're stuck on
Rent free earthquake zone, molasses

[Verse 2]
I need someone else's glasses
Starving waitresses in plasters
Fat houseflies, genocide
We've been stitched up, molasses
Well let me tell you well no chick made could be the same
As Sweet Georgia Brown
Crazy feet that dance so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown
Fella’s sigh, and even cry for Sweet Georgia Brown
I tell you just why you know I don’t lie

It’s been said, she knocks them dead in any old town
Since she came right it’s a shame how she brings them down
In Liverpool she even dare to criticize the Beatles’ hair
With their whole fan club standing there, I mean Sweet Georgia Brown
Alright

I say this group is absolutely marvelous with the piano
Don’t you think so?
Not too commercial boys, not too commercial!

When it comes to music Sweet Georgia known to mind
Don’t buy clothes at fashion shows but she still looks fine
Snap chicks cry, they want to die when Georgie does the twist
I never would try to tell you just why use your imagination
There's a DJ crazy for her living in out home town
Since she came like it’s a shame, she turns him down
Records that she can get are records, they ain't sent him yet
Carolina may have Dina, but that don’t have Georgia Brown

Oh such Sweet Georgia
Yeah yeah yeah I mean brown, oh oh oh
Sweet Georgia Brown
Take it from me, don't be a do-badder up
Do-badder up, do bother to put your foot up
That ladder that leads you to that place
Below and every day you lose other you

Feel sadder, you get madder so use the other
Step ladder, you climb the other way
Scrapping and fighting, scratching and fighting
Cheating and acting, selfish makes your heart
Like a part of the hardest heart, so selfish

Take it from me, don't you be a do-badder up
A do-badder up, a do-badder up, just step up for that
Step ladder and climb the other way

[Verse 1]
Stinky weather, fat shaky hands
Dopey morning Doc, grumpy gnomes

[Refrain]
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

[Verse 2]
Big screen dolls, tits and explosions
Sleepy time, bashful but nude

[Refrain]
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

[Verse 3]
Intergalactic, seeming to be you
It's all in the tablets, sneezy Bhutan

[Refrain]
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

[Verse 4]
Mars happy nation, sit on my karma
Dame meditation, take me away

[Refrain]
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

[Chorus]
Sending me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away

[Refrain]
You little wonder, little wonder you
You little wonder, little wonder you

[Chorus]
Sending me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away

[Refrain]
Little wonder, little wonder you
You little wonder, you little wonder you
You little wonder you
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you
And so the story goes they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie like they hope it was
And the Goodmen Tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of Brawn were nicer shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss
Sighing, the swirl through the streets
Like the crust of the sun
The Bewlay Brothers
In our Wings that Bark
Flashing teeth of Brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, And we were Gone
Hanging out with your Dwarf Men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions

I was Stone and he was Wax
So he could scream, and still relax, unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Thru our veins and Lo! it was midnight
Back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the Cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote
Cannot be found today
And it was Stalking time for the Moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
In the Devil-may-be-here
But He can't sing about that
Oh, And we were Gone
Real Cool Traders
We were so Turned On
You thought we were Fakers
Now the dress is hung, the ticket pawned
The Factor Max that proved the fact
Is melted down
And woven on the edging of my pillow
Now my Brother lays upon the Rocks
He could be dead, He could be not
He could be You
He's Chameleon, Comedian, Corinthian and Caricature
Shooting-up Pie-in-the-Sky
The Bewlay Brothers
In the feeble and the Bad
Bewlay Brothers
In the Blessed and Cold
In the Crutch-hungry Dark
Was where we flayed our Mark
Oh, and we were Gone
Kings of Oblivion
We were so Turned On
In the Mind-Warp Pavilion

Lay me place and bake me Pie
I'm starving for me Gravy
Leave my shoes, and door unlocked
I might just slip away, hey

Just for the Day, Hey!
Hey, Please come Away, Hey!
Just for the Day, Hey!
Please come Away, Hey!
Please come Away, Hey!
Just for the Day
Please come Away
Please come Away
Please come Away
Please come Away
Away
(Away)
Away
Hey

[Verse 1]
You've got dreams and
You've got goals
There's a vision burning down in your soul
Hold on
There's nothing that you can't do
You've gotta be driven
Motivated too
Stir up the gift that God has placed in you
Hold on
The future's looking bright for you

[Chorus]
No matter how hard it seems (No matter how hard it seems)
Never give up, always believe
Hold on, hold on to your dreams (Hold on to your dreams)
(No, no, no) Though you're facing adversities (You gotta know)
You can still be all you wanna be (Just hold on)
Hold on, hold on to your dreams

[Verse 2]
Determination is the key
In this cold world, if you're gonna succeed
Hold on
There's nothing that you can't do
Don't be discouraged by the trials you face
'Cause your beautiful mind would be a terrible thing to waste
Hold on, hold on
The future's looking bright for you

[Chorus]
No matter how hard it seems (No matter how hard it seems)
Never give up, always believe (Never give up)
Hold on, hold on to your dreams (Hold on to your dreams)
Though your facing adversities (You gotta know)
You can still be all you wanna be (Just hold on)
Hold on, hold on to your dreams

[Bridge]
Hold on, be strong (Never let nobody tell you you can't make it)
(No, no, no) Hold your head up high, keep your eyes on the prize
(Your dreams are meant for you to obtain)
And your labor is not in vain

[Chorus]
No matter how hard it seems (Just hold)
Never give up, always believe
Hold on, hold on to your dreams (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Though you're facing adversities
(That's the fact of life, but you gotta hold on)
You can still be all you wanna be (Just hold on)
Hold on, hold on to your dreams
SPOKEN "Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. We'd, we'd like to dispense with the-uh, it so
Happens that we
Just happen to have a couple of arrangements along with us. And, uh, Female fans squeal
Remember, your elders
Are sitting all around you. Fans laugh We would like to, uh, do, as one of our encores, a very
Lovely song. This
If we may digress for a minute, is not from a motion picture-it is from a show called "Carousel", it's
A very lovely
Tune called "If I Loved You." One female squeals
If I loved you, time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know
If I loved you, words wouldn't come in an easy way
'round in circles I'd go
Longin' to tell you but, afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by

Soon you'd leave me, off you would go in the mist of day
Never, never to know
How I love you, if I loved you

Brief instrumental
Soon you'd leave me, off you would go in the mist of day
Never, never to know
How I love you, if I loved you
You painted your lips baby
And you painted your eyes too
Its gettin' to the place now woman
Till I can't hardly recognize you
If that's what it takes to be hip baby
Oh, I want you to be a square
I don't want you messing around baby
Oh, I don't want you cutting of your hair

I didn't say nothing to you baby
When you were wearing bikinis for close
Oh I even stood around baby
I watched you paint your toes
If that's what it takes to be hip baby
Oh, I want you to be a square
I don't want you messing up woman
Oh, I don't want you cutting of your hair

There's something about your girlfriend baby
I swear I can't understand
She got her hair cutt off the other day
And now she looks just like a man
If that's what it takes to be hip baby
Oh, I want you to be a square
I don't want you messing up baby
Oh, I don't want you cutting of your hair
The first Noel, the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up and say a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far;
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a king was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Then entered in those wise men three
Full reverently up on the knee
And offered there, in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
I been in the right place
But it must have been the wrong time
I'd of said the right thing
But I must have used the wrong line
I been in the right trip
But I must have used the wrong car
My head was in a bad place
And I'm wondering what it's good for

I been the right place
But it must have been the wrong time
My head was in a place
But I'm having such a good time
I been running trying to get hung up in my mind
Got to give myself a little talking to this time

Just need a little brain salad surgery
Got to cure this insecurity
I been in the wrong place
But it must have been the right time
I been in the right place
But it must have been the wrong song
I been in the right vein
But it seems like the wrong arm
I been in the right world
But it seems wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong
Slipping, dodging ,sneaking
Creeping hiding out down the street
See me life shaking with every who I meet
Refried confusion is making itself clear
Wonder which way do I go to get on out of here

I been in the right place
But it must have been the wrong time
I'd have said the right thing
But I must have used the wrong line
I'd a took the right road
But I must have took a wrong turn
Would have made the right move
But I made it at the wrong time
I been on the right road
But I must have used the wrong car
My head was in a good place
And I wonder what it's bad for

[Verse 1]
I'm looking over the skyline of the city
How loud quiet nights in the mist of crime
How next door to happiness lives sorrow
And signals of solution in the sky

[Chorus]
A city of justice
A city of love
A city of peace
For every one of us
We all need it
Can't live without it
A Gotham City
Oh, yeah

How children are drowning in their tears
How we need a place where we can go
A land where every one will have a hero, even me

A city of peace
For every one of us
'Cause we all need it, yeah

We won't stumble
And we won't fall
I know a place that offers shelter

How do I say goodbye to what we had?
The good times that made us laugh outweigh the bad
I thought we'd get to see forever but forevers gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
I don't know where this road is going to lead
All I know is where we've been and what we've been through
If we get to see tomorrow, I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
And I'll take with me the memories to be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
And I'll take with me the memories to be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

I had no worries
Till I met you
But ever since that day, baby
Lord, what I've been doing through
I found no rest
No happiness
You don't do nothing but making me blue

You said you loved me
And I believed in you
I sent you down baby
And been seein' you through
But for that mistake
You made my heart ache
You don't do nothing but making me blue

This life I'm living
Stayin' here with you
Been nothing but heartaches
Woman and you know it's true
You don't satisfy
Won't even try
You don't do nothing but making me blue
Now I'm sayin' it's over
Yes, and leavin' you
Just stay where you are, little girl
I say I'm leavin' you
You had your fun
What's done is done
You don't do nothing but making me blue

[Verse 1]
Where have you come from, where have you been?
How can you know, unless you begin?

[Chorus]
Turn around
Giving more than you take
Lost and found
In the past

[Verse 2]
The chance of a lifetime is passing you by
Use it or lose it in the wink of an eye

[Chorus]
Turn around
Giving more than you take
Lost and found
In the past

[Instrumental 1:48 - 5:37]
Just a little more love
Just a little more peace
It's all it takes to live a dream
Walk hand in hand
Gotta understand
And one day soon
We'll live in harmony

Repeat it all the time

Just a little more love,just a little more love, just a litte more love,...
JUST A LITTLE MORE LOVE!
Ooh yeah
(Sing it, Wan')
Ooh, mmm, yeah...

[Verse 1: Wanya Morris & Shawn Stockman]
When it's storming (when it's storming)
You're my sunshine
When my mind gets clouded (gets clouded)
You bring the light inside

When it's hard for me to breathe
You're the air I need
Sometimes I make you wanna leave
But you're always there for me

[Chorus]
That's why I love (I)
That's why I love (said I love you baby baby)
I love (don't you know I love)
That's why I love you (and you know and you know)
That's why I love (and you know it's alright, baby)
And girl I love
I want everyone to know (said I want the world to know)
That I love you (hey hey)
Nate, sing it for 'em now

[Verse 2: Nathan Morris]
When I'm crying
You are my handkerchief
It feels like I'm dying
You raise me up just once again
Baby, you're the star
When I'm lost
That guides my way
At times when I'm losing my mind
You make everything okay

[Chorus]
That's why I, I love you
I love you
That's why I love (I love you so)
Ohhh, yes I do
I love
I really do
That's why I love
I love you, I love you, I love you eh
That's why I love
And girl I love
That's why I love you
I want everyone to know
That I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Bridge]
I love it when you come around
'Cause you know just how to hold me down
Said you sho'nuff time to hypnotize
You're so beautiful and ain't no doubt
Without you, baby, what would I do?
I'd lose all of my breath trying to explain to you
That I love you
That is why I

[Chorus]
That's why I love (I love you baby)
That's why I love
I love
That's why I love you
That's why I love ah ah ah
And girl love you
I want everyone to know
That I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you

That's why I love
That's why I love
I love (I love you so much)
That's why I love you (Oh oh oh yes)
That's why I love
And girl I love (Huh)
I want everyone to know
That I love you (Oh I love you, baby)
That's why I love
That's why I love (Hey)

That's why I love you
That's why I love
And girl I love
I want everyone to know
That I love you

I love (I love you)
I love...

[Outro]
That's why I love
And girl I love
I want everyone to know
That I love you
Hey
April, come she will
When streams are ripe and swell with rain
May, she will stay
Resting in my arms again

June, she'll change her tune
In restless walks she'll prowl the night
July, she will fly
And give no warning to her flight

August, die she must
The autumn winds blow chilly and cold
September, I'll remember
A love once new has now grown old
I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you-know-who
He said, "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow
Whatcha tryin' to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you"

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shakin' like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, mean, big and bad, Lord
Pointin' that gun at me
"Oh, wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble wit' chu
And I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you"

"Won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
For sure
Well, the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you son, well it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door

"Won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
Show me the back door
I've come home
I've been away too long
But you don't want me back again
And I tried, in the end
I can't say you made me very sad
The point of love is not to lie
Points denied, in the end, in the end
How can you tell me you don't want me
When I've done all I can to save the day
Suppose I'm in the way
In the end, in the end, in the end
You don't see sense, eyes never cry
Please take part of me, leave the rest to die
I can't say you made me very sad
The point of love is not to lie
Point's denied, in the end, in the end
How can you tell me you don't want me
When I've done all I can to save the day
Suppose I'm in the way
In the end, in the end
How can you tell me you don't want me
When I've done all I can to save the day
Suppose I'm in the way
In the end, in the end, in the end
When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
Is the golden sky
And the sweet silver song of the lark
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

[Verse 1]
Incredible
From your legs up to your mouth, you look so edible
Don't have to speak your spirit, it's just legible
And when you lick your lips, I swear girl I go medical
Let the mystery unfold

[Chorus]
What the deal, mami?
Can we make a deal?
Let me show you, mami
That my love is for real
Got the goods baby
Make you wanna reveal your heart
So can we deal mommy
'Cos I got what you need
Girl, I want you do close to me
Girl, I promise we will never be apart

[Verse 2]
Paradise
Tonight I'll take you there
Lay back and close your eyes
I'll make this lovin' hurt so good
But you won't want to cry
So let me put my love inside you
And make you tremble, ever so
Gently baby, don't let go

[Chorus]
What the deal, mami?
Can we make a deal?
Let me show you, mami
That my love is for real
Got the goods baby
Make you wanna reveal your heart
So can we deal mommy
'Cos I got what you need
Girl, I want you do close to me
Girl, I promise we will never be apart

[Bridge]
Why don't you open up your heart and let me in
And I'll tell you what the end is before we begin
I'll be swimming in an ocean filled essence of you
Your world's surrounding me
Your love is drowning me
I can see my future when I look in your eyes
Loving you forever we will always be together
That's the real mommy
What do you feel mommy?
What's the deal mommy?
I wanna make you reveal your heart

[Chorus]
What the deal, mami?
Can we make a deal?
Let me show you, mami
That my love is for real
Got the goods baby
Make you wanna reveal your heart
So can we deal mommy?
'Cos I got what you need
Girl, I want you real close to me
Girl, I promise we will never be apart
What the deal, mami?
Can we make a deal?
Let me show you, mami
That my love is for real
Got the goods baby
Make you wanna reveal your heart
So can we deal mommy?
'Cos I got what you need
Girl, I want you real close to me
Girl, I promise we will never be apart

[Outro]
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la
What the deal, mami?
Can we make a deal?
Let me show you, mami
That my love is for real
Got the goods baby
Make you wanna reveal your heart
So can we deal mommy?
'Cos I got what you need
Girl, I want you real close to me
Girl, I promise we will never be apart

Just when U thought it was safe 2 go outside
I hit your ass with another funky design
And it's real good
U thought it wasn't when U shoulda
Checked yourself before U got another foot in your ass
And now it comes 2 pass another phat shot from the higher class
That's right, U're still a rookie, see
Kickin' it with the grown folks in the wrong key
Honey please, U need 2 find
Somebody that'll hip U 2 the funky design

CHORUS:
The funky design
The funky design
The funky design

Shouts out 2 the rookies, put it in the bank
And let it gain a cent or 2 until it just stanks
And flows, your nose will know
When it's all wrinkled, then it's good 2 go
On the fire, I would be a liar
If I didn't say I wanna take U higher
And hip U 2 the one-eyed bass
Listen 2 the solo while it pleads my case
Honey please, U need 2 find
Somebody that'll hip U 2 the funky design

CHORUS

And just when U thought it was over, it started up again
Kickin' so loud that it's sure 2 frighten and win
U try 2 run 4 cover
The girl that U're with wanna be my lover
And the DJ instead of kickin' a favorite tune
Scratches on the record that reverberates the room
Like a train crash, U better save yo' ass
The funky design is back and it's bad
Housequake, oh no, I'll kill
Any rookie dumb enough 2 let that nigga spill
Out any speaker, see?
I'm the motherfucker now and if U please
U need 2 need 2 need 2 find
Somebody that'll hip U 2 the funky design

CHORUS {repeat to fade}

[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

[Bridge]
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town

[Verse 1]
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

[Verse 1]
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
It's a blue world without you, it's a blue world alone
My days and nights that once were filled with heaven
With you away, how empty they have grown
It's a blue world from now on, it's a through world for me
The sea, the sky, my heart and I, we're all an indigo hue
Without you, it's a blue, blue world

[Verse]
Sorry if I don't have faith in you
And all the boys you have living with your cultured ways
Sorry if I don't have faith in you
Seems like you had a fail in love
Now the love is gonna let you go
I'm not sure if I'd go there
I don't believe in free love
Tell me have you heard the story
That took place not long ago
Bout an angel up in heaven
They say she up and ran away from home

Word is she had unfinished business
So back on earth she had to flee
Well you know I'm so elated
Because she's laying right here next to me

And when God woke up that morning
And he called out her name
And when she did not answer
Heaven will never ever ever be
Heaven will never be the same

[Background Vocal:] Heaven will never be the same 

[2x]

Always dreamed that it would happen
I just didn't know exactly where
All my life I'd been waiting for something amazing
Said it took a while but now I know
So tell me can I get a witness
If you believe in miracles
And the proof I have is living
And my life will never ever be
And your life don't to be the...
At times it seems we take for granted
How precious life can be
Just hold on and I'm sure you'll understand it
Bringing into this world
A precious boy or a girl...And when God woke up that morning
Said where has my little angel gone
And when she didn't an...answer
Heaven will never ever ever be
Heaven will never be the....same
Yeah....Yeah
Well, things have been goin' wrong
Long enough to know that everything is just right
I've been walkin' in the dark
Long enough to know when I've finally seen the light
I've been losin' long enough
To know when I've finally have won
And even a blind man can tell
When he's walkin' in the sun
Well, I've cried enough tears
To recognize this feeling called a smile
I've been bottom rung long enough
To know when I'm doin' it in style
I've been runnin' so long enough
To know when there's no more need to run
And even a blind man can tell
When he's walkin' in the sun
Oh, the wind is at my back
And I'm sailin' on a ship that's overdue
I've blown so many chances
That I ain't gonna blow this one with you
And I've seen enough bad times
To know when the good times have begun
And even a blind man can tell
When he's walkin' in the sun
And even a blind man can tell
When he's walkin' in the sun
And even a blind man can tell
When he's walkin' in the sun
And even a blind man can tell
When he's walkin' in the sun

[Intro: Paul Williams]
Oh, mother

[Verse 1: Paul Williams]
Oh mother of mine, I've, I've been blind
The things that you tell me, yeah, I paid, I really paid it no mind
Oh please, oh please forgive me, yes, I know I was wrong
But now, now I know, yeah, my place, my place is at home

[Pre-Chorus: Paul Williams]
Can't you see I've been crying now (Oh yes, he's been crying)
Almost dying (Uh-huh, almost dying)
I need your advice, mama, yeah (He needs your advice)

[Chorus: Paul Williams]
(He needs your advice)
Oh, mama (Please, Mother)
Oh, mama (Please, Mother)
Oh, mama (Please, Mother)
Come on and tell me, now

[Bridge: Eddie Kendricks]
How much about love, you don't understand?
Yes, you knew that you were wrong
Oh, when you thought you were wrong
Yes, it was that young girl
She put you in such a whirl

[Verse 2: Paul Williams]
Yeah, I said, mama, don't you worry now, yeah
I guess I had it coming anyhow, yes I did
I'm gonna do everything you say
Hmmm, each and every day

[Pre-Chorus: Paul Williams]
I'm gonna be a man, yes, I am (Oh yes, he's gonna be a man)
Now that I understand (Now that he understands)
Ooh, I'm not gonna be no fool no more (He's not fool no more)
Yeah because you told me so (Like, like he was before)

[Chorus: Paul Williams]
Whoa, mama (Please, Mother)
Oh, mother (Please, Mother)
Oh, mother (Please, Mother)
Come and tell me now

[Outro: Paul Williams]
(Mother, he's gonna be alright) Oh, tell me now
(Mother, he's gonna be alright) Hmm, I'm sorry
(Mother, he's gonna be alright) Yes, I am, I'm really sorry
(Mother, he's gonna be alright) Oh, I should have taken heed, yeah
(Mother, he's gonna be alright) Yes I should have heed because you know what to say
(Mother, he's gonna be alright) Woah oh
