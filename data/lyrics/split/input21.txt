I'm gon' get it, gon' get it
My trigger finger itchin', my trigger finger itchin'
My trigger finger itchin', my trigger finger itchin'
My trigger finger itching, nigga

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
You ain't gon hurt nobody like Kid 'n Play
Ain't nothin' sweet but the codeine, nigga
Eyes hella red like chlorine in 'em
I was gettin' that pussy, I was gettin' that money
Long hair, don't care, Hacksaw Jim Duggan
Too high to take a breath, too high to take a step
Two rights don't make a wrong, three rights make a left
The cops on my dick, the feds on my nerves
I walk it like I talk it, got legs on my words
If she don't suck dick I don't give her that dick
Got the world in my hands, I'mma dribble that bitch
Money is the issue, full court pressure
I like my blunt Nutty Professor
I'm a straight rider with a getaway driver
Hit you dead on the money, now you dead on arrival
I don't fuck with these niggas, too old for new friends
But never too rich for new money
These niggas buying Haterade by the twelve pack
Like two stomachs
I'm laced up like two shoes, Miss Goody
Keep that ratchet, nigga
Trigger finger itchin', I'll scratch it, nigga
Blow your fuckin' brains out in traffic, nigga
Got green, New Orleans, St. Patrick, nigga
One bitch in the whip, one on the phone
The one on the phone is in front of your home
She 'bout to run in your home and put —

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
One in ya dome, one in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome
Empty stomach, full clip
I'm gon' get it, gon' get it
Empty stomach, full clip
I'm gon' get it, gon' get it
My trigger finger itchin', my trigger finger itchin'
My trigger finger itchin', my trigger finger itchin'
My trigger finger itchin'
Nigga

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
Rest in peace to the game 'cause I'm fresh to death
Rest in peace to the game, tell them kill they self
Make your death wish, 'cause I'm too fresh
'Cause I'm fresh to death, 'cause I'm fresh to death
You go broke tryna get fresh like this
Rest in peace to the game 'cause I killed it
I'm fresh to death, I'm fresh to death
What you talkin', I came out a coffin
Yeah

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I just can't see myself
Living in a house of mirrors
I bought me a double-R
'Cause I went from rags to riches
And these niggas nag like bitches
Actin' like little fags like Richard
And all of my bitches be bad as vision
You got a problem
I can fix it like a mathematician
I am-munition
Call me ammo for short
Trukfit shirt, camo the shorts
Your girl is a freak, your man is a narc
With your son in your arms
I'll put —
One in your dome
Tunechi

[Chorus: Jamie Lidell]
Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you
And I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you, back-back

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She had cat eyes, nine lives, no tan lines, thigh highs
She ride me like a drive-by, I'm real, these niggas sci-fi
But that's neither here nor there, she been contemplatin' short hair
She said she tryna be different but she just like the rest of these bitches
But that's neither here nor there, and my dick is her chair
It be sexual warfare, I be loaded like software
Got so many hoes I'm hoein', but she the only one worth knowin'
And yeah, I do my dirt, but that's for the flowers to grow in
I ain't tripping, but she be tripping
They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffing
Look, girl, just gimme that brain, and I'll return the favor
Them hoes say I'm a dog, but how come I don't chase 'em?
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up
I just wanted some time, she say, "Okay, I'm your honor"
But she been wanting to break up since Dolce and Gabbana
All that ass, I just be like, "Come sit your groceries on my counter"
I drink tea, she drink wine, call it Tijuana
I'm dying to meet her girl, but she want me to meet her momma
Swear I may go Issey Miyake, Bond no. 9
The weed is funky, but I'm smelling fine
Tunechi

[Chorus: Jamie Lidell & Lil Wayne]
Now, I know (Woah!) the only compass that I need (I'm putting my hat back on)
Oh, is the one that leads back to you (She said)
Now, I know the only compass that I need (Yeah)
Oh, is the one that leads back to you

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I got that shit in my system, somebody gon' be my victim
Eh, so where you at with it? 'Cause I can't do it by myself, I need a ass-sistant
I got that good-good, that get right, that early morning, that midnight
I beat it up like a fist fight: one, two, three, four, five, 6-9
That dick all in your windpipe, some of her friends I dislike
Some of your friends, they alright, sometimes I think y'all all dykes
But fuck all that, I'm on one, don't wanna be with the wrong one
That cold head, that warm tongue, my third leg run marathons
I feel you like I'm blind, girl, can't you see? It's meant to be
So come to me, then come for me, my game cold, one degree
I'm rolling with two bad bitches 'cause misery loves company
One sweet, one sour, my honeybee and my bumblebee
I miss you in the worst way, ride that dick no speed bumps
No red lights, no stop signs, just get to Lil Tunechi

[Chorus: Jamie Lidell & Lil Wayne]
Now, I know (Woah!) the only compass that I need (I'm putting my glasses back on)
Oh, is the one (Yeah!) that leads back to you (She said)
Now, I know (Now, I know) the only compass that I need (Get to me baby)
Oh, is the one (You need to get to me, baby) that leads back to you
(I'm waitin', yeah)

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Uh, should I call somebody else?
'Cause girl, it's almost 12 and this dick won't suck itself
Girl, you know it need some help, it'd make a nigga's day
If you said you on your way, ayy, ayy
Should I call somebody else?
'Cause girl, it's almost 12 and this dick won't suck itself
Girl, you know it need some help, it'd make a nigga's day
I just hope you know the way
And she said

[Chorus: Jamie Lidell & Lil Wayne]
Now, I know (Woah!) the only compass that I need (I'm putting you back on)
Oh, is the one (That's right) that leads back to you (And she said)
Now, I know the only compass that I need (Get to me baby)
Oh, is the one (You need) that leads back to you (To get to me)
That leads back to you
(But you already got to me)

Been locked up in the house way too long

And my girls are so real
Said it’s been a minute since I had some
He’s been acting up
But he won’t be the only one

Soon as he saw me
Turned on by how the dress was fittin' right

See my silhouette in the moonlight
Such an attraction
Keep tellin' me how my outfit’s so nice
Little did he know
Ha, my man gon' take it off tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when he acts up, that’s when you put it on
Get him uptight, this is your song

All the ladies, you ain't get all dressed up
In your dresses and your best digs with no reason
Get ready to freakum, freakum

[Bridge]
When you put it on, it’s an invitation
When they play your song, get on up and shake it (Yeah)
Work it out your back, you don’t have to waste it
Spin it all around then take it to the ground and
When you put it on, it’s an invitation (Hey)
When they play your song, get on up and shake it (Hey)
Work it out your back, you don’t have to waste it (Hey)
Spin it all around then take it to the ground

Every now and then you gotta go in the back of that closet
And pull out that freakum dress, oh

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Cut the music up

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
YMCMB, bitches call me "Tunechi Li"
I be with niggas that shoot police
I keep that iron, you can get creased
And if she say she didn't fuck—bitch, you're lying through your teeth
They say, "It cost to be the boss"
The ones in jail wish they were free
Niggas call me "Hi-C" because I'm high, as you can see
Niggas say they paid they dues; well, I'm checking your receipt
Might as well go stupid since this is a stupid beat
Grab the owl out the tree, and ask that bitch, "Who but me?"
Got your bitch bent over, nigga—hands to her feet
Tell that pig and that cow I'll go ham if it's beef
'Cause all my niggas well rounded
Don't fuck with none of these square niggas
Mask on, Ghostface Killah, draw down and erase niggas
I'm a Blood, is you a blood donor? Swisher full of that California
I hit it sideways: caddy-corner
Then she catch that nut like pneumonia—Lil Tunechi!

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Lay it down, ho (Haha), lay it down, bitch
Lay it down, ho, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down
Put the money on the couch, nigga
Give me everything up in your house, nigga, shut your mouth, nigga
Put the money on the couch nigga
Give me everything up in your house, nigga, shut your mouth, nigga (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
Start it up: vroom, vroom
Uppercut a bitch out the bus: boom, boom
Unless I get the brain: pum-pum
She let a nigga run and get the gang, run a train: zoom-zoom
Tryna get paid too soon, one deep
One sweep away in a room-room
We getting money over here, talking shit and fucking bitches
I don't know what the fuck they doing, Tune
My syrup purple, my turf Earth, my birth circle, I'll dirt surf you
I squirt-murk you, my verse hurtful
My shooters still got curb curfews
Y'all bout as hot as Von Dutch, y'all not gone harm much
Hijack y'all some prom bus; ain't no retreat but my arms up
No graffiti, my bombs up
It's Young Money in this shit until a nigga dead and gone
If you wanna set it off, what you wanna bet it on?
I'm betting the wedding's off when e'erything wetted on
Point 'em out, Truk your life, fuck your style
Fuck with me, you a bucket foul
Niggas'll buck your smile for a dunking pile
You better duck it, pal

[Hook: Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Lay it down ho (Yeah), lay it down bitch (And I smoke)
Lay it down ho, lay it down (Lil Tunechi)
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down... (Hahaha, mhm)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Shawty, what's your name? Is you trickin'? Is you paying?
Is you sniffin' on that 'caine? What the fuck, is you saying?
If you getting it, then you getting it
It's my money, I ain't splitting it
I ain't tripping it, if she got a fat ass, then I'm tipping it (Tipping it)
Came out the bank—Bye, teller!" Give a bum money—"Hi, fella!"
Bad lil' ho, high-yellow, brand new Rolie, Sky Dweller
Just left from Dubai, flew private-eye
I made a million dollars, swear to God, that ain't no lie
I said, them niggas was popping, fake niggas be watching
My black glove be dripping wet, but I got my Cochran
Losing ain't no option, I'm teaching bitches my doctrine
The Maybach ain't poppin, if it ain't got no par-tah-tion
Oops, I mean "partition"; it's all a part of my vision
I sit and count this money while I watch you bitches audition
I said, "Oops, I mean 'partition,; it's all a part of my vision
I sit and count this money while I watch you bitches audition," hehehe

[Outro: Nicki Minaj, w/ Lil Wayne]
Fuck wrong with you bitches?
I don’t give a fuck
You don’t hear me, you don’t see me—bitch, you gon' feel me, ho
Young Money, Young, Young Money nigga
Young, Young—lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down, aah!

[Part I: Sexy Ladies]

[Intro: Timbaland]
C'mon

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I can tell you want it good, girl
You ain't gotta worry no more
You keep my bottles cold and you pop 'em
As soon as I walk in the door
These dudes don't know me from Adam and Eve
That's why they can't mess up my flow
And when this beat drops, your heart stops
You feel it from your head to your toes

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
If you know what I'm talking 'bout (Hey)
Let me see you work it out (Hey, girl)
Girl, that's what I'm talking 'bout (Come on, Justin, talk to 'em)

I got sexy ladies all over the floor

Now I'm back with one of my latest, just lettin' you know
That I got sexy ladies, so back up some more
And let me take it off

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
I know a little girly from uptown
Just waiting just to cater to me
I know a little betty from downtown
That'll do anything that I please
All my other people that dance 'round
When they hear me rockin' the groove
Now it might sound cocky
But is it really cocky if you know that it's true?

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
If you know what I'm talking 'bout (Hey, girl)
Let me see you work it out (Hey, girl)
Girl, that's what I'm talking 'bout (Come on, Justin, talk to 'em)

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talkin' to one of the greatest who did it before

Hey! Uh

She's freaky and I like it
Listen

[Verse 1]
She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight
And she looks like a model
Except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
Ooh, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight
Hey!

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh

[Post-Chorus]
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it
Yeah

[Verse 2]
She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
Well, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight, oh
And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight, oh
Hey!

[Chorus]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare (Cause a glare)
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare (I had to stop and stare)
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows

You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)
'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

[Bridge]
The summer's over for the both of us (Summer's over)
But that doesn't mean we should give up on love (Don't give up)
You're the one that I've been thinking of (You're the one)
And I knew the day I met you, you'd be the one, oh!

[Chorus]
I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)
'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I saw you last night (Freak, freak)
In the powder room

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]

You're out of sight

Hey, yo, JT, let me holler at baby real quick

Head, shoulders, feet and toes
Work that body, go on and pose
Please the crowd, easy now
Go ahead, baby girl, "Cheese" and smile
She said, "Mister, Mister
Would it be cool if I took a picture?" (Picture)
To hang it on the wall with the rest of the best
I had her back in an hour or less
He say, she say, we say play
Doggy Dogg, take it easy
It's time to expose, I'll break off the rolls
Now take off your clothes (Do it)
Get real close up under the light
And do that thing, show you're right
Now close the doors
Now you can really give it to me, go on, strike that pose

[Verse 4: Justin Timberlake]
I saw you last night (Hey, girl)
At the café
But you wasn't with your girlfriends, your girlfriends
So I stepped up to ya (Hey, girl)
I pursued ya 'cause I couldn't stand to wait
Let's date (Yeah),  that'd be great

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Wait! Stop and picture
Baby, stop and picture
Baby, stop and picture

You're outta sight
Wait! Stop and picture

You've been looking all night for your shining star
Well, baby, here I am, so why you waitin'?
Step on over, let me show you how bad you are

[Pre-Chorus]
Just let me take the lead
All you gotta do is let your mind be free
Let's hit the floor and cause a scene
Get real wet if you know what I mean
What you say, baby?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
(And she said) Take me now
I'm hungry for your lovin'

You got me working, honey

So take me now
Boy, you make me feel like I gotta dance
(I gotta dance, gotta dance baby, I gotta dance...)

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
I feel good to you, you try to hide it
And I can tell by the way you push up close to me
Your body temperature is arisin'
Something's goin' down as far as I can see

[Pre-Chorus]
Just let me take the lead
All you gotta do is let your mind be free
Let's hit the floor and cause a scene
Get real wet if you know what I mean
What you say, baby?

[Intro/Outro]
I always do you favors, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
I fucked you on your job, and that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
And I don't give a fuck, but I got to, I got to yeah yeah
They say the best part of waking up is breakfast after a nut
And that's romance, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
We fuck and crash that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
Ok

[Verse 1]
Fuck my hand, suck my thumb
Be a lady and buy me lunch
Send me cards, make me read
But don't send me no flowers unless it's weed
Cause I'm that nigga, she say Im that nigga
She ain't got a man but act like I'm that nigga
She check my phone, what's that 'bout?
Any other ho I would've cursed her ass out
But that's romance, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
She kiss my ankle when I twisted my ankle
She even did anal when she don't do anal
My bitch, I'm thankful, let's hold hands (Can we?)
Let's slow dance (shall we?)
And we gon be like 1, 2, 1, 2
She said Im the one, girl you the one too
I stand up in that pussy like a sunroof
Yeah

[Hook]
I always do you favors, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
I fucked you on your job, and that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
And I don't give a fuck, but I got to, I got to yeah yeah
They say the best part of waking up is breakfast after a nut

[Verse 2]
Ok, now give me coochie at my mama's crib
On Thanksgiving everybody's listening
All your home girl's bad and they're our guest
Let'em all in and I'll play chef
That's romance cause we so real
She said she cannot take the pain, if it ain't a pill
She said fuck these hoes, they just mad

If you got cups then I got dranks

And I don't give a fuck but baby I got to, I got to yeah yeah
They say the best part of waking up is breakfast after a nut

[Intro/Outro]

[Verse 1]
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Bridge]
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
"When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place"

[Chorus]
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me
Mmmm

[Outro]
He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"

[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn

[Verse 1]
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Verse 2]
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's OK

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Outro]
Oh I'm just a girl
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh I'm just a girl

[Verse 1]
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

[Chorus]
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

[Verse 2]
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

[Chorus]
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

[Bridge]
You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you
(Died for you)

[Chorus]
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

[Verse 1]
I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

[Chorus]
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

[Verse 2]
You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late, so you see

[Pre-Chorus]
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything

[Chorus]
How can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
How can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

[Outro]
Oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true
'Cause I know you

[Chorus]
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh

[Verse 2]
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket (Pocket)
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

[Chorus]
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh

[Outro]
You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh, oh-oh
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby
Oh

[Verse 1]
Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

[Verse 2]
Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, "Hey, by the way"

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

[Bridge]
If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

[Outro]
La-la-la
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful, stay beautiful
Na-na-na, na-na

[Verse 1]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No, no
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 1]
She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh, my, my, my"

[Chorus]
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my

[Verse 2]
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh, my, my, my"

[Chorus]
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
2 a.m. riding in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my

[Bridge]
A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

[Chorus]
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said, "I do," and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

[Outro]
I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh, my, my, my

[Verse 1]
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song"
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Askin' God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Askin' God if he could play it again

[Post-Chorus]
Da-da-da-da

[Bridge]
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Askin' God if he could play it again

[Post-Chorus]
Play it again, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

[Outro]
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

[Verse 1]
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

[Bridge]
When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
And only you can tell

[Chorus]
That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well I'm only me when I'm with you

[Outro]
With you
Uh-huh-huh, yeah

[Verse 1]
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

[Chorus]
And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

[Chorus]
And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

[Bridge]
Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we're invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize

[Chorus]
I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you, let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah

[Outro]
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile

[Chorus]
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?

[Verse]
Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say, I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but

[Chorus]
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?

[Bridge]
It's not unbroken anymore (It's not unbroken anymore)
How do I get it back the way it was before?

[Chorus]
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break—
(Why) Would you wanna break it?

[Chorus]
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm-hmm

[gunshot]
(What the fuck was that?)

[Verse 1]
Uh, my mind's filled with mine fields
The ashes fall, the wine spills
The world stops, drops and rolls
It's Judgment Day or a fire drill
Yeah, I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain't never lyin', yeahh
My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of kill em all and let 'em die

[Chorus]
God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
The end of time is like a hour away

[Verse 2]
Damn, military minded, lost and can't find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
'Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I'ma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I'm wired out the socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there's food for thought then I'm guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want – I took heed, yeahh
Now let it breathe, yeah

[Verse 3]
Back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she's so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what's appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain't that a bitch? I'm just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshener
I don't play, boy, I ain't Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It's a cold world, I put on a mink
There's a chain of command, I'm the missing link

[Chorus]
God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
And I'm smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet

[Outro]
Here we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I'ma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I'm wired out the socket, but still shockin'
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?

[Hook]
Fuck with me wrong, take me out my zone

Bring that ruckus up in here, throwin' bottles, chuckin' chairs
Got the pretty models duckin', breakin' heels and chippin' nails
Turn around and go right back to breakin' down my cigarillo
Climbin' up a Suga Hill, slidin' down in somethin' new
Spilling Gin and jungle juice, and I got that lumber too
And I brought a fuckin' zoo, tear this shit up and chuck a deuce
This triple C, they Triple L, lames love to lose
A hundred million in my horoscope, 'bout to show you a horror show
Boot you fuckin' head off your collar bone

Pussy niggas ain't eatin', but we fry the farm
Beat a nigga down 'til he left without a vital sign

Got a pocket full of ass-whoopings, I'm givin' 'em out like nicknames
What's up with your fist game? You'll catch a hook, fish hang
Watch me cock the Nina, call that rough sex
Knock your head off, you just a rough neck

I'm high as Heaven, I'll pop the reverend and stop the wedding
Got more money than memories in the bank, don't forget it
Clean em up my team is up, I'm high as Scotty, beam me up
They say we all gotta pay the price, fuck it, man, ring me up
Fuckin' right I skate, ho, pussy is my scapegoat
And all these pussy-ass niggas that's hatin', kiss my ass, besos

I'll be dead before I be dead broke
Still burn money, my bread toast
Fuck it, if you got it, spend it, nigga
But just keep your two pennies, nigga

Don't open your mouth, I'm a dentist, nigga

Soulja Boy on the beat

My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh, bitch!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Lay on the bed, open that twat
I French kiss that pussy, like muah
Sit on my face, M-U-A-H
Before I eat that pussy, I say my grace
Girl I'm nastier than him, I don't know why you still with him
Beat that pussy, go to sleep, she got that Tylenol P.M
Fuck that bitch until she tired, 'til she tired like a rim
Give her head like a brim, it tastes good, M-M-M
Pussy monster in her closet, full of surprises
I give full body massages, I hope that pussy smell like a violet
I hope that pussy warmer than luke and sweet as Godiva
Suck this dick and swallow that nut and call it Penis colada
Lift up that mini-skirt, that's my dinner desert
She fell in love with the Martian, I said you too down to Earth
Man, these hoes love Wayne, got a bunch of dimes, that's chump change
This shit is target practice and your bitch is my gun range

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh
My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh, bitch!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
Down here waiting for her to come like payday
Hoping this juice is sweeter than baked cake
She say it's for Tunechi, she lie with a straight face
But I'm trying to eat healthier, so I ate a veggie
Sucked on that pussy, I feel better already
She say "Tunechi go slower" and Tunechi went faster
My tongue is a motor, my dick is a NASCAR
Whipped cream on that pussy, dickhead like a bullet
If her hair real I'mma pull it, hope that ass feel like a cushion
I give her wood when he wouldn't? I hope that pussy tastes like pudding
And I get that ho the boot, hold up, let me put my foot in (Tunechi)
Got a sweet tooth, candy yam pussy
I'mma leave that ass smoking like a Amsterdam tourist man
These hoes love Wayne, got a bunch of dimes, that's chump change
This shit is target practice and your bitch is my gun range

[Hook:]
My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh
My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh, bitch!

[Verse 3: Trina]
Lay on that bed, open your mouth
This pussy so clean like soap in your mouth
I do my lil' dance, he scoping me out
If that dick like a tree watch me build a treehouse
Ok, the baddest bitch in this bitch, got the fattest clique in this bitch
You might drown, you better start doggy paddling in this bitch
I'm Trin, B nigga? Queen nigga, sleep in this pussy, dream nigga
I stay on that dick like a fucking balance beam nigga
Hair pull, neck grab, don't fuck with hoes that backstab
Don't fuck with niggas that ain't got shit, if I fucked a nigga then that's my dick
My mouth a jacuzzi, my pussy a safe place
Fuck me 'til daybreak, then you can go skate, Trina

[Verse 1]
I know that things are broken
And though there's too many words left unsaid
You say that you have spoken
Like the coward I am, I hang my head

You lie careless your head on my chest
Don't even look at me looking my best
And all these things I can't describe
You would rather I didn't try

[Chorus]
But please don't cry, you liar
Oh please, don't cry, you liar

Oh please, don't cry, you liar
Oh please, don't cry, you liar
Oh please, don't cry, you liar

[Verse 2]
And you lean in for your last kiss
Who in this world could ask me to resist?
Your hands cold as they find my neck
Oh this love that I've find, I detest

[Intro: Pitbull]
To these rappers, I apologize, I know it ain't fair
Only ball I drop, New Year's, Times Square
The world is mine, sixth sense, I see the seven signs
Now baby, let's get started for life

Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day
Now that's worldwide, if you think it's a game, let's play, dale

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I am what they thought I'd never become
I believed and became it
Now I'm here to claim it
I hustle anything, you name it, name it
I went from eviction to food stamps
To baggin' work, wet and damp
To a passport, flooded with stamps
Now it's Voli everywhere I land
Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day
Now that's worldwide, if you think it's a game, let's play, dale

[Bridge: Shakira & Pitbull]
'Cause if it feels right (You know it feels right)
We shouldn't waste any more time
Let's get it started (Let's get it started)
Don't think about it (Let's get it started)
You know I'm gonna make it alright, alright (Let's go)
'Cause if it feels right (You know it feels right)
You know I've made up my mind
Let's get it started (Let's get it started)
Don't think about it (Let's get it started)
I know that we can make it alright, alright

[Chorus: Shakira & Pitbull]
Every time I look into your eyes
I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime
We can get started for life (Tonight)
For life  (Tonight) for life (Tonight)
We can get started for life (Tonight)
For life (Tonight) for life (Tonight)
We can get started
Don't start what you can't finish

[Intro]
I know I vowed to never do this again, but, uh
I guess this seems to be the only thing I'm good at
Got something that you need to know
Be the realest shit I never wrote
Can't hold it, gotta let it go
Know that I mean every note
Yeah, yeah, listen baby

[Verse 1]
Let me start by saying that the way I feel for you has never once changed
And the games I played, mistakes I made leave me sorrier than you'll ever know
We got a problem, baby, I can't lie
'Cause lately, I realize that I
Never knew that we was on the same (playing field)
Knew that it was wrong, but we (let it be)
And I know you never knew when you said I do
That you would have to face all the (pain you feel)

[Chorus]
And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

[Verse 2]
Trade memories for moments, trade love to be lonely
Guess that's just the man in me, blame it on celebrity
When the night time feel like the right time
And that spotlight feel like the right light
When it's really just my fears and I still don't dry your tears
When I say, "She ain't you and I really love you more"
And you say, "If it's true, why you do it for?"
And I, I really don't have no excuse
I break your heart, make you cry, I just wanna say goodbye

[Chorus]
And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

[Bridge]
What I feel, I don't even gotta write it
It's like poison in my body and there's no way to deny
That my heart is a time bomb with seconds left to explode
But I gotta let you know before it blows
That it ain't on you, it's my fault
All the gossip and talk, behind your back when you walk
By the time you will know, before long you will see
That you deserve more, you deserve more
You deserve so much more than what I'm offering

[Chorus]
And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

[Outro]
Live with this
Can you live with this, girl?
I just want you know
Got something that you need to know
This be the realest shit I never wrote, uh
Can't hold it, gotta let it go
Know that I mean every note, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, umm umm

[Intro repeated throughout]
I gotta be above it
Gotta be above it
Gotta be above it
Gotta be above it

[Verse]
And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I know that I can't let them bring me down
And I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
I know that I gotta be above it now
And I can't let them all just bring me down

[Chorus]
This time I'm just gonna take it
Or I'm never gonna shake it
I'll just close my eyes and make it so that
All those little things don't affect me, now

[Bridge]
Know that I gotta be above it now
And I can't let them all just bring me down

[Chorus]
This time I'm just gonna take it
Or I'm never gonna shake it
I'll just close my eyes and make it so that
All these little things don't affect me now

[Intro: Nicki Minaj, Gravy & Babyface]
(Yeah, yeah! Sunshine!)
(Miss Nicki Minaj, my man Gravy)
(Dirty Money shit, let's go!)
Sunshine
Yeah
Uh, uh, uh
Yeah
Go!

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo! Yo yo yo yo, hold the do'
Let me get up on the float like Mardi Gras
Every-every time I rhyme, I sun the shine
Little mama, you a bird, like you done some time
Every-every time I spit, I massacre
So they better move quick, like Nascar
Everybody want a dime, I'm-I'm the best
When I get up in the club, I grind the best
You don't know, you better respect me 

[?]
I wouldn't try it if it discredits Nicki 

[?]
I am the one, like Tracy McGrady
Now little daddy let me, let me upgrade ya
Come on, I make it hot, see, I'm a hot one
I keep the stack & let Max play the shotgun (yes, sir)
I'm in the good car, always with a hood star
Introducing Mr. & Mrs. Good Bar

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
Get up on my level niggas, get it up
Gettin' Dirty Money figures, throw it up
Get up on my level bitches, get it up
Drink some Dirty Money bitches, get a cup
Get up on my level niggas, get it up
Gettin' Dirty Money figures, throw it up
Get up on my level bitches, get it up
Drink some Dirty Money bitches, get a cup

[Verse 2: Gravy]
It's frego daddy Gravy, of course
God Willing coming soon, I'm the good of New York
I shine like VVS stones in the dark
Take a seat when you hear me, like Rosa Parks
Fuck the chit chat
Let's talk guns & drugs, you with that?
Tryin' to see a mill or two, fuck who I'm better than
Rollin' up on a dutch, you know I need my medicine
It's high noon & I'm the nigga that shot the sheriff
Me and Nicki's like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't be embarrassed
I'm sort of like a rabbit the way I love my cabbage
But I still watch for 5-0 like I'm Garret
'08 Challenger lookin' like Dukes of Hazzard
Turn it into a coupe, and now the roof's gone
Word to Nicki Minaj with daisy dukes on
See it's Max-a-millie-on, chumps, so move on
Before I act like a Autobot and transform
Too hot and I ain't Mims
I flip bricks while you little clown still buyin' rims
Who's in charge? Stop frontin' like I ain't him
I'm Saks Fifth Ave, you still shop at Fims
Superstar with the Audemar and a pair of Timbs
Who your wives screwing? Flossin', I been doin'
Fuckers

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
Get up on my level niggas, get it up
Gettin' Dirty Money figures, throw it up
Get up on my level bitches, get it up
Drink some Dirty Money bitches, get a cup
Get up on my level niggas, get it up
Gettin' Dirty Money figures, throw it up
Get up on my level bitches, get it up
Drink some Dirty Money bitches, get a cup

[Chorus]
It was acceptable in the '80s
It was acceptable at the time
It was acceptable in the '80s
It was acceptable at the time

[Verse 1]
I got love for you
If you were born in the '80s, the '80s
I've got hugs for you
If you were born in the '80s, the '80s
I'll do things for you
If you were born in the '80s, the '80s
I've got hugs for you
If you were born in the '80s

It was acceptable in the '80s
It was acceptable at the time
It was acceptable in the '80s
It was acceptable at the time

[Verse 2]
I got love for you
If you were born in the '80s, the '80s
I've got hugs for you
If you were born in the '80s, the '80s
I'll do things for you
If you were born in the '80s, the '80s
I've got hugs for you
If you were born in the '80s
Yeah

[Chorus]
It was acceptable in the '80s
It was acceptable at the time
It was acceptable in the '80s
It was acceptable at the time

[Intro]
You remind me of something
I just can't think of what it is

[Verse 1]
Girl, please-
Let me stick my key in your ignition, babe
So I can get this thing started and get rollin', babe
See I'll be doin' about 80 on your freeway
Girl, I won't stop until I drive you crazy
So buckle up cause this can get bumpy, babe
Now hit the lights and check out all my functions, babe
Girl, back that thing up so I can wax it, baby
Honey, we gon' mess around and get a ticket, babe

[Chorus]
Cause
We off up in this jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all up in the back
We got this shit bouncin'
We goin' up and down
We smokin' and we drinkin'
Just a'thuggin it out

[Verse 2]
Jump up, down once I hit them switches, babe
And I'm about to take it where you want to go, babe
Guarantee you I'm about to get some mileage, babe
And it won't be no runnin' out of gas, babe
It's like woo-ooh-ooh, pull over, babe
And let me put this lovin' off in your trunk, babe
So buckle up this could get bumpy, babe
Girl, we gon' mess around and get a ticket, babe

[Chorus]
Cause
We off up in this jeep
We foggin' up the windows

We all up in the back

We smokin' and we drinkin'
Just a'thuggin it out

[Verse 3]
Now hold on tight cause I'm about to go faster, babe
Girl, you dealing with a pro behind this wheel, babe
So tell me have you ever driven a stick, babe?
You'll be screamin' every time we shift them gears, babe
So brace yourself while I'm hittin' them corners, babe
When it's over put that Kells on your license plates
Now buckle up cause this can get bumpy, babe
Girl, we gon' mess around and get a ticket, babe

[Chorus]
Cause
We off up in this jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all up in the back
We got this shit bouncin'
We goin' up and down
We smokin' and we drinkin'
Just a'thuggin it out

[Bridge]
When I hear you say:
Green light... I'mma go
Yellow light... Do it slow
Red light... I'mma stop
When I hear you say:
Switch lanes... Hit the signal
Pit stop... Take a break
Hit the hazards when we park
Because we about to go real far

[Chorus]
Cause
We off up in this jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all up in the back
We got this shit bouncin'
We goin' up and down
We smokin' and we drinkin'
Just a'thuggin it out

[Outro]
Now let me see you
Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce
Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce

[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Outro]
And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly

[Verse 1]
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Verse 2]
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Bridge]
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar
And pathetic
And alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

[Refrain]
But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Verse 1]
I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met, and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter

[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Bridge]
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

[Outro]
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
The End

[Verse 1]
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

[Chorus]
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

[Verse 2]
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

[Chorus]
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

[Bridge]
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up
By the old Moulmein Pagoda
Looking eastward to the sea
There's a Burma broad a settin'
And I know she thinks for me

For the wind is in the palm trees
And the temple bells they say
Come you back, you British soldier
Come you back to Mandalay
Come you back to Mandalay

Come you back to Mandalay
Where the old flotilla lay
Can't you hear their paddles chonkin'
From Rangoon to Mandalay

On the road to Mandalay
Where the flyin' fishes play
And the dawn comes up like thunder
Out of China 'cross the bay
Ship me somewhere east of Suez
Where the best is like the worst
Where there ain't no Ten Commandments
And a cat can raise a thirst

'Cause those crazy bells are callin'
And it's there that I would be
By the old Moulmein Pagoda
Looking lazy at the sea
Looking lazy at the sea

Come you back to Mandalay
Where the old flotilla lay
Can't you hear their paddles chonkin'
From Rangoon to Mandalay

On the road to Mandalay
Where the flyin' fishes play
And the dawn comes up like thunder

[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

[Verse 2]
I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

[Chorus]
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 3]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

[Verse 4]
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

[Chorus]
And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh

[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

[Chorus]
So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

[Outro]
Just like our last

[Verse 1]
I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered"

[Verse 2]
I said, "Remember this feeling"
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines, wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd"
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid"
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered"

[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment?
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you

[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid"
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 1]
The early cars
Already are
Drawing deep breaths past my door
And last night's phrases
Sick with lack of basis
Are still writhing on my floor

[Hook 1]
And it doesn't seem fair
That your wicked words should work in holding me down
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information
Given at close range
For the gag and the bind
And the ammunition round

[Verse 2]
Conversation, once colored by esteem
Became dialogue
As a diagram of a play for blood
- Took a vacation; my palate got clean
Now I can taste your agenda
While you're spitting your cud

[Hook 2]
And it doesn't make sense
I should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information
Given at close range
For the gag and the bind
And the ammunition round

[Chorus]
This is not about love
Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
This is not about love
Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
I miss that stupid ache

[Verse 3]
"What is this posture I have to stare at"
- That's what he said
When I was sitting up straight
Changed the name of the game cause he lost it
He knew he was wrong
But he knew it too late
But I'm not being fair
Cause I chose to listen to that filthy mouth
But I'd like to choose right
Take all the things
That I said
That he stole
Put 'em in a sack
Swing 'em over my shoulder
Turn on my heels, step out of his sight
Try to live in a lovelier light

[Chorus]
This is not about love
Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
This is not about love
Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
I miss that stupid ache

Oh, oh, oh

Come in to my house
You're invited into my house
Entering the back of my house
Welcoming you into my house
Come in to my house

Would you just like to tell us
How you began creating disco

[Verse 1]
Well it was the mid 70's
I was a virtually unknown producer at the time
And I, I was conducting various sonic experiments
With the assistance of Mary, my wife

[Verse 2]
Anyway during one session I discovered that
By using a succession of techniques
I, I actually developed during the war
I could create an entirely new genre of music
And that was the night I created disco

[Chorus]
I created disco

[Intro]
Would you just like to tell us
How you began creating
Disco, disco, disco, disco, disco

[Verse 1]
Inside me, inside me is a flame
That burned brighter anytime you came
Gets in the way when I'm alone with you
But disappears if I'm with someone new

[Verse 2]
It learnt how to fit into my foreplay
With my skills our love was going okay
Until the night when we were on the phone
You're moving on what better

[Verse 1]
Inside me, inside me is a flame
That burned brighter anytime you came
Gets in the way when I'm alone with you
But disappears if I'm with someone new

[Verse 2]
It learnt how to fit into my foreplay
With my skills our love was going okay
Until the night when we were on the phone
You're moving on what better

[Verse]
Electro man, electronic man
Electro man, electronic woman
I've been outside wearing my device
I came back in wearing the same device, as you

[Intro:]
I don't wanna sound mad, though! I don't wanna sound mad!
I feel marvelous right now!
Dirty money!

[Verse:]
Tell that bitch with the crown to run it like Chris Brown
She won 3 rounds, I'mma need a hundred thou
Like china town, bitches better bow down
Oh, you ain't know? bet ya'll bitches know now
Fuck I gotta do to let 'em know that I'm the one?
Way I ride the drum they salute me in the slum
In the 6 hun the color of bubble gum
I'm with my nigga spits and my nigga, bun crum (waddup!)
Yes, I'm the one, I'm the motherfuckin' one (chyeah!)
Hold more weight than the late big pun (oh!)
Bitches talk slick, but they ain't say nun (no!)
Mad cause I'm bad, 2 sticks in my bun (chyeah!)
Yes, sir, look what i've done
They r-run, run when I come
Bum-stickity-bum, let me tell 'em where I'm from
Queens, little mama, gabbana, some nice pumps (chyeah!)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
T-raww, fuck y'all, money tall, dick large
Tiger in my backyard, bitches on my futon
Dog house, no dog, shootout, Chris Paul
Walking on the marble floor, take your fucking shoes off
Bitch this is fox fur, killing shit, fuck a hearse
I can show you my choppa works
She give me head, when my head hurt
Deep throat, till the bitch burp
Her best friend said let me at 'em-Cousin Lurch
Smoking on that turf, get your feelings hurt
At your neck like a collared shirt, ball like a Nerf
Word, more green nigga than smoking pot
When I see more, I'm that horror from that little shop
Shop, butcher shop, open up your top
All you see is gold watch, Rolls Royce, road blocks
Sun roof, fogged out, chrome grill, gold mouth
Take a fuckin' look around

[Chorus: Tyga]
Bitch I'm all you need
Augh, I say fuck them other niggas
Fuck them other niggas
Bitch I'm all you need
Augh, I'm the hottest nigga, all I do is turn up, bitch
500 degrees
Augh, I say fuck them other niggas, fuck them other niggas
Bitch I'm all you need
Augh, I'm the hottest nigga, all I do is turn up, bitch
500 degrees

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Thrilla manilla, I buy straight from the dealer
I'm politickin' in Paris, I'm buying statues and pillars
All from the Louvre nigga, mosaics from the museum
You niggas counting per diem, your bitch is in my DM
I never read 'em, weak bitch probably get seasick
On the yacht eat shrimp, see my name on a blimp
It read T-Raww's a pimp
Nigga I ain't dancin' but my hand on my hip
Full clip, movie shit, Bruce Wayne, Alfred
Niggas want a verse, can't even get a ad-lib
I'm killing this shit, and I'm killing your mom
One verse at a time, the shivers are mine
I murdered this shit, just takin' my time
Got bars, front gate, face shot, blind date
Rolex, timepiece, ain't got no time for no bitch speech
120 that six speed, pull it out that's all me
Just call me T-papi

[Chorus: Tyga]
Bitch I'm all you need
Augh, I say fuck them other niggas
Fuck them other niggas
Bitch I'm all you need
Augh, I'm the hottest nigga, all I do is turn up, bitch
500 degrees
Augh, I say fuck them other niggas, fuck them other niggas
Bitch I'm all you need
Augh, I'm the hottest nigga, all I do is turn up, bitch
500 degrees

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi over bitches
Smokin' color purple, blunt fat as Oprah Winfrey
I'm the nigga, the nigga, nigga, the nigga, nigga
I be snappin', I hope you get the bigger picture
I said fuck that nigga that you fuckin'
She say that nigga rap, I say he couldn't wrap a mummy
But let me pass the weed, and stop passin' judgement
Before I have to beat him like a dick he had it comin'
Been eating so much pussy, man I'm starting to get chubby
Schoolin' motherfuckers, I'm their favorite subject
Broomstick in my pants, I'm 'bout to go witch hunting
I'm already loaded, these niggas still bufferin'
I fuck my girlfriend and her best friend, these niggas is lesbians
Don't cross me like a pedestrian, I'm getting head watching ESPN
She holdin' me and carressin' me
Don't hate the player, hate the referee
If she F with me, I am definitely a necessity

[Chorus: Tyga]
Bitch I'm all you need
Augh, I say fuck them other niggas
Fuck them other niggas
Bitch I'm all you need
Augh, I'm the hottest nigga, all I do is turn up, bitch
500 degrees
Augh, I say fuck them other niggas, fuck them other niggas
Bitch I'm all you need
Augh, I'm the hottest nigga, all I do is turn up, bitch
500 degrees

We can shoot realer, just a bang for yo work
Right out niggas rough, it’s the thuggish ruggish bone

Gone, got bars, ain't gotta roam
If she ain't giving dome I guess she gon be walking home
Click clack two heels, tell her, don’t make a noise
When I’m down south, niggas say I’m that boy
Good dawg, good for nothing but the cash
100 on the dash, molly in the stash, fuck a price tag
Smoke till' I can’t see nothing, call it gas mask
She gon need a white flag when a nigga murder that ass

[Hook]

[Intro]
I ain’t tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
Yea
I got some shit on my mind

[Verse 1]
First off, this song, meant to be tooken wrong
Bad intentions and all, don't want the problem resolved
Heard it was you I'm like nah not my dawg
Went to school together Took the bus and all
Back of flashin cars, tryna be a boss
Tryna fit in with the hustlers, they told us run along
Tryna learn to shoot dice, got my bike stolen dawg
You still wanna gang bang, ride deep in cars
Til I see the nigga wrong hat, now it’s head off
Picked up a notepad, bet you gon do the same
Wrote down the shit I saw now, I don’t look at shit the same
Now how am I to blame for you choosin a life in made?
Nigga you a man too, why you mad at me?
Same gravity hold you down, that’s embarrassing
Your comments was hilarious, not even congratulations
Told niggas we’re related, even when I made it
Had nothing but good things to say about you even though you still hate it
I know you think ‘cause this fame I’m probably jaded
Ain’t get a chance to see yo daughter, tell her happy belated
For me, I don’t care if that car lease, you in it you own it
And that’s all me, being smart don’t mean cheap
You could take a life sitting in the driver’s seat
Take your shades off, I’m like
(Remember me?)

[Chorus]
I ain’t tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
If you know what you say then say who you are
We ain’t gotta take it this far
So go on, make a diss song, this is not a diss song
They just wanted this song, tell em play this song
I ain’t tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
Listen to this song

[Verse 2]
Lookin at my story, breakin down my glory
Judging my highlights when it’s shots like Horry
Always tryin to take from me, criticize, hate on me
Wanna call me fake cuz you really can’t relate to me
Your remarks, blatantly out of character
You sociopaths couldn’t make a dollar in America
On your keyboard cuz I blew up like a keloid
Me boy, why you niggas gotta be a kill joy?
I gave you niggas something to ride to
Gave you niggas something to get fly to
Gave you niggas something to die to
Niggas want the fast life, barely in the drive through
I advise you, do what yo life allow you to
You’re a fan nigga? It’s cool, I was once too
All that feedback, really don’t need that
You like it? Buy it
You don’t? don’t cop it
Catid, it be great but my eyes lit
Ignorance is bliss so I can’t blame yo ignorance
It’s irrelevant, I’m relevant
I’m a big event so go ahead and vent
(I’m a big event so go ahead and vent)

[Chorus]
I ain’t tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
If you know what you say then say who you are
We ain’t gotta take it this far
So go on, make a diss song, this is not a diss song
They just wanted this song, tell em play this song
I ain’t tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
Listen to this song

[Bridge]
Listen to diss song
Listen to diss song
Diss song
If you know what you say then say who you are
We ain’t gotta take it this far
I ain’t tryna diss you
I ain’t tryna diss you
Tell em play this song
I ain’t tryna diss you
Make a diss song
Tell em play this song
Diss song
Diss song

[Verse3]
Bill rings, let the birds sing
Had to sacrifice, never knew what pain will bring
This moment of clarity
I do it for my auntie’s nephew, never had a niece
They call it spoken word, don’t want it to speak
Don’t mix the colors with whites as if it was bleach
Back of the bus, niggas fightin over window seats
Tryna compete, T-Raww’s
Make this idea complete
Ryan just got killed, who is there to blame?
God rest his soul, tryna protect his gold chain
It’s rules to the shit, but just it ain’t a game
Give or take, niggas still gon violate
Not up for discussion, nobody cockin and bussin
You tough? It’s always someone tougher sayin fuck me some public law
Bussin, I kept it 1000 to be exact
Went from hood racks to Maybachs, how hood is that?
Plaques on the wall, wall match the chrome gat
Gat packed, backpack, backpack rapper never was that
Niggas fire arms like they fuckin fist gone
These simple heartbeats, that’s a real diss song
(Motherfucker)

[Chorus: Future & Tyga]
I'm just now getting to know you (yeah, yeah)
There are some things I wanna show you (show you off, show you off)

Uhh, that pussy mine, that's anytime
And I get it in when I call she said "couldn't pick a better time"
I know is early, just get back in town
I'mma be there in a minute down, drop that towel and its going down
Pull up on your block, all the neighbors watch
Little things, tell you you're pretty, know you get that a lot
Eyes from a distance, his and hers, gold watch
Everybody seen you, with them now them heels, sold out
I invest that time, I respect your grind
Don't keep each other in the dark,cause the sun won't shine
Don't wanna rush it right, but that ass fine
But for now let's just vibe, cause

[Chorus: Future & Tyga]

I see you working on your body, getting ready for summer
I just gotta new phone, and I lost your number
But I'mma get it, cause it's that important
Had to hit up your so called 'friends', man, them bitches annoying
I'm on the road, tell me what you're doing
I got that O-love for you, don't let it ruin
How about you come see LA, like a Bruin
Focus on on what we got going, not what everybody else doing

I feel your love and pain is crazy babe, cause

[Chorus: Future & Tyga]

Got a lot I want to tell you (no doubt, no doubt)
Me so scared of failure (don't wanna let it all out, yeah)

[Bridge: Future]
It's like you up and walked into my life, out of no where (where you come from?)
And if I lie to you today girl, that wouldn't be fair
I wanna take you around the globe and show you off everywhere (Freebandz)
And eventually I want us to take you down
Yea, yea

[Chorus: Future & Tyga]

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Fresh off the runway, today gon be a good day
Her first time in L.A., she heard 'bout Secret Sunday
Party on roof top, convertible drop top
Want the Axel Foley life, talkin Beverly Hills cop
2 shots, we sip a lot, one shot, that’s all you got
She just wanna be on the scene, stuntin in parking lots
First time she feel at home, second time did it wrong
Third time’s a charm, now she ready for it all
I place my bets high, no time for actin shy
Startled by the lights on stage, don’t close yo eyes
Thinkin rodeo drive, sweets at the lama ties
Oh she fly but it’s gon take more to weaken thighs
Hoping that they gon come, she’s saving up her ones
Saying she love to hustle, champagne for fun
A New York stripper, said she left her nigga
La won’t tip er, she runnin back to that nigga
I told er

Wake up to flowers and she know it’s me
Swear to God that body perfect like them rosaries

Swiping when I’m overseas, Chanel with the codeces
Berkin make er twerk it, I pop it while she workin
Niggas poppin in bands when she walk out by them curtains
Make yo rainin honest cuz I swear that she deserve it
Nowhere to nothing, nigga money longer than that suburban
Love er but she a stripper, magnum wrapped just like a turban
We just out further here, I’m going deep enough to hurt it
Yea she a squirter, that pussy homicide
And my dick can murder, them legs suicide
And I click on purpose, we fuckin Oceanside
Keep er wetted in them surface and whenever she resurface

Whenever she in Cali no need for the umbrella ‘cause

Hijack like the hook, all the bitches wanna fuck
I'm a good ass nigga, I dont need no luck
Good molly, partying in the after party
Pull up in the Rolls but I'm leaving in a red Rari
All my niggas gettin money like Saudis
Black mafia shit, young Gotti

[Hook: Tyga]
Pussy, money, weed got all that

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
If you believe in having sex say me too (me too)
I'm riding in my roof look see-through
I got fours on the big like pre-school
Marijuana, money, and vagina
I got plaques on my walls, you got gingivitis
Still sell a brick like I won't retire
Hijack your bitch, steal your wifey
Man my chopper go hyphy, you got your bitch in some Nikes
I got my bitch with some dykes and she saying she like it
We were down in Paris, keeping it Eiffling
Youse was at home, keeping it trifling

[Hook: Tyga]

Nigga talk shit get your head cracked
Riding with the racks, thang on my lap
Steal your bitch, call it hijack

Auhg, god damn Dupri, the beat bang
Trade hoes like players need a coach name
T-Raww gang, nigga last king
Nigga hating cause I'm ballin, telling more shame
Rack city triple x 10 mil, baby
Used to be balling, now I’m Bill Gating
Hate a shy bitch cause I’m inpatient
Live your life like a king and it’s so amazing!

Fucked her in the kitchen, kept the food cooking
Augh, 22 young millionaire
Crib in Bel Air, all the bitches stare

No house phone (cause I’m never there!)

Cause I get her best friends all in the club
Niggas po’d up, bitches off drugs

[Intro]
Yeah, the voice gone

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Driving, but my mind in the back
You ride along, but it's quiet cause we argue prior to that
I left my phone, stopped for gas, then some girl named Janet call
Said it really pissed you off and you let it build a wall
Emotions tall, we’re in the mall and some random girl call didn’t mean to text her back
I ain't trying to lose it all, cause family first and pussy last
The last pussy that I had it was good, but she ain't no trophy to brag
But I should do it anyway, cause we can fall off any day
And you'll be right back to where you was, yeah, your momma place
And things are safe, bills are paid and you just lay around, man, you're so spoiled now, only child!
Business as usual, while you yell our business so loud
Bringing these groupie bitches around you; they ain't your friends, they're foul
Swear so they tell addresses in your mail first to say: "I told you so!"
But first off, ain't they all alone?
Yeah, I told you so, you keep your enemies too close
Not everybody auntie know, we're supposed to be like on the low!
Remember before we've been down this road, tie your flat on the slope
Came to a stop as soon as I spoke, cause you know:

[Hook: Tyga & Kris Stephens]
I wanna tell the world about you, but it's like we're sworn to secrecy!
Why do we sacrifice, growing up to fall in love so fast, hope we don't become enemies!
I put my faith in God, you put your faith in me, now I'm just trying to keep my sanity!
Why do we sacrifice to fall in love so fast?
Man, I hope we don't be enemies
I'm still seeking..

[Verse 2: Tyga]
I ran into my ex like the other day didn't wanna let you know, cause usually you look the other way
Despise face with hatred, visions of me and her naked
Lies, you can't take it, cheated before, but not much lately!
Lately I've been so into this shit, love is amazing!
Said: 'you was amazing spending your time
All of your time into the days when, but it's one person you relate with
You go wild and lay with!
Never been good with relationships, life difficult, she make it basic
Yeah, when the bass hit I drive slow, your body in my control
It's my control, ain't gotta go no where, just post like field goal!
As the time goes, we'll grow, too..
No telling what I might do without you, cause I got a past and you do too
But I ain't gotta judge what you've been through, cause:

[Hook: Tyga & Kris Stephens]
I wanna tell the world about you, but it's like we're sworn to secrecy!
Why do we sacrifice, growing up to fall in love so fast, hope we don't become enemies!
I put my faith in God, you put your faith in me, now I'm just trying to keep my sanity!
Why do we sacrifice to fall in love so fast?
Man, I hope we don't be enemies
You know, I wanna tell the world about you, but it's like we're sworn to secrecy!
Why do we sacrifice, growing up to fall in love so fast, hope we don't become enemies!
I put my faith in God, you put your faith in me, now I'm just trying to keep my sanity!
Why do we sacrifice to fall in love so fast?
Man, I hope we don't be enemies
I'm still seeking...
Still seeking...

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Big shit perfect timing, got a chef, we ain’t gotta leave
Baby we can dine in
Get you played like violins
Made a purchase so large, got a call to confirm it
Swishers when we riding
Case a nigga get pulled over, keep me visine
When you living like this
She won’t never wanna leave with these new hoes
Steady tryina fuck me
Fresh nigga, no dry cleaners, don’t wash that, it’s brand new
Got Piru homies, got Crip niggas
And my ocean view straight water blue
My second time, your first time
She let me hit on the first night
Foreign cars, muscle cars
Y’all niggas just ain’t living it right

[Hook]
Drive fast, live young
I’m making change, I make it rain
We ain’t the same
I’m pulling up, my whip game
Got leather seats and wood grain
Drive fast, live young
Got champagne, that’s candy paying
My real estate, these boppers know my stage name
I sip slow, while entertain
Drive fast, live young
I’m dope, mane, you so lame
100 thous went to dice game
Drive fast, live young
Push start, I’ma start
She up and down that boulevard
Going hard, going hard

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Oh you bout that life, want that shine
Can I have that eyes, nah nigga it ain’t mine
I’ve been hustling all night, and I know she wanna call
But a nigga working hard like 3 jobs
Hottest paper can’t count it all alone
Mesmerized by the throne, addicted to doing wrong
I’m a stone cold killer, furs in the winter
Audemar ghetto? light bulb just lit up
Grown with the game, drop vise get hit up
Nigga take fade, knock down nigga get up
Broke niggas, broke niggas, I ain’t gotta worry bout gold diggas
Pow, pow, D-Rose on niggas
Hot shot clock, waiting for the finish
Hop in the tennant, y’all niggas shit rented
22 like Emmitt, and my bitch photogenic
She be fired in a minute, dry your eyes baby I was only kidding
Do it all different she used to say I did it
Rolls royce, lamborghini nigga, what’s the difference?

[Hook]
Drive fast, live young
I’m making change, I make it rain
We ain’t the same
I’m pulling up, my whip game
Got leather seats and wood grain
Drive fast, live young
Got champagne, that’s candy paying
My real estate, these boppers know my stage name
I sip slow, while entertain
Drive fast, live young
I’m dope, mane, you so lame
100 thous went to dice game
Drive fast, live young
Push start, I’ma start
She up and down that boulevard
Going hard, going hard

[Verse 3: JMSN]
Sometimes man it just suits
I’m living a dream, man it’s an ecstasy
Man, ecstasy
She feel my energy, wanna get next to me
Man this is ecstasy, ecstasy
Drive fast, live young
Chop, chop, never stop
Drive fast, live young
Chop, chop, never stop
Drive fast, live young
Drive fast, live young
Drive fast, live young
Driving in
Be forever young
Drive fast, live young
Driving in
Be forever young

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Bet your window's rolled down and your hair is pulled back
Bet you got no idea that you’re going too fast
You’re trying not to think about what went wrong
You’re trying not to stop until you get where you’re going
You’re trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes

[Bridge]
I can’t live without you, I can never doubt you baby
I can’t never doubt you, I can’t live without you baby, baby

[Hook]
The highway won’t hold you tonight
The highway don’t know you’re alive
The highway don’t care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won’t dry your tears
The highway don’t need you here
The highway don’t care if you’re coming home
But I do, I do

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Bet you got a dead cellphone on your shotgun seat
And I bet you’re all up in God's ear talking about me
You’re trying not to let the first tear fall down
You’re trying not to think about turning around
You’re trying to get lost so you turn on the radio
And the song goes

[Bridge]
I can’t live without you, I can never doubt you baby
I can’t never doubt you, I can’t live without you baby, baby

[Chorus}
The highway won’t hold you tonight
The highway don’t know you’re alive
The highway don’t care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won’t dry your tears
The highway don’t need you here
The highway don’t care if you’re coming home
But I do, I do
I do, I do (x3)
Alright, yeah
Thank you Kelsey Kulage, love

[Hook]
Niggas wanna stop me like the Nazi
Getting money like Illuminati
Look up and see the palm trees, fuck everybody
Palm trees, fuck everybody
All I see is the money, buried over the struggle
I know religion got me, too cheap to sell my soul though
So fuck every commy, palm trees
Fuck everybody, palm trees

[Verse]
Clearly these niggas can’t see me like black & white TV
So pretend that you hear me like Stevie
Let’s call it, leave and fuck you
We’ve been discussing our salary
You chiefin, pass the blunt
Pray that you live, have a dissy
Tires screeching, swerving paparazzi
I could have relieve in 91 gas from Chevron, Rolls Royce like Heron
Warrior, like Cleon; girls, they like to cling on
Give em hard dick one time then that boy gone
I hot box Ferrari to my latest songs, H Crown, did 5, glad my nigga made it home
These bitches fronting, claiming they ain’t hoes
Actin like the single life, the way that go ball all alone
All-white neighborhood, I feel alone
8 bedrooms, let my thoughts roam
And one day king will realize his throne
When you pop T-Raww, morals in you fairly strong
I love making that shit that you can sing along
Getting head while you’re high
That’s my way you’re getting blown
Used to talk to these kids through the Styrofoam
Now we talk for millions on the microphone
Jewelry cashed back then the zip locked
No job to them rogue niggas
Kick rocks, white socks
Clean nigga, court side
Fact not, see you making it rain, nigga that’s all you got
All night, that’s what you got
Fuck with me baby, make sure you leave with a wad
Course you ain’t bad, fuck your cash, I pay my tab
Make you a star in real life, fuck a blog, nigga

[Hook]
Niggas wanna stop me like the Nazi
Getting money like Illuminati
Look up and see the palm trees, fuck everybody
Palm trees, fuck everybody
All I see is the money, buried over the struggle
I know religion got me, too cheap to sell my soul though
So fuck every commy, palm trees
Fuck everybody, palm trees

[Hook - Soulja Boy]
I'm driving in a foreign
All the ride this foreign
All the ride this foreign
I'm driving in a foreign
Yeah my car is foreign
Yeah my car is foreign
I'm driving in a foreign
I'm riding in a foreign
I'm driving in a foreign
I'm riding in a foreign

[Verse 1 - Soulja Boy]
I bought your car walk in the club
I got the party poppin'
My… ask me why I go so hard it ain't no stoppin’
I need everything foreign I need a lot of money pouring
We never see the el tore ‘cause Soulja Boy got a fortune
We’re not playing, every car is foreign with 'em driving
Drifting left to right and everything snowing
I need every chain all my neck golden
I need every diamond in my ear frozen
Take off, take off, 3 2 1 let's race off
And my jet is about to take off
Take off, take off, 3 2 1 let's race off
And my jet is about to take off
I need everything foreign
Yeah I'm riding foreign
Driving around in foreign
A lot of money is foreign
I need foreign, I need a foreign

Every car is foreign
Every girl is gorgeous
Money yeah it's pouring
The cities yeah I'm touring
I need everything foreign, foreign
I need everywhere foreign, foreign

[Verse 2 - Soulja Boy]
You walk in the club bad boy
And I ain't looking everyone
Ain't nobody drive my style
I'm in the club I'm stupid high
I'm blowing kushie to the sky
Pour up, pour up
I'm a jury froze up
They see my car like hold up
See my car like slow up
It's nothing, yeah I'm stuntin'
We gettin' money we don't do no frontin'
We all in or nothing
No talking, no drop your style so you walking
You rent this shit but I bought it
It's Soulja telling me no Audi
I pull up in this foreign
Overseas when I'm touring
It's foreign

[Intro]
This is not your ordinary record
Record, Re-re-record, re-re-re-cor-cor-cord (Hit it!)

[Verse 1]
Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things?
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's runnin' it
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killin' me
So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty
There has to be some type of change for this day and age
We gotta rearrange and flip the page
Livin' encased like animals and cannibals
Eatin' each other alive just to survive the nine to five
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive
Peace of mind's so hard to find

[Chorus]
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, come on now

[Verse 2]
Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces, a war is taking place
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
Is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're livin'
The clock is tickin', the end is comin', there'll be no warnin'
But we live to see the dawn

[Bridge]
How can we preach, when all we make this world to be
Is a living hell torturing our minds?
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light
And the love in our hearts will shine

[Verse 3]
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespectin' each other
Whatever happened to protectin' each other?
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted
Family values are contradicted, ashes to ashes and dust to dust
The pressure is buildin' and I've had enough

[Chorus]
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, come on now

[Verse 4]
Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces, a war is taking place
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
Is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning
But we live to see the dawn

[Chorus]
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, come on now

[Outro]
Shout
Shout
Shout
Shout
Shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, come on now
Shout

Yo Soulja bring the jury box out my Nigga

[Verse 1: 2-D]
Oh, joys are us, the sun has come again to hold you
Sailing out the doldrums of the week
The polyphonic prayer is here, it's all around you
It's all around you, out here

[Bridge: 2-D]
And if the whole world is crashing down (on you)
Fall through space out of mind with me

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising
Blows all the shadows far away
The falling of the whole empire, is here to hold you
Rolling out and haunted till it sleeps

[Hook: Yukimi Nagano]
Little memories, marching on
Your little feet, working the machine
Say will it spin, will it soar?
My little dream, working the machine
Soon, like a wave, empires will fall
And closing in on you, they're going on
Little memories
Your little feet, working the machine
Say will it spin, will it soar?
My little dream, working the machine
Soon like a wave, empires will fall
Closing in on you, they're going on

[Verse 1]
When sky blue gets dark enough
To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can

[Verse 2]
Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hands

[Chorus]
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away

[Verse 3]
I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand
When I would take her anyway I can

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes and she goes
Like no one can
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands

[Chorus]
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes and she goes
Like no one can
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands

[Chorus]
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away

[Verse 1]
Senses taking over
Thought you set me free
I've tried to get up
But it was pouring down on me
Keeps on burnin' deeper
Desperate for you to be
Seven psychiatrists couldn't drag it out of me

[Chorus]
Ooh, this is what I need
Ooh, tell me you're allowed to let it show

[Verse 2]
Just like it was magic
I was far enough to see
Better than to get just what
A stranger did to me
Is it 'cause I lie?
Is it 'cause I don't?
Well, I just don't know
Keep on asking me
Darling, let me see (keep on asking)
I'd give anything to let it go

[Intro]
You are a hoe, you are a hoe
(Fuck) You
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck him
Fuck everything else that I can see
I know, fuck you I hate you so fucking much
I know you think I'm crazy
'Cause I think you’re a fucking fag (Hahaha)

[Skit: Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC, Sam, and Wolf]
"Sam, the music sounds good, man! You've been practicing!"
"Thanks"
"Sam, this is Wolf. He's new here."
"What's up, dude?"
"Wolf, this is Sam. Sam and his band have been here at Flog Gnaw for a while. Sam's gonna show you around while I fill out these last minute field trip slips, alright? Now you guys have fun"
"So, you guys are into jazz?"
"Look. Wolf, Prairie Dog, Ronzell—whatever the fuck your name is. We don't fuck with you or anybody else here, alright? You stay the fuck out of our way and we'll stay out of yours, capisce?"

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Poppa ain't call even though he saw me on TV, it's all good (Fuck you)
But now my balls, balls deep in this broad's jaw
Swallow girl, it's just nut
Bitches scared to let me smash on they ass
Yeah, they heard I'm fuckin' nuts like the swag of a fag
Like me and Tekeli was gagging in the back of the cabin
Camp Flog Gnaw, nigga, you can tell by the badge
(Hodgy, pass me my inhaler)
I'm sick of hacking and coughing, I'm often this fucking awesome
I'm animal, Noah's arking, all from this rapping nonsense
Four stories in my home like "What the fuck's an apartment?" (nigga?)
Get shit poppin' like Peter's pores during puberty
Take bets on how quick Tyler can reach maturity
Cussing out Siri like a waitress with no patience
Oh, you want a tip bitch, well here's my dick for gratiturity, bitch

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Shut 'em down!
Nigga, shut 'em down!
Shut 'em down!

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I tumble-crush on huzzy sluts, give money up then nutty butt
Professor Nutty Buddy Klump gets petty when you touch his lunch
Like, what the fuck? I'm drunk as fuck, turn the fucking music up
So I can't hear these stupid fucks, talk-no-walk, let you discuss
You're talking too much, who the fuck are you to us? Uterus
I put that on my pubes and nuts, if I don't begin moving up
I'm shooting up, you and her crew on turf, new dessert
I can see the bitch in a nigga through his shirt
I can smell the whore on a bitch when she flock around my crew to flirt
It's on ya' shoulder, lose the dirt, yeah, it's the movement first
Fuck a human nurse! I'm ill I used this earth to infuse the birth
Of my scrotum on the Channel 10 news, my only motive is to
Skip to my Lou, get hip to the pew
You can drink piss and eat a dick in a few, the sickening view
Of visuals, woo, I'll eat your ribs, I'm a wolf
Then meet your kids after school, and give them drugs cause it's cool, fucker

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Shut 'em down!
Nigga, shut 'em down!
Shut 'em down!

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Hodgy, fuck this beat, nigga, let's smoke weed
That shit I need, be the shit that's green
A little purple and pink, come get some Swisher Sweets
About three or four more than needed be
I got a eighth I could face, I got a blunt flavored grape
I hate the grape, I could taste it when I'm inhaling the vapes
You could smell us in places when we walk in our clothing is always covered in flakes
Enough for two shake blunts; and what the fuck is this? Uh...
I think this Mary is laced; my heart is beating at paces
That Pacquiao can't relate I'm fucking faded like gradients
Shit, I'm stuck like the tape that's superglued
To the center of Kelly Price first waist
It's like my first date with Mrs. Mary, the shit is scary
The paranoia from this marijuana's very heavy, I'm lifted
Fainted by my fifth hit, Lionel, pass the sherm
Let's use the Philly as a dipstick for this bath salt, you dipshit

[Outro: Domo Genesis]
C'mon, my nigga! You don't even smoke, you weak as fuck, my nigga. You do not smoke, no tucks, my nigga. You're as weak as f- you’re butt my nigga. Oh, mark ass nigga, Cuh, oh my God, bro. Here come this weak-ass nigga, Samuel

[Chorus 1: Tyler, The Creator]
(Can we talk on the phone or something)
Because when I call (When I call you on the phone)
I hope you pick up your phone
I'd like to talk to you
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
Because when I call
I hope you pick up your phone
I'd like to talk to you
I hope you answer

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Hey Dad, it's me, um...
Oh, I'm Tyler, I think I'd be your son
Sorry, I called you the wrong name, see, my brain's splitting
"Dad" isn't your name, see "Faggot"'s a little more fitting
Mom was only twenty when you ain't have any fucks to spare
You Nigerian fuck, now I'm stuck with this shitty facial hair
Also stuck with a beautiful home with a case of stairs
So you not being near fucking fire-started my damn career
But fuck it, I got Clancy, he gave me the chance to see
A world I wasn't supposed to, I'm stoked that I didn't know you
But sucks you ain't give a fuck and considered a sperm donor now
Fuck is an Okonma? I'm changing my shit to Haley
And I just ain't being passive, nigga
You a fuckin' faggot, nigga
Got a show on Monday, guess who ain't gettin' no passes, nigga?
But if I ever had the chance to ask this nigga
And call him
I hope he answer

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & (Syd)]
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
Because when I call (When I call, baby)
I hope you pick up your phone (Please pick up)
I'd like to talk to you
(I hope you answer)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Suck my fucking dick and swallow this case of nuts
Ace hates your guts, I'm a selfish fuck
And I ain't sharing green as if I'm facing blunts
Frank is out the closet, Hodgy's an alcoholic
Syd might be bipolar, but fuck it, I couldn't call it
Supposed to be gone 'til November but quickly came back in August
I left two months through September to clearly remember all this
I would like to tell my grandma, but she just nostalgia
I'll call her number
But she won't answer

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & (Syd)]
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
'Cause when I call (When I call, baby)
I hope you pick up your phone
(I'd like to talk to you)
I hope you answer

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
You claim to hate my fucking guts
But say I'm on a island in Thailand and I was wilding
And, if I got stranded had to man up and hold my nuts
And hope that I could live off salt water and fucking coconuts
Phone ain't got no service, this 3G is fucking worthless
Day is getting dark like the area's turning urban
You'll be fucking nervous like me inside of a Church's
But, I'ma get in contact regardless, and
I hope you answer

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
The last verse was about this girl, haha

[Intro: Nas]
Crack fucked up the world
And I wonder if they realized the damage
I mean, they come from an era
Who made a lot of money off that shit
And I wonder if it fucked with they conscience
It fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it
I couldn't stand seeing people fucking theyselves up like that on the shit
And that's where the money came from

[Chorus: Tyler The Creator & Frank Ocean]
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Shit's getting warmer, on that corner
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 foreigners
Your mother's a goner
I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
You got a daughter, shit's getting harder
The only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep
And the seashore ain't saw ya
You got a mother, she don't support you
But you bought her a new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had a roof
Now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof
I guess you’re accustomed what you’re used to
So you bought two, nigga
They coming for you, nigga
Niggas be hating I'm doing them bitches
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind
And it’s all an illusion
Who was alludin' all of this potent?
I am the reason your family is using and shooting up
It's my fault
You can, blame me, motherfucker
For killing your aunties and uncles
The hustle and hunger
All I wanted was a cheeseburger
And a little chain, tucked
Didn’t realize this game fucked, up some lives
Oh, how's mine?
My conscience eats it up all the time but, other than that I’m fine
I got a little money in my pocket

[Chorus: Tyler The Creator & Frank Ocean]
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Nigga, we broke as fuck
Homie got a chop shop, I stole that truck
And I sold that dope, motherfuckers hope this nigga go broke
But like my work I give no fucks, I'm sorry (Yeah)
She could have been a doctor, nigga, I’m sorry (Yeah, nigga)
Could have been an actor and won that Oscar, said I'm sorry
I sold that soap, and I killed black folk, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)
But I got a nice car, put my sister through school
While my mama all cool, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)
I'm in too deep and I can’t see the shore, I'm sorry

[Outro: Nas & Tyler, The Creator]
You get addicted to the flip, we used to call it
You get addicted to the flip (I'm sorry)
The, the, the, the transaction, the hustling (I'm sorry)
Even more than the money, it's just your job (I'm sorry)
You feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man
And make this happen for that person (I'm sorry)
And to do this and do that
You become the go to guy, you know, forever
Next thing you know you’re in too deep
Way too deep, it'll scare the shit out of you
You wind up with so much work, that you'd be scared to death
It's important for us to realize man, we gotta get out of that, man
You know, dudes is buying choppers
Shoot down the people that look just like them
Dudes is buying guns to take down each other
Nobody wins, ya know what I mean?

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
'Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves
Shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty-four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts, fuck
I love you
Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Girl, you fucking with my emotions
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest can make me the saddest
Look Alice, let's get lost in your wonder-er-land, fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathin'
And you'll see the meaning of stalkin'
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seein' with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evenin'
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
'Cause when I hear your name, I cannot stop cheesin'
I love you so much that my heart stops beatin' when you're leavin'
And I'm grievin' and my heart starts bleedin'
Life without you has no goddamn meanin'
Sorry, I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I fall for you, but I love you

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator & Pharrell Williams]
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it tonight
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling bitch, let's try to catch it tonight

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams & (Tyler, The Creator)]
C'mon baby, even though I hate you, I still love you
I love you
And Salem, my love (I know)
I'm passive aggressive (I'm sorry, fuck)
(Come here)
I like when we hold hands
(You're the best around)
See I get jealous (Fuck)
And if I see that nigga (If I see him)
I just might kill him, haha (Look)
(Look, I wanna strangle you, 'til you stop breathing)
Love, love, love
(Spend the rest of my life, looking for air)
(so you can breathe, or we can die together, you and me)
(Fuck, look)
I'm in love (Love)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator as Wolf and Salem]
"Yo, why is Samuel such a fucking dick?"
"He isn't such a badass actually. He's only here because he ran away, because some shit happened back home. He's actually a dweeb"
"Yo, what happened?"

[Verse 1]
Geek, fag, stupid loser, find a rope to hang
I'm not bipolar, see I'm just known by those couple names
I wanna tell my pops but shit, he'll probably say the same
Fuck...
Hated by everyone, that's the way it seems
I don't know what's shorter, his damn temper or my self-esteem
I sit in my room and I listen to tunes, I'm amused alone
'Cause none of the cool kids would let me join a team
Depression's on the stalk again
My best friend's an inhaler because it will not let me cough
Whenever I am losing oxygen, bully hand around my neck
Cause he felt disrespected when I decided to talk again
I brought that on myself, see I should know my place
But not at lunchtime, see I know better than to show my face
Around them, but the day I do it'll be everywhere
When I share these feelings finally they gon' fucking care

[Hook]
Grab a couple friends, start a couple riots
Crash a couple- (planes, planes, planes)
Then, gather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers
Odd Future hooligans causing up a ruckus
It's us, nigga
I said it's us, nigga

[Verse 2]
Murder, murder, m-murder the last they heard of you
Was when I... "uh" with all them burners, you
Think that I'm some punk bullied bitch who ain't gon' trouble you
Well, I'm gonna burst your bubble two times if you don't mind
Umm "Who are you again?" I'm Samuel and that's Tyler
We came to get wild and style in these trench coats!
Don't start asking what's packing in these trench coats!
Just know if you start acting, I'm grabbing for these trench coats!
My step-father called me a fag
I'll show him a fag, and I'll light a fire up in his ass
And recently them assholes been fucking with me in class
So I'ma keep them muhfuckers there and make sure they pass huh
My prom date, she dismissed my offer
So I'mma **** her and toss her in the principal's office
(Tyler, I'll go with you)
Oh, now you wanna conversate with me try to be my friend? (Where are my parents at?-) Don't worry, you'll probably never see them again

[Hook]
Grab a couple friends, start a couple riots
Crash a couple- (planes, planes, planes)
Then, gather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers
Odd Future hooligans causing up a ruckus
It's us, nigga
I said it's us, nigga

[Bridge]
Bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum
Bum. bum. bum. burumrumrumrum bum bum bum
Bum bum bumbumbumbum, hehe
We are the Sams, and we're dead -- it's just four of us
We come in peace, we mean no harm, and we're inglorious
We took their heads but we just took back what they took from us
I guess we lost ours

[Verse 3]
Music had nothing to do with my final decision
I just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention
But nobody would listen, but stuffed animals that I had
Since I was a kid but I'm growing up so they're missing
I didn't mean to hurt anybody, I'm sorry
I wouldn't hurt a fly or consider joining the Army
I'm hardly ever angry, Roger Rabbit framed me
Momma I'm the same fucking kid that you made, see?
I don't wanna go to jail, I just wanna go home
And I want them fucking kids at school to just leave me alone
And I... I hear helicopters, make ‘em dip
I'm fucking reloaded, I told you all that I ain't taking shit
You better back up before this Mac start to lift up
I'll pump it like my inhaler when asthma begin to act up
The difference between us and our class is tan khakis
I got 99 problems and all of them's being happy

[Intro]
I don't fucking like this shit, fuck
Ah!

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Tall ugly nigga with lips bigger than Tigger
Only blue print on these Vans like I don't listen to Jigger (Uhh)
Cotton-picking nigger, Golf Wang season sicker than the block
Colette and skateshops, where wolves deal 'em (Uhh)
Workshop is awesome, ask Dill and let's pretend
Like I'm not making dollar Bill Withers on these fucking stickers (Uhm)
Pulling down my zipper and she quick to say she doesn't suck
Bitch, cut the crap like dyke booty when they scissor (Uhh)
Pink haired Mrs., I'm her mister, sipping Slurpees, bag of chips
Now show your tits for mister Fuji, take a picture (Uhh)
OF is popping like a blister, need some Listerine
Spitting got us balling like we Mr. Clean's sister (Uhh)
Sick of being black, sipping paint thinner out a tin flask
Plotting on the babysitter before dinner
And hopefully I get her, if I don't, fuck it then
See I never simp son, polar opposite of Smithers, I'm done bitch

[Hook: Casey Veggies & (Tyler, the Creator)]
Until the ozone leaves and the Earth is hot
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot
The moon now working and the stars align
I stay golden, y'all thought I was out my mind
(Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot) Yeah
(Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot) Ah man
(Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot) Ah man
(Yeah) Yeah

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
(Somebody told me...) I had a decline in the buzz
Not a shocker bruh, I had the stun gun in my bum
And when I drop shit you better have a towel and a sponge
And ask Bob bitch, I eat a ton bucket of chum
In Bikini Bottom, I am the biggest problem
This shit fishy niggas dip like we were set in Harlem
Heaters turn them into nuggets like Carmelo Anthony
We just sit and burn shit just like my fucking anthem

[Verse 3: Mike G & (Tyler, The Creator)]
I'm like goals, those are something you have to stand to reach
My campaign speech elect me Commander in Chief
Respect to whoever's minor appearances cause mass hysteria
But I'm still incomparable, I'm like the face of America
I'm the ambassador from a land made of gold
I'm a fucking centerfold, I'm something to behold
I can kill a hundred shows, take one for the road
I'm results of putting persistent pressure on coals, (Bitch)

[Hook]
Until the ozone leaves and the Earth is hot
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot
The moon now working and the stars align
I stay golden, y'all thought I was out my mind
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot (Yeah)
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot (Ah man)
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot (Ah man)
(Yeah) Yeah

[Verse 4: Tyler, the Creator]
It's a dog eat dog world, don't get bit bruh
A son of a bitch I am, yup, I'm a sick pup
(I thought that you were nice) Yeah I am, slut
I'm also half ass a racist who hates niggas, yep, I'm a mixed mutt
'Preme is the top bunk, green is the pillow case
Golf is the bed sheets (Hat and my T-shirt)
TrashWang sticker on that Chima Fergolfson
I'm real with the box, and I murder with the pen
It's Bimmer Boy's, boy; never swerving in the Benz
I'm listening to Dead Sam demos on the ten
Can I get a medium with cheese and bacon?
It's Loiter Squad nigga...

[Outro]
Fucking Loiter Squad...
(That shit was fucking crazy)
Yeah
(Damn)

[Skit]
Yo, Wolf, nigga
What? Why are you running?
Sam's after you
Sam's after who?
You!
For what? What the fuck?
He found out that you and Salem been hanging out, he said he gonna kill you
Kill me? What the fuck you mean kill me?
You got a booger in your nose
What the, wait, slow down, wait, slow down, what the fuck you mean he gonna kill me?
I don't know, he just said he gonna kill you
Not if I get to him fir-

[Intro: Jason Dill]
"I'm saying, you know, like. All I ever told you to do was grow up, don't grow down. You know, like, you know, grow up. Don't grow down, grow out. You go from being a kid, just doing your thing, hanging out with your friends. Months later you're world-famous. You're a gay rights activist, and you don't even know it. You know what, I don't wanna say it to you no more, Tyler. Fuck you, Tyler!"

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Watch me get this money, nigga; tired of being hungry, nigga
Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch a nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage -- you look lunch, my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies, bitch
I'm hocking, spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch
Buncha novices, Odd Future the squad is thick
Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense
We the last of a dying breed
And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please
My pockets solid, making profit off the highest tees
Bitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursing
Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person
Watch me get this money, I'm up when the birds chirping
Make actions, fuck rehearsing

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine
Summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, 'cause I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, "Fuck shit"
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy? Posers looking silly, boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese
Na'kel Smith, Transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?
See y'all niggas tripping, man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the .9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, "Hi," I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings
"Analog" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the "Tron Cat" fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time, I'ma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine
Summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt, Tyler, The Creator (as Sam)]
This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)
All I’m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs
Brother the Pigeons is us
Bid you goodnight and good luck
(Oh, shut the fuck up!)
(Gunshot)

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator (as Sam)]
Samuel's here! Where's Wolf? Fucking faggot. Salem was mine, bitch! Was that good enough, you fucking pussy?

[Salem]

Colorful you are

You're my favorite crayon in the box
Let's think outside the lines
Come to my treehouse, yeah let’s escape
Then let me go, headfirst in your lake
From what I heard, it's great
It's great
There's a party

[Verse 2: Erykah Badu & Tyler, the Creator]
Tuesday is good news day Woo!
Not usually a full tray Yeah

[Intro: Tallulah]
Tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale!

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
They say I've calmed down since the last album
Well, lick my dick, how does that sound? Ummm
Smell my gooch, you could kiss my buns
And I don't give a shit, bend my rectum
Somebody said bands make her dance
You think you're getting cash, no bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait turn this up, bitch, this my jam (Where the drums at?)
Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn nig​ger
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox Live, that fun
Before I cum, I call your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram
And suplex her off a building if I get banned
(I'm just fucking around)

[Chorus 1: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Bring back the horns that was played in the beginning
And tell Tony Parker that I found his vision
And if he's tripping off my sneak dissing
Then he has to deal with me and my minions
Tryna get a bimmer, E46
Have you heard "48"? Motherfucker, I'm great (Yeah)
Golf Wang prints always cover the sleeves
From cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please
Fuck I look like? Got a new bike
Tire never pop like the puss on a butch dyke
Think I give a fuck, I do go raw
Then I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease, bitch!)
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the obese neck on Aretha
Now turn that snare down
I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare on the same damn bus
Like, "You're going to jail now"

[Chorus 1: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
If a woodchuck could ever give a fuck?
Bitch suck dick, motherfuck you and your opinions
(Can you kick it?) Yes, I can sir, where the lump is
Sicker than the last bar bold-er, I’m a CO
Colorado, fuck Michael, bitch, I’m badder than my BO
Find me and Lance tryna dance during chemo
Before they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos

[Chorus 2: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, buddy, this is my jam, na, na, na, na, na, na, na!
Golf Wang, Golf Wang, no, fuck you, na, na, na, na, na, na!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
How many fags can a lightbulb screw?
Well if it has a dick, maybe two or six
And tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit
And shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?
A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me, tryna set mood
Little Redtube, fuck lotion, I don't need lube, dry fist suits me (Yeah)
Up and down, friction make a *fap fap* sound
The shit's kind of disgusting
Fap time and before I flatline
Clancy chimes in my room and catch me
This shit's so damn embarrassing, like—

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Christian Clancy]
Oh, shit, aw, fuck
What the fuck?
Aw, I'm sorry
Is that my shirt?
Yeah, sorry, I needed something
Clean that shit up, we're going to the office!
Fuck

[Verse]
Went to Six Flags, six fags came up
And said "Ayo! Can we get a pic?" I said no
And they said "Oh! It's Wolf Gang, "Yonkers", Goblin is my shit though"
Now I'm like, "fuck, I don't want to be an asshole"
So I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon
With a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on
So fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath
'Cause some kid said I was there, then they caused a riot (Tyler's here!)
Now I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo
All because they noticed the top with the box logo
And them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard
They bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo
I'm going fucking loco, "Hey, Tyler, can I...?"
No, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?
"But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied
Until I heard "Radicals," the last part got to me
See, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed
Now I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be
My life is just like yours, no father
My momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom
In school I was the one that was thinking outside boxes
So everybody in them would say that I got problems
So when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em
You're an inspiration to niggas like me
Not the niggas who just like you 'cause of lyrics and beats
I'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be
I heard the song "Bastard" right in the moment of heat
Not in summer, but of course, I was holding a heat
Gun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord
And it drew me in like predators carrying treats
Then I said to myself, "Fuck, is he speaking to me?"
See, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat
I mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?
I carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard
On my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (that's weird)
That's hard, that scar from playing air guitar
When I see you play at the Roxy (uhh)
Tyler, I love you, wanna be just like you (alright)
I think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (no homo)
Wish I had a basement meant for me to hide you
We could play Xbox and listen to "In Search Of..." and eat donuts
Over conversating 'bout what church does
Come up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs
I'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip
And Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch
You should've took me instead (uhh, that's weird)
See, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither
And if I can't have you then she shouldn't either
No one should see you, but me in your t-shirt
I worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (what the fuck)
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing
I know it seems like I'm just slobbing on your knob
But I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (yeah, you are)
I ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times
'Cause (Thanks for the support) I love you man (alright)
I like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees
I like pants that's cut, I like words like "fuck"
I got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out
Now paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (what the fuck)
And I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day
And now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a "hey" (sorry)
And my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play "VCR"
In my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors..."
All right, my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic
So I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses
(Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit
And I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick
But I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar
After spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers
"Yonkers" and "Yonkers" (I love that song) Sick of hearing about "Yonkers"
I'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered
"Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert
I was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan
The one that say "Sagan Lockhart" and when you came out to "Sandwitches"
That's when my fucking boy-crush got started"

[Outro]
Just take this fucking picture man, shit...

[Intro: Dr. TC]
So, what's going on, Wolf? Talk to me, man. People worry. We hearing stories about you getting into fights and all this unnecessary bullshit. It's—Wh—What's on your mind? Talk to me, I'm here

[Hook]
Domo, roll another one
I'm just fuckin' with you, I ain't smokin' none
My squad bring terror, no intended pun (Wolf Gang, nigga)
Merch booth made niggas extensive funds (Paid)
Mama got the Rover with the Range (Yeah)
She don't ever ever gotta struggle, not again (Nigga)
And I put that on my dead grandmama's name (Rest in peace)
Too soon (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Ugh, my nigga Slater, yeah that's my little pony
Little homies is repping like I been fucking with Kony
Nigga, Phillip and Kobi, to my niggas that know me
Your boy seem happy as fuck, but truthfully, your boy lonely
Nigga's a target for marketing, he's an artist
Can't even walk into Target
Without bothering customers bothering
Asking me for a picture, can I talk to they sister?
Nah, nigga, get lost, you're fucking smothering
God, I wanna quit, but I can't
'Cause mother and sister can't pay the rent
Four stories with storage, I'm 21 with a mortgage
And touring's paying the bills, life is paying for thrills
Life's a bitch, bruh, but from the third floor, man, she's gorgeous
A year ago I was broke; now, how can I afford this?
I started off with disposables; now, I have an assortment
And I'm using these negatives to develop a portrait
Now, the frame is a pain in the ass
To get it in without a scratch or stain on the glass
But that's not important
Just as long as it's printed, and I hinted it is
But when I get it I'll make sure you get a copy, you bitch
Shit, I'll even add a signature with the fuckin' pic-a-ture
I'll even tell you the film I used, and the aperture

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Domo, roll another one
I'm just fuckin' with you, I ain't smokin' none
My squad bring terror, no intended pun (Wolf Gang, nigga)
Merch booth made niggas extensive funds (Paid)
Mama got the Rover with the Range (Yeah)
She don't ever ever gotta struggle, not again (Nigga)
And I put that on my dead grandmama's name (Rest in peace)
Too soon (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Grandmother died, didn't cry, not a tear
Not gonna lie, fucking weird, no water dripped out the eye
But when I got the news, yup, it left your boy stuck
'Cause when my mom dipped
She was the one that gave me a fuck
Mom calling and calling, I'm on my way to a show
I answer, she crying, saying, "Sadie is dying"
The doc said she only had a week for us to speak
Before she deceased, 'cause cancer was just eating her cheeks up
Fuck! Nah, this is really awkward for me, bruh
I hang the phone up, and adjust my seat back
And started to think, like, "What the fuck just happened?"
I never had a death, and I just seen her a week ago
Meet them at the hospital, I should
In between the set of BADBADNOTGOOD
Lionel asked what happened I said it's bad bad, not good
Just take me to the Cedars-Sinai off of Oakwood
Getting there, family sitting center chair
Awkward in the lobby, it was floating in the thinning air
Getting there, need a sticker saying how I got in there
There's her room
Open up the curtain, she's just sitting there, "Hello"
Our conversation's brief
Couldn't even make eye contact when we speak
Lookin' at her, you could tell all she had was weak
And I'm not talkin' days, bruh, I'm talkin' 'bout her strength
I sat there, 20 minutes tops
Hoping it was just a fucking plea that she could cop
She died that night

[Outro: Dr. TC & Tyler, the Creator]
Oh, that's heavy, man. I'm sorry for your loss
Yeah, whatever. Don't worry about it...
The last time I seen Sammy, he was lookin' for you
Fuck that nigga, Samuel!
Uhh, have you seen him?
Nah, but if I seen that nigga I woulda killed him

[Verse 1: Tyga]
They say what goes around comes around (round)
And I know I made mistakes and you forgave me how (how)
I don't understand, you know I'm trying the best I can (can)
I guess it's consequences when you dealing with sin (sin)
And even sacrificed your friends over me
All them nights in the club turn to nights with me
It's like the same old story out your diary (diary)
Memories never fade but only in time we'll see (see)
Hope to see you with me 'cause...

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
My heart beats for you, girl, you know are the one
Why you mad at me? Girl, I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up
But my heart beats for you, baby, I’ma go and scream it loud
But if you leave, it's something I can't control
So let's do it one last time and fuck for the road

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, grippin' and biting
Remember the times after fighting
You said you loved me, I liked it
Became obsessed with the sexing
You screaming, “Whose is it?” we naked
Now I'm pullin' your hair told you take it
A couple of shots, now we faded
Don't even know we made it, we home
Got that look in your eyes like hope you mine
Said you hoped the feeling’s real, really tired of all the lies
One minute we fine, then we not, everything I do you can't
But that's no reason for making mistakes, this time put it all on the plate
I, I told you be loyal, spoil you, never disown you
You get lonely when I'm touring, just hold it down ,be supportive
I'll be back in the morning, that new purse you wanted
What's good if you can't flaunt it (flaunt it), show it
Ain't the same, better than the rest (rest)
And what's real love if you ain't got respect? (Got respect)
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to make, make you understand, make you understand that

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
My heart beats for you, girl, you know are the one (oh, for you)
Why you mad at me? Girl, I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up (oh, made mistakes, I know I fucked up)
But my heart beats for you, baby, I’ma go and scream it loud
But if you leave, it's something I can't control
So let's do it one last time and fuck for the road

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
All I ever wanted was your happiness
But right now let's get right down to it, let's handle this business
If you gonna leave me tonight, I gotta kiss it goodbye
Girl, I'm 'bout to make it cry, and all I need is one more time 'cause my...

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Last time, best time, better than my next time
Rolex and vest time, Moët it's sex time
Hard to let go, a part of you gon’ be alone
Scrolling your phone, looking at texts, seems like not too long ago
Ain't the same better than the rest (rest)
And what's real love if you ain't got respect? (Got respect)
And it's no way I can pay you back (back)
But my plan is to make, make you understand, make you understand that

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
My heart beats for you, girl, you know are the one
Why you mad at me? Girl, I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up
But my heart beats for you, baby, I’ma go and scream it loud
But if you leave, it's something I can't control
So let's do it one last time and fuck for the road

[Verse 1]
Got my childhood in the 80's that shit was crazy
Thinking just she had a baby, she just a baby
First pack I ever sold, my big brother gave me
30 off a hundred dollars, man he tried to slave me
Shout out to my brother Vic, that nigga raised me
Remember when I seen a brick, it was amazing
First pistol I ever had, you know I stole it
First car I ever bought, you know they stole it
My uncle still smokin dope, but I can't judge them
I probably never get to vote, and ain't that ugly
I might just try a new approach, but that is doubtful
And I ain't gotta buy shooter, I keep a house full

[Hook]
I was wasted last night I swear it was a blur
Can't remember shit, but I know I wore bur
Big super duper bad bitch what I prefer
And you's a pussy ass nigga, that's what I concur
Pull up in my super sport, smokin super purp
Dope jumpin out the gym, I got super work
These niggas super duper hating cause they super lame
Super charger, got the super duper going on, super

[Verse 2]
Different, recognize, stickin out like a porky pine
45 on my waist, I shoot this up like Columbine
Drive by, bah bah, I'mma shoot for all mine
Gucci I'm not hard to find, I come back with my seat reclined
Twirl talk, cook it, chicken pot pot
This might be on bail or some, cause she let me slide by
Wise guy, mob ties, better have your shoes tied
Your girl know you a bitch nigga, she went and got her tubes tied
Room full of camera people, I'mma let you slide
Last nigga tried the stupid shit, that nigga died
The earth it ain't big enough for us so one day gon collide
And I ain't waitin on nobody protect me, I'mma ride

[Hook]

[Intro: Meek Mill]
MMG in the building
It's Meek Milly, you know what I do
I get money bitch
Yeah, Philly

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I'm ballin on these niggas like I'm Derrick Rose
If they ain't talking money, I don't hear em though
If they ain't talking pussy, I don't hear them hoes
I'm a paper making, pussy getting animal
More money, more problems
So every check I get, I'm buying more choppas
So every check I get, I'm buying more choppas

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Hunnid stacks, that's featherweight
It's time to get this money and the record straight
Fuck the loud ho's, I don't ever hate
On the first night, I don't ever wait
I buy her weave, and red bottoms
Before you blink your eyes she got her head boppin'
I be in the hood, where the lead poppin'
While you was buyin' circles we was square coppin'
Thirty six, Pyrex
Bakin Soda, I make a nine stretch
Paper towel, let it dry yes
Got em lookin' at my wrist like "Is he signed yet?"
No nigga, you a ho nigga
Rapper, you a action figure G.I Joe nigga
Middle of the streets I'm on a 4-wheela
Same night I rock the same stages as HOV nigga
Hah!

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I'm ballin on these niggas like I'm Derrick Rose
If they ain't talking money, I don't hear em though
If they ain't talking pussy, I don't hear them hoes
I'm a paper making, pussy getting animal
More money, more problems
So every check I get I'm buying more choppas
So every check I get I'm buying more choppas

[Verse 2: Mel Love]
I say, I be off in the kitchen
Pitchin' apron and a mitten
Trying to get it back ya a nigga trying to get it
Hit it hit it straight with a

Trying to burn it all down and bring it all back

For the right price I can make it straight drop
Right price drop make a lot lot

[?] nigga pop pop 

[?] fuck is y'all on
I don't like mine looking like popcorn

[Intro: Lenny Kravitz]
When was the last time we got to be 100% real, ya'll?
I don't want ya'll holding back nothing!

[John Legend]
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Verse 1: John Legend]
We made a lot of magic
It’s the only way we know
Let’s trip the night fantastic
Light it up, tell me more, explore
We love, we love, we love the stars
We could fall so hard
The drinks, the minks, the jewels, the house, the cars
Why’d we ball so hard?

[Hook: John Legend]
Yeah, I’m not afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And we’re not afraid to die
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Bridge: John Legend]
We’ve got a lot of nerve, girl
We walk around here like we own this place

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
See my jewels dripping on my Timberlands
Stepping like a criminal, success is so imminent
Pink champagne, black Rolls Royce
Eggplant double breasted suit from Tom Ford
Bon voyage, left haters in the fog
Look up in the sky, bet you recognize a boss
Look into my eyes as I fantasize for us
Still actin’ shy like this is summer class crush
Money comin’ fast, I’m never in a rush, no
Plus another twenty in the tuck
Semi in the truck, another forty on the wrist
Quarter-mill on my mind got me livin’ like I pitch
Dodging Robin Givens, balling like I’m Roger Clemens
Still in the game, uniform all linen
She get Chanel, ski trips to Vail
Only the highest grade, like trees that I inhale

[Hook: John Legend]
Yeah, I’m not afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And we’re not afraid to die
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Outro: John Legend]
Who do we think we are?
I don’t know about y’all, but I feel good tonight
There’s something in the air tonight
You know, everyone needs someone to look up to
Why shouldn't it be us?
Who do we think we are?
Tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Tell me, who do we think we are?

[Lenny Kravitz]
This is our song – our song for the future

[Intro: Jenna G]
'Nother
'Nother
'Nother

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on, babe, now I know what I have found

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
I'm so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamoured, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it? You got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

[Outro: Sam Smith]
I'm latching on to you
I won't let go of you
I'm latching on to you
I won't let go of you
I won't let go, I won't let go
I won't let go, I won't let go
He told me sweet lies of sweet loves
Heavy with the burden of the truth
And he spoke of his dreams
Broken by the burden
Broken by the burden of his youth

"Fourteen years," he said
"I couldn't look into the sun
She saw him laying at the end of my gun"
Hungry for life
And thirsty for the distant river

I remember his hands
And the way the mountains looked
The light shot diamonds from his eyes
Hungry for life
And thirsty for the distant river

Like the scar of age
Written all over my face
The war is still raging inside of me
I still feel the chill
As I reveal my shame to you
I wear it like a tattoo
I wear it like a tattoo
I wear it like a tattoo

[Verse 1]
There is a woman in Somalia
Scraping for pearls on the roadside
There's a force stronger than nature
Keeps her will alive
This is how she's dying
She's dying to survive
I don't know what she's made of
I would like to be that brave

[Chorus]
She cries to the heaven above
There is a stone in my heart
She lives a life she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand-new shoes
Hurts like brand-new shoes

[Verse 2]
There is a woman in Somalia
The sun gives her no mercy
The same sky we lay under
Burns her to the bone
Long as afternoon shadows
It's gonna take her to get home
Each grain carefully wrapped up
Pearls for her little girl

[Bridge]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Chorus]
She cries to the heaven above
There is a stone in my heart
She lives in a world she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand-new shoes
Hurts like brand-new shoes

[Chorus}
Too damn sexy
Too damn sexy
What's all the talking shawty show me something good
Too damn sexy
Too damn sexy
What's all the talking shawty show me wassup, wassup
Baby girl you ready, Know that I'm ready
Drop the top and she drop the drawers, she love to text and I never call
Baby girl you ready, Know that I'm ready
Drop the top and she drop the drawers, she love to text and I never call

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
All the money I pass out and make a skinny girl get ass shots,
Baller team you the mascot and wear gucci shoes to take trash out
Got a yellow bone, and a yellow car, and a yellow watch like lemonade
3 girl lemon like a dinnerdate
Big gucci don't discriminate
Got a black chick and she love Lenox
Spent 30 grand in 30 minutes
I stop hitting then get back in it
A strong back is recommended
She a shopoholic I'm a trapaholic
I capatilize she a capricorn
Put a bracelet on her that'd break her arm
I'm the last equipped and she the first to call
She a classy chick with nasty thoughts
Heads turn quick coz' the way she walk
I beat it up and then act all soft
Ever get caught cheating then it ain't my fault
Standing tall like Pau Gasol
I love to fuck and she love the mall
I drop the top and I drop the drawers
She love to text and I never call

[Chorus}
Too damn sexy
Too damn sexy
What's all the talking shawty show me something good
Too damn sexy
Too damn sexy
What's all the talking shwaty show me wassup, wassup
Baby girl you ready, Know that I'm ready
Drop the top and she drop the drawers, she love to text and I never call
Baby girl you ready, Know that I'm ready
Drop the top and she drop the drawers, she love to text and I never call

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Baby girl you ready, Know that I'm ready
Hop in my ghini' like mario and dreddy
If I gave to you you can have it I don't want it back that's deadly
Got black girls and got white girls and got red girls that's lesbi's
Every night like new year, Money like I'm Freddy
Hoes kissing in my section, New York perfection
I'm so high undress it, Got up in the morning step in
Took her out for dinner and she here cooking me breakfast!

[Chorus}
Too damn sexy
Too damn sexy
What's all the talking shawty show me something good
Too damn sexy
Too damn sexy
What's all the talking shwaty show me wassup, wassup
Baby girl you ready, Know that I'm ready
Drop the top and she drop the drawers, she love to text and I never call
Baby girl you ready, Know that I'm ready
Drop the top and she drop the drawers, she love to text and I never call

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Look for me
Lost in a whirlwind, 2012 quality
High up until the world ends, doing eighty-five in my ride
And these niggas hiding, know I'm striding like a giant
I ain't lying when I'm rhyming, rule these niggas like a tyrant
Damn, Doms, it don't even seem like you trying
Know these niggas crucify 'em, couldn't crack him, I'm a diamond
I know that niggas is finding my progression so uncommon
The pressure I'm still applying till I hear the angels crying
Sad day in Hell for those who doubted, hope your head explode
Cry about it, but don't deny that Doms got the realest flows
My eyes is feeling low, pulling on the killer 'dro
Chilling with a vixen, thinking "This is what I did it for"
Still banging, Wolf Ganging as if you niggas didn't know
Still trifling, Loiter Litter Life and triple sixing, ho

[Break: Earl Sweatshirt]
Doms, Doms
Doms

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
While they ripping through the packaging to grab the shit
I'm shaded with the few whom I usually blow cabbage with
New patterns patty-caking with mannequins
'Cause I don't like my fucking homies dip, bruh, they all
Jaw-slacking, all 'em awe struck
And I ain't got shit but a pretty bitch and cigar tucks
Riding in the city and knocking out in the Starbucks
I swear these niggas is fucking phony, smoking spliffs
And that's, prior to arriving to the studio
Eyes glued to a gluteus maximus, attractive lady
Where you headed with that shit?
And can a real nigga get a look at it?
Crook, panic-shook, ain't ya?
Blunt fatter than some butch ankles
Cheffing, fit the cook apron, ante up for good payment
Run until my foot achy, running till my foot aching
Full-grown terror type, Ferragamo do-rag
With my nigga Travy out in Maui, running two-mans
Smoking till I'm loopy as a motherfucking toucan
Twenty minutes, burn a fucking quarter back to two grams
But I'ma dip, I know you must have had it with my rude ass

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]

I been fly since the Big Bossman feud with the Mountie
Bobby Bacalhau, crocodile, know the proper style
Curtis Martin run the rock in for the Jets yo
I would watch my older cousins makin' profits on the steps, made my mind up
Never see me hustlin' for Honda's, Eyes are on the Zonda, eyes low from puffin ganja
My fuckin life is like a ghetto drama, sip the green tea
Polish off the metal cause we men of honor
You see the P, left side of the Cardigan sweaty
Well now you know that I'm a rocker like Marty Jannetty
The low shit, kill the pussy with the whole dick
Slicker than the oil on the marble with the flow shit
Hard bottoms cat's be clickin' like the horses do
We just dined, but I'm down to take your portion too
Smoke a few sticks, poke a few tricks
Shave the points off the game call it Blue chips
This ain't Shaq an penny action squeeze the Mac elevy
Tsunami lyric from the inner corner crack the levy
Snake the hash cause my skills tight pair the salmon with the dill right
Grab your hammer and hold your shield tight

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
My life is inches from death I blow the piff on the step
Spit the phlegm, hold my dick when I rap, plus the suede feet
Play the street, hear the music of the city lights flashin
With high fashion and some nice titties
Drug dealers sell the drugs are for realin
Angry mothers cuff there children when they walk in the buildin'
We stand tall, like the great wall i'll never fall
Disobey the law, summer spring and fall don't forget the winter
Before Splinter and the turtles, rock the lightweight
Lo' jacket with the man, hopin the hurdle vicious with verbal
Stuffed inside your bitch is a gerbil, seven platters on the table
Dutch's filled up with herbal, grow accustom to the fast life
Raise the glass, tap the glass twice now they flick the picture
Cause we passed nice Peace to Queens though heavy on the C-note
Ricky Steamboat one love Bronsolinio

[Intro]
You could fly
Nobody can touch you ... nobody
You could fly
Nobody can touch you

[Verse 1]
Ain't no question, ain't no conspiracy, yeah
Keep on searching for love, who else is incomplete?
There's so many good vibes just floatin' around in the world
And when the ground and sky combine, oh yeah
I'm feeling more than fine
I'm so Rock and Rollie

[Chorus]
Don't you feel it? Feel it? Feel it?
Don't you know that I'm unfuckwittable
Don't you feel it?
Don't you know that I'm unfuckwittable

[Verse 2]
One day I knew no one could help me in Hell
Not many people are true, fake as the lies they tell, no no no
The world is filled with good vibes, and that is what I seek
And now I'm feeling more than cool, oh yeah
I'm feeling more than cool, yeah
Them Jokers can't hold me

[Chorus]
Don't you feel it? Feel it? Feel it?
Don't you know that I'm unfuckwittable
Don't you feel it?
Don't you know that I'm unfuckwittable

[Chorus]
Don't you feel it? Feel it? Feel it?
Don't you know that I'm unfuckwittable
Don't you feel it?
Don't you know that I'm unfuckwittable

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
In my head your smile appears clear
Wish it wasn't my imagination running away with a dream
Your eyes they tell it all called it
Hope you have a good heart and you're smart
You've got a good head on your shoulders
That's what turns a nigga on, strong feelings that I have
You'll probably never, find out ever
I'll admire from afar, star
Keep doing all the great things you're doing
You got it going on, young lady

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Father John Misty]
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
How'd you get so fuckin cool?
Fools probably try to spit at you daily
The price you pay cause you're hot
Has anyone told you that you're fresh as hell
And I dig the way you wear your hair too
It makes you look more mature
See I just wanna be a man and I think you can be the one to guide me
But who the fuck am I kidding
Man you know they say I'm wild
But real people rarely come around if ever
You got it going on young lady

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Father John Misty]
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
You turn a nigga on, these feelings I have
You'll find out never, unless you're clever
I'll admire you from afar, star
Keep doing all the great things you're doing
You got it going on, young lady

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Father John Misty]
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady

[Verse 1: Haim]
Hey!
Love, hate, play this game of give and take
Go, stay, we all make mistakes
I'll say, what a wonderful escape
I embrace
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus: Haim & Kid Cudi]
Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)

[Verse 2: Haim]
I can't understand, I don't understand it
The visions in my head
I just can't make sense of it
I just can't make sense of it
I just can't make sense of it
Cause I can never run
I can never run, I can never run
There's no use for it baby
I can never run
I can never run, I can never run
I’m so used to you baby
I can never run, I can never run
There’s no use for it baby
I can never run
I can never run, I can never run
I’m so used to you baby

[Chorus: Haim & Kid Cudi]
Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Ooo-oh! Ooo-oh!
Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
Baby, Oh oh
Ooo-oh! Ooo-oh!
Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
Baby, Oh oh! Ooo-oh!

[Chrous: Haim & Kid Cudi]
Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)

[Intro: Kid Cudi]
I don't need, I don't need nobody

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Please shut the front door and walk right in
In the land of the man who rock it hard for them
Super Solo Dolo attack, run and tell that
If you'd like to know, yes, I am on acid
Who could it be? K-I-D
Searching all day in the streets for DMT
Don't sip it, though - it couldn't answer
Drip, trip all day - bumpin' MGMT, homie
Watch on who you hate on, fam', without the facts
Sad niggas back in the hood bumpin' Ratatat
To me it was a dream, a fiend to understand that
You never seen a nigga like me?
I just tell 'em I'm an oxymoron when I open my mouth
Cause people talk shit before knowing what I'm about
But for sure these Cleveland boys is ill
But pretty soon your gutter bitches wildin' for real, it's such a trip
Hoes around the globe, I'm known to have a fet'
I don't do a thing and these bitches lickin' they lips
Me and Chip reflect on all the hate and jibber jabber
Mmm, you almost got me, but sucker I'm not a sucker
Better get on back
You pussy motherfuckers get the Will Smith smack
And I am not a fronter, better look up the facts
The world know what it be: Mr. Rager, Solo Dolo, C.U.D., repeat it

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns
God blessed my tongue, I need it for life
Awkward like Cartwright, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I really want it - need it
Break bread - or break fast
Before I blast and break legs, ride past
And they scream out "little Johnny is dead!" (oh you dead nigga)
You wish me well, I wish you Hell
Eternity, no such thing as time will tell
Infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion
Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'
What's the definition of water?
Sherm sticks, sipped a gallon of it when you caught us
Turn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter
If my son heard it, probably look at you as his father
I'm proud of myself in a bad way
Halfway house, tell it to meet me halfway
I'm passin' out, ass whoopin'
Your ass lookin' for Michelle Obama 'til I bang on you
They couldn't

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns
God blessed my tongue, I need it for life
Awkward like Cartwright, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?

[Verse 1]
I guess I'm loony, I guess I'm on one
Guess I'm just a star of my movie
They say I'm the chosen, and so it goes
I'm supposed to live and grow old and die alone
Talking to myself in the mirror
Take one to know one
Can we talk, just loony to loony?
How strange the notion
You don't really know no one
And what if I told you
You no longer know me
You better keep going and keep it rolling now
Ain't no thing, you don't really need me
The pressure is growing
Hard times they mold you
Into someone way colder
Let the world see how you win
No matter how you seem to them
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em

[Chorus]
And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
M.A.D. S.O.L.A.R
And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
Oh, and people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
M.A.D. S.O.L.A.R

[Verse 2]
I guess I'm loony, I guess I'm on one
Guess I got to finish my movie
See my heart has been swollen, it's healing slow
Hope I don't live to grow old, no one at home
Staring at myself in the mirror, take one to know one
Want to find out 'bout the real me?
Certain moments reveal you
Especially friends who were never good friends
But want to act like they know me
You better keep going and keep on strolling
It's so crazy how you think you can play me
Show them pussies you're growing
Hard times, they mold you
To the haters, I told you
Let the world see how you win
No matter how you seem to them
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em

[Chorus]
And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
M.A.D. S.O.L.A.R
And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
M.A.D. S.O.L.A.R

Have us a good time, and I ain’t gonna lie

Got some friends around me, got some friends around me
Have us a good time, and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around, nigga slide by
Have us a good time and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around me, got some friends around me

Tonight we alive, we should give em a show
And my living room dance floor is ready to go
My people be on across the globe

[Intro: RZA]
Zig-Zag
Yo, check it
Ayo

[Verse 1: RZA]
Who could take a single buck, an empty cup, a stroke of luck
Fuck around and reconstruct it up to a million bucks?
In God we trust, every part of us is marvelous
You Krusty Krab squad, y'all will rust, y'all ain't hard enough
Demolition expert, I exert through your network
While the Tec squirt, jerk, there's holes inside your sweatshirt
Through your apparel, through your blood, through your bone marrow
Precise with this mic device, slice your pie like Sbarros
You falling nigga, and you can't get up
You been stalling motherfucker now your ass is stuck
Brooklyn, Brownsville, baby, stay with the Killer Hill crazy
Ankle strapped above the boot, it conceals my three eighty
Are you running for this money money? Hunting eggs like Easter Bunny
Geeks trying to beast upon me, freak, I will eat a zombie
Calm and double while you jumping through these hurdles
Silly rabbit, the race is always won by the turtle
Mental machinery, purple herbal mixed with that greenery
I don’t write songs, grasshopper, I write sceneries
Everything ain’t what it seems to be
What it means to you, it don’t mean to me
Bzzz, a sting from the killer bees

[Chorus: Kid Cudi and (RZA)]
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez on 'em)
Stings bitch, bzzzz...
BzzzzZZZzzz

[Verse 2: RZA]
I pass any test of litmus, I workout at 24 Fitness
On the weekends I sip Belvedere with that citrus
My dogs is vicious, exotic nympho whore for the mistress
Life is good, I live every day like it's Christmas
Happy New Year, I does what the fuck I wanna do here
I splash that Gucci shit from the shirt to the shoewear
Trust the rings out, wife beater tee with the wings out
Long dick stamina, I fuck a bird 'til she sings out
La la la la, Bobby could convert Lady Gaga
Back to heterosexual, I'm classy like Impala
Plus I'm federal, when it comes to making dollas
Like Jigga nigga man, if you hear me then holla
Gold rings like the Green Lantern you see me in the mean phantom
Pushing over there in Ohio, outside of Canton
Or maybe in the grotty, rugged projects of Staten
Tall redbone in my shower, she looking like Paula Patton

[Chorus: Kid Cudi and (RZA)]
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez on 'em)
Stings bitch

[Verse 1: King Chip]
If my niggas don't fuck wit' you, I don't fuck wit' you
That's just a code in my hood, don't let these guns hit you
Be a man of your word, don't ever let 'em play you
Stand up for your shit, make sure these haters pay you
Can't nothing stop a room full of real niggas
I got some bad rich bitches, they my real niggas
It's like working four jobs not to kill niggas
My little niggas love to ride by and spill niggas
If y'all fell out over some chips that ain't your real nigga
If y'all fell out over a chick that ain't your real nigga
Before I be a house nigga be a field nigga
I gotta Port Arthur chick, call it my trill nigga
I met Duke in '92 and we still niggas
Rockin Hilfigers before they was like chill niggas
Living well me and my niggas gon' eat
Before you hate, hit the brakes with both feet

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right

This is how it's 'posed to be

Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right, ohh

Hey yo, all right

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Max with the homies, try to teach them things
Teach them how to make a piece of change, even keep the change
But they never change, bought a set of chains with another chain
Upgraded to a better chain, that Beretta sing, I ain't playing
Shoes on the 'rari start to look like hooves
Pigs by the crib start to look like wolves
Money neva change me only change the situation
The paper I be chasin' got them sucka niggas hatin'
Started from the pavement, basement Satan
Couldn't match my flames so they compare me to a mason
Free like slaves but they based and crazy
We talkin' 'bout crack or we talkin' about blacks?
Spliffing the blunt up, then they pickin' the gun up
Motherfuckers is trippin', they fittin' to run up
Then they gettin' the come up, yup, bitch
And they do it 'til the sun up
And this is for my niggas and my gang
Through the fortune and the fame
Only thing that never change is my niggas

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be

[Post-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
I got the niggas that I need with me
Any issues my nigga you know to please hit me
No question no hesitation when it comes to holding fam down
If you creep me the fuck out you probably ain't around
Now you can hate on the side lines, I'm skippin past
You got me fucked up, keep talkin and kiss my ass
No sweatin the ho shit, too in tune with the family
I do got the ones that do know Scott
They give me the love that a nigga need
If it's a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
Word to Dennis, ridin' thick and thin until we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished, clothes on our kids
And keep my niggas from goin away on a bid
Only wanted all the fly shit when we got big
Chasin these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggas up so 'bout it, 'bout it they go blind about it
We all grown, families of our own
Providing for 'em real niggas, real morals that's the code
Perform so long as I am my brother's keeper
He will provide me with a nine if I need or a street sweeper
The love I have for my niggas is another type
You gotta real nigga down with you for your whole life
Love for my niggas
The brothers that I never had made my life a lot less sad, my nigga

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be

[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Yeah

[Verse: Kid Cudi]
Element of the surprise
Such a spectacular thing I cannot, lie
So many things people wanna limit you to be
I show you a glimmer inside the spectrum of the wizard
Well known as a getter and a nigga with a plan
The negative that come out they mouth, so sad
When I smash, wipe the smirk off they face, my bad
Who bad? I am, my dad raised one hell of a man
At eleven I had to throw on the pants
Still don't feel appreciated and not by my own fam
All good, I'll be tucked away in them shadows
Workin' in sweats, solve the riddle and soon I'm ready for battle
Move my fans with my love and they move me with theirs
We unified by the dark and middle fingers in air
Come on, who gon' go half on a zone?
Oh, thought I would be done off that coke, no
Let me tell you some' ho
Ben said "Everything that shine ain't gold"
Been skeetin' on pretty faces then my heart switched cold
Been the nigga sittin' in hell in fresh ass clothes
I know what it feels like to have a broken nose
And ain't nobody hit you in it
It's really 'cause that shit that you snorted and put all in it
That time you thought I was finished, no I just experimented
And it helped me adjust and be ok, with being demented
By the way nigga, these cars ain't rented, I give a fuck who sees
So I don't bother rollin' tinted, look who the fuck it be
That skinny Cleveland niggie, I stay reppin' my city bitch
Been smokin', no jokin', Cudder's had that itch, so I scratch

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
So please no more speculation 'bout that
Burn baby, burn, truthfully and noted, I'm back
So please no more speculation 'bout that
Burn baby, burn, truthfully and noted, I'm back

[Post-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Niggas think I'm livin' life paranoid
Mothafuck that, man
Oh, they got me twisted, they don't know that boy
Mothafuck that, man
I'm just gettin' busy, killin' it, I'm gettin' busy
Mothafuck them, man
I just wanna watch 'em burn, baby, burn
Niggas think I'm livin' life paranoid
Mothafuck that, man
Oh, they got me twisted, they don't know that boy
Mothafuck that, man
I'm just gettin' busy, killin' it, I'm gettin' busy
Mothafuck them, man
Now it's time to watch 'em burn, baby, burn
Hahaha, yahm

[Outro: King Chip]
Ahhh, ahhh, my leg!

[Intro]
Lord of the Sad and Lonely
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Won't you tell me who is; the supreme leader
Still underused, like I'm not a human heater
Move and groove, make a bitch linger
Want more than the dick, gold on the ring finger
Not the one to play dumb, see I'm from Cleveland bitch
Up in the hills, still keep it way triller than most
Wanna relax, someone tell me how that feels
I say that now until I go and pop this pill
I say out loud "You wanna let me cop a feel?"
Now I don't pray out loud but I know that my God heals
Bounce with me, if you don't give a fuck simply
Fed up, won't let up, on the overtime
The more I work, the more they wanna sweat mine
I can feel those lames, they love to speak my name
Sometimes dream of breakin' niggas whole faces
In front of the precinct, ain't scared of catchin' cases
Sky might fall, but I ain't worried at all
Got me some Xannies and a couple Adderall
Plus these racks I go distribute at the mall
In the spirit of God, with some Gandalf balls, yahm
Lord of the Sad and Lonely
And the ones that feel like shit on the daily
Don't let these phony niggas and hoes
Be the ones that bring you low
Let it be from the fatigue from making the pussy bleed
All of the things I've seen and survived
Make a nigga feel way more than just alive
You know my name, you know my face
All hail King WZRD in your motherfucking space
You love it

[Chorus]
Everyday, ev-ev-everyday
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep-yah
Lord of the Sad and Lonely
Yep-yep, yep-yep-yep-yep, yep, yep
Lord of the Sad and Lonely
Yep-yep-yep-yep, yep, yep, yep-yah
Lord of the Sad and Lonely
And the ones who feel like shit on the daily
I got you

[Verse 2]
Now I can show you how to make it, no Domingo Dean
In a way in which the universe has never seen
I feel attention when I'm struttin' in my Prada boots
Checkin' my fresh, if you want, I can style you
So unearthly, my profession is to wow you
Nigga how you not better than me? Listen, I swear to Je'
I feel like Baby back in '99
In the SLS stuntin' and it's all mine
Shittin' on these niggas, sippin' on some Swiss Kriss
I got some jewelry on it, sittin' on my slit wrists
My label fucking up my flow, see I'm getting pissed
Work too damn hard fam, for the shenanigans
Don't hang around bums, and that's how I win, fe fi fo fum
Haters, how do my cum taste? No more fun, no jokes, no smiles
Just a grin that suggest I'm the best
Living like I got a motherfucking pump on my left at all times
So many kids live their life through my rhymes
See, I'm in love with you all 'til the end
When shit was dark for me you were my only friends on the realer
So smoke some tree for your nigga
Ain't nobody got my bounce, know my kushy ounce
Walk in rooms and fuckboys close their mouth
The Cud life, you know what we about

[Outro]
Lord of the Sad and Lonely

[Verse 1]
I got my head on a swivel
Think it's time I open my mind where I left these niggas incompletely
Make sure that they can't delete me
I'm bout to rewire your whole fucking mainframe, sick of the same
Lame old same thing
I got some bubonic you might wanna mix with some whisk
I got a vendetta with showing niggas that I'm way better
Feeling way worthless, the lost black sheep of G.O.O.D. Music
Only good for a hook, huh? Let me show you flows
Intuitive when it comes to the many things I know
Cold, most winters I would dream of being a winner
Feeling like less than shit to the doubters
Pain I promise to all who oppose my knowledge
My reign, the fucking essence of pain, fuck rain
Standing in a monsoon of cool, time will tell
This is what it is when you're walking to hell

[Chorus]
Cold
Bitch you know I'm cold, yeah
I'm one cold blooded nigga
Oh, so cold
Niggas know I'm cold, yeah
One cold blooded nigga
Owie

[Verse 2]
I love how I can make so many people feel uneasy
Walk right past, I know you hoes see me
Can't deny the shine of a Jedi
World-class almighty super Cudder the Godly
Burbon, divas just smoking 'tiva, those my hobbies
I love shittin' on these niggas, that is my fave
Can't fuck with an unstoppable force
That lives with no regrets and of course no remorse
One two, one two, assholes now please listen close
I live for the day to watch all you pussies roast
Whoosah whoosah, so I don't slit nobody throat
Aw, it ain't my fault, homie thought he had the juice
Bash a nigga face and watch the blood leak
Put my ear where his jaw was, tell a nigga to speak
Standing in a monsoon of cool, karma is my armor
Was only scared of my father, beyond that I'm

[Chorus]
Cold
Bitch you know I'm cold, yeah
I'm one cold blooded nigga
Oh, so cold
Niggas know I'm cold, yeah
One cold blooded nigga
Cold
Bitch you know I'm cold, yeah
I'm one cold blooded nigga
Oh, so cold
Niggas know I'm cold, yeah
One cold blooded nigga
Owie

[Break]
Ah-ah-ahem!

[Verse 3]
Ugh, I like my alcohol straight, bitch
I can't stop stuntin', I need my brakes fixed
Yeah, I'm on that shit like a fucking maggot
On the road to riches; you niggas stuck in traffic
Stomp a nigga out, keep the party going
Kick them hoes out if them hoes annoying
But if they friends bad, then them hoes could join
I'm 'bout to shoot a porn; I'm castin': broken arm
Got money on my mind, pussy on my agenda
I beat that pink pussy magenta, fuck bein' gentle
Man, I'm hard; these niggas is simple, gun to your temple
I smoke 'til I look Oriental, high as a window
And I broke these niggas like pencils
Unaccidental—bitch, I meant to
Dick in her dimples; lick it, I tremble
I swear, this shit is mental, fuck it, my rent due
I school your ass and suspend you, you bitch, you!
It's Tunechi!

[Chorus]
And I don't know how fake feel, nigga
'Cause all my life I been a real nigga (Real nigga)
Yeah, all my life I've been a real nigga (Real nigga)
Don't fuck up my night, I'm like:
"What's poppin'?" (What's poppin'?)
"What's your friend name?" (What's happenin'?)
"What y'all drinkin' on?" (What's poppin'?)
"Come get a oil change" (What's happenin'?)
I brung my AK (Bah!) I'm on my "A" game (Bah!)
Bitch, I'm a a-hole (Bah!), leavin' shit stains (Bah!), ho!

[Outro]
Bah!
Haha!
Young Mula, baby!

[Verse 1]
I could've died in your arms tonight
Felt so complete
All I needed was you right there
No need to speak
I've got a long noon ahead
So I have to leave
She said it's coming down outside
Why don't you just stay with me?

[Hook]
It's snowing outside on a Saturday
Cold out there so I have to stay
And there's no place that I'd rather be
Than havin' you layin' in my arms all day
So drink this tea, put the radiator on
Get under the cover, I'ma keep you warm
If this is how love feels
I wanna keep it around and 'round and 'round

[Verse 2]
Uh, baby girl, I'm so convinced that you're all I need
I swear when I'm wit' you, it's like there's no world outside
Just you and me
And I don't think that I've ever felt this way, yeah
Ohh, I'm layin' in bed with one of the most beautiful girls
That I ever seen

[Hook]
It's snowing outside on a Saturday
Cold out there so I have to stay
And there's no place that I'd rather be
Than havin' you layin' in my arms all day
So drink this tea, put the radiator on
Get under the cover, I'ma keep you warm
If this is how love feels
I wanna keep it around and 'round and 'round

[Verse 3]
I said baby you looking great
I was hoping I could take you
Going down by the river like a fisherman with his bait
You see your body take the cake
Thick, plus you're tough as steak
Jordan's wanna break, I was hoping I could stay
Because its snowing outside on a Saturday
And being skin-to-skin is goin' half the way
And sheesh, there's no place that I rather be
Than under these covers 'cause God knows I love ya
I swear it be the way that we're touchin' that got me buggin'
And it be your every position that's got me trippin'
And you don't need to worry about stressin', I'll do the dishes
Just make sure the tea is lifting come on
I'm feeling like, your long hair and your soft skin
A bright smile baby you don't need no porcelain
Love it when we take those adventures through them iChat pictures
One look into them eyes, I done lost that, I'm like

[Hook]
It's snowing outside on a Saturday
Cold out there so I have to stay
And there's no place that I'd rather be
Than havin' you layin' in my arms all day
So drink this tea, put the radiator on
Get under the cover, I'ma keep you warm
If this is how love feels
I wanna keep it around and 'round and 'round

[Outro]
That's how we get down, nigga
That's how we get down, nigga
That's how we get down, nigga
That's how we get down, nigga
That's how we get down, nigga
That's how we get down, nigga
That's how we get down, nigga
That's how we get down, nigga
Swag me out, bitch

[Verse 1]
New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down
New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down
Like a rat in a cage, pulling minimum wage
New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down

[Verse 2]
New York, you're safer and you're wasting my time
Our records all show you were filthy but fine
But they shuttered your stores when you opened the doors
To the cops who were bored once they'd run out of crime

[Verse 3]
New York, you're perfect, oh, please don't change a thing
Your mild billionaire mayor's now convinced he's a king
And so the boring collect, I mean all disrespect
In the neighborhood bars I'd once dreamt I would drink

[Verse 4]
New York, I love you, but you're freaking me out
There's a ton of the twist, but we're fresh out of shout
Like a death in the hall that you hear through your wall
New York, I love you, but you're freaking me out

[Verse 5]
New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down
New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down
Like a death of the heart, Jesus, where do I start?
But you're still the one pool where I'd happily drown

[Chorus 1]
And, oh! Take me off your mailing list
For kids who think it still exists
Yes, for those who think it still exists
Maybe I'm wrong and maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong and maybe you're right
Maybe you're right, maybe I'm wrong
And just maybe you're right

[Chorus 2]
And, oh! Maybe mother told you true
And there'll always be somebody there for you
And you'll never be alone
But maybe she's wrong and maybe I'm right
And just maybe she's wrong
Maybe she's wrong and maybe I'm right
And if so, here's this song

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunnyhop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D (Star Trak)
Made a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs
Shit, (what?) now I kick it in the 'burbs

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Me? I'm from the slums, niggas who push a ton
Ton of drums, with foul flow, dirty mouth, like kissing bums
Mama done made her one, um, a witty son
With no respect for women, so show me your titties hun (what?)
You eighteen? Me? I'm twenty-somethin'
OK, I'm twenty, but I'm soon to be twenty-one
I wild out at shows, break shit, it should be fun
Venues are like pussy with me, "Should he come?"
I'ma wax that like the chapstick in my backpack for my black lips
Then dip to Europe and come back with a stack of cheese
A stack of cheese for these rats, um, that mac and cheese
New 'Preme shit got me feeling flyer than a bag of bees
Fuck critics ("How's your dick?") Shit, how's your knees?
Y'all on my dick more than my index when I take a pee (Damn)
I came up with ''Rella'', ain't touch a bag of weed (Word?)
Shit was doper than Whitney Houston's needs
Golf Wang, that's the team to be, ay
Getting T.U., O.F., indeed
We was missing Sweatshirt, like "Where's the hooded sleeve?"
Okay, nevermind, we found him, yeah

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunnyhop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D
Made a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs
Shit, now I kick it in the 'burbs

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Guess I win, checks started cashing in
I stop rapping and start asking where my fucking passion is
Probably where that faggot went (who?) Tyler talking father problems
Shocking shit, he spit to popping topics in them gossip columns
I ain't ask for this, I did it out of boredom
Thought that roach was cool, he died and pushed me into stardom
Now; Ye's, PJs, sipping leche
Chips Ahoy, boy, listening to "Cowboy", ay!
Boy, land in Melbourne and skate to Fitzroy, ay!
AUS was awes', I enjoyed, boy
Y'all niggas played as a tot's toy
Have a good day as I annoy, oi

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunnyhop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D
Made a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs
Shit, now I kick it in the 'burbs

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Canons with panorama views
My shoes that seen more vans than Mexicanas
Or crackers in Alabama
G-O-to-the-L-F, this OF
I opened up a store so I don't stress
But nigga, I (what?) mosh in gardens
Jazz punk shit, playing chords
Making up shit, pardon my Dolly Partons
And I keep shartin'
Hoodies with rectangles and different colors
Niggers think I started kindergarten

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Frank Ocean & Both]
My bitch is on my handle bars
I, just, wanna, ride, my bike
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
My bitch is on my handle bars
Hair blowing in the wind
Her freckles look like candy bars
Hair blowing in the wind
My bitch is on my handle bars
I, just, wanna, ride, my bike
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
My bitch is on my handle bars (Handle bars)
Hair blowing in the wind (Ooohh)
Her freckles look like candy bars (Shit)
My cool summer never ends (Cool)
My bitch is on my handle bars
Yeah (Bars, bars)
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Oh my God, seriously? Mister Cool Guy, haha
You're talking to a fucking bike, loser
Hehe, oh fuck

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Ayyo hit or miss shorty wake up shorty shit the fish
Razor sniff, leave the pocket when you see the Blitz
You never know the type of pickle you in
Till you wake up in a cell and nuts will tickle your chin
It's Vinny Gorgeous with the sinister grin
And if it wasn't for the drugs I'd probably be in the gym
If I'm not up in the studio, I'm up in your wife
If you had a bigger package she'd be up in your life
In 93' I had to cop me the Flights, started plottin the heist
So I cop me a knife, these sneakers cost a hundred forty duke
I'm stoppin' your life, better yet I'll cut your cock off with the choppin device
You never know it could be you up on the table
Emergency rush in will pull your bladder through your navel
Special pants cover that feces bag, another man rockin that chain
And the piece he had, We kill the cow carve it for the proper preparations
Braise the leg sir the loin make the brisket Cajun
Rib eye prime prefer you leave the bone in, the tomahawk chop is only meant for grown men
Zonin' sequin shirts with the stone gems
I'll never have it, duke—I'd rather let the chrome sin
Equip for the rip, you faggot pussies sit where you piss
These queens killers hit the strip with the sniff, bitch
Roll up the grass crazy willy man will stuff your ass
With a gerbil, serve your girl a custard mask
Crush the glass, dip my fist and step inside the ring
Inside the bing,pussy ran he tried to hide the thing
Come through to the courts, a hundred down from any spot
Dribble shoot, the penny drop just like a henny shot
You look astonished, face twisted like a Twizzler
My people laughin cause they know we goin sizzler
Purpose to life, prestige pussy plenty paper
Steam risin off Jacuzzi women different flavors
Whips are major, shits aggressive like a vicious saber
You trick the paper, tell your bitch that I'mma hit it later
Accurate palm strikes, on like disposition, John Stockton
I'm scoring and I'm also dishin
Magic long night pipe with no intermission
Put on the DL, Tommy John no more pitchin
This is Queens watch words, just like Persian
Jissepe Dishdo Automatic with the conversion
You never know might be the next to meet the surgeon
Split like a pig, and left you bleedin like a virgin
Inhaler of smoke the fine chronic conoisseur
We Bobba Ghanoush the tan colored pile of Raw
The humus and bread, olives from another land
And fuck a burger, i'd rather eat the mother lamb
I'm Royce Gracie the magician of submission, elegance in the kitchen
My ambition ain't to glisten, but yo, Fuck all the jewelery shit
Provide me with a sturdy whip, a package on the dirty bitch
Titty size a 36, 30 dicks what she takin in a single sittin
Silk and linin what I'm sportin when the Eagles winnin
Yo bet the oval, cause the corners are a little iffy
In a minute turn a macho man a little sissy
I'm never pissy, all the women wanna kiss the
Flushin grizzly, heavy but they never diss me
Cause I be in and out of pussy like a stream of piss
Gleam the wrist, nah fuck it, rather steam the bliss

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here, 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never want to say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here, 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No! Hear me out now!
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now! Hear me out now!
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now!

[Breakdown: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Verse 1]
What shall we use
To fill the empty
Spaces
Where waves of hunger roar?
Shall we set out across this sea of faces
In search of more and more applause?

[Breakdown]

[Verse 2]
Shall we buy a new guitar?
Shall we drive a more powerful car?
Shall we work straight through the night?
Shall we get into fights?
Leave the lights on?
Drop bombs?
Do tours of the East?
Contract diseases?
Bury bones?
Break up homes?
Send flowers by phone?
Take to drink?
Go to shrinks?
Give up meat?
Rarely sleep?
Keep people as pets?
Train dogs?
Race rats?
Fill the attic with cash?
Bury treasure
Store up leisure
But never relax at all?
With our backs to the wall

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Now everybody wanna know, know, know who that kid
Young boss how them thoughts run through that wig
You have the cars I can move that quick
So don't get put in the dirt, just putting in work, I do that shit
When I pull up in the spot niggas frown that face
Probably cause I grabbed their main squeeze 'round that waist
Off to the side, light a spliff, down that case
Let's get it popping 'till the lights on

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm a Steel City veteran
Tools like a Leatherman
End up with some numbers on your chest like a letterman
Jacket when the ratchet let
One up in your eggshell
The tool he's like Whitney and them, waiting to exhale
The goonies got plenty of them
Head trip the kid's a goner
I got plenty of wolves
Don't make me sick them on you
I'm that sick, but I arrive at the eaves
Relax it, with a bad chick twisting my trees
And count cheese 'till it's stacked to the sky
These dudes mad at the guy
I talk shit and I'm actually fly
Yeah I back it up
Couple grand dog I'll help you wrap it up
No, you ain't the shit but I'mma take the shit, pack it up
It's young Wiz and Tha Hustla
Ain't a damn motherfucker up in here that could fuck with us
This that real Steel City boy rap
Can any boy clap
Steel City on, map

[Hook 2]

[Verse 1 : Game]
Hey yo I’m full of that purp

I hit the block like what, them boys can’t fuck with that phantom
Put them 6s down in buck kid, I fuck with Atlanta

Shining like the staple center lights when Kobe go for 40 looking like mike!
Don’t compare me to these rap niggas I’m not like ‘em, I swear to God

You can ask the broads, I like my bitch authentic no fake
Titties or ass

So pull a 38 on yeah, turn a nigga mike on

Bigger than that nigga face and that’s foul, game

[Hook : Soulja Boy]
I’m fucked up and I’m faded
I said I’m fucked up and I’m faded
We got peach sirock syrup ‘tron, peach sirock syrup ‘tron, peach sirock syrup ‘tron
Faded, I’m faded, faded
She faded, faded, he faded, faded, we faded
Faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, I’m fucked up

[Verse 2 : Soulja Boy]
Puff pop and I pass on, rich nigga young asshole

Pound 

[?] that’s a beat up, 50 k on my sleeve bro
And I’m fresh fuck and my sleeve up
These niggas riding won’t be us
Everyday we get the bump, riding round smokin’ grind
2012 red Bentley mean, gang driving through compton
Bad bitches by the dozen, no police I ain’t coughing
And niggas saying they got swag
But it’s money gang or nothing
I’m high as fuck see it in my eyes
Shouts out game that number 5
Fresh as fuck till a nigga die

Fick you niggas talking bout, we get cash by large amounts
I’m fucked up and I’m faded, got a mansion up in Las Vegas

[Hook]
I’m fucked up and I’m faded
I said I’m fucked up and I’m faded

Faded, I’m faded, faded
She faded, faded, he faded, faded, we faded
Faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, I’m fucked up

[Verse 1]
Betwixt and between, the fantastic dream and the fear
Do you wonder where she is this afternoon?
And does it get on your nerves, make you slightly perturbed
That there's things that you don't know about her?
And even the places that she's never been with you
Seem awful empty without her

[Chorus]
You can't look into those eyes
Down no telephone line
What if you were right first time?
You can't look into those eyes
Down no telephone line
What if you were right first time?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Betwixt and between, the fantastic dream and the fear
Do you wonder where she is this afternoon?
And with the needle in groove, is there owt to prove?
And tell me, are your feet still tapping?
I know there’s a first for a trip over the water
What is the worst that could happen?

[Chorus]
You can't look into those eyes
Down no telephone line
What if you were right first time?

[intro]
Like a waterfall in slow motion
(Alright)
Like a map with no ocean

[Hook] 

[Mike Posner]:
I'm still tryna to do it big for my home town

Somebody take my coat alright
Got the... to the game oh good

Apologies for that (I'm sorry) I gotta keep my suitcase packed
You can add it to the arsenal
Kobain Donnie Darko flow
Hey lady, I didn't catch your name lady
Let me do it to you good all night
Cause the nose ring might as well be a bulls eye
Let me clear my throat

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]:
The goal was to go and get Scott Storch doe
And stay away from Scott Storch clothes
Have I done yet not quite
I'm back in your city, never the same chick twice
Damn homie in high school you was the man homie
Damn, fuck happen to you
All my plaques just sittin in the closet
Cause I ain't have time to get in no spot yet
Don't I just glide on the beat
Ain't I so smooth on that motherfucka
Bingo
My mixtape shit going harder than your single
Let me clear my throat

[Verse 3: Elzhi]:
What up doe? Elzhi broadcasting live from the district. Motown, Great Lakes, Detroit stand up!
Could we be called the Motor City, cause we're living in the fast lane?
Get gas drivin a flash all of out cash gain
May die tryin to stay fly like a crashed plane
Tryin to get pass pain, doctor's splash rain on gash
Within your mass brain from a blast, now your ass slain
The whole hood is high on, pill, glass, 'caine
With many stuck, needles in they last vein
Sharp as a tuxedo when they clash in upper class Spain
And I ain't bullshittin'
The wolves gettin' inside of this wool mitten so cold
(Alright)
They growin' up near these auto industry entities
You instantly keep an eye on your role
Let me clear my throat

[Verse 4: Dusty McFly]:
D-town Westside
D-town Eastside

313 is in the building
Here we go yeah
Mamma been laid off
Pappa been laid off
My brother's been laid off
For more than two years now
Ooh can't get a job
Billy can't get a job
They gotta listen to the blues

Help them to strive
Help them to move on
Help them to have some future
Help them to live long
Help them to live life
Help them to smile
Don't let them stay home
And listen to the blues

Pappa been laid off
Mamma been laid off
Billy can't get a job
For too long, too long
Don't let them lose
We gotta give them a chance
It's gonna come back on everyone
If you don't make them dance
Don't let them stay home
And listen to the blues
There's nothing sacred
Breathing hatred
We have to face it
No one can take it
And feel no pain

Mamma been laid off
Pappa been laid off

Ooh, can't get a job

Help them to live long

Don't let them stay home
And listen to the blues

One day we're gonna wake up
And the ghetto's all around
All over, my friend
Have you ever seen a man break down?
Do you know how, how that feels?
To walk the streets
With your head held high

Oh Lord, have mercy
Did you ever see a man break down?

There's nothing sacred
Breathing hatred
We have to face it
No one can take it
And feel no pain

Ooh, did you ever see a man break down?

[Verse 1]
I'm so afraid
Of all the mistakes that I've made
Shaking every time that I awake
I feel like a cardboard cut-out man

[Hook]
So build me a time
When the characters rhyme
And the story line is kind

[Verse 2]
I've aged and aged since the first page
I've lived every line that you wrote
Take me down, take me down
From the shelf above your head

[Hook]
And build me a time
When the characters rhyme
And the story line is kind

[Verse 3]
I live where I'm left
On the shelf like the rest
And the epilogue reads like a sad song
Please pick up your camera
And use me again

[Hook]
And build me a time
When the characters rhyme
And the storyline is kind
Yeaaaah!

[Spoken Verse]
Pass the tequila, Manuel
(Glug, snort)
Listen, gringo, laugh at my lisp and I kill you
I think
This Spanish music
It sets my soul on fire
Lovely señorita
Your eyes are like stars
Your teeth are like pearls
Your ruby lips

[Verse 1]
Been thinkin' 'bout this all damn day, oh, woah
And I can't wait to see your face, mmm, oh
My hands are dyin' to touch ya, oh, I
But I ain't got the patience to wait
And I think it's time that I lose control, lose control
And in my mind, I'm sexual, sexual

[Chorus]
Girl, are you ready? (Ready)
Are you ready for love? (Ready)
Girl, are you ready? (Ready)
Are you ready for us? (Ready)
Girl, are you ready? (Ready)
Are you ready for love? (Ready)
Girl, are you ready? (Ready)
To glow in the dark (Ready)

[Verse 2]
Oh, na-na-na, it's okay to scream
And if you need to, take a second to breathe (Ah)
Hey, there it is, I can feel your legs tremblin'
You feel the sweat drippin' from my chest
And then you like, "Oh-oh-oh, baby, don't stop"
Then I'll be like, "No, I won't, I'ma take ya to the top" (Oh)

[Chorus]
Girl, are you ready? (Yeah, yeah, ready)
Are you ready for love? (Ready)
Girl, are you ready? (Ready)
Are you ready for us? (Ready)
Girl, are you ready? (Ready)
Are you ready for love? (Ready)
Girl, are you ready? (Ready)
To glow in the dark (Ready)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Girl, are you ready? (Ready)
Are you ready for love? (Ready)
Girl, are you ready? (Ready)
Are you ready for us? (Ready)
Girl, are you ready? (Ready)
Are you ready for love? (Ready)
Girl, are you ready? (Ready)
To glow in the dark (Ready)
Skeletons in your closet
Itchin' to come outside
Messin' with your conscience
In a way your face can't hide

Oh things are gettin' real funky
Down at the old corral
And it's not the skunks that are stinkin'
It's the stinkin' lies you tell

What did your mama tell you about lies
She said it wasn't polite to tell a white one
What did your daddy tell you about lies
He said one white one turns into a black one

So, it's gettin' ready to blow
It's gettin' ready to show
Somebody shot off at the mouth and
We're gettin' ready to know

It's gettin' ready to drop
It's gettin' ready to shock
Somebody done turned up the heater
An'a it's gettin' ready to pop
Crevices in your pantry
Now what do we have in here
Havin' a daytime nightmare
Has always been your biggest fear

Oh things are gettin' real crucial
Up the old wazoo
Yet you cry, why am I the victim?
When the culprit's why-o-you, oo oh

What did your mama tell you about lies
She said it wasn't polite to tell a white one
What did your daddy tell you about lies
He said one white one turns into a black one

So, it's gettin' ready to blow
It's gettin' ready to show
Somebody shot off at the mouth and
We're gettin' ready to know

It's gettin' ready to drop
It's gettin' ready to shock
Somebody done turning the heater
An' a it's gettin' ready to pop

It's gettin' ready to seep
You're gettin' ready to freak
Somebody done picked up the talk box
We're gettin' ready to speak
It's gettin' ready to jive
It's gettin' ready to gel
Somebody done gone let the lid off
We're gettin' ready to smell

They're gettin' ready to deal
You're gettin' ready to ill
Somebody done just dropped the big dime
And they're gettin' ready to squeal

It's gettin' ready to turn
We're gettin' ready to learn
Somebody done fired up the brimstone
And you're gettin' ready to burn

It's gettin' ready to shake
You're gettin' ready to ache
Somebody done snitched to the news crew
And it's gettin' ready to break

You're gettin' ready to lie
They're gettin' ready to spy
Somebody's been put on the hot seat
And you're gettin' ready to fry

[Intro: Lil Keke]
Yeah, H-Town all stars in the building, that's right
Lil Keke the don, yes
Check it out

[Verse 1: Lil Keke]
Seven-thirteen homey, I been on
Yeah we been here and y'all sho been gone
Screwed up captain, still repping the south
And can't none of y'all cut me off, I'm alive
Make 'em southside, cause that's Texas pride
Pimp C got me swangin' it wide, so be quiet
Bey still repping it right for H-Town
Don Keke's draped up, chopped and screwed down

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I've been on, I've been on
Since back when I had braids on my dome
Underground king, sitting on my throne
Me and Bey done did number one songs
Riding candy and chrome, this Texas
Could buy a Bentley cash with this necklace
This H-Town, we drive reckless
We make 'em bow down, they gon' respect us

[Hook: Beyoncé]
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off

[Verse 3: Willie D]
I am Houston, rep it hard
Cup with R, candy cars
Geto Boys, Willie D
You're plexing with Bey, you're plexing with me
These dudes in the streets, be acting mob
But go to the pen, and be playing with them boys
They are not me, they're carbon copies
If God got me, who gon' stop me

[Verse 4: Scarface]
I been on, now who you goons gon' get to knock me off?
I've been boss, been on slabs, been on paint
Been on fours homey, I've been on drank, I've been had bank
Twenty-five years and ain't fell off yet, cause my flow that wet
You don't want no plex, they talk that sh-
The Queen Bey said you better bow down, bow down

[Hook: Beyoncé]
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off

[Verse 5: Z-Ro]
On, I could never be off
Hit the boulevard so hard, it'd never be soft
Elbows so long, looking like they reach out
Set of diamonds and gold in damn near each mouth
They call it Styrofoam City; Houston, Texas to be exact
Swangas on anything, it ain't gotta be a Lac
If I say I got sixteen, it ain't gotta be a rap
All them d-boys in them traps, they gotta feel that

[Verse 6: Bun B]
We the big ballers and big bodies in fresh foreigners
Fresh up off the road from hustling and rap touring
While you sleeping and snoring, we creeping and pouring
BaddieBey and the Bun, baby, you can't ignore 'em
Represent for Port Arthur, get it right off the water
How you want it hard or soft, put in your order
Never the hesitators, shaking off all the haters
Ridin' for Pimp, Screw and all the Lone Star Staters, hol' up

[Hook: Beyoncé]
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off

[Outro: Beyoncé]
I remember my baby hair with my dookie braids
Frenchy’s, Boudin in the parking lot
Shout out to Willie D
I was in that Willie D video when I was about fourteen, looking crazy
Shout out Pimp C
You know we used to sneak and listen to that UGK
Didn’t do your girl but your sister was alright, damn
In ya homeboy’s Caddy last night man, haha
Hold up, Texas trill
H-Town going down, man

[Verse 1]
I was standing by the Nile
When I saw the lady smile
I would take her out for a while
For a while

[Verse 2]
Like tears left like a child
How her golden hair was blowing wild
Then she spread her wings to fly
For to fly

[Verse 3]
Soaring high above the breezes
Going always where she pleases
She will make it to the islands in the sun

[Verse 4]
I will follow in her shadow
As I watch her from my window
One day I will catch her eye

[Verse 5]
She is calling from the deep
Summoning my soul to endless sleep
She is bound to drag me down
Drag me down
In a churchyard by a river
Lazing in the haze of midday
Laughing in the grasses and the graves

Yellow bird, you are not lone
In singing and in flying on
In laughing and in leaving

Willow weeping in the water
Waving to the river daughters
Swaying in the ripples and the reeds

On a trip to Cirrus Minor
Saw a crater in the sun
A thousand miles of moonlight later

[Verse 1]
We smile and smile
We smile and smile
Laughter echoes in your eyes

[Verse 2]
We climb and climb
We climb and climb
Footfalls softly in the pines

[Verse 3]
We cry and cry
We cry and cry
Sadness passes in a while

[Verse 4]
We roll and roll
We roll and roll
Help me roll away the stone

[Verse 1]
Heavy hung the canopy of blue
Shade my eyes and I can see you
White is the light that shines through the dress that you wore

[Verse 2]
She lay in the shadow of the wave
Hazy were the visions of her playing
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine made her blind ev’ry time

[Verse 3]
Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind
Envy is the bond between the hopeful and the damned

[Verse 1]
The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high
The ravens all are watching from a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping like a tube-train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end? Will the final couplet rhyme?

[Chorus]
And it’s high time, Cymbaline
It’s high time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

[Verse 2]
A butterfly with broken wings is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in, there’s nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agent are both busy on the phone
Selling coloured photographs to magazines back home

[Chorus]
And it’s high time, Cymbaline
It’s high time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

[Verse 3]
The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You hear the thunder of the train
And suddenly it strikes you that they’re moving into range
And Doctor Strange is always changing size

[Chorus]
And it’s high time! (High time), Cymbaline
It’s high time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

[Chorus]
And it’s high time, Cymbaline
It’s high time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

[Intro: Denzel Washington in Training Day]

[Intro]
This is a public service announcement
We call it Blood Sport
I had to do one too, I sorry
I'm a competitor
Oh my God, it's about to get hideous
I hope you niggas know your history

[Chorus]
Homie go ask Doc (talk about me)
Homie go ask Nas (and he'll tell ya)
Homie go ask Jay (young fella)
But when you ask them all (don't be jealous)
I'm the best in LA. In LA
Or wherever the fuck that you stay

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
It's all copastetic
Hip-hop no longer face Armageddon
Call me Bruce Willis
No call me lieutenant tinted windows on the black benz
So they only see it late nights like Jay Leno
I fuck twice your girlfriend probly told you we can't fuck
No, she lying
Oh my god I am the best rapper under 25 you can underline it
You abusing the game you defiant
Disobedient student need attention
Have parent conference I'll be there, Just let me know what classroom you in my son
I am Dwyane Wade of recording
You more like Kobe Bryant with no endorsements
That's like Shaq at the freethrow, pointless
I'm equivalent to a Earl Boykins, Spud Webb, Muggsy Bogues
I suppose I handle the rock well
I do hoes like Stockton and Malone: make my pick then roll
The ugly ones go to Sam Cassell
You washed up like Nick Van Exel
Shawn Kemp, Robert Parish, John Salley whole career on the bench
Let's get deeper in these NBA statistics
My team something like the retro Celtics
Which means consecutive championships
Which means I'm Larry Bird's equivalent
To the way I do a verse he handle the ball
The same way I handle it with no pen
I call Jay Rock when I wanna dish it off
He bang like Vince Carter when he first saw NBA Court
Alley oop the court let him do what he want
Bang. Aw fuck it let's talk more sports
How bout football?
I run the game like Walter Payton back 1984
I'm pass you niggas like Peyton Manning
Play the field like Ray Buchanan
When I kick it like Morton Anderson it gets scary
Weight on my shoulder, refrigerator Perry
Hip-hop cops on me, I dodge 'em like Barry
Sanders
John Madden hold your commentary
Keep the cameras on I'm primetime like the '95 Deion
Should I keep going?
Aw fuck it let me keep going
I'mma do it like the '97 T Owens
Not the ‘07 T Owens
T Owens with Jeff Garcia throwing the pigskin
Y'all need to work on y'all defense
I train like Warren Sapp on the weekend
Maneuver like Warrick Dunn
I'm just having a little fun have some with me
Let's go baseball now the '94 Ken Griffey
One man roster matter fact I'm the '96 Mike Piazza
MVP of LA, call the doctor
I came up with my assumptions I must be rap ESPN or something
It’s about time for halftime reporting
I’m a star kicking niggas off the field and court man
I know you good with the right but you still ain’t nice till you do it with the left hand
You ain’t nice till you play all positions
Or knock it out the stadium, hey wait a min
I got tickets to the all star game, to pro bowl game baby girl bring a friend
I’m a get you in, I’m a take you out, I’m a stick it in
You might say, "ouch"
Just let me score one time
Dribble my balls to the floor one time
I’d be going for a week bet they gon’ miss me more than a pitch from Nolan Ryan
I am the Jeff Gordon of recording
I am Tony Hawk if I was skateboarding
I am Michael Irv before the coke snortin'
Aw fuck it I’m what’s ever important
After this you gon applaud him
If not, fuck it, I’m blood-sportin'
Homie, I’m blood sport

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Ya’ll niggas ran out of time to get ya’ll shit together, man
I’m here
Hey, hey, hey, hey Moose what I gotta do, boy?

[Verse 1]
I've got myself in a masochistic hold
Why don't you let go?
Shake it off just to redirect my flow
Come on, let's go
Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middleweight
We don't stop rock around the clock
Motor-mouthing off in front of every other road block

[Pre-Chorus]
Come again and tell me
What you're going through
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due

[Chorus]
Memories of everything of lemon trees on Mercury and
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything that blew through

[Verse 2]
Looking up into a reverse vertigo
What an undertow
Give it up, another stubborn Scorpio
Come on, let's go
Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middleweight
We don't stop, rock around the clock
Motor-mouthing off in front of every other road block

[Pre-Chorus]
Come again and tell me
What you're going through
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due
To the moon she gave
Another good review
Turn around and look at me
It's really, really you

[Chorus]
Memories of everything of lemon trees on Mercury and
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything that blew through

[Bridge]
Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middleweight
We don't stop, rock around the clock
Motor-mouthing off in front of every other road block

[Chorus]
Memories of everything of lemon trees on Mercury and
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything that blew through
Memories of everything of lemon trees on Mercury and
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything that blew through

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said, "You've got to go back"
You know they didn't even give us a chance

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say, "You can make it okay
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain"

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said, "Say what you doing in bed?"
I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace"

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Bridge: John Lennon]
Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said, "Poor boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you but your soul"
Think!

[Verse 4: John Lennon]
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspaper said, "She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag"

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 5: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said, "We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back"

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Outro]

[Hook: Macklemore]
Now you know what's good for you
Got that, not gonna warn you
We got that to make it right right right
You know all my women, I adore you
Bodies wanna absorb too
The energy, melody life life life
Now you know what's good for you
Got that, not gonna warn you
We got that to make it right right right
You know all my women, I adore you
Bodies wanna absorb too
The energy, melody life life life

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
See I don't know why I gotta go and creep around
You've seen me and my penis
Not used to having to sleep without somebody
And I've been chugging alcohol and I'm leaving now
And I don't wanna go home alone tonight
I was freaking with some hunny named Lisa
She was squeezing alpha Puerto-Rican Diva
Weaving her hair with the cleavage out
Expedin' by the V
She's flashing the keys to go peep the house
And then my phone rings, it's my girl on the line
It's like, I don't know what the hell to do
It's like women like this are seldom and few
I'm fucked up in the club with a blunt and a butt
But my love will hang up if I tell her the truth
See, I can be a selfish dude especially when
I'm off a blunt and a brew but
But she's so sexy, now let me spend the night
It's like help, either way I'm screwed
Get it?
See if I lie, I got my conscience to deal with
But if I go wakin' up in the ride then I'm gonna get
To grind with a fine Puerto-Rican Brazilian
But is it really worth it? I don't know
I gotta ask myself that question
Booty's truly an option
But it's not gonna suit me like my girl Evan

[Hook]
I don't wanna do it but I can't help it
I'm so selfish
Lady, what you want me to say?
Foolish
The lies and deception
I tried to confess it
Committed, but I still wanna play
I don't wanna do it but I can't help it
I'm so selfish
Lady, what you want me to say?
Foolish
The lies and deception
I tried to confess it
Committed, but I still wanna play

[Bridge: Step Cousins]
I don't wanna do it but I can't help it
I'm so selfish
Lady, what you want me to say?
Foolish
The lies and deception
I tried to confess it
Committed, but I still wanna play

[Verse 2: Step Cousins]
If I gave into the fact that you hate me and take me back
I'm saving face by staying at the bar
And embracing this Jack
She wanna leave, I can tell by the way
She react to the mouth piece
No more dollar drinks so she
Followed me with the house keys
And I know what I'm doing is wrong
Hoping that you were the one
But out 'til like two in the morn
With nobody you wanna know
It's comforting to know you're home
When I'm out on the road
I know you're lonely though
Or maybe got some flow of your own
In the looking glass, you shake your ass
I sat back and I watched
Then I took your hand, and we both danced
While thinking of the thoughts
It might've been the circumstance that hurt
This man - I'm a circus act at most
Nobody's perfect girl, it's a perfect world
But we don't have to know
And I'm not trying to justify it
But I might try to simplify it
One touch and I'm mesmerized
So I mess around in disguise
Flesh to the eyes, test to the lies
Sex gets my vote unless...
You're destined to die with the one
Next to your side
Fo sho

[Bridge: Step Cousins]
I don't wanna do it but I can't help it
I'm so selfish
Lady, what you want me to say?
Foolish
The lies and deception
I tried to confess it
Committed, but I still wanna play

[Hook: Macklemore]
Now you know what's good for you
Got that, not gonna warn you
We got that to make it right right right
You know all my women, I adore you
Bodies wanna absorb too
The energy, melody life life life
Now you know what's good for you
Got that, not gonna warn you
We got that to make it right right right
You know all my women, I adore you
Bodies wanna absorb too
The energy, melody life life life

[Intro]
Oh no
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
So fresh (so fresh) oh yes
And I, know I was in love with you
First moment I met you, butterflies
Kept me floating in the air, that's how it felt
First word that I spoke it made you smile
Cause I got a little style goin'
You laugh in my face but I didn't care
Cause it started the conversation
That led to our first date, now
Old folks used to tell me, I know it and I felt it
I know it's true if, they're, just like you

[Chorus]
So fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
Each time when I closed my eyes
Fade in and your lips touch mine, oh
So fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
You're like my favorite
I swear you could play forever...

[Verse 1]
Girl, let me get this tripod, make sure that the angle's right
Don't know if you know your lines, so this might just take all night
Baby, get up on the bed, I'll do all the things you like
Everything that I wanna do to you
Girl, your wardrobe is the same suit that you wore on your birthday
Baby girl, ooh, I want you, want you in the worst way
Now I'm gonna film you, I wanted to since the first date
Now I got a chance to, baby, I got plans for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Me, you take one, cut cut
Me, you take two, cut cut
Me, you take three, same scene
It's us in between the sheets, oh, ah
Me, you take four (Four)
From the bed down to the floor (Floor)
Baby, you so good, I feel like you deserve an award
From the way you put that thing on me, girl, it's a dream
And I know all the things to do
So, baby, we can make a film, watch it over and over again
And I will play the lead to you (I'll play the lead to you)

[Chorus]
We'll make a movie, movie
You'll play the starring role and I'll direct you on where to go
We'll make a movie, movie
Up and down and 'round and 'round, baby
Just you follow, I'll show you what to do
We'll make a movie, movie, oh
We'll make a movie, movie, oh
We'll make a movie, movie, oh
We'll make a movie and I'll let you do me, do me, oh

[Verse 2]
Baby, let's do role play, I can be anything you like
Use your imagination, now just gon' and close your eyes
Puedo ser tú corazón (Yes), y tal vez tú profesor (Yes)
I can be your doctor (Yes), girl, bet I make it better

[Pre-Chorus]
Me, you take one, cut cut
Me, you take two, cut cut
Me, you take three, same scene
It's us in between the sheets, oh ah
Me, you take four (Four)
From the bed down to the floor (Floor)
Baby, you so good, I feel like you deserve an award
From the way you put that thing on me, girl, it's a dream
And I know all the things to do
So, baby, we can make a film, watch it over and over again
And I can play the lead to you (I'll play the lead to you)

Girl, you're the best really and truly, truly
For the things that you do, oh-oh

[Chorus]
We'll make a movie, movie (Woah)
You'll play the starring role and I'll direct you on where to go

[Verse One] 

[Mike Posner]:
She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Zero hours, nine AM
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the earth so much I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight
But nobody home gon' remember my name

[Hook]:
I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no
I'm a rocket man

[Verse Two]:
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
You don't wanna be high
High like me

[Hook]:
I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man

Eh, eh I'm a rocket man
Yeah I'm a rocket man
I'm a rocket man

[Verse Two] 

[Bun B]:
Houston we got some problems
I don't know how your boy gonna solve them
The command center just won't link
And the comm. set's down I don't know what to think
Happen in a blink, sorta like the Big Bang
How can something so small turn into a big thang
One small move turn in to a big chain
No bass, no treble, all mid range
And it seems so strange, but it all makes sense
My back against the wall, end-up behind the fence
Situations always get so tense
And I just want us to still be friends
But we just argue, fuss and fight
And we scream and yell and we cuss all night
And it seems that we're always so uptight
Think that it's time that I book this flight
Took all my might but I feel so weak
So much to say but I just can't speak
Gotta be done but it kill me to do it
Came as a surprise, but we always knew it
So I'm taking this trip, no plane no car
Might be close and it might be far
But later than soon, when you look up at the moon
I'll be next to it shining like a star

[Hook]:
I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man

[Music video intro: Rihanna]
We've done the work, we know the system

[Intro: Rihanna]
Yeah, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

[Refrain: Rihanna]
Hands in the air, it's a stick up, stick up

You'll do everything Shy Ronnie says
Tell 'em, Ronnie

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg & Rihanna]
Hey, it's Shy Ronnie, and you down on the floor

Uh, oh, boner alert!

[Bridge: Rihanna & Policeman]
Why did I think you could do this?
Ronnie, hostage on the move!
(*Gunshot*) He shot himself
And why is your gun so small?
The police are on their way
Come out with your hands up
Good luck, Shy Ronnie
Bye-bye!

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg]
Haha!
Ronnie, motherfucker, and I'm back from the dead
Brain bored with the murder, so I shot my own leg
Don't get the name twisted, 'cause I'm crazy as shit
I hung a giant-ass noose off my giant-ass dick

[?] everytime

[Break: Rihanna]
Ay! I forgot this money

[?]
And also this guy

[?]

[?]
Too-da-loo!

[Verse 4: Andy Samberg]
And you can hang from it
'Cause you don't wanna see my real gun
Shots to the sky
But your face sound real fun
Ronnie!
Here's a little story that I think you'll like
It's not about Shaq or Iron Mike
So buckle your seatbelts, it's gonna get choppy
And listen to the tale of the time I fought Rocky

One day me and all my friends were hangin'
Talkin' 'bout which of the girls was most bangin'
Then one friend says, "You know who's really tough?
"Rocky, " (hit me home) "the boxer." Man

I said, "Yeah I know him. What about him? " He said
"He's really tough." "No way, man. I'm calling your bluff
"I think that I can take him and, to prove my point
"I'll challenge him in public." (Yeah, that's the joint!)

So the very next day, stayed true to my word
And I snuck on T.V. so I could be heard
I said, 'Rocky, if you're out there, I think you're a nerd
"And I'll lick you and bury you like a dog turd! "

I got kicked out, but the candle was lit
Cause the people had to know if my claim was legit
It made the headlines and I got the call
It was Rocky ("Hey") and he wanted to brawl
We negotiated terms and set the date
Then I went into training to add some muscle weight
While I punched on meat in a rickety shack
He was sippin' on wine, having models rub his back

At the weigh-in, boy the tension was high
Me and Rock, toe-to-toe and eye-to-eye
I talked some trash, we got pulled apart
I shot him one last look to strike fear in his heart

Skip ahead, the big night was finally here
My body was ripped and my mind was clear
We entered the arena to the roar of the crowd
People chantin' my name - I never felt so proud

Faced off once more in the center of the ring
Touched gloves, said a prayer and the bell went 

[ding]
He hit me with a left and shattered my face
And a right sent my teeth all over the place

Then another great punch caved-in my eye socket
He broke my jaw and my trainer yelled, "Stop it! "
But nobody heard him and he crushed my ribs
Blood sprayed off my face and onto some kids

They yelled out, "More! " and Rocky obliged
I had to think of some way to turn the tides
So I leaned back to hit him with all of my might
Took a swing, but he caught me with a sucker punch right
Then a sucker punch left and a sucker punch right
Then twenty-two consecutive sucker punch rights
He tore off my arms and beat me with 'em
Then threw acid in my face which obscured my vision

He kicked me in the leg and fractured my shin
The bone splinters shot right out of my skin
People barfed in the crowd; they were going insane
And Rocky punched my nose-bone into my brain

I was quivering and twitching when I soiled my shorts
Then Rocky pissed on me (customary in sports)
The doctor came out and pronounced me dead
And that was the night I fought Rocky

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
You know it's crazy, cause nights like this
Would start out with a little private party
You sneak me in your mom's house
I know I mighta spilled my drink, but
Really wasn't tryin' to spill my heart out
I mean it started as a conversation
I was really tryin' to get my thoughts out
But then we make moves and we make plans
Had the whole thing mapped out
See, you were gonna go to college
And to pay for bills I'd figure the job out
And you knew I had to say it, but them day's gone
Now I moved on and you switched phones
Hopefully reincarnation will bring us back to the place we belong

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Summer after high school when we first met
We make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 3: Katy Perry]
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
Its time to face the music
I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 4: B.o.B]
I'm falling for you like dominoes
From the top of the hundredth floor
Look out below Geronimo
Tryin' to get behind the closed doors to your soul
Why'd you have to end the show
We had such a beautiful plot
There was still more story to go
Now look, I'm not insinuating that
You're some type of fair weather player
But even if the whole world falls over
I wouldn't be aware of a glacier
I just wanna see you wake up
Doing your hair in the mirror with your makeup
Then, maybe in the next lifetime we could make up

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 1]
You think I'd leave your side, baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down
When you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you want
And if only you could see into me

[Chorus]
Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me

[Verse 2]
When you're on the outside, baby
And you can't get in
I will show you
You're so much better than you know
When you're lost and you're alone
And you can't get back again
I will find you
Darling, and I will bring you home
And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes
And in no time, you'll be fine

[Verse 3]
You think I'd leave your side, baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down
When you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you're wrong
And if only you could see into me

[Chorus]
Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh, when you're low
I'll be there
By your side, baby
Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh, when you're low
I'll be there
By your side, baby

[Chorus]
Nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
I am just here waiting for the perfect time to tell you I don't know
Maybe I'm just reading into it a little deeper than I should
We would make it easy, we would take it slowly, if only we could

[Spoken Interlude]
Hey, what are you doing out here? You're thinking about everything, aren't you? I know it’s crazy, just don't think of it like that. Nothing has to mean anything. Come on, come back inside

[Verse]
Elodie, look at me, unless you're tryin' to hurt me
Heavy blow, down I go, now I just want to let go
Is it right? Is it wrong? I don't know
It's not the cause I'm fightin' for anymore, it sucks to keep on runnin'
Eventually, there will be a time for clearer thinking
For now, I weep, can't get to sleep, I try to hold a good feeling
I just get one, here it comes, there it goes
Now we just might lose the fight, yeah, but it's alright, it wasn't our decision

[Chorus]
Nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
I am just here waiting for the perfect time to tell you what I know
Every man is happy until happiness is suddenly a goal
I'll just be here waiting 'til the doctor calls and then I'll let you know

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Ladies and gents, sorry to keep ya'll waiting
This goes out to everybody still hating
For those that fake, ya'll can keep on fakin'
I'm cooking a plate for you to stick your whole face in
Tastes good, don't it cousin?
Just so you know it's nothin'
I get you buggin' like some Codiene in some Robitussin
It's just the way that I approach each time
I slap the track and turn around and choke each rhyme

Broadcast to the nation like NBC
With pages of 16s like an MPC
Deliver an ass-whipping via MP3
Giving you people more reality than MTV
Do it PPV, snap necks with the pressure
Make a mess then carry you out on a stretcher
You could sue but, oh, the law won't protect ya
Even the court room sketcher could not sketch ya

You're not following me, I got your number like caller ID
Try it, you can holler at me
I promise you pain, I will chop your body in threes
And you'll be sitting there stuttering "P-p-probabably"

[Chorus 1: Mike Shinoda]
Follow me, I got styles, you can copy one
Back of your mind, I know you wanna stop me son
But here's news for you fucker, that can not be done
You can think that I'm finished, I have not begun

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I'm grinding, putting these kids to bed
You think you're hard-boiled, fucker you're an easter egg
You got a pastel shell and a soft inside, squash your pride
You think I fucking lost my mind, I'm not playing
I might as well be making a bomb
I lay you down to foundation when I'm taking you on
Bet the farm on the rhyme for the sake of my mom
She's like, "Mike, show these pigs what kind of bacon you're on"

It's funny but don't laugh, money with no cash
The villain of vocab, I'm killing this notepad
The realest I wrote, man, you don't even know half
I'm banking a full tank, you're running on low gas

[Chorus 2: Mike Shinoda]
Take that, I'm cutting off your fun
You're nothing but a butter knife stopping a gun
We can dance but your chances are slim to none
And you can think that I'm finished, I have not begun

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
Got a razor-blade tongue and I get this done
No running, just dumping on your clique for fun
Machine Shop got it locked like the game's a joke
Say something funny get the whole gang provoked
Better buckle down fucker, go get your own
We been working ten years just to get this known
The people on the block start to get numb
They expect that it's fresh when the new shit come

Here it goes let 'em know they can fix the frown
Railroad rap hot tracks running you down
And they ask and repeat how I do this now
Like I'm really gonna tell 'em how I get this sound
We just do what we do give you that fix
We come in the back like we run this bitch
Turn the lights down low and we start the show
When I give it to ya, give it right back and it goes

[Chourus 3: Mike Shinoda]
Take that, take that, cutting off your fun
You're nothing but a butter knife stopping a gun
We can dance but your chances are slim to none
You can think that I'm finished, I have not begun
Follow me, I got styles, you can copy one
Back of your mind, I know you wanna stop me son
But here's news for you fucker, that can not be done
You can think that I'm finished, I have not begun

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Finished, I have not begun
No

[Intro]
Ay, what up Mami
It's your boy Weezy, yeah
You need to ride with me on this one
I'm so great my homies think i'm artistic
Hah

[Verse 1]
Now in the drop you'll find me
On my way to get you, cause I got you Mami
I know you got some issues tryna stop you Mami
But I'm a little more ahead, let me spot you Mami
I have you, as we drive through the east side
Stop through my honey chrome right along the beach side
Ay, how can I answer at your sweet mind
Tell me 'bout your day
I know I heard about it 3 times
Hah, okay, I'm waitin' on my fourth time
And later on the 5th, so I don't forget
I got my lady in the whip, she got my name on her hip
And she don't let another name out her lip, uh huh, gangsta
See, if I don't play 'round and she gon' stay down
So last summer, I retire my number, ho
So no, I can't jot you my number though
My nigga real think you hot as a mother, but

[Hook]
Baby girl, I know that we can make it through the weather
As long as we strong, everything will stay together
When times get hard, long as we call upon the Lord
Everything will be fine, everything will be fine

[verse 2]
I will ne-e-ever leave you girl
Like R. Kelly said, while the R. Kelly played
Full time mother, you work hard everyday
I wake up beside you, thank the Lord everyday
Oh, beautiful woman, I look forward everyday
Just to see that childhood scar on your face, hah
I got a Tony Montana chick
If your girl get out of line, she a manner chick?
If my world get out of line, she program my shit
I know my shit do stink, but she can stand my shit
I got the flip-flop paint on her standard shift
Dot 6 Range Rover, I advance my bitch
How you gon' go get some pants like that
With an ass like that, you know I'm bad for that
But you ain't gotta answer that
Long as every time I call you answer back
I said

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Ride with a G and come join me on this adventure
Hop on the beat and put your ass on the 20 inches
I'll slide you the key, you wait for me after the concert
I promise I'll leave straight from the stage to under you skirt
Got riders with me, but don't mind them, they only homies
They only gonna let you get on me, so get on me
The song the DJ playin' is my own, so get on me
I'm only gonna let you get on me, so get on me

[Hook]
Can't no nigga do it quite like me
Rock ice like Phi
Cop a J keep the price in the winter like Weezy
Ain't no nigga like me
This be, this be
Ain't no nigga do it quite like me
Can't no nigga do it quite like me
Rock ice like Phi
Cop a J keep the price in the winter like Weezy
Ain't no nigga like me
This be

[Verse 1]
Now who you know can cop a J
Keep the price in the winter like me
Rock ice like me
Talk a monkey out a banana tree
I'm a P.I.M.P
Tip when I walk, slur when I talk
Bitch, catch the ? quick
If she runnin' her lip
If a nigga trip, I give him a clip
Now that's some gangsta shit
Nigga bitch believe, which is not just for me
Just for you
Instead of bringing one key
The bitch can bring two
I'm a bad mother ooh
Just doin' what I do
So smooth, I'm a hustler baby
I just want you to know
Anywhere I've been
Or where I'm about to go

[Chorus]

[Hook]
Shake your money maker
Don't break the money table
Take the money, baby
Do your thing
Ooo boy, if you love it when I shake my body
Hop on the train and get right behind me
Shake your money maker
Don't break the money table
Take a ride on the choo-choo train
Ooo boy, if you love it when I shake my body
Hop on the train and get right behind me

[Verse 1 - Ms. Tee]
Boy, I like the way you make me dance up on the floor
When the song go up, I nod my head, I wanna hear more
I wanna rock, my ? body
I wanna move, my ? body
All my girls, ? a bar
Don't matter if you're big, fat, skinny, or small
Let's work, work, 'til the early morning
Let's get high, 'til the break of dawn
Everybody, just move your feet
All you ladies, come and shake your money maker with me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Up in the club on the Hennessy
Fake booty clowns are shakin' on me
I can barely stand up
I can hardly see
I drank it down and hit the VIP
Love when we hit the back
You let me hit from the back
And back to floor, lookin' for more
I ? shorty at the bar
I might as well ?
?
As I awoke this evening
With the smell of woodsmoke clinging
Like a gentle cobweb hanging
Upon a painted tepee
Oh, I went to see my chieftain
With my warlance and my woman
For he told us that the yellow moon
Would very soon be leaving

This I can't believe I said
I can't believe our Warlord's dead
Oh, he would not leave the chosen ones
To the buzzards and the soldiers' guns

Oh, great father of the Iroquois
Ever since I was young
I've read the writing of the smoke
And breast-fed on the sound of drums
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk
And ride a painted pony wild
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux
To make a chieftain's daughter mine
And now you ask that I should watch
The red man's race be slowly crushed?
What kind of words are these to hear
From Yellow Dog, whom white man fears?

I take only what is mine, Lord
My pony, my squaw, and my child
I can't stay to see you die
Along with my tribe's pride
I go to search for the yellow moon
And the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold
And the healing waters run

Trampling down the prairie rose
Leaving hoof tracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me
I welcome with my hands
I heard from passing renegades
Geronimo was dead
He'd been laying down his weapons
When they filled him full of lead

Now there seems no reason why
I should carry on
In this land that once was my land
I can't find a home
It's lonely and it's quiet
And the horse soldiers are coming
And I think it's time I strung my bow
And ceased my senseless running
For soon I'll find the yellow moon
Along with my loved ones
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields
Without the sound of guns
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Comes with a bullet hole

[Hook: Tyga]
I said, fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, nigga, I hit 'em up

[Verse 1: Tyga]
T Raww go stay Westside, killa cap peela
No ceiling, probably worth 10 million
Poor nigga watch chilla, you ain't even gotta feel it
That's chin chinchilla flyer than a caterpillar
I sick my dogs at you, yeah
They ain't call the dog catcher, bitch
Spark the fire, no matches, yeah
So high just laughing, hah
Burners in the attic, they ain't know I had it
Shoot sporadic, fire automatic, pop the target
Driving backwards, I'm a hundred bill fanatic
Bring the static, make vows to the money, but I skipped marriage
Keep staring, rather die that nigga than live average, get you embarrassed
Thousand karats on my wheel that my kids inherit
Black card credit, told them I don't use debit
Nigga know that's my motto, I could do this shit forever so

[Hook]
I said, fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, nigga, I hit 'em up

I said, fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, nigga, I hit 'em up

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
We don't rock with them niggas anyway, fuck them
We'd ever caught them in the hood, we'd a stuck them
Things coming in, we get them off by the dozen
We about that action, y'all ain't about nothin'
Girl of your dreams, I already had her
If it ain't my team, it don't really matter
Short stay, I'm only in town for the figures
Even when I'm up, I'm still down for my niggas
Need nothing else, don't concern me or worry me
Nah, I'mma ride 'til they burn me or bury me
Cause the truth is, niggas die every day
Heard about me, I hope you heard thoroughly
I don't switch sides, I just switch rides
Might just get a little head, let the bitch slide
Knowing that I can, knowing that I will
Far as the other side go, you know how I feel

[Hook: Tyga]
I said, fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, nigga, I hit 'em up

I said, fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, nigga, I hit 'em up

[Verse 3: 2Pac & Tyga]
You gotta watch your back, stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young motherfucker doin' dirt, bitch
Walkin' through the streets wearin' jewels
Ain't got shit to lose
Gonna fuck up and bust young niggas with tools
The intricate designs of my lethal lines
Now time hard to find a job, easier to rob niggas
These days, motherfuckers talk shit, and turn snitch when you see 'em
They ain't talkin' 'bout shit, Westside
I keep a vest on my chest, bitch
Buck, buck, cops wanna hit me with the book
But I don't give a fuck, government got a nigga feelin' stuck
While these same little sluts gettin' fucked for a quick buck
Weed make my mind roam
All alone, ain't nothin' like tryna bone
Over the phone, in my mind I can see her naked
I can't take it, got me shakin' at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew, bitch
Get loaded, can't control it
Nigga, pass me the blunt and let me roll it
Then smoke it, sipping Hennessy, plottin' on my enemies
Comin back twice as hard like, remember me
My hustle to my dyin' days, niggas dyin' every day
And we celebrate with pain, pourin' champagne
Street politics, they wanna join my campaign
Worldwide, LA niggas screaming Westside

[Hook: Tyga]
I said, fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, nigga, I hit 'em up

I said, fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, nigga, I hit 'em up

[Intro]
Ow!
Ho!
Ow!

[Verse 1]
Baby, does he do it for you?
When he's finished, does he step back and adore you?
I just gotta know, 'cause your time is money
And I won't let him waste it, oh no-n (Ow!)
Baby, just go with it
'Cause when you're with me, I can't explain it, it's just different
We can take it slow or act like you're my girl, let's skip the basics
Whoa-whoa, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so replaceable
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, uh, da-da-da)
You're worth the chase you're putting on
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da)

[Chorus]
It's alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine, I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable, a collectible
Just like fine china

[Verse 2]
Favorite, you're my favorite
It's like all the girls around me don't have faces
And the saying goes
Life is just a game but I'm not playing
Whoa-whoa, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so replaceable (Woo-hoo)
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, uh, da-da-da)
You're worth the chase you're putting on
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da)

[Chorus]
It's alright (Yeah), I'm not dangerous
When you're mine (Woo), I'll be generous
(You are) You're irreplaceable, a collectible (Just like)
Just like fine china
It's alright (Girl), I'm not dangerous (I'm not dangerous)
When you're mine (Girl), I'll be generous
(You are) You're irreplaceable, (You are) A collectible (Hey!)
(You are) just like fine china

[Bridge]
Took me a while (Yeah) to find your love (Hey!)
Ain't no amount of time in this world (Ho!)
Save me a lot of time and just love me (Hey!)
Feel it, baby, feel it in your soul
Are you ready? (oh)
I know your heart been telling you, you belong to me (Haha)
A-na-na, no-whoa

[Chorus]
It's alright (Yeah, whoa!), I'm not dangerous (I'm not dangerous, hey!)
When you're mine (Whoa, I'll get you girl), I'll be generous (I, I, no)
You're irreplaceable, a collectible
Just like fine china

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh
Yeah
Uh
Oh, oh no
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Compliments to the chef, the baby lamb was perfect
Now I smoke the drugs that got me feelin' like I'm surfin'
Dusk on the North Shore, hash on my person
Roll it to a snake then I wrap it like a turban
We in the jungle with the shaman
Tryna find these answers to these problems I've been ponderin'
Now these motherfuckers hollerin' with their lips puckered like collagen
Sell me the world, and my kids, put them in colleges
But daddy get it by himself on the reg
Stuffed zucchini flowers, mix ricotta with the egg
Chopped parsley, soft flakes, Himalayan mines
Meditation time help me penetrate the mind
December 2nd '83, I was created
My vision's wide of the human being jaded
It's just reality, dealt with on a daily basis
Big Body put the burner in these bitches faces

[Hook: Lauriana Mae]
Oh, they're selling dreams out here in every corner store
Pawn 'em on the streets, I feel, they're selling me the world
But if it all goes up, it could all come down the same
So when I go where I go I remember where I came...
Remember where I came from

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Yo, yo can lead a horse to water but you can't make 'em drink it
Two in the pink, two in the stink
Leather colored goulash, talks with Lou Dobbs, create some new jobs
In '87, saw my father in a blue Saab
Right seat sittin', left hand shiftin'
You know that every team needs a Paxson and a Pippen
Bronson rappin' like he on an acid tab trippin'
You changin' with the moon with a Maxi Pad drippin'
High-five love, 5'5, plump
Sell the pussy 'til the shit look like a Ty Cobb glove
Bring me back the money then I dip to Arizona
Put my balls in your mouth, bubble tea, tapioca
Smoked shark, speakin' in a Nordic slang
Baby blue eyes, important like an August rain
Clear water from the creek keep me nourished
Keep my head up, never discouraged, pussy bitch

[Hook]

[Outro: Lauriana Mae]
Yeah... remember where I came from...
Remember where I came from...
Yeah... remember where I came from...
Remember where I came from...

[Verse 1]
Anger, he smiles towering
In shiny metallic purple armor
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown
Sneers at the grassy ground
Blue are the life-giving waters
Taken for granted
They quietly understand
The once happy turquoise armies
Lay opposite ready
But wonder why the fight is on

[Chorus]
But they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
Just ask the axis

[Verse 2]
My red is so confident he flashes
Trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young, full of daring
But very unsteady for the first go around
My yellow in this case is not so mellow
In fact, I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine
Keeps holding me from
Giving my life to a rainbow like you

[Chorus]
But I'm uh, yeah, l'm bold as love
Yeah, yeah, well I'm bold, bold as love
Hear me talking, girl
I'm bold as love
Just ask the axis
He knows everything
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
We are, Young Mula
And we run this bitch

[Hook]
Roll with duct tape and ride with the Mack
Roll with duct tape and r-r-r-r-ride with the Mack
Roll with duct tape and ride with the Mack
Roll with duct tape and r-r-r-r-ride with the Mack

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Slide out the Ferrari, I came to wet up the party
And baby I can shoot like Robert Horry or Corey Maggette
Ready for the impossible, I'm colossal, fool
And y'all niggas just molecules
Don't know how to build a house but I got a box of tools
I'm talkin' 'bout that "pop pop, pap pap, bang bang, blocka boom
That is for Tune
The coupe I'm in say "va va voom", then it go pe'hune
Nigga I'm gone
I'll see you soon, on the moon
Put me in the dirt and watch me bloom
Put me in the jungle, bet I'm coming back with all the food
Put me in the streets and bet I'm coming back with money
Yeah, bitch nigga run it (3x)
I'm heavily blunted, me and my gun loaded
She ridin' with me 'til the muthafuckin' road end
Yeah, and it be like that
I don't got papers on that Glock
But I got papers on that Mack

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: Raw Dizzy]

I ain't have a body on it, but don't nobody own it
So anybody can get it if anybody wants it
Homie, I'm not your homie
You fuck around and end up wrapped up
In the trunk like a fucking mummy
Phony, I'm far from phony
I'm only about my money
And I keep enough of work to feed a thousand junkies
I stay strapped cause I keep a couple thousand on me
And I know these little cronies that's plottin' on me
But I ain't never scared
I ain't never runnin'
I got my own back
I ain't never frontin'
And I'm forever thuggin'
I'm like a pair of somethin' (?)
No heart, I don't care for nothin'
And no sir, I ain't here for nothin'
Then I'm trying to bring it back like the record's jumpin'
I got my system pumpin'
And I'm riding with the Mack and the duct tape in case I gotta carry somethin'

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]

I got real fucking blood flowing through my pulmonary veins
I play the kitchen, call me "Culinary Maine"
Y'all niggas bitches, ya'll hustlin' on the scary train
While we move everything, from heroin to Mary Jane
But let me fall back, I know the Feds like rap
(There's an echo in the headphone)
That's how I know the mic tapped
When you don't brush your teeth
The only time you touch plaques
While we got too many on the wall
Yeah, it's like that
I got chicks that like me that don't like rap
Ask your girl who her favorite
I bet she say she like Mack
I tell a dark-skinned chick I'm allergic to chocolate
So if we eating use the plan and you can keep on walking
Hi Yellow Mamis, I don't eat red meat
I'm busy killing tracks
Yeah, this is a dead beat (rest in peace)
No child support
I pay with my heart, I kill it
I probably never be the best
But one of the realest

[Hook]
Are there any, ugly girls in the audience tonight?
(Howling and yelling) Umm
This is for all the ugly girls in the audience tonight (X4)
I hope you... yeah, you... you, ugly bitch
Cause this is for all the ugly girls in the audience tonight
And this is for the ugly girls, ugly!

[Chorus]
Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my lover, taking it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong (No, no)

[Verse 1]
How optimism led me astray
Two hundred things I took the wrong way
But I saw her love gauge runnin' low
I tried to fill but it overflowed

[Chorus]
Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my lover taking it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong

[Verse 2]
She remembers my name
Could be blowin' way out
It's all going to change
She remembers my name

[Bridge]
But she’s only messing around
Please, no more playing with my heart
Ooh, go Mr. Right just for once
(Then it all just came out)
Ooh, no more mischief with my mind
(Guess I'll hold in, next time...)

[Verse 3]
No more gettin' it wrong
I'll be frozen, here on
If forever, we'll see
No more guessin' for me

[Outro]
Oh, I was just so sure of everything
Oh, that's what you get for dreamin' aloud
(Then it all just came out)
(Guess I'll hold in, now on)
(If forever, we'll see)
Oh, the day that words are clearer for me
(But no more guessing for me)

[Verse 1]
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way, and it corrodes my soul
I want to leave, you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, I'm a sickening wreck
I've got the twenty-first century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history, Mr. Shankly

[Verse 2]
Fame, fame, fatal fame
It can play hideous tricks on the brain
But still I'd rather be famous
Than righteous or holy, any day, any day, any day
But sometimes I'd feel more fulfilled
Making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to live and I want to love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of

[Verse 3]
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way, and it corrodes my soul
Oh, I didn't realise that you wrote poetry
I didn't realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry, Mr. Shankly
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, since you ask
You are a flatulent pain in the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
Still, I must speak frankly, Mr. Shankly
Oh, give us your money!

[Intro]
I'm saying, I care
But it's like you don't hear me
What more could I do?

[Verse 1]
Girl, you can keep that
Trying to make me jealous
I admit that I've been careless
But we can't take back what's done
I know why you did that
You're frustrated 'cause I don't react
Maybe you want some feedback
'Cause normally my feelings don't show
But baby...

[Chorus]
I care for you
By now you should now that I care for you
You say my actions never show it
I don't wear my heart on my sleeve
But what you get's what you see
The truth is, girl, underneath
Gotta believe that I care for you
Baby, I care for you
I, I, I, I care
I, I, I, I care for you

[Verse 2]
Every day, I'm
Trying to prove myself to you
But what's the point?
No such thing is satisfying you
Maybe you'll appreciate it later, by the time I'm gone
Better get your act together, don't wait too long
Don't wanna change what we have to what we had
Girl, I need you to know that I...

[Chorus]
I care for you
By now you should now that I care for you
You say my actions never show it
I don't wear my heart on my sleeve
But what you get's what you see
The truth is, girl, underneath
Gotta believe that I care for you
Baby, I care for you
I, I, I, I care
I, I, I, girl, I care for you, I do

[Bridge]
Gotta believe it, gotta believe it
I care
Gotta believe it, gotta believe it
Gotta believe it
I care, I care
You know I care
I care, I care
You know I care, I really do

[Chorus]
I care for you
By now you should now that I care for you
You say my actions never show it
I don't wear my heart on my sleeve
But what you get's what you see
The truth is, girl, underneath
Gotta believe that I care for you
Baby, I care for you

[Outro]
Now, listen, hear me
I care, I care, I care for you

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ugh, lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he bout that action and grab me and take a stand
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told
I don't even shake his hand, I dont even crack a smile
Knew him since a child, man this game so wild
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like its a brick store
On my dick nigga, thats what I thought your chick for
You pissed off, I only deal with the big dogs
Could've bought a Maybach before I signed with Rick Ross
That's the reason that I'm turnin' up
Doin' donuts while these haters got these niggas burnin' up
Niggas want to murder us, this label want me purpula
You ain't talkin' money to me I need a interpreter
Cause I can't understand that, money rubber band that
Take off in my city, and your city where I land at
When I'm in your town forty rounds in my damn strap
Boy what a feeling getting hit

[Verse 1]
If I were a swan, I'd be gone
If I were a train, I'd be late
And if I were a good man
I'd talk with you more often than I do

[Verse 2]
If I were asleep, I could dream
If I were afraid, I could hide
If I go insane
Please don't put your wires in my brain

[Verse 3]
If I were the moon, I'd be cool
If I were a rule, I would bend
If I were a good man
I'd understand the spaces between friends

[Verse 4]
If I were alone, I would cry
And if I were with you, I'd be home and dry
And if I go insane
Will you still let me join in with the game?

[Verse 5]
If I were a swan, I'd be gone
If I were a train, I'd be late again
If I were a good man
I'd talk with you more often than I do

[Verse 1]
Would you like to say something before you leave?
Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel
We say goodbye before we've said hello
I hardly even like you, I shouldn't care at all
We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud
From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year

[Pre-Chorus]
And I would like to know

[Chorus]
How do you feel?
(How do you feel?)
How do you feel?
(How do you feel?)

[Brass Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Not a single word was said, the night still hid our fears
Occasionally you showed a smile but what was the need
I felt the cold far too soon in a room of 95
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there
Tomorrow brings another town another girl like you
Have you time before you leave to greet another man?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just you let me know

[Chorus]
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel?

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
Goodbye to you, Charlotte Pringle's due
I've had enough for one day

[Instrumental Outro]

Bad ass bitch, big ass titties, man

Got lil' niggas that'll sock you in the fucking face
And if you think that they won't sock you in your fucking face
Ayy you a bi-ahhhh! Pop you right in your fucking face

These broke niggas always re-ing up
Nigga see me in the beam, now he speedin' up
I’m like "Duke, holla at me when ya Gs is up"
Oh, that’s the Kanye piece? Throw your Jesus up
When I say I’m 'bout my guac, I don’t mean amole
Feel like I’m being watched, I don’t mean a Rollie (Okay)
I’m half past seven o' clock, all by my lonely (Kyuh)
Spits got the Dessie on cock, don't run up on me (Blocka!)
Bitches get mad, 'cause they know they can’t (Stop her)

And I don’t know how to take it slow
I’m the type to get right, stay in the limelight
I’m at the bar gettin' Rémy on rocks
I’m comin' for these rap bitches if they ready or not (Kyuh)
You know the girl, I already was hot
You tell 'em, fuck a new bitch, I want a veteran spot
Look, it’s Nicki M in the place, so stay back
I stay around the white like I’m Pat Sajak (Okay)
Plus I had my A-game up since 8-track
I’m Diddy with the flow, “Take that, take that”
My flow say ka-ching and my pockets say cheese
I ain’t got a bag, but my wrists say freeze
Dick 'em, trick 'em, I know how to pick 'em
Brrt, stick 'em, ah-ha-ha! Stick 'em

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj, Ru Spits]
If you wanna me sweat me, then baby, let me tell you
I’m not like them other girls you've been with
'Cause I know you think I’m sexy, you wanna sex me
Rollin' with Ru Spits, we make hits, where my chips, bitch? (Yo, yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 3: Ru Spits & Nicki Minaj]
I don’t know what you chasin', dog
'Cause I ain't got patience for (Nope, nope)
All these dudes that be hatin' y’all
'Cause money we be takin' more, gettin' cake for sure
Only think about makin' more
Grey Azzure, mink drag, let it scrape the floor
Don’t be mad when I take your broad
Rock stones, can’t trace a flaw
So I guess, in a way, you could say (You could say)
That I was made to ball
Act out and the K applaud
Me and Nicki gon’ pay the cost
You wanna play the boss
You gon' learn how to take a loss
Of course I’m back, kid still torch the track
We gettin' paper like Office Max
Branch house with the horse to match
Pink gems, and the cross attached
Hit you, then I toss the gat
So, Gs up, nigga, get your Bs up
Chick act up, tell a hoe to ease up
In the back of the club, homie roll that weed up
If you wanna jump bad, a beatdown’s the outcome

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Where my niggas that's gettin' they Gs up? (Gs up)
In the back and you rollin' your trees up (Trees up)
Where my bitches that's gettin' they freeze up?
And gettin' they tease up, just tell 'em to ease up (Ease up)
Where my niggas that's gettin' they Gs up? (Gs up)
In the back and you rollin' your trees up (Trees up)
Where my bitches that's gettin' they freeze up?
And gettin' they tease up (Go, go, go, go, go)
Just tell 'em to ease up (Ease up!)

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
My nigga Spits (Ease up)
Fire and ice (Ease up)

[?] (Ease up)

[?] I see you (Ease up)
Nicki Maraj in the building, bitches (Ease up)
(Ease up, ease up)

[Verse]
Soothing repeat
I look down at my feet
It's a hypnotist's arm
And it works like a charm
But I won't be deprived
Real world, surreal life
Oh, I doubt there is time
Go to sleep, you'll be fine
In the morning you'll find
Real life was such a grind
Off I go, day is done
Where a new one's just begun

[Verse 1]
This could be the day that we push through
It could be the day that all our dreams come true
For me and you
Till we're at the end of just another day
Are you too terrified to try your best?
Just to end up with an educated guess
Like success
Like those times you wake up mystified

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it feels so real in my sleep
Never held something so close I couldn't keep
Into the day, the strangest feeling
Do you really live without the fear that

[Chorus]
Everything is changing
And there's nothing I can do
My world is turning pages
While I am just sitting here

[Verse 2]
Well, am I getting closer?
Will I ever get there?
Does it even matter?
Do I really need it?
Push it out the window
On and on, we all go
(This could be the day that we push through)
Into another morning
Doesn't even matter
It was only yesterday
(It could be the day that all our dreams come true)
Didn't even know you
Now I'm gonna miss you
(Oh, it feels so real in my sleep
Never held something so close I couldn't...)

[Chorus]
Nothing ever changes
No matter how long you do your hair
Looks the same to everyone else
Everything is changing
I guess I should warn my mum
But she'll just be excited

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse]
But that's only while I think of you (Think of you, think of you)
Some vision that I hold on to (Hold on to, hold on to)
You know it's everything I do (Thing I do, thing I do)
You know it's everything I do (Thing I do)
Can almost stand competing with the others
Can almost hear the fun that I should be having
Instead of just dreaming
But it's only when I think of you (Think of you, think of you)
The mover I could turn into (Turn into, turn into)
There must be something I can do (I can do, I can do)
Yeah, there must be something I can do

[Chorus]
I just don't know how to feel right
A beautiful girl is wasting my life
I'm playing a part as somebody else
While tryin' so hard to be myself
I just need to hear somebody say
This will all make sense one day
I guess I'm alright, but they're all doing so well
What I wouldn't give to be under that spell

[Post-Chorus]
You'll know soon
You'll know soon
You'll know soon
You'll know soon
You'll know soon (Yeah)
You'll know soon (Yeah)
You'll know soon (Yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
But you don't know the truth
I'm in love with you
You just don't believe
In anything I do

[Chorus]
In so many ways I'm somebody else
While tryin' so hard to be myself
I just need to hear somebody say
This will all make sense one day
Well, it's getting late I'd better go
I made it this far as far as I know

[Outro]
In so many ways I'm somebody else
While tryin' so hard to be myself
I just need to hear somebody say
This will all make...

[Chorus]
All I give are little clues
Maybe, one day, I'll get through
There is nothing I can do
I'll just keep on lying to you
I only need to say it's true
Your poor little heart already knew
But there is nothing you can do
I'll just keep on lying to you

[Verse]
Should my cover ever blow
Would you ever let it go?
There is something you should know
But hell if I'd ever let it show
So here I am, trying to be strong
It was noon, now my shadow's long
I guess I'll go and tell you just as soon
As I get to the end of this song
To the end of this song
To the end of this song
To the end of this song
To the end of this song

[Bridge]
The curse has won again
Soon I'll be alone
Take all you can
Please understand
That it never really was love

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
All I give are little clues
Maybe one day I'll get through
There is nothing you could do
I'll just keep on lying to you

[Interlude]
But she just won't believe me
She just won't believe me
I'd never be deceiving
But she just won't believe me

[Verse]
All those things I ever, thought would never end
To think they’re now all memories, sends me 'round the bend
To watch her airplane swaying, coming in to land
There, my world is hanging, in someone else's hands
And if I have done something, and you have to let me go
Think of me as someone, someone that you know
But if I don't hear something, pretty soon from now
I'll disconnect completely, see how that works out

[Chorus]
I wasn't, daring, not much a chancer
Oh, my darling, why won't you answer?
7:00 A.M, midnight in Dover
Sun's coming up now, I guess it's over
Playing his guitar, while he’s dying of cancer
Oh, my father, why won’t you answer?
7:00 A.M, midnight in Dover
Sun's coming up now, I guess it's over

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
I wanted her, I wanted her
But she doesn't like the life that I lead
She doesn't like the life that I lead
Doesn't like sand stuck on her feet
Or sittin' around smokin' weed
I must seem more like a friend in need
And I boast that it is meant to be

[Chorus]
But, in all honesty, I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move
And in all honesty, I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move

[Verse 2]
And she doesn't like the friends that I make
Doesn't make friends for friendship's sake
She just gets bored sitting by the lake
Her soul won't surface and her heart won't ache
And I boast that it is meant to be

[Chorus]
But, in all honesty, I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move

[Break]
And I thought they could cure his disease

[Chorus]
But, in all honesty, he didn't have a hope in hell
Now we'll never see him move

[Verse 1]
All movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
For seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one

[Chorus]
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset

[Verse 2]
The time is with the month of winter solstice
When the change is due to come
Thunder in the other course of heaven
Things cannot be destroyed once and for all

[Chorus]
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset, sunrise

[Verse 3]
All movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
For seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one

[Chorus]
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset, sunrise

[Verse 1: Robin Thicke]
I met the joker
And I stole the moon
I raised the sunshine
And I've been the fool
And I have been laughed at
And I've been lied to
And I have been left alone with no answer

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
I don't cry, I don't cry no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't try, I don't try no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't lie, I don't lie no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't cry no more

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
I took the picture
I faced the truth
I lived a lifetime, a lifetime with you
And I watch you fall asleep smiling
And I lie awake
But there's only so much that one man can take

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
Ooo so I don't cry, I don't cry no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't try, I don't try no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't lie, I don't lie no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't cry no more

Ooooooooo
Ooooooooooooo

[Verse 3: Robin Thicke]
And I am a hero
But I'm not made of steel
And I'm not the smartest man
But I know the deal
And I'll bleed for your lips
If you'll bleed for mine
And I can't escape it
Cause I do love you

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
Ooo so I don't cry, I don't cry no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't try, I don't try no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't lie, I don't lie no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't cry no more
Ooooooooo
Ooooooooooooo

Girl I know you want this
So I don't cry, I don't cry no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't cry no more

[Verse 1]
The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows
Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere
He didn’t care

[Refrain]
He stood in a field where barley grows

[Verse 2]
His head did no thinking
His arms didn’t move except when the wind cut up rough
And mice ran around on the ground

[Refrain]
He stood in a field where barley grows

[Verse 3]
The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
But now he’s resigned to his fate
‘Cause life’s not unkind – he doesn’t mind

[Refrain]
He stood in a field where barley grows

[Verse 1]
Isolation can put a gun your in hand
It can put a gun in your hand
It can put a gun in your hand
If you need to, you can get away from the sun
You can get away from the sun
You can get away from the sun
If you need to, you can get away from the sun
If you need to, you can throw away the only one

[Verse 2]
I'm so tired, but I can never lay down my head
I can never lay down my head
I can never lay down my head
I'm so lonely, but I can never quite reach the phone
I can never quite reach the phone
I can never quite reach the phone
I'm so lonely, but I can never quite reach the phone
I'm so lonely, I've gotta eat my popcorn all alone
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Isolation can put a gun your in hand
It can put a gun in your hand
It can put a gun in your hand
If you need to, you can get away from the sun
You can get away from the sun
You can get away from the sun
If you need to, you can get away from the sun
If you need to, you can throw away the only one

[Verse 1]
I wish that I could swim and sleep like a shark does
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd hide 'til the end of time
In that sweet cool darkness
Asleep and constantly floating away

[Verse 2]
I wish that I could break and mend like the world does
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd chase all my dreams away
And I'd let you crush me
My dreams would be constantly melting away

[Verse 1]
I wish that I could swim and sleep like a shark does
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd hide 'til the end of time
In that sweet cool darkness
Asleep and constantly floating away

[Verse]
Now that you're gone, it's been a long, lonely time
It's a long, sad, lonely time
Rolling along, I'm in a strange state of mind
It's a strange, old state of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Memories, they mess with my mind
Who am I to deny?

[Chorus]
She was so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So bad at being in love

[Verse]
Now that you're gone, it's been a long, lonely time
It's a long, sad, lonely time
Rolling along, I'm in a strange state of mind
It's a strange, old state of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Memories, they mess with my mind
Who am I to deny?

[Chorus]
She was so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So bad at being in love

[Verse 1]
She got that water faucet pussy
I swear that fucker wet
I'm standin' over the kitchen faucet
Whippin' up them bricks
These niggas keep on beating the door down
Want to spend a check
The junkie tried to steal my lawn mower he got wet
When I first bought my 'Vette these bitches said Gucci's a mess (damn)
Came back in that M6 and I drop my top she drop the dress
We the best fuck the rest
Beefing with me better bring your vest
Sliding down the crest in a charger on 6s
And I'm looking for them hood bitches

[Hook]
Where them hood bitches, all I fuck with hood bitches
Like them hood bitches, yeah I fuck with hood bitches
Where the hood bitches point me to the hood bitches
It's Guwop in this bitch and I want them hood bitches
Where the bitches tell me where hood bitches
Where the hood bitches point me to them hood bitches
Gucci Mane in this bitch I got my hood bitches
You ain't no hood bitch I need them hood bitches

[Verse 2]
I'm Gladys Knight with a bitch so bad
That she rode a bike but she not a dyke
She got a man but she wear the pants
So I guess the pussy nigga got his panties tight
So here's the plan, he's a lame
Respect the game bring me the white
Do it again, I'm the Gucci mane
Might fuck around and make you my main
Main thing but a change of heart
She came in with some granny panties
I'm so picky that my dick went limp
And I had to kick the punk bitch up out the mansion
That young nigga got a 45
But the nigga too antsy-pantsy
These hood bitches give the best head
When I fuck her I keep a pistol handy

[Hook]
Where them hood bitches, all I fuck with hood bitches
Like them hood bitches, yeah I fuck with hood bitches
Where the hood bitches point me to the hood bitches
It's Guwop in this bitch and I want them hood bitches
Where the bitches tell me where hood bitches
Where the hood bitches point me to them hood bitches
Gucci Mane in this bitch I got my hood bitches
You ain't no hood bitch I need them hood bitches

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I can make a duece duece do some crazy things
Dope so good, make a junkie do some crazy things

That dope so good it make a snorter catch some crazy dreams
I got that gangsta cush and that shit amazing man
Ain't nothing but white bitches at my party, it's crazy man

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
I like to stay down with my ho so now I'm crazy paid
My credit working, make it double, I'm cashin crazy plates
I'm from the middle of the city like a grady baby
And I be piped up when they see me, I got crazy flavor
Turn it up so loud nigga, I might wake yo neighbors
Einstein what you sayin, go bout what it say on the papers
Might move to Oakland just to watch a game of the Raiders
No flexing, they connected this with the dope like the cable
When I go to table you can tell that I'm hunting
My stomach get craving, it's smelling them hundreds
Can you feelin it comin, I'm not in it for money
And I hate to say, I can make a bitch do some crazy things

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Junkie gon slap crazy, my trap is crazy
You'd think this shit was 1980's and I fucked with Reagan
I didn't have no daddy to bring the bacon so i brought home the baking
And if you think you gon punk Guwap then you sadly is mistaken
I got 200 thousand cash on me, I'mma go to Vegas
And I don't need no fuckin no Jenny Craig, my money overweight
I don't even pay the rent cause always overpay
And I overtip in 100's cause I'm Gucci man, I'm rich to stay
I go anywhere I wanna go, I double dare you to try to flap
I'm a have to fly her to because this pussy gon have to come in now
I'm a flip the pack and switch the spots, I know the folks gon run me now
And you can't tell me shit bout East Atlanta, bitch I know it's moneyed up

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
It is so easy to see
Dysfunction between you and me
We must free up these tired souls
Before the sadness kills us both
I tried and tried to let you know
I love you, but I'm letting go
It may not last, but I don't know
Just don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't know, then you can't care
And I show up, but you're not there
But I'm waiting and you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you

[Chorus]
Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

[Verse 2]
A bed that's warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
But misbehaving only makes
The ditch between us so damn deep
Built a wall around my heart
Never let it fall apart
Strangely, I wish secretly
It would fall down while I'm asleep

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't know, then you can't care
And I show up, but you're not there
But I'm waiting and you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you, baby

[Chorus]
Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

[Bridge]
But we have not hit the ground
Doesn't mean we're not still falling, oh
I want so bad to pick you up
But you're still too reluctant to accept my help
What a shame
I hope you find somewhere to place the blame
But until then, the fact remains

[Chorus]
Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
Nothing lasts forever
But be honest, babe (Yeah)
It hurts, but it may be the only way
Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing last forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

[Verse: Roger Waters]
If you didn't care what happened to me
And I didn't care for you
We would zigzag our way through the boredom and pain
Occasionally glancing up through the rain
Wondering which of the buggers to blame
And watching for pigs on the wing

[Intro]
*Pig snorts*

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Big man, pig man
Haha, charade you are
Wooh!
You well-heeled big wheel
Haha, charade you are
And when your hand is on your heart
You're nearly a good laugh, almost a joker
With your head down in the pig bin
Sayin', "Keep on digging"
Pig stain on your fat chin
What do you hope to find
Down in the pig mine?

[Refrain: Roger Waters]
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh, but you're really a cry

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Bus stop rat bag
Haha, charade you are
You fucked up old hag
Haha, charade you are
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost worth a quick grin
You like the feel of steel
You're hot stuff with a hatpin
And good fun with a handgun

[Refrain: Roger Waters]
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh, but you're really a cry

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
Hey you, Whitehouse
Haha, charade you are
You house proud town mouse
Haha, charade you are
You're tryin' to keep our feelings off the street
You're nearly a real treat
All tight lips and cold feet
And do you feel abused?
...! ...! ...! ...! ...! ...! ...! You
Gotta stem the evil tide
And keep it all on the inside

[Refrain: Roger Waters]
Mary, you're nearly a treat
Mary, you're nearly a treat, but you're really a cry

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse: Roger Waters]
You know that I care what happens to you
And I know that you care for me too
So I don't feel alone or the weight of the stone
Now that I've found somewhere safe to bury my bone
And any fool knows a dog needs a home
A shelter from pigs on the wing

[Intro]
"Moon in one thousand … Scorpio … braving the skies … Libra ... Portalia ... 

[Lapintin ... Roscoe Thomas] ... Pluto was not discovered until 1930 ... nine two three select … adjusting ... fixed star of ... reduce, execute now if possible ..."

[Verse 1]
Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan, stars can frighten

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Blinding signs flap
Flicker, flicker, flicker, blam
Pow, pow
Stairway scare Dan Dare who’s there?

[Verse 3]
Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds
The icy waters underground

[Verse 1]
Lucifer Sam, Siam cat
Always sitting by your side
Always by your side

[Refrain]
That cat’s something I can’t explain

[Verse 2]
Jennifer Gentle, you’re a witch
You’re the left side, he’s the right side
Oh, no!

[Refrain]
That cat’s something I can’t explain

[Verse 3]
Lucifer, go to sea
Be a hip cat, be a ship’s cat
Somewhere, anywhere

[Refrain]
That cat’s something I can’t explain

[Verse 4]
At night prowling, sifting sand
Hiding around on the ground
He’ll be found when you’re around

[Refrain]
That cat’s something I can’t explain

[Verse 1: Rick Wright]
There was a king who ruled the land
His Majesty was in command
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
Showered silver on the people...

[Hook]
Oh, Mother
Tell me more

[Bridge: Syd Barrett]
Why’d'ya have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They’re scribbly black and everything shines

[Verse 2: Rick Wright]
Across the stream with wooden shoes
With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time

[Hook]
Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning
Yes, they did

[Musical interlude]

[Verse 3: Syd Barrett]
For all the time spent in that room
The doll’s house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by

[Hook]
Oh, Mother
Tell me more
Tell me more

[Outro]
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah

[Verse 1]
Doctor Doctor, I’m in bed
Doctor Doctor, aching head
Doctor Doctor, gold is lead
Doctor Doctor, choke on bread
Doctor Doctor, underfed
Doctor Doctor, gold is lead
Doctor Doctor, Jesus bled
Doctor Doctor, pain is red
Doctor Doctor, dark doom
Gruel ghoul, greasy spoon
Used spoon, June bloom

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Music seems to help the pain
Seems to motivate the brain
Doctor kindly tell your wife
That I’m alive
Flowers thrive
Realise
Realise
Realise

[Verse 1]
I want to tell you a story
Bout' a little man, If I can
A gnome named Grimble Grumble
And little gnomes stay in their homes
Eating, sleeping
Drinking their wine

[Verse 2]
He wore a scarlet tunic
A blue green hood, it looked quite good
He had a big adventure
Amidst the grass, fresh air at last
Wining, dining
Biding his time

[Chorus]
And then one day
Hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Ooooooh my

[Verse 3]
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn’t it good?
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn’t it good?
Winding, finding places to go

[Chorus]
And then one day – hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Ooooooh my
Ooooooh my
Wind will blow and the sun will shine
On that hill where we used to climb
I'll look in your eyes and you'll be mine
Someday soon

I won't even make a scene
That will be just like a dream
Cash is gonna flow down by the old mainstream
Someday soon

You don't know me, but I know you (you don't know me)
You have no idea what I'd do (what I'd do)
To make you mine and see you swoon
Someday soon

Sun's gonna shine, wind's gonna blow
On that hill where we used to go
I'll look in your eyes and down I will roll
Someday soon

Someday, someday soon
Someday, someday soon

[Verse 1]
I’ve got a bike, you can ride it if you like
It’s got a basket, a bell that rings
And things to make it look good
I’d give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it

[Chorus]
You’re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I’ll give you anything, everything if you want thing

[Verse 2]
I’ve got a cloak it’s a bit of a joke
There’s a tear up the front
It’s red and black, I’ve had it for months
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should

[Chorus]
You’re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I’ll give you anything, everything if you want thing

[Verse 3]
I know a mouse, and he hasn’t got a house
I don’t know why I call him Gerald
He’s getting rather old, but he’s a good mouse

[Chorus]
You’re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I’ll give you anything, everything if you want thing

[Verse 4]
I’ve got a clan of gingerbread men
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men
Take a couple if you wish. They’re on the dish

[Chorus]
You’re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I’ll give you anything, everything if you want thing

[Verse 5]
I know a room of musical tunes
Some rhyme, some ching, most of them are clockwork
Let’s go into the other room and make them work

[Instrumental outro]

[Verse 1]
Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown

[Refrain]
Yippee! You can’t see me
But I can you

[Verse 2]
Lazing in the foggy dew
Sitting on a unicorn

[Refrain]
No fair, you can’t hear me
But I can you

[Verse 3]
Watching buttercups cup the light
Sleeping on a dandelion

[Refrain]
Too much, I won’t touch you
But then I might

[Verse 4]
Screaming through the starlit sky
Traveling by telephone

[Refrain]
Hey, ho, here we go
Ever so high

[Verse 5]
Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown

[Refrain]
Yippee! You can’t see me
But I can you

[Hook]
Every time your girl gimme that pussy, killin' it
Every time I get a pack I mix it, I’m killin' it
Got so many damn chains on I’m glistenin', I’m killin' it
Every time a nigga see me out, I’m shittin', I’m killin' it

[Verse 1]
Rich gang, Soulja Boy got a lot of tats
Rich gang Soulja Boy keep alot of scrap
Riding in a bugatti I finess a pack
Wake up in the morning and im sleeping racks
Riding round the city, Soulja Boy killin' it
I can't drive the car if it ain't no foreign whip
Turn my swag on cause I finess a brick
Spent a couple racks just cause I'm filthy rich
Keep alot of scraps on me im in love with stacks
Keep alot of money on me im in love with racks
Stay high all set Soulja make it back
You ain't even gotta ask shawty I got a pack

[Hook]
Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wondering in the night, what were the chances?
We'd be sharing love before the night was through

Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away and

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

[Instrumental-first three lines of Chorus]
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night
Dooby-doooby-doo and other scat to end
So amazing, unbelievable, miraculous women you are
Incredible, unforgetable, your the worlds greatest by far
Sensational, so lovable, my cinderella you are
So beautiful, ghetto fabulous, the reason I wish upon a star
As I lay me down to sleep I, pray your heart ill always keep it
Hope you feel the same
So baby come and hop on board my life and
Just let love take us away

[Hook:]
Dream girl lets take a flight
Far away to a paradise
Dream girl lets take a ride
Destination rainbow skys
Dream girl lets kiss and hug
On a beach with white sand and all white doves
Dream girl lets cuddle up
Somewhere, where ever and make sweet love

Baby you are my dream, dream, dream, dream girl
My sunshine, my blueskys, love is who you are to me girl
My angel, my piece of mind, woman you have come to set me free
Love makin, breath takin, sweet valentines to me
Heart racin, creatin, and incredible fire within me
I believe in you and me, together for all eternity
And I hope you feel the same
So baby come and hope on board my life and, let love take us away

[Hook]

Baby this love we make is to good to be true
Heaven must really love me because heaven sent me you
Keep bringing me joy, I dont wanna wake up
I stay asleep as long as I can have you right here in my dreams

Survival of the fittest it is well known there's no water like my city's

Niggas got choppas niggas got trimmers
Niggas got problems niggas got business

Bitches got bitches

No he don't want that & he don't want this

You know I gotta put the dollar sign before the bitch
Every movie gotta end but I'm just stickin to the script
Addicted to the chips commited to my clique
Cash money mother fucker get the pistol to your lips

[Intro: Big Sean]
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
I look up, I say I think it's time to kill it

[Verse 1 : Big Sean]
Bitch I'm sexy as fuck, you ain't even gotta tell me
I ride around to Pac, I fuck my girl to R. Kelly
I tell her make me a sandwich, no PP & Jelly
She look back like "Goddamn, what you think this? A deli?"
I'm screaming "Hell yeah trick, Hell yeah ho"
That shit make her love me more, and she know I love her too
She know I been to hell and through, I need what Reverends do
Power of the revenue got me a 2 to 10 and a 10 to 2
I gotta shine boy I be a star, on fire that's a meteor
So I'm either or on TV with a Rita Ora set your DVR
Stacking money face to face what that mean CPR
Everyday the day date, gangbang major pain
D-Town I ride around me and my dog like Charlie Brown
Just trying to get that white money you know, countin' cake and KK's
On a day to day base, then vacay for eight days
You know muthafuck taking a vacation
Put palm trees up in my house and have a stay-cation
Getting paid while I'm chilling that's a paid-cation
Full glass of champagne, Oh no, you can't taste it

[Chorus]
I seen cars (switch up)
Seen Hoes (switch up)
Seen Money all switch up
When the days get dimmer
Who gone leave you there and who gon leave with ya
This is for the ones that's always riding with ya ain't switched
I ain't switch up naw naw I ain't switched up
Same me naw naw I ain't
Switch up
Same team naw naw I ain't switched up
I think it's time to kill it

[Bridge: Big Sean]
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
I said I think its time to kill it

[Verse 2 : Common]
Bought a Cadillac, now I’m Cadillac Com
She ride alright, when I'm riding right, Put Cadillac on that lawn
Might even let her meet Ye, might even let her meet Sean
Might even let her meet Push, she never meet my Mom
Chi Town is my town, I ride around like I'm lying down
Southside my eyes down, I'm the shit y'all fly around(Oww)
I’m in my mode today, sayin what the fuck I’m ‘posed to say
Moving making money, got them trashbags back
Smoke Chibahs with leaders, Pussy sweet and I'll eat her
Got strippers and divas, plus some cougars and cheetahs
Oh you with GOOD, put me on like Bonita
I said ease up, ease up, ease up
Ain’t nobody fucking with my clique

[Interlude: Big Sean]
And all these bad bitches man, they want the.. (dick).. (they do)

[Verse 3 : Big Sean]
All I care bouts my crew, my family and women
Except these women that’s hoing, and these hoes that be stealing
Trying to get them a cut, that’s how you end up with stitches
I tell a bitch quit playing, and play ya position
Either move or get devoured, fuck a coward
I be fresher than these motherfuckers head to toe
If I rocked Eddie Bauer, but I dont
Aura Gold, everything I do I do it overboard Michael Phelps splash,
Smile for the polaroid, self-employed
Now you shelf employed, D-Boy
Never sold, but I still got more lines than corduroy
And I'm with the same crew til I'm an old man
Cause there no such thing as new old friends

[Chorus]
I seen cars (switch up)
Seen Hoes (switch up)
Seen Money all switch up
When the days get dimmer
Who gone leave you there and who gon leave with ya
This is for the ones that's always riding with ya ain't switched
I ain't switch up naw naw I ain't switched up
Same me naw naw I ain't
Switch up
Same team naw naw I ain't switched up
I think it's time to kill it

Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it

[Outro: Big Sean]
Rollin' with the same team I ain't switched shit
Rollin' with the same team I ain't switched shit
I'm with the same OGs
The same old team,and you know my team
Ain't switched

[Intro]
I had to do it Mr. Ross
I had to

[Interlude]
I am the man so proud I am
Came here as a boy, staying here as a man
People they don't get it, try to see it if you can
Livin' in la la land ain't all that bad
Because...

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
Want to look for me my nigga
You can look up at the stars

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I tap dance on the cloud like I'm Savion Glover
In tune with my roots like the Reading Rainbow nigga
I'm here to give the kids new li-ter-ature
I am the cure to the wack juice over flow
Gettin' a new beat, recycle' their old flows
What were they thinkin' when they wrote it?
The Lord knows, but I suppose raps hungry hungry hippos
Decided to look over Kid Cudi with the glow
Cool beans though, 10 Deep jeans hoes
Stampede fitted, in the Range with a knitted
No gimmick, real time, real heart, real words, elegant, a piece of art
I never be retro or like a cool kid
With only two songs, look at what I did
No famous name vouch and I'm still the shit
Nigga, first couple songs, no guest appearances
No big names, no big chains
Just Plain Pat visions with some sick aim
Now you sick mane, I ain't taking stabs
I'm just taking names then I'm kickin' ass
Me & my nigga Wale let them suckas pass
Until we fed up & wed up
Where niggas keep they swag to the heart
Ruin niggas hopes for success
After Lebron, I'm what's next
Next, next... to pass the baton of success
I pass an event, hoes seem to forget
My only cash flow was from bape
Now these hoes can't stunt pictures of my face
They know

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
Want to look for me my nigga
You can look up at the stars

[Interlude: Kid Cudi]
I am the man so proud I am
Came here as a boy, staying here as a man
People they don't get it, try to see it if you can
Livin' in la la land ain't all that bad
Because...

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
Want to look for me my nigga
You can look up at the stars

[Verse 1]
Made me kiss ya with a whisper
And violently you swung through unfamiliar tongue
Couldn't listen to tradition
Grab me by the wrist to silently insist

[Chorus]
And when I'm in the confines of crawling walls
You hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling, the avenues
Unsugared taste
We'll waste away the evening
The afternoon and the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

[Verse 2]
You stood shirtless and confident
Listening to the fools, tickling the rules
Their obsessions followed patterns
Sat upon their stools with their attitudes

[Chorus]
And when I'm in the confines of crawling walls
You hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling, the avenues
Unsugared taste
We'll waste away the evening
The afternoon and the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And when I'm in the confines of crawling walls
You hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling, the avenues
Unsugared taste
We'll waste away the evening
The afternoon and the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

[Verse 1]
I watched you cry
Bathed in sunlight
By the bathroom door
You said you wished you did not love me anymore
You left your flowers in the backseat of my car
The things we said and did have left permanent scars

[Pre-Chorus]
Obsessed, depressed at the same time
I can't even walk in a straight line
I've been lying in the dark, no sunshine
No sunshine
No sunshine

[Chorus]
She cries
This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even there
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have, oh yeah
(Just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling)
'Cause I can't believe that it's over

[Verse 2]
You've hit your low
You've lost control and you wanna come back
You may not believe me, but I gave you all I had

[Pre-Chorus]
Undress, confess that you're still mine
Roll around in a bed full of tears
I'm still lying in the dark, no sunshine
No sunshine
No sunshine

[Chorus]
She cries
This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even there (Yeah)
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
(It's just a feeling) Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
No, I can't believe that it's over now
(Just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling)
It's just a feeling, just a feeling that I have, oh

[Bridge]
So much to say
It's not the way she does her hair
It's the way she seems to stare right through my eyes (Oh-oh)
And in the darkest day when she refused to run away
From love she tried so hard to save

[Chorus]
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have (Oh)

Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
(It's just a feeling) It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have (Oh, oh yeah)

[Outro]
I can't believe that it's over
(It's just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling that I have)
I can't believe that it's over
(It's just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling that I have)
Now I can't believe that's it's over, yeah

[Verse]
Ok, I be on that money though
Balling like K Durant, I hit you that thunder ho
Lightning Breitling on my wrist
My necklace it look sunny though
I’ma kill these rappers till they say Meek I don’t want no more
I ain’t gotta say I’m back, I was never frontin' though
Rappers thought they fucking with me, bottom line like underscore
Everything I do is hot, I give em that summer flow
All year around hit the stage, tear it down, hit me now, hear me now
Clearly pal, this Philly in its flesh
I ain’t never get a tat but I got Philly on my back
I put castle in my back, I put Gillie on that track
And bring that real shit to the front, all that dissing to the back
Hold up, hundred thousand mixtape sold, facts
I got it from Jahlil that the same place I get my tracks
I’m slammin for my city, he put Chester on that map
I take em everywhere I go, I keep em closer than my strap
Ok, we be making hits, and you be wastin' time
Cause everything we put out go up like Kobe from the line
They told me I keep goin' and keep flowin' I’ma shine
And then they calling us the dream team, Kobe and LeBron
Is that your girl, I’m a g, what I rep, M-O-B
If he say he fuckin with me, what I say, N-O-T
You know me, I stay fly, I stay fresh, I stay high
Pull up in the Maserati, tap the gas and I say bye {Skiirrt}
They can’t even keep up, and I ain’t even heat up
Wait till I sign my deal and draw my line and we gone sweep up
Beat the beat up, take the streets up, pop famous like a reefer
I’m like an iPhone volume that stop buzzin' like a beeper
I sneak up, fuck the game up
Talk leds, reel my name up
I done came up, from the same stuff
Run tracks just like a train up
You lame bra, what’s your name son?
Top 5 what I came for
My shit shine like a rainbow, your put that pussy chain up
Look what you niggas made me do, shit shine like baby blue
Pick your favorite rapper, I’ll put me and him on pay per view
We get busting paper too, thanks giving on your artist
They say my barz the craziest, my flow's just so retarded
Im started now wrap me up
Go hard, no lettin' up
These cops, wanna lock me down
Haters, wanna wet me up
Praying on my downfall, I know you ain’t gone help me up
I guess I’ll do the ground work, let Tip and Cali set me up
I’m gone nigga
I said I’m gone
Coexist
The devils in the dealer,the poltergeist is in the pokerchips
Game changer, I practice Iron Swan Song, Tiger Palm & Cobra Fist
Go by many slang name's and sobriquets
Asking me how many lines is in my mind
Is like asking how many fish can the ocean fit
I set out to do the impossible like an open fist,
Achieve the unbelievable like throwing Open Pit
The last line refers to flying saucers
A rhyming Chaucer who came from District 9 but now he's flying over it
Battle Jay Elect? Who has the foolhardy audacity to utter this?
I look at him like a high minded brother from another and when we finally encounter
With dual flows overdosed on over-the-counter's
Its gone be like Mulder meets the Mothership
Friend Of The People, Fuck the government...
"Well Toby, still want to be bionic?"
"You bet! I saw the way you mopped up those guys. If I could do that there wouldn't be a kid in town that could make me..."
"Toby, listen to me. What you saw in there was a man being forced to go berzerk because there are parts of his body he wasn't born with"

Hearers of the tone with the sensitive poem
Transmitted with the voice like a sousaphone
We be beaming these rhymes to the satellite
With the Human Beatbox for the people's delight

I run the three-legged race in a potato sack
I put a whole potato salad right down your back
I get mad respect at the old folk's home
Your mama's grandpapa won't leave me alone

Crank up the bass and redline the game
You're like the Tidy Bowl man spinning down the drain
Cause I'm a cyborg created to emcee
We're gonna change our name to The Disco Three

Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em
Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em
Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em
Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em
Update my firmware and I'm good to go
I'm like "Danger, Will Robinson! Danger, Will Robinson!"
Coming down the block and you're like "Oooo!"
Bionic eye with the do-do-do-do-do-do....

I got my gear on like the Ear-ons
The human switchboard and interferons
We Jam On It like Newcleus
I'm known on a roll like Caduceus

Do androids dream of electric sheep?
Well, either way you're going to sow just what you reap
Cause I'm a replicant, not a skin-job
Yo, HAL, open the fuckin' doors to the pod

Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em
Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em
Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em
Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em

Ah! Ah!
(Human Beatbox sample)

Smooth like butter, pure like ghee
Let me get up on the mic with the do-re-me
My dog's name is Sam, not Fifi
I'm profilin' a boulangerie
Robotron, Gorf, and Galaga
I got the sexy Dig Dug calendar
Mix Master's scratching like he's got lice
The crabs! Hey yo, that ain't nice!

Like One-Eyed Jacks and Suicide Kings
You want wildness, wild I bring
My Uncle Freddie's making horseradish
To serve you on a platter like gefilte fish

Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em
Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em
Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em
Brrr, stick 'em, ha-ha-ha, stick ' em

"Well Toby, still want to be bionic?"
"What do you think you're doing in here you little agh..."

[Verse 1 - David Gilmour]
Bridges burning gladly merging with the shadow
Flickering between the lines
Stolen moments floating softly on the air
Born on wings of fire and climbing higher

[Verse 2 - Richard Wright (backed by Gilmour)]
Ancient bonds are breaking
Moving on and changing sides
Dreaming of a new day
Cast aside the other way
(Magic vision stirring
Kindled by and burning
Flames rise in her eyes)

[Verse 3 - David Gilmour and Richard Wright]
The door that stands ajar
The walls that once were high
Beyond the gilded cage
Beyond the reach of ties
The moment is at hand
She breaks the golden band

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
To wake up in the morning is a motherfuckin' blessin'
Grab my AK I ain't motherfuckin' stressin'
Standing in the kitchen and I'm whippin' up the babies
Only thing on my mind is how to buy me a Mercedes
Scrapin' up the pot, tryna come up with the extra
Young niggas rob and I heard that they finesse ya
Ain't no pressure, get the .38 special
Only thing on my mind is how to put you on a stretcher

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I pull up solo dolo in a motherfuckin' Lambo
Sippin' lean all on my Polo, makin' niggas out examples
Your girlfriend want a photo cuz she say she like my wardrobe
Got Louie on my feet and I got diamonds in my earlobes
My prices buy so low but shawty tell me somethin' I don't know
My niggas are so cuthroat man they dirty like a dope bowl
I made a hundred thousand right on Bouldercrest and Flat Shoals
Worth a half a million when I moved over to Creel Road
Servin' through the _____ with the do' closed
Got more blocks than Dikembe Mutumbo
Gave holmes a whole thang to blow a nigga head off
.44 bulldog when I drop the bread off

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I pulled up with a chauffeur and my motherfuckin' Rolls Royce
Glock 19 bought my purp and a pair of Jordans
Gucci Mane my nigga so you know I fuck with Bricksquad
My ___ speak bilingual don't do English, they the brick squad
2 tops on my Vette, middle finger to a squad car
Cool hundred bricks, that fill up a smart car
Energy efficient niggas winnin' on the gas rate
48 a pound, want 10? Okay 38
_____ amaze me, while the kitchen slave me
One time to the dope boys, they the ones who raised me
I fuck with the robbers, I hang with the murderers
Finna get that new Bentley, but then didn't come convertible

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I been gettin' money since I motherfuckin' came here
Same shit, cop and go, naw ain't nothin' change here
Know I got that haze, sour, and a couple kushes
Shorty got the rock, and the Glock is in the bushes
One already in the head, hollows in a full clip
All my niggas bout that bread, we ain't bout that bullshit
Work is good, make sure your connect keep it real with you
Hundred on the chain, quarter million on the vehicle
Spit a couple bars, get some budgets, sign a deal or two
Drink some liquor, fuck some bad bitches, pop a pill or two
Killin' you, young black rich nigga, ain't no need in stressin'
Be thankful for what you got my nigga, it's a blessin'

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Taylor Gang or Die
FFC
Crowd Cloud
Heavy Hustle
*laugh*
Rostrum Records
Yeah. Me

Big money, small money
Short money, tall money

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Soon after we locked eyes
I had a vision of me inside
I stimulate your mind and give your body everything that it wants
Private school her whole life
Got an infatuation with being bad
You take her out to shop
To spend it all cause she don't see those tags
I get deep inside her soul though
If she was a guitar I'd treat her like a solo
And put my fingers through your hair
And last night was amazing I can honestly say that you the best I ever had
And you don't remember cause you weren't even there..
But your soul was..

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Keep going..

Just.. just catch up with the next one..

Ay..
Ay Ay..
Ay..

We don't make love I touch your soul girl.. *laugh*

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
She don't party where the rest go
You need to be able to let your hair down so you can feel good..
Here you can buy your own drinks, drive your own car, purchase the Louis bags on your own
Her parents money long but since she grown she'd rather spend yours..
I get deep inside her soul though
Go into the drag and beat it like I'm bolo..
Until you think it's to much..
And even though now you figuring out how or what we shouldn't did..
To your friends you'll admit that we had fun.. okay..

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Ay Ay..
Ay Ay..

[Verse 1: John Record]
Let's ride to the gate so you can meet the man..
Call me Peter Pan I'mma take you to never never land..
When your all dried up here's an ocean to wet the sand..
Of course I'mma see what's good with your physical..

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm relighting in the dark to her lock I got the key
And niggas down to get a copy..
Damn..
How does it feel this great when your not even here..
And you climax with the thought of me
That mean we gotta be..

[Verse 1]
Somebody shakes when the wind blows
Somebody's missing a friend, hold on
Somebody's lacking a hero
And they have not a clue
When it's all gonna end, again

[Verse 2]
Stories buried and untold
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on
When will this mystery unfold?
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?

[Chorus]
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna to take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

[Verse 3]
People laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is takin' a life, hold on
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me where were you
When your children cried last night?

[Verse 4]
Faces fill with madness, oh
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is to reach for the truth, the truth

[Chorus]
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

[Bridge]
And when that flag blows
There'll be no more wars (Ooh, why?)
And when all calls
I will answer all your prayers, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky, oh no (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (Come on, I need some kind of sign)
If we all cry (Cry with me) at the same time tonight
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself, alright)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one, whoa (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
You can change the world (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
If we all cry at the same time tonight
If we all cry at the same time tonight

[Outro]
Change the world

[Verse 1]
Hold my hand, feel the touch of your body cling to mine
You and me, making love all the way through another night
I remember you and I walking through the park at night
Kiss and touch, nothing much, let it blow just touch and go
Love me more, never leave me alone by house of love
People talk, people say what we have is just a game
Oh, I’ll never let you go, come here girl
Just got to make sweet love ‘til the break of dawn

[Chorus]
I don’t want the sun to shine I want to make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don’t know what I’m going to do - I can’t stop loving you
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn making love

[Verse 2]
Hold my hand, feel the sweat, yes you’ve got me nervous yet
Let me groove, let me soothe, let me take you on a cruise
There’s imagination I bet you've never been there before
Have you ever wanted to dream about those places you’ve never known

[Pre-Chorus]
(Break of dawn, break of dawn) there’s no sun up in the sky
(Break of dawn, break of dawn) I can see it in your eyes
(Break of dawn, break of dawn) girl you got to understand
It’s the way that I love you, let me show you I’m your man
Break of dawn

[Chorus]
I don’t want the sun to shine I want to make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don’t know what I’m going to do - I can’t stop loving you
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn making love
I don’t want the sun to shine I want to make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don’t know what I’m going to do - I can’t stop loving you
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn making love

[Bridge]
Let’s not wait, the sun is out, let’s get up and let’s get out
It’s the day, a brand new day, let’s both go outside and play
Let us walk down the park, making love ‘til it’s dark
Let me move, let me soothe, ‘til the break of dawn and you know it’s true, oh

[Chorus]
I don’t want the sun to shine I want to make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don’t know what I’m going to do - I can’t stop loving you
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn making love
I don’t want the sun to shine I want to make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don’t know what I’m going to do - I can’t stop loving you
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn making love
I don’t want the sun to shine I want to make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don’t know what I’m going to do - I can’t stop loving you
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn making love
Break it down

[Chorus]
Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

[Verse 1]
You're beautiful, you're wonderful
Incredible, I love you so
You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do, if I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me I'd tell them no

[Chorus]
Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

[Verse 2]
Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no

[Chorus]
Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
(My bay-beah!)
I don't want nobody else to hold you
(Don't you do this do me!)
That's a chance I'll take
(If the angels come around!)
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
(Just tell them to bring me down to my baby!)
No, if the angels took me from this earth
(Don't you do this do me!)
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

[Verse 3]
Oh no, can't be without my baby
(I can't be without my baby!)
Won't go, without her, I'd go crazy
(You can't do this to me!)
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
(See, if the angels come around, just tell them to bring me down, to my baby!)
Ooh
Oh no, can't be without my baby
(Don't you do this do me!)
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
(I can't be without my baby!)
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
(I love you, girl! I need you, baby! I want you, baby!)
Ooh

[Chorus]
No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

[Outro]
Leave us alone
Just leave us alone
(You're beautiful, you’re wonderful, incredible, I love you so)
Leave us alone
Please leave us alone
(You’re beautiful)
Please leave us alone
Oh, leave me alone
Please leave me alone
I said leave me alone

[Intro: Chris Tucker & Michael Jackson]
Oh man! Look at that girl, right there!
Goodness gracious! That girl fine, man!
Look at it, she just too fine! She know she fine too!
She is banging!
She's off the hook!
She looks good, you're right
Hey, I bet you, can't nobody get that girl
Chris, I can get her
You can't get that girl, Mike
I guarantee you can't get that girl!
Watch me get that girl
I bet you never-Neverland, you can't

All right! Shamone, then, shamone!
Watch

Darkchild, I like that

[Verse 1]
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed

I cannot explain these things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels so right (Girl)

And I finally found, come on, girl

And everything I own I give (Come on, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

[Verse 2]
In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I (Oh)
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for all my life (Searched for all my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find

Such a perfect love that's awesomely so right (Whoa, girl)

You rocked my world, you know you did (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Girl)
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know you did
And everything I own I give (Girl, girl, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find

The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

[Bridge]
And girl, I know that this is love
I feel the magic all in the air
And girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I always have to have you here, hoo

[Chorus]
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know you did
And everything I own I give (Look what you did to me, baby, yeah)

The way you talk to me, the way you're lovin' me
The way you give it to me

The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

[Intro: Michael Jackson & Marsha Ambrosius]
Butterflies

Da de -de -de -da, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum
Butterflies, inside

[Verse 1]
All you got to do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile
When I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my call
When I'm trying to get through
Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

[Chorus]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
'Cause you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I

[Verse 2]
All I gotta say is that I must be dreamin', can't be real
You're not here with me
Still I can feel you near to me, yeah
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby
Just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies

[Chorus]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I

[Bridge]
If you will take my hand, baby, I will show you
Guide you to the light, then
If you will be my love, baby, I will love you
Love you, 'til the end of time

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Marsha Ambrosius]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Girl, you give me)
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I (I just wanna touch you)
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna, I wanna, be with you, girl)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Talk to me, baby) (Inside)
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna touch you)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Butterflies)
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna, I wanna, be with you, girl)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Wanna be with you) (You give me)
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I

[Verse 1]
Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel

[Chorus]
But I am speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real

[Verse 2]
When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you I'm in the light where I cannot be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground

[Chorus]
Speechless (speechless), speechless (speechless), that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real

[Verse 3]
I'd go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face
There's no mountain high I cannot climb
I'm humbled in your grace

[Chorus]
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you, I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless

[Outro]
Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence I am lost for words
Words like
Like, "I love you"

Dance
Don't you overload, baby

[Verse 1]
Once, all alone
I was lost, in a world of strangers
No, one to trust
On my own, I was lonely
You, suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before, but now it's all clear
You, took away the fear
And you brought me back to the light

[Chorus]
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my night time
My world
You are my life

[Verse 2]
Now, I wake up, every day
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
‘Cause you love me
You, help me understand
That love is the answer, to all that I am
And I'm, I'm a better man
Since you taught me by sharing your life

[Chorus]
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my night time
My world
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my night time
My world

[Bridge]
You gave me strength
When I wasn’t as strong
You gave me hope, when all hope was lost
You opened my eyes, when I couldn't see
Love was always here waiting, for me

[Chorus]
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my night time
My world
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my night time
My world
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my nighttime
My world
You are my life

[Intro]
Ooh, don't walk away
Walk away

[Verse 1]
Don't walk away
See, I just can't find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so you’ll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray

[Chorus]
How can I stop losing you?
How can I begin to say
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away? Yeah

[Verse 2]
I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time
But it's been so long, now all I do is cry
Can’t we find some love to take this away?
'Cause the pain gets stronger every day

[Chorus]
How can I begin again?
How am I to understand
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away? Yeah

[Verse 3]
See, and why
All my dreams been broken
I don't know where we’re going
With everything we said and all we done now
Don't let go, I don't wanna walk away
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
And why?
All my dreams been broken
I don’' know where we’re going
When everything begins to set us free
Can't you see? I don't wanna walk away

[Outro]
If you go, I won't forget you, girl (Please don't go)
Can't you see that you will always be? (You will always be)
Even though I had to let you go (Don't you leave me, don't you leave me)
There’s nothing left to do
Don't walk away
If you go, I won't forget you, girl (Please, please don't leave, you will always)
Can't you see that you will always be? (Can't you see you and me?)
Even though (You will always be), I had to let you go
Better leave now, don't you leave me
When there's nothin' left to do
Don't walk away
If you go, I won't forget you, girl (Oh no, oh yeah, baby girl)
Can't you see? (You and me), that you will always be (I won't forget you, girl, I won't forget you, girl)
Even though (I won't forget you, girl), I had to let go
Better leave now, better leave now
There's nothin' left do
Don't walk away

[Verse 1]
We pray for our fathers
Pray for our mothers
Wishing our families well
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
But not for the missing

[Chorus]
So this one’s for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

[Verse 2]
When you sit there addressing
Counting your blessings
Biding your time
When you lay me down sleeping
And my heart is weeping
Because I'm keeping a place

[Chorus]
For all the lost children
This is for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

[Verse 3]
Home with their fathers
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
I see the door simply wide open
But no one can find thee

[Chorus]
So pray for all the lost children
Let’s pray for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well
This is for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children
Wishing them well, and wishing them home

[Verse 1]
He gives another smile, tries to understand her side
To show that he cares
She can't stay in the room
She's consumed with everything that's been going on
She says
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand

[Verse 2]
Everything will be alright, he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid that what they're doing is not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever

[Chorus]
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand

[Verse 3]
He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tries to explain, "It's you that makes me happy"
Whatever, whatever, whatever

[Chorus]
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, just don't let go of my hand

[Outro: Carlos Santana & Michael Jackson]
Thank you, man
Thank you, Carlos

[Verse 1]
Then there was rain
The sky wore a veil of gold and green
Night was the bride of a lonely day
Time just floated
Then there was rain
The sound foundations are crumbling
To the ground comes a pyramid tumbling
Time just floated away
We can watch it and stay and we can listen

[Chorus]
Oh, rainy day, come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

[Verse 2]
Then there was rain
And I spent the night with the Queen of Spain
My lonely little heart, well it broke again
Time so vicious
Singing, the deeper that the knife goes in the more you win
You end up with less than when you begin
The deeper that the knife goes in
Oh

[Chorus]
Oh, rainy day, come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

[Outro]
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

Big ass booty with a little bitty waist

[Verse 1]
I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Verse 2]
I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Bridge]
Dear Lord, when I get to heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothin' but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Outro]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?

[Intro]
We'll be forever loving Jah
We'll be forever loving Jah

[Verse 1]
Some they say see them walking up the street
They say we're going wrong to all the people we meet
But we won't worry, we won't shed no tears
We found a way to cast away the fears
Forever, yeah!

[Chorus]
(We'll be forever loving Jah) We'll be forever
(We'll be forever loving Jah) Forever, yes, and forever!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) There'll be no end

[Verse 2]
So, old man river, don't cry for me
I've got a running stream of love you see
So, no matter what stages, oh stages
Stages, stages they put us through
We'll never be blue
No matter what rages, oh rages
Changes, rages they put us through
We'll never be blue
We'll be forever, yeah!

[Chorus]
(We'll be forever loving Jah)
We'll be forever
(We'll be forever loving Jah)
Forever and ever, yes, and forever
(We'll be forever loving Jah)
'Cause there's no end

[Verse 3]
Because only a fool lean upon
Lean upon his own misunderstanding, oh, yeah
And then what has been hidden
From the wise and the prudent
Been revealed to the babe and the suckling
In everything, in every day, I say, yeah!

[Chorus]
(We'll be forever loving Jah)
We'll be forever
(We'll be forever loving Jah)

[Verse 4]
Because just like a tree planted
Planted by the rivers of water
That bringeth forth fruits
Bringeth forth fruits in due season
Everything in life got its purpose
Find its reason in every season
Forever, yeah!

[Outro]
(We'll be forever loving Jah)
We'll be forever
(We'll be forever loving Jah)
On and on and on and on

We'll be forever, yes, yes we'll be forever
(We'll be forever loving Jah)
We got to be forever
Yeah, uh, it’s for my..., niggas
My... real, niggas
My Canada niggas
It’s the realest shit I ever wrote
It’s the illest shit she’ll ever quote

Uh, I know these niggas love to hate me but fuck it, I’m with it
I’m running the city!
A buck fifty for them bitches were a bucket of fifty
Swiss cheese for some niggas I’m fucking with swiftly
And break bread with all them niggas is hustling with me
I know the feeling I felt it before feeling it
Screw fake city I felt it before grilling it
I grew up fast, too much cash
In the brain of this nigga, that ain’t blew up fast
I send prayers to my mom though, my mind on the dime though
I’mma keep kickin', till I’m looking like Rolando
Stress is my feeling, cause I’m feeling it’s my time though
Knowing I’mma kill it, I’m the illest from my time bro
Time zone, time switch, I get grind, get money and a mind switch
I’m in a mosh pit, with no money, so hungry than a live pit
Before the country I rap it cause it’s my shit
I, guess I'm seeing how you niggas get
If I was on my face, you wouldn’t give a nigga shit
So fuck you all young owe a nigga enough
And everybody’s selling dreams and most of the niggas bluffing
Ain’t gotta brag, and boast a nigga, I’m coming
They know what they’re fucking fear
They show it all in the public
Yeah, but I can see them through my third eye
We gonna be on top, shots watching from the bird’s eye
View from the school, no rules where the birds lie
I was in the basement, trying to get the words out
All the brothers locked up for trying to put some birds out
Million on this case they was trying to bring the herd out
He tried to feed his family, trying to see a Grammy
Working so hard, I ain’t got time to see my family
Niggas on the B role, they’ll be fucking with me
That if I don't make this rapping they go back to selling kilos
You gotta understand that a nigga like me I was raised where
If you got a beef, you throw the hands back
Fuck what your man’s at!
If it’s going down, it’s right now for the hand clap
You down, and you staring back, back to my bullshit
Used to chill with niggas that was strapped with a full clip
Squad up type niggas, started problems over bullshit
But he never caught up, look how he was brought up
Stay up on your feet, cause the closest niggas harm ya
Breaking the alarms up, we was doing bad like there was no such thing as karma
Shout my nigga, that’s the way, he didn’t have no armor
Had my nigga, Big leaning like he was out from....
I can’t see it any further
Lot of single mothers, I ain’t seeing any fathers
She don't see either
Maybe on the weekend, if you see some cooking decent, and
He'll probably call her, and she'll probably spoil him, and
Been rich, went broke, then rich again
With all that I’ve seen and found a lot of missing friends, niggas
That was just pretend, fuck the bails, skip the pen
Riding like District 10, a hundred bands just to spin
Rumor a nigga whispering, what’s a nigga whispering
To a mother fucker that ain’t listening, and bitches just
Jump on a nigga dick, ride it cause a nigga sick
Then the buzz dying, all the mother fucking bitches dip
I don’t give a fuck now, made a nigga numb now
Bitch who’s going dumb, and I’ll never plan the dumb down
I face it, going harder, then it’s bass and its sounds fair
Let the game play and I'll make a goal like a touch down!
I put that on Syriah, I’m on fire
Get a mother fucking grip, nigga bald tire
Fuck these nigga and these bitches, they are all liars
But got niggas and some bitches, nigga bonfires
Yeah, and I'm forever on some fly shit
I’mma draw the line, you niggas pick who you gonna ride with
Shot goes out to Nipsey, I fuck with you for fucking with me
Half of niggas is pussies, you pussy niggas is dickies
Hickies left on my neck from a bitch, I swear that she get me
Me and her both know that she only here for my Benjies
Roldses, Benzes, and Bentleys
Politics couldn't prevent me
So all you niggas resent me for all the hate that you send me
But, it's okay though, I only came up
Sense for the future, back in high school
Teachers called me a looser
Cause she thought that I was focused on banging, soo woopin'
Fuck you for not using
The better side of you and judging the young nigga
With dreams and aspirations for making my funds bigger
Aye, a lot of things I had to figure out
So fake shit don’t ever come about this nigga mouth!
Nigga, Canada! Aha! Live nigga trying to shit on me, it’s all good nigga
I’m about to get mine nigga, when I get it don’t ask me for nothing, nigga
I don’t owe a nigga nothing, nigga
Yeah! And all my niggas back home, we gonna get there in a minute my nigga
We gonna get this money!

[Verse 1]
I need a camera to my eye
To my eye, reminding
Which lies have I been hiding
Which echoes belong

[Pre-Chorus]
I've counted out
The days to see how far
I've driven in the dark
With echoes in my heart

[Chorus]
Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
And no, it's not okay

[Verse 2]
I smashed a camera
I wanna know why
To my eye, deciding
Which lies have I been hiding
Which echoes belong

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm counting on
A heart I know by heart
To walk me through this war
Where memories distort

[Chorus]
Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
And no, it's not okay

[Pre-Chorus]
I've counted out
And no one knows how far
(Tell 'em I'm lost)
I've driven in the dark
(Tell 'em I'm lost)
With echoes in my heart
(Tell 'em I'm lost)

[Chorus]
Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost
Yeah, I'm lost
And no, it's not okay

[Outro]
No, it's not okay
No, it's not okay

[Verse 1]
Cheer up, honey, I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with silvery stars
Honey, kisses, clouds of fluff
Shoulders shrugging off

[Verse 2]
Cheer up, honey, I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with radio cures
Electronic surgical words

[Chorus]
Picking apples for the kings and queens
Of things I've never seen
Oh, distance has no way
Of making love understandable

[Verse 3]
Cheer up, honey, I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with silvery stars
Honey, kisses, clouds of fluff

[Chorus]
Picking apples for the kings and queens
Of things I've never seen
Oh, distance has no way
Of making love understandable

Oh, distance has no way
Of making love understandable

Oh, distance has no way
Of making love understandable

Oh, distance has no way
Of making love understandable

Cheer up, honey, I hope you can

[Verse 1]
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
There's a war on

[Chorus]
You're gonna lose
You have to lose
You have to learn how to die

[Verse 2]
Let's watch the miles flying by
Let's watch the miles flying by
You are not my typewriter
But you could be my demon
Moving forward through flaming doors

[Chorus]
You have to lose
You have to learn how to die
If you want to want to be alive
Okay

[Chorus]
You have to lose
You have to lose
You have to learn how to die
If you want to want to be alive

[Chorus]
You have to die
You have to die
You have to learn how to die
If you want to want to be alive
Okay

[Verse 1]
Oh, I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love

[Verse 2]
Shiny, shiny pants and bleached blond hair
A double kick drum by the river in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
Another then another
She fell in love

[Chorus]
I miss the innocence I've known
Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned

[Verse 3]
Unlock my body and move myself to dance
Moving warm liquid, flowing blowing glass
Classical music blasting masks the ringing in my ears

[Verse 1]
Oh, I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with another
She fell in love

[Chorus]
I miss the innocence I've known
Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned
I miss the innocence I've known
Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned
Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned
Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned

[Verse 1]
All I can see is black and white
And white and pink with blades of blue
That lay between the words I think on a page
I was meaning to send to you
I couldn’t tell if it’d bring my heart
The way I wanted when I started
Writing this letter to you

[Chorus]
But if I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you’d understand
I’m the man who loves you

[Verse 2]
All I can be is a busy sea
Of spinning wheels and hands that feel for
Stones to throw and feet that run but
Come back home
It made no difference
Ever known, it made no difference
Ever known to me

[Chorus]
But if I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you’d understand
I’m the man who loves you

[Verse 3]
All I can see is black and white
And white and pink with blades of blue
That lay between the words I think on a page
I was meaning to send to you
I couldn’t tell if it’d bring my heart
The way I wanted when I started
Writing this letter to you

[Chorus]
But if I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you’d understand
If I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you’d understand
If I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you’d understand
I’m the man who loves you

[Outro]
I’m the man who loves you
I’m the man who loves you
I’m the man who loves you
I’m the man who loves you

[Verse 1]
Crazy rides rockets
Where's your magic wand?
Empty out your pockets
Words without a song
I, myself, have found a real rival in myself
I am hoping for a re-arrival of my health

[Verse 2]
Sleeping eye sockets
Baby, suck your thumb
I'll keep you in my locket
A string I never strum
It's become so obvious
You are so oblivious to yourself

[Chorus]
Tied in a knot
But I'm not gonna get caught
Calling a pot kettle black
Every song's a comeback
Every moment's a little bit later

[Verse 3]
Lazy locomotives
Wherever you may roll
I think you have no motive
I know you have no home
It's become so obvious
You are so oblivious to yourself

[Chorus]
Tied in a knot
But I'm not gonna get caught
Calling a pot kettle black
Every song's a comeback
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later

[Outro]
Tied in a knot
But I'm not gonna get caught
Calling a pot kettle black
I'm not gonna get caught
Calling a pot kettle black
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
It's my father's voice trailing off
Sailors sailing off in the morning
For the air-conditioned rooms
At the top of the stairs

[Refrain]
His jaw's been broken
His bandage is wrapped too tight
His fangs have been pulled
And I really want to see you tonight

[Verse 2]
There's bourbon on the breath
Of the singer you love so much
He takes all his words from the books
That you don't read anyway

[Refrain]
His jaw's been broken
His bandage is wrapped too tight
His fangs have been pulled
And I really want to see you tonight

[Verse 3]
Someone ties a bow
In my backyard to show me love
My voice is climbing walls
Smoking and I wanted love

[Refrain]
My jaw's been broken
My heart is wrapped in ice
My fangs have been pulled
And I really want to see you tonight

[Bridge]
And it makes no difference to me
How they cried all over overseas
When it's hot in the poor places tonight
I'm not going outside

[Chorus]
They cried all over overseas
It makes no difference to me
When it's hot in the poor places tonight
I'm not going outside
("Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot")
It's hot in the poor places tonight
("Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot")
I'm not going outside
("Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot")
I'm not going outside
("Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot")
I'm not going outside

[Outro: Sample]
"Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot"
"Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot"
"Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot"
"Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot"
"Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot"
"Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot"
"Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot"
"Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot"
"Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot"
"Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot"
"Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot"
"Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot"
"Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot"
"Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot"
"Yankee, Hotel—"

[Verse 1]
How can I convince you, it's me I don't like
And not be so indifferent to the look in your eyes
When I've always been distant
And I've always told lies for love

[Verse 2]
I'm bound by these choices, so hard to make
I'm bound by the feeling, so easy to fake
None of this is real enough to take me from you

[Chorus]
Oh, I've got reservations
About so many things
But not about you

[Verse 3]
I know this isn't what you were wanting me to say
How can I get closer and be further away
From the truth that proves it's beautiful to lie

[Chorus]
Oh, I've got reservations
About so many things
But not about you

[Chorus]
Oh, I've got reservations
About so many things
But not about you

[Outro]
Not about you
Not about you
Not about you
It's not about you

[Intro]
Let my car run out
Cars burn out
I won't scream or shout
Lost my breath now
Let's die together, no one lives forever
(Cars burn out)
Let's die together, no one lives forever
Falling through the clouds
No one lives forever
Falling through the clouds
('Cause I feel like I'm in heaven, dancing)
No one lives forever

[Verse 1]
When you go, please don't leave your love in the sun
My heart will melt away
In the night, with your twisted tongue
When you drop the bomb, I'm blown away

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I refuse to hide in the page of your story
I come out the box, I won't say I'm sorry

[Chorus]
We in the nuclear season
In the shelter I'll survive this though
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat gone

[Verse 2]
Now I'm facing this on my own
'Cause you taste the blast and it shook your bones
I'm a warrior all alone
In the field of lies, I won't go home

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause I didn’t burn my skin in the blaze of glory
I come out your hands, I won’t say I’m sorry

[Chorus]
We in the nuclear season
In the shelter I'll survive this though
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat gone

[Post-Chorus]
We survived nuclear seasons
We survived nuclear seasons

[Bridge]
I can feel it, I can feel the fear
I can feel it, inside of my soul
Inside of the soul

[Chorus]
We in the nuclear season
In the shelter I'll survive this though
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat gone

[Post-Chorus]
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times, dark nights)
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times, dark nights)
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times, dark nights)
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times, dark nights)

[Hook]
Tin soldiers and Nixon coming
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drumming
Four dead in Ohio

[Verse]
Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her
And found her dead on the ground
How can you run when you know?

[Bridge]
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

[Verse]
Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her
And found her dead on the ground
How can you run when you know?

[Hook]
Tin soldiers and Nixon coming
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drumming
Four dead in Ohio

[Outro]
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio

[Verse 1]
Yeah, we got a situation
Lock down, and I'm trapped in the basement
I'm a victim of replacement
'Cause you acting so leather
Trying to put across your statement, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know you struggle
Choke when you see love grow

[Chorus]
You, you lied
Ha ha ha ha, I was right
All along, good job
Good job, you fucked it up

[Verse 2]
'Cause we used to be the cool kids
You were old school, I was on the new shit
We were addicted to the blue print
But we threw it in the flame
And now we're never gonna trace it, oh
'Cause we used to be the cool kids
You were old school, I was on the new shit
We were addicted to the blue print
But we threw it in the flame
And now we're never gonna trace it, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know you struggle
Choke when you see love grow

[Chorus]
You, you lied
Ha-ha-ha-ha, I was right
All along, good job
Good job, you fucked it up

[Bridge]
And now you're walking on your own
Rain falls down, I'm not answering my phone
I got to phase you out my zone
Hope you realize now that I am never coming home
You were meant to be alone

[Chorus]
You, you lied
Ha-ha-ha-ha, I was right
All along, good job
Good job, you fucked it up
It's a front, good job
Good job, you fucked it up
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)

[Verse 1]
You choke my throat with words of wonder
You make it hard to breathe
Your love's so cold, just like an arrow
Pierced through my skin, I bleed

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I knew you were no angel
But God, what did I do?

[Chorus]
Do you remember what I said that first time we met?
Stay away, why couldn't you stay away?
I never needed anyone, but now that you are gone
Stay away, won't you just stay away?

[Post-Chorus]
Taking all my light and blocking out my vision
Bad little girl you have trapped in the prison
On my hands, on my knees, pulled on the chains
Licking up the blood, yeah, I made this decision

[Verse 2]
You took my light
Trapped in the prison
You threw away the key
You are the curse, I am the captive
Walking on hands and knees

[Interlude]
Never learn, never learn
Never learn, never learn

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You were no angel
But God, you're just electric blue

[Chorus]
Do you remember what I said that first time we met?
Stay away, why couldn't you stay away?
I never needed anyone, but now that you are gone
Stay away, won't you just stay away?

[Breakdown]
Stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away
Stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away
Stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away
Stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away

[Bridge]
I climbed a wall to touch your shadow
I hear you call for me
But you're not there, you're just an echo
Why did you fall for me?

[Chorus]
Do you remember what I said that first time we met?
Stay away, why couldn't you stay away?
I never needed anyone, but now that you are gone
Stay away, won't you just stay away?

[Outro]
Taking all my light and blocking out my vision
Bad little girl you have trapped in the prison
Won't you just stay away?

[Verse 1]
Almost Heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

[Chorus]
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

[Verse 2]
All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

[Chorus]
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

[Bridge]
I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road, I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

[Chorus]
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

[Outro]
Take me home, (Down) country roads
Take me home, (Down) country roads

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Brooke Candy]
Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You're starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don't want to see your face
I'm starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart
Uh, uh, Brooke Candy

[Verse 1: Brooke Candy]
We were on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
Kept the blunts rolled, always let you take the first hit
When the feds caught us, I said I would take the rap
'Cause I knew it ain't easy livin' life in the trap
I was the Queen B and you were like my Jay Z
Only one who held me down when I was fuckin' crazy
Ivana and Trump, shit, we coulda ran the world
You were my Chris Brown, I was your only girl
Let you put your feet up while I was cookin' you breakfast
Thought I found my ride or die, but now I just regret shit
Log into your email 'cause I knew that shit was wrong
Pullin' up a private photo of a bitch showin' her thong
Then I look a lil' closer, it's my home girl Lisa
Time to terminate shit, hasta la vista
Married to the mob, so I put a hit on it
Handed you my heart, then you took a shit on it
That's fucked up

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You're starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don't want to see your face
I'm starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
Now I'ma fuck your shit up
Set fire to your pick-up
And drive it super sonic
Crash and burn it with my sister
No, I don't need a mister
Cancel the babysitter
I'm never going down that road
It's easy to resist ya

[Bridge: Charli XCX]
You broke my heart
And I'm never gon' forget this
You broke my heart
And now I'm comin' back to get ya, don't you know?

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You're starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don't want to see your face
I'm starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart
Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You're starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don't want to see your face
I'm starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart

[Chorus]
You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt’s on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like
You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt’s on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like

[Verse 1]
Used to come around, you'd be knockin' on my front door
Playing board-games, horror films with the super gore
Thought that you were cute from the start
Yeah, I’m pretty sure
You were like the medicine, the medicine, I wanted more
All along, I wanted someone to vibe with
Found the guy I want the rest of my life with
Ha, we on some husband and wife shit
I don’t really care, 'cause I know that I like it

[Refrain]
And when the clouds part open
When the last word is spoken
When the last heart’s been broken
We’ll be sitting on your bedroom floor still smoking
And when the clouds part open
When the last word is spoken
When the last heart’s been broken
We’ll be sitting on your bedroom floor still smoking
Smoking, smoking

[Chorus]
You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt’s on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like
You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt’s on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like

[Verse 2]
Oh, now I got a plan
I hope you gonna be my man
I can see us cushy in the house right by the ocean sand
And when I wanna cry, I hope you're gonna hold my hand
And when the shit goes down, I hope you're gonna make a stand
This shit is super wild
This shit is super cool
This shit is kinda gangsta'
I think I’m into you
This shit is super wild
This shit is super cool
This shit is kinda gangsta'
I think I’m into you

[Chorus]
You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt’s on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like
You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt’s on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like

[Verse 1]
Dancing
In the darkness
Pink and lilac
Keep the silence
Crystals
On the skyline
Cut the midnight
Ultraviolet

[Chorus]
You're the one who can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one who's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You're the one who can turn the page
You're the one who came along and unlocked the cage
Now I'm dancing in the dark

[Verse 2]
Flying
Through the black night
You're the angel
In the moonlight
Running
Through the thunder
Undercover
Silver lover

[Chorus]
You're the one who can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one who's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You're the one who can turn the page
You're the one who came along and unlocked the cage
Now I'm dancing in the dark

[Bridge]
You're the one who can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one who's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You're the one who can turn the page
You're the one who came along and unlocked the cage
Now I'm dancing in the dark

[Chorus]
You're the one who can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one who's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You're the one who can turn the page
You're the one who came along and unlocked the cage
Now I'm dancing in the dark

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm dancing in the darkness
Three years before, I was feeling so heartless
But your burn shined through
Now I'm drinking love potion when I lay next to you
It's a criminal feeling
Happiness cries and my tears are dreaming
My body is screaming
I'm staying right here, no, I'll never be leaving

[Intro: Shawty Redd]

These suckaz got me riding New Bentleys
Finessing got my wrist so blurry

I'm a bachelor, I'm available, got bails and thier mailable
A Malibu condo with a great view of the sailing boats
Coke clean as a baby ass, they dug tunnels to get it here
Shout out to my cartel bitch fix me a cocktail
My block do cartwheels, got keys like a locksmith
I met a bitch so bad, I gave her keys to a mach 6
Versace my glasses, I skipped all my classes
My top in the trash, I left my top with my last bitch
Moved on to another ho, trade her in for a yellow bone
Four diamond chains stacked on my neck, it look like a herringbone
It's Gucci and Shawty, thank the lord that we beat the case
Them haters can holla, cause I think I need a hearing aid

[Hook]

You better move ya feet

[Verse 1: Mike G]
Yeah, now you're thinkin' what have I gotten myself in?
How can I extend this situation?
I can't see how this'll end, while other's contin
You just wanted a friend
But I can make you feel like you'll never need them again
I hope they go with the wind
Way past far
No way anyone could ever tell where we are
Freeze to make you stay
Raise fires to keep them away
Keep a quick pace to make sure
Others must admire from a distance
I could make you wanna love me in an instant
Too nice, nicer than they are
But I learned being too nice won't get you too far
Explore everywhere on you
The journey can't hurt
Dominate every place, that's just how kings work
No commitment, no goal, no model
Wrong role, role models played a role
No shadow, no soul, let's go

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
Yeah, I’m dancing in the darkness
Three years before I was feeling so heartless
But your burn shined through
Now I’m drinking love potion when I lay next to you

[Intro]
What up, Paco? Little fucker
She's such a mess, so depressed
He just looks at me
I look at her and see my reflection crookedly
He can't talk but he understands
All I want is quality time with both of 'em
But she's got other plans

[Verse 1]
We shared a common love
But she was hesitant
I dove in face first like fuck the prerequisite
He tried to warn me
This girl was bad news
But I was lonely, in need of a companion
Canine or female, I'm like fuck it I'll take them both
And lost track of what I needed most (how selfish)
She had stories of abandonment and Prozac
They kind of bored me to the point I felt concerned
Until I learned that he'd been watching every episode
And taking notes on how to sit and wait his turn
Now if only I could find a way to make her stop talking about herself for more than two minutes
We could get married
What a scary thought
All I saw was ducks crying and a silent child absorbing everything
Waiting for his chance to scream
Like for instance, the time she made me feel guilty
For my accomplishments and her lack of passion
Mind sex was an understatement, let's call it brain rape
And when I needed them walks, he didn't hesitate
So now I'm like evaluating every move she makes
Cause her words get more irrelevant with every sip she takes
Sometimes he gets me pissed and small shit escalates
It's a strange relationship but it's a bond that never breaks
And I strongly suggest, the next time that you find yourself looking for love
Just get a pet. And wear a bulletproof vest
Cause you never know, she could be the one looking to bum a cigarette
It's such a simple concept, never trust a big ass with emo glasses and alcoholic tendencies
Chances are that in all her drunken splendor
She'll leave out the part about her chemical dependencies

[Hook}
So pull up we ballin, we pull up in Porsches

But I’m really 'bout money from Jamaica, that’s yur girl but I might just take her
Serve a shot just like a waiter
House came with an elevator
Balin out, ballin out, bitch you know that I represent the south
Got a lot of money, got a lot of dough
Nigga talk chess, so I’m killing with the flow
Hey it’s a freestyle, money going up, yes go now
Niggas talk chess so is going down
Got the chopper out, yes it’s going down
Got the SOD, time is money, and we getting all this money
And we getting all this hundreds
Man try to show we get money
Man ain’t nothing to a G now free stop this shit for free
Got a chopper and my niggas with me
Load it up yeah we’re getting tipsy
How we’re getting this money, how we’re getting this dough?
We pull up them whips say what? We’re taking they hoes

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money, come and find me: Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd a thought a country wide tour be the outcome
Labels want my name beside a X like Malcolm
Everybody gotta deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button (what?) nothin' man
Now super bad chicks givin' me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques, just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out, and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur "to the top"
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packing stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos, he's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke, this cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know, rap will never be same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes and establishing the name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealing with a few true villains who stand inside of a booth, truth spilling
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up outta of our mouths
Now rewind it
Pay back mothafucka for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place
So Drake

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man

[Verse 1]
And the wise man said I don't want to hear your voice
And the thin man said I don't want to hear your voice
And they're cursing me, and they won't let me be
And there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do

[Chorus]
Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

[Verse 2]
And the mother say we spit on your son some more
And the buildings say we spit on your face some more
And the feeling is that there's something wrong
'Cause I can't find the words and I can't find the songs

[Chorus]
Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

[Bridge]
Dear Sir, I have a complaint
Dear Sir, I have a complaint
Can't remember what it is
It doesn't matter anyway
It doesn't matter anyway

[Outro]
Stop whispering, stop whispering
Stop whispering, stop whispering
Stop, stop

[Sampled Intro]
"Look at the bargains over here, ladies"

[Verse 1]
If I was your girlfriend
Would you remember
To tell me all the things you forgot when I was your man?
Hey, hey, when I was your man

[Verse 2]
If I was your best friend
Would you let me take care of you
And do all the things that only a best friend can, oh
Only best friends can

[Refrain]
If I was your girlfriend
If I was your girlfriend

[Verse 3]
If I was your girlfriend
Would you let me dress you?
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
Not that you're helpless
But sometimes, sometimes
Those are the things that bein' in love's about

[Verse 4]
If I was your one and only friend
Would you run to me if somebody hurt you
Even if that somebody was me?
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
Please

[Refrain]
If I was your girlfriend
Uh-ah, ooh-hoo-hoo
If I was your girlfriend

[Breakdown]
Would you let me wash your hair?
Could I make you breakfast sometime?
Or then, could we just hang out, I mean
Could we go to a movie and cry together?
'Cause to me, baby, that would be so fine

[Verse 5]
(If I was your girlfriend)
Baby can I dress you?
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
(If I was your girlfriend)
Listen girl, I ain't sayin you're helpless
But sometimes, sometimes
Those are the things that bein' in love's about
(Sugar)

[Breakdown]
Sugar, do you know what I'm saying to you this evening?
(Sugar)
Maybe you think I'm being
A little self-centered
(If I was your girlfriend)
But I, I said I want to be
(Sugar)
All of the things you are to me
(If I was your girlfriend)
Surely, surely you can see

[Spoken Outro]
Is it really necessary for me to go out of the room just because you wanna undress?
(If I was your girlfriend)
I mean, we don't have to make children to make love
And we don't have to make love to have an orgasm
(If I was your girlfriend)
Your body's what I'm all about
(If I was your girlfriend)
Can I see you?
I'll show you
(If I was your girlfriend)
Why not?
You can think it's because I'm your friend I'll do it for you
(If I was your girlfriend)
Of course I'll undress in front of you!
And when I'm naked, what shall I do?
(If I was your girlfriend)
How can I make you see that it's cool?
Can't you just trust me?
If I was your girlfriend you could
(If I was your girlfriend)
Oh, yeah, I think so
Listen, for you naked I would dance a ballet
(If I was your girlfriend)
Would that get you off?
Then tell me what will!
If I was your girlfriend, would you tell me?
(If I was your girlfriend)
Would you let me see you naked then?
Would you let me give you a bath?
(If I was your girlfriend)
Would you let me tickle you so hard you'd laugh and laugh
And would you, would you let me kiss you there
(If I was your girlfriend)
You know down there where it counts
I'll do it so good I swear I'll drink every ounce
And then I'll hold you tight and hold you long
(If I was your girlfriend)
And together we'll stare into silence
And we'll try to imagine what it looks like
Yeah, we'll try to imagine what, what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try to imagine what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try

[Intro]
Ohhhh, baby, ohhh

[Chorus]
Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind
I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind
Your beauty I'll still see
Love is too weak to define
Just what you mean to me

[Verse 1]
From the first moment I saw you
I knew you were the one
That night I had to call you
I was rappin' 'till the sun came up
Tellin' you just how fine you look
In a word, you were sex
All of my cool attitude you took
My body was next
You made love to me
Like you was afraid
Was you afraid of me?
Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy?

[Chorus]
That's why
Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind
I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind
Your beauty I'll still see
Love is too weak to define
Just what you mean to me

[Verse 2]
When we be makin' love
I only hear the sounds
Heavenly angels cryin' up above
Tears of joy pourin' down on us
They know we need each other
They know you are my fix
I know, you know that I ain't cheatin' baby
They know this is serious
I ain't fuckin' just for kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial
You could say that I'm a terminal case
You could burn up my clothes
Smash up my ride--
Well maybe not the ride
But I got to have your face
All up in the place
I'd like to think that I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk, imported Egyptian lace
Nothin', baby, I said nothin', baby, can compare
To your lovely face
Do you know what I'm sayin' to you this evening?
I'm just tryin' to say

[Chorus]
That until, until the end of time
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
You own my heart, you own my mind
I truly adore you
I truly adore you, darlin'
Adore you
You don't know what you mean to me, baby
Baby, baby
Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind, I truly adore you
Adore you

[Breakdown]
Can I talk to you?
Tell you what you mean to me
Every time you wander
I'll be your eyes so you can see
I wanna show you things
That I never showed no other, I wanna be
More than your mother
More than your brother
I wanna be like no other
If you need me, I'll never leave
I know, that you know, without you there is no me
There is no me
Without you there is no sea
There is no shore
Love is too weak to define how much I adore
You child, you child
The last words you hear
Be with me darlin' til the end of all time
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my mind
I'll give you my body
I'll give you my time
For all time I am with you

[Outro]
You are with me
You are with me

[Intro]
And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder
One of the four beasts saying "Come and see"
And I saw, and behold, a white horse

[Verse 1]
There's a man going 'round taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around

[Verse 2]
The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup?
Or disappear into the potter's ground?
When the man comes around

[Chorus]
Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

[Verse 3]
'Til Armageddon, no salaam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise men will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around

[Verse 4]
Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

[Chorus]
Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
In measured hundredweight and penny pound
When the man comes around

[Outro]
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts
And I looked, and behold, a pale horse
And his name, that sat on him, was Death
And Hell followed with him
Yo Kenny Parker what up!
KRS in the building
Yo these cats all talkin' about

[Verse 2: Krs-One]

Shoot out, shoot out

Waive the Glock in your boy face like what
You talk that junk, but you really all punk

So I could buck buck buck buck you up
You a fan of rap

Where them cannon's at
First thing you get hit with is a panic attack
Then you feel the steel
Of the gat to your back
Now you wonderin' why you even said all that
You could've left KRS-one way in the back
With his conscious raps and his old school tracks
But now?

[Hook]

And "Spiritual Minded", but ya'll are not concern
You wanna take shots at me

But nope, ya'll crazy
I'll watch your brains ooze out like cracked jars of turkey gravy
God told me to slay thee
And I'mma get to it
No ifs ands buts or maybes

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers
And ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie
Woo-hoo

(Get back one)

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go, oh

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoa-oh

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved

[Bridge]
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo

[Chorus]
Oh, the Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go, oh
Go
Go

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go, oh
Go
Go, go

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1: André 3000]
I, I, I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bet
Oh, and you, you and your head high
And your tears dry
Get on without your guy
And I, I, I went back to what I knew
So far removed from all we been through
Oh-oh, and you, and you, and you, you tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black

[Chorus: André 3000]
We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I go back to her and you go back to
You go back to

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I, I love you much
It's not enough
I love blow and you love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
I go back to black

[Intro]

When you're back in your old neighborhood
The cigarettes taste so good
But you're so misunderstood
You're so misunderstood

There's something there that you can't find
You look honest when you're telling a lie
You hurt her but you don't know why
You love her but you don't know why

Short on long term goals
There's a party there that we ought to go to
If you still love rock and roll
If you still love rock and roll?

It's only a quarter to three
Reflected off of your CD
You're looking at a picture of me
You're staring at a picture of me
Take the guitar player for a ride
'Cause he ain't never been satisfied
He thinks he owes some kind of debt
It'll be years before he gets over it

There's a fortune inside your head
When all you touch turns to lead
You think you might just crawl back in bed
With a fortune inside your head

I know you're just a mama's boy
You're positively unemployed
So misunderstood
So misunderstood

I know you've got a God-shaped hole
You're bleeding out your heart full of soul
You're so misunderstood
You're so misunderstood
You're so misunderstood
You're so misunderstood

I'd like to thank you all for nothing
I'd like to thank you all for nothing at all
I'd like to thank you all for nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing at all
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing at all
Far, far away from those city lights
They might be shining on you tonight
Far, far away from you
On the dark side of the room

I long to hold you in my arms and sway
Kiss and ride on the CTA
I need to see you tonight

Those bright lights
Oh, I know it's right
Deep in my heart
I'll know it's right

By the bed
By the light that you read by
By the time
That I get home to say good night
I need to see you again
On the dark side, my friend
On the dark side

[Verse 1]
Choo-Choo Charlie had a plenty good band
But he couldn't understand why no one would go
The World Record Players on a tour of Japan
Charlie's fixing his van with a left arm tan
He said:

[Chorus]
"Monday, I'm all high
Get me out of FLA
In school, yeah
I fooled ya
Now I know I made a mistake"

[Verse 2]
Blister on a turnpike, let me by
I only want to wonder why when I don't die
Ooh, I shot you, yeah, I know
I only want to go where my wheels roll

[Chorus]
Monday, I'm all high
Get me out of FLA
I fooled ya
In school, yeah
Now I know I made a mistake

[Verse 3]
Everybody's wondering, "Where'd he go?"
He must be down in Pensacola hiding from the snow
The World Record Players on a tour of Japan
Charlie's fixin' his van, he's waitin' for a postcard
And he said:

[Chorus]
"Monday, I'm all high
Get me out of TLA
Well, I cut class
In school, yeah
Now I know I made a mistake
I made a big mistake, alright"

[Outro]
Yeah, alright
Alright, alright
Alright
Man, I've been listenin' to Creedence Clearwater Revival
Son of a—

[Verse 1]
I know we don't talk much
But you're such a good talker, oh whoa
I know we should take a walk
But you're such a fast walker, oh whoa
Well alright

[Chorus]
I know where I'll be tonight, alright
Out of mind, out of sight

[Verse 2]
Well okay, I know you don't love me
But you'll still be thinking of me, oh whoa
Well alright, I know you probably hate me
That's okay with me
Alright

[Chorus]
I know where I'll be tonight, alright
Out of mind, out of sight
Out of mind, out of sight

[Bridge]
You don't see me now
You don't want to anyhow

[Verse 3]
Look out, here I come again
And I'm bringing my friends
Look out, here I come again
I'm bringing my friends
Okay, alright, okay, alright

[Chorus]
I know where I'll be tonight, alright
Out of mind, out of sight
Out of mind, out of sight
Out of mind, out of sight
You're trying my patience, try pink carnations
Red roses and yellow daffodils
Don't forget the flowers, someday, I know you will

Displayers of affection and all good intentions
Why don't you just send me the bill
Don't forget the flowers, someday, I know you will

Lately you've been taking me
Way too seriously, oooh
I can't ever explain why
I don't feel your pain, oooh

I left you behind, I know it's been a long time
But I'm not over you
Don't forget the flowers, someday, I hope I do

You're trying my patience, try pink carnations
Red roses and yellow daffodils
Don't forget the flowers, someday
I know I will
Don't forget the flowers, someday
I know I will
We've got solid state technology
Tapes on the floor
Some songs we can't afford to play

When we came here today
All I wanted to say
Is how much I miss you

Alcohol and cotton balls
And some drugs
We can't afford on the way

When we came here today
We all felt something true
Now I'm red-eyed and blue
I got you and that's all I need
I got you and that's all I need
I got you and that's all I need
I got you

I got you and I still believe
That you are all I will ever need
It's you, oh

All the way back in the seventies
You were my little TV queen
Guitarzan and your friend Janine
I got you

I got you and I still believe
That you are all I will ever need
It's you, oh

It's the end of the century
And I can't think of anything
Except you
It's the end of the century
And I can't think of anything
But you, oh

All, I, need

I got you
I got you, babe
I got you
Close your eyes and go to sleep, baby
Take your head off your feet, honey
'Cause you've been working hard and I know you're tired
You been trying hard not to think I'm a liar

What's the world got in store?
What's the world got in store for you?
What's the world got in store for you now?

Come on baby somehow, I need you
Do I have to show you how, baby?

I'm not trying to knock you out
What's it about?
I just know you need your rest
But I can't say what's best for you

You been working hard and I know you're tired
I've been trying hard not to feel like a liar

What's the world got in store?
What's the world got in store for you?
What's the world got in store for you now?
What's the world got in store?
What's the world got in store for you?
What's the world got in store for you now?
I've been sleeping alone, out on my own
I'm sure it seems like I'm taking my time to get back to you
You've been doing your part, working real hard
I'm not lying, sure it seems like I'm trying to get back at you

Do you miss me too?
Baby, say I miss you
Just say you miss me too

Do you miss me too?
Baby, say I miss you
Just say you miss me too

I've been losing my mind, wasting my time
I'm not crazy, sure it seems like I'm lazin' up to get back to you
You've been taking it hard, I know it's hard
I'm not lying, sure it seems like I'm trying to get back at you

Do you miss me too?
Baby, say I miss you
Just say you miss me too
Do you miss me too?
Baby, say I miss you
Just say you miss me too

Well, I been mixed up
Since the break up
What I need you to say
Everything's okay

Baby, say I miss you
Just say you miss me too
Just say you miss me too
There's rows and rows of houses
With windows painted blue
With the light from a TV
Running parallel to you

But there is no sunken treasure
Rumored to be
Wrapped inside my ribs
In a sea, black with ink

I am so
Out of tune
With you

I am so out of tune
With you

If I had a mountain
I'd try to fold it over
If I had a boat (probably roll over)
You know I'd probably roll over (leave it on the shore)
And I leave it on the shore (leave it for somebody)
I'd leave it for somebody
Surely there's somebody
Who needs it more than me

I am so
Out of tune
With you

I am so out of tune
With you

For all the leaves we'll burn
In autumn fires and then return
For all the fires we burn
All will return

Music is my savior
I was maimed by rock and roll
I was maimed by rock and roll
I was tamed by rock and roll
I got my name from rock and roll
Well I know we don't talk much
But you're but you're such a good talker
Oh whoa

Well I know that we should take a walk
But you're such a fast walker, oh whoa
Well alright

I know where I'll be tonight, well alright
Outta mind, outta sight

Well okay
I know you don't love me
But you'll still be thinking of me, oh-whoa

Well alright
I know you probably hate me
Well that's okay with me
Well alright

I know where I'll be tonight
Well alright
Outta mind outta sight
Outta mind outta sight
You don't see me now
You don't want to anyhow

Well look out
Here I come again
And I'm bringing my friends

I said, look out
Here I come again
And I'm bringing my friends
Okay, alright, okay, alright

I know where I'll be tonight
Well alright

Well outta mind outta sight
Outta mind outta sight
Outta mind outta sight

Well alright
That's quite alright
I know you don't love me
I know you don't love me anymore, alright
I know you
I can't tell you anything
You don't already know
I keep on trying
I should just let it go

I keep on singing
Your eyes, they just roll
It sounds like someone else's song
From a long time ago

You already know the story
And the chords are just the same
You already know I love you
And I sound like what's his name

But you can't stop me
I want you to know
I know it sounds like someone else's song
From a long time ago
I want to be your kingpin
Living in Pekin

I want to be your bigwig
Living in Pekin

I got the flu and away I flew
N.Y.C.P.D. blue
Dimatapp and Spinal Tap
City maps and hand claps

Statue of Liberty play
It only works once
Don't throw it away

'Cause I want to be your kingpin
Living in Pekin

Living in Pekin

Living in
How can I
How can I give my love to you when
I don't know what to do
Was I in your dreams? I'd like to know
Did I touch your hand and did it feel like snow?
Try to understand while I've got you on the phone

Did I hurt you like I know I can?
Tell me why you'd ever want to leave your loving man
Try to understand, please try to understand

Was I in your dreams?
Was I in your dreams?

Does a dreamer die when his dreams die too?
I don't really mind if I dream about you
I can't say what any of that means

Was I in your dreams late last night?
Did you hold your pillow? Did you squeeze me tight?
I just want to make everything all right

Was I in your dreams?
Was I in your dreams?
Was I?

[Verse 1]
It's all happened here before
I know you've seen it too
I know you've seen it too

And it's all happened to you
Kid, you've paid your dues
Dues and dues

[Chorus]
Why would you
Want to live
In this world

Why would you
Want to live
In this world

[Verse 2]
I know you watch the news
I've seen it too
I've seen it too
And it's all happened to you
Kid, you've paid your dues
Dues and dues

[Chorus]
Why would you
Want to live
In this world

[Outro]
Why wouldn't you
Want to live
In this world
Wouldn't you
Want to live
After the show
You walked right past
Arms reached out
For your autograph

And as you flashed
Your backstage pass
I caught your eye
With a camera's flash

When the band came out
They stood behind you
Cymbals crashed
The lights went blue

You stood alone
In the halo's haze
Shiny guitar hung on
Gold lamé
And you
You were the lonely one
You were
The lonely one
When you perform
It's so intense
When the critics pan
I write in your defense

I understand I am just a fan
I'm just a fan

When I get home
I turn off the alarm
I check the phone
No messages on

I play the ones from yesterday
I play your song
Just to hear you say that you
You're the lonely one

You are
The lonely one

You
You're the lonely one
You are the lonely one
Well there's a dreamer in my dreams
Swinging from the beams
With light shining off the snow
Well there's a singer in my heart
Burning up the charts
With songs about things we all know

Well there's a blister on his brain
That's driving him insane
'Cause all good things, they gotta go

Well there's a child on the way
It could be any day
But how this life will change we don't know

Well there's a child on the way
Gonna look just like him
One day, he's gonna say
"Ain't you my dad?"

Then he's gonna look down and smile
And after a while, he'll say
"That's for sure, 'cause you got my eyes."
Well there's a dreamer in my dreams
He's hanging from the beams
With light shining off the snow

There's a blister on his brain
It's driving him insane
'Cause all the good things have to go

There's a dreamer in my dreams
Swinging from the beams
With a light shining off the lake

Well, I know I made mistakes
I'm passing then all on
But I hope he gets up before dawn
All right

(Yeah, that's it)

There's a dreamer in my dreams
Climbing up the back
Of a car they used to call a Cadillac

It's got a brand new set of keys
He's got a new look, he's got a new look
And he's gonna, he's gonna take it all away
(I believe it)

There's a dreamer in my dreams
Swinging from the beams
All jacked up in my garage

He's hanging from a belt
He don't know what he's done
Just don't forget to say goodbye when he's gone

(Oh! That's it!)
You
Always wanted more time
To do
What you always wanted to do
Now you got it
And I, I must be high
To say goodbye
Bye, bye, bye

You
Never said you needed this
Now you're pissed that you missed
The very last kiss
From my lips
And I, I must  be high
To say goodbye
Bye, bye, bye

You
Never looked in my eyes
Long enough to find
Any peace of mind
But now you got it
And I, I must be high
To let you say goodbye
Bye, bye, bye

[Verse 1]
Well the money's pouring down
And the people all look down
And it's floating out of town

I hit the second deck
And I spent my paycheck
And my wife that I just met
She's looking like a wreck

[Chorus]
Casino Queen
My lord you're mean
I've been gambling like a fiend
On your tables so green

[Verse 3]
I always bet on black
Blackjack
I'll pay you back
The room fills with smoke
And I'm already broke
And the dealer keeps on joking
As he takes my last token

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Someone’s got it in for me
They’re planting stories in the press
Whoever it is I wish they’d cut it out quick
But when they will I can only guess
They say I shot a man named Gray
And took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me
I can’t help it if I’m lucky

[Verse 2]
People see me all the time
And they just can’t remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas
Images and distorted facts
Even you, yesterday
You had to ask me where it was at
I couldn’t believe after all these years
You didn’t know me any better than that
Sweet lady

[Chorus]
Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your mouth
Blowing down the backroads heading south
Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe

[Verse 3]
I ran into the fortune-teller
Who said beware of lightning that might strike
I haven’t known peace and quiet
For so long, I can’t remember what it’s like
There’s a lone soldier on the cross
Smoke pouring out of a boxcar door
You didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done
In the final end he won the war
After losing every battle

[Verse 4]
I woke up on the roadside
Daydreaming about the way things sometimes are
Visions of your chestnut mare
Shoot through my head and are making me see stars
You hurt the ones that I love best
And cover up the truth with lies
One day you’ll be in the ditch
Flies buzzing around your eyes
Blood on your saddle

[Chorus]
Idiot wind
Blowing through the flowers on your tomb
Blowing through the curtains in your room
Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe

[Verse 5]
It was gravity which pulled us down
And destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage
But it just wasn’t enough to change my heart
Now everything’s a little upside down
As a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped
What’s good is bad, what’s bad is good
You’ll find out when you reach the top
You’re on the bottom

[Verse 6]
I noticed at the ceremony
Your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
I can’t remember your face anymore
Your mouth has changed, your eyes don’t look into mine
The priest wore black on the seventh day
And sat stone-faced while the building burned
I waited for you on the running boards
Near the cypress trees, while the springtime turned
Slowly into Autumn

[Chorus]
Idiot wind
Blowing like a circle around my skull
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol
Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe

[Verse 7]
I can’t feel you anymore
I can’t even touch the books you’ve read
Every time I crawl past your door
I been wishing I've been somebody else instead
Down the highway, down the tracks
Down the road to ecstasy
I followed you beneath the stars
Hounded by your memory
And all your raging glory

[Verse 8]
I been double-crossed now
For the very last time and now I’m finally free
I kissed goodbye the howling beast
On the borderline which separated you from me
You’ll never know the hurt I suffered
Nor the pain I rise above
And I’ll never know the same about you
Your holiness or your kind of love
And it makes me feel so sorry

[Chorus]
Idiot wind
Blowing through the buttons of our coats
Blowing through the letters that we wrote
Idiot wind
Blowing through the dust upon our shelves
We’re idiots, babe
It’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves
(Hook)
Ayo I represents Queens
Yea, you already know, come on
You know what time it is
Ayo I represents Queens
Please, let em know
Ayo I represents Queens
Bam bam yea yea uh
Statik
Yo I represents Queens, I prop scenes up
Yea

(Verse 1 - Action Bronson)
Yea the cops set me up, tried to play Action
Good thing I’m like Peyton with the play action
Gold wagon need a diaper cause I’m shitting on em
No lying, engine like a retarded lion
Very special, twist pussy like pretzel
The driver named Fletcher
Sit in the back of the Cadillac stretcher
Maroon dash, air bloom when the platoon blast
Blue grass in the Jag playing jazz
Beige rider glove on my hand
Damn call me Bam Bam Baklava
Sell ten out the minivan like a soccer mom
Back flip out the eight
Doctor Octagon, Aqua Huaraches on
Put the fork in the pasta with the Shiitakes on it
Ain’t a dime, get a move without Papi on it
Green paper, motherfuckers left sloppy for it
Come on, come on
(Hook)

(Verse 2 - Action Bronson)
Throw the left hook, knock a horse out
World came from across town, I put the fork down
Through the knapkin and the dessert disgusted
Lick the mustard, kiss my cousin
Motherfuck you know I do my thing, it’s nothing
Suede patches on the elbow of the jacket
Fodd saver bags for the green crack
Toast to Sesame seeds on the sea bass
Candy skywalker Adidas
Sitting courtside heat jazz
Please, my bitch squeeze at 45 degrees
While I shift the V with Mystique
Kiss on your cheek, go to sleep
I roll the leaf up uh, cut through the block with Queen Latifa
A hundred grand wrapped in a flag of Trinidad
I been a dad, smoke dope, got the same taste as a lemon head
I wanna meet the bitch that invented head
Korean meats laid on a lettuce bed, roll up

(Hook)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm so fucking awesome - my marbles, I lost 'em
I'm taking everything - everything but precaution
Your bitches wanna call us and text us like Austin
Pussy make me hard, pussy niggas make me nauseous
I've been on my feet since the day I started walking
Bitch, I think I'm MC Hammer, put the nail in the coffin
Sell coke in a drought, sell pussy at an auction
Bullets got a nigga running fast enough to race horses
Around here you sniff these lines, you don't cross 'em
Kill your ass and leave you behind like an orphan
I swear it happens all the time, very often
Still getting baseball money; Barry Larkin
Around here we play for keeps, yeah, we eating, but we starving
I get me a little money, try to spread it margarine
I'm flyer than a motherfucker, all my flights chartered
Green kush, red flag, black car, white lawyer, I'm good

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I say I go into my beastmode - rapping niggas, I eat those
I tell a bitch take a deep breath then bend them knees like a freethrow
I don't want me no good girl, I fell in love with these freak hoes
In my bedroom I make a movie, it's starring me with that Lee Rose
Cause I ball hard like D-Rose, my stash on closet
Racks in my pocket, these racks I deposit
Got racks on my conscience, money on my mind
I got shooters on my team, they got bodies on their nine
Look at that bad bitch right there, see that body on that dime
I ain't swimming in no ho, you know I'm probably on that grind
All these niggas hating on me, me, but I ain't on that time, time
Cause I be in the back, nigga, and I ain't talking about swine
I'm talking 62 West, they say a nigga too fresh
You a rat, your homie singing y'all should do a duet
Shawty told me she loving my swag, I make that pussy too wet
You niggas banned, and my hoes and I'm like why they'd do that? Go

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uhm, I don't have a conscience, all my friends are monsters
They visit me so constant and talk to me about nonsense
Like stabbing you and then watching you fight for your life like you boxing
Bitch, deuce deuce, I smoke that OG killer Bobby Johnson
I'll olly over that bitch head, it's Hollygrove til I'm fucking dead
I did a bid for that toast, so fuck with me I'll treat you like butterbread
But I still go hard with no regard, Earth ain't shit, bitch, go to Mars
Leave a nigga dead in the gutter
I'll just beat him with a bloody ass bowlingball
I'm fresh as hand sanitizer, don't hate the game, just analyze it
Two xanax', I'm fantasizing about fat bitches' panty sizes
Take a bullet to the chest, be a man about it
Stop acting like a little bitch nigga, most of y'all niggas is bitch niggas
I got a tiger in the basement, Big Tigger
My hair long, my dick bigger
My hair long, my dick bigger
My hair long, my dick bigger
My money longer, my weed stronger
I feed hunger, I no longer get my weed from Fee
I pull that freedom of my waist, now watch me let freedom ring, ding

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Like the legend of the phoenix, huh
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning, uh-huh
The force from the beginning

[Verse 1]
Call it a split cause you know that you will
You bite your friends like chocolate
You say, we go where nobody knows
Got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Now we run, run away from the boys in the blue
And my car smells like chocolate
Hey now think about what to do
I think about what to say, I think about how to think
Pause it, play it, pause it play it, pause it

[Chorus]
Oh we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

[Post-Chorus]
Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
If you don't stop smoking it
That's what she said
She said we're dressed in black, head to toe
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

[Verse 2]
Hey now we're building up speed as we're approaching the hill
Oh my hair smells like chocolate
Hey now you say you're gonna quit it
But you're never gonna quit it
Go get it, go get it
Got get it, go get it, go!
And play it cool

[Chorus]
Oh we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

Well I think we better go, seriously better go
Said the feds are here you know
Seriously better go
Oh oh, well I think we better go
Said the feds are here you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go

Oh we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats

No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

Said the feds are here you know
Seriously better go

Said the feds are here you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go

However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My english grammar gets better and better

History in the making, get with me I'm not faking
Big up all my Jamaicans, Haitians and all my nations
Latinos and my Asians, yeah I know you've been waitin
Feeling you've been forsaken, but I'm building this nation
Building new innovation, look at what we've been facin
Payola on these stations, plus they run like plantations
Complete with black beats sportin soul by caucausians
If you hear me on your station best believe I'm not payin~!
KRS is the realest, KRS-One is fearless
I grew up in them days when crack was new to drug dealers
See them cats they be liars, we the New York survivors
Eighty-one to ninety-one, they was our record buyers
Now they front cause they got work tryin to redo all my work
'til we live and in concert, and I'm makin they eye hurt
Shinin so bright and so lively
Everybody know, hip-hop was better in the nineties

[KRS-One] 

[Hook]
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My english grammar gets better and better
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My english grammar gets better and better
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My english grammar gets better and better
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My english grammar gets better

[Pee-Doe]
It was better in the nineties, the solo was grimey
The Wu-Tang Clan came in with the killer army
Grand Puba came in with Girbauds hangin low
Hilfiger Tommy niggas rockin Polo
40 ounce guzzlin, nickel bag coppin
Troopin through the block with the boom box knockin
All we do is "Spark Mad Ism" non-stop and
When Hot 97 played the real hip-hop and
I remember 98, point 7 KISS FM
With Kool DJ Red Alert, mixin up the blends
Them mixtape deejays had the streets on lock
Like Demo and Ron G, my nigga Doo Wop
Before the radio station corrupted the nation
To rule the street, A&R's discoverin the sensations
KRS came with the peace declaration
Took it with the leaders to the United Nations

[KRS-One] 

[Hook]
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My english grammar gets better and better
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My english grammar gets better and better
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My english grammar gets better and better
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My english grammar gets better

[Verse 1]
Oh, sweet thing
Zion doesn't love You
And Babylon don't love You
But You love everything
Oh, You saint
America don't love You
So I could never love You
In spite of everything

[Pre-Chorus]
In the dark of this place
There's the glow of Your face
There's the dust on the screen
Of this broken machine
And I can't help but feel
That I've made some mistake
But I let it go
Ya Hey, Ya Hey, Ya Hey

[Chorus]
Through the fire and through the flames
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Deo)
You won't even say Your name
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Deo)
Through the fire and through the flames
You won't even say Your name
Only "I am that I am"
But who could ever live that way?
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Ut Deo, Ya Hey
Ut Deo, Deo

[Verse 2]
Oh, the motherland don't love You
The fatherland don't love You
So why love anything?
Oh, good God
The faithless, they don't love You
The zealous hearts don't love You
And that's not gonna change

[Pre-Chorus]
All the cameras and files
All the paranoid styles
All the tension and fear
Of a secret career
And I can't help but feel
That You seen the mistakes
But You let it go
Ya Hey, Ya Hey, Ya Hey

[Chorus]
Through the fire and through the flames
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Deo)
You won't even say Your name
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Deo)
Through the fire and through the flames
You won't even say Your name
You say, "I am that I am"
But who could ever live that way?
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Ut Deo, Ya Hey
Ut Deo, Deo

[Spoken]
Outside the tents
On the festival grounds
As the air began to cool
And the sun went down
My soul swooned
As I faintly heard the sound
Of You spinning "Israelites"
Into "19th Nervous Breakdown"

[Chorus]
Through the fire and through the flames
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Deo)
You won't even say Your name
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Deo)
Through the fire and through the flames
You won't even say Your name
Only "I am what I am"
But who could ever live that way?
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Ut Deo, Ya Hey
Ut Deo, Deo
Through the fire and through the flames
You won't even say Your name
Only "I am that I am"
But who could ever live that way?
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Ut Deo, Ya Hey
Ut Deo, Deo

[Chorus]

[Hook: Tru James]
Just me and you girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you girl
Wooooaah ohhh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Aren't you a sight for red eyes
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown, you asleep with no make-up
I'm just tryna be inside you 'fore you wake up

[Hook: Tru James]
Just me and you girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you girl
Wooooaah ohhh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
We had problems but it's all in the past
Everybody got problems baby, algebra class
Remember I used to do things that'd make you laugh
Like orderin' a girl drink in a masculine glass
You like piña coladas, getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But, they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Ain't no denying baby you have changed
Cause now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching, you're pissed off, tripping
Cause even when we're kissing baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like, "No he didn't?
No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?
Is that bitch still stripping?
Trying to get a pair of Christians?"
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say, "How is work baby?"
Well some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See, she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credit's so bad I can't get no one to cosign
I would've thought she would've bust in the door cryin'
But she upped and left a nigga and she ain't give me no sign
Now, she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame, it's a miracle that she'd
Talk to a nigga with a ten-year ago swag
Plus I don't like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote, "Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends."
On the phone, hollin' that "niggas is whatever"
Let's fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome, Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she ain't got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong, except a nigga grown
So I can't bitch and moan, in a session gettin' stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train, to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her, "Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress."
Thirty foot train, diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides, I'm so glad you came
Aunty couldn't make it, oh no that's a shame
Wedding in June, what could be better?
Let's fly to Euro, make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor, "Just drive so far."
Told some of your friends and they wasn't excited
Well we gon' tour the countryside and they won't be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin' and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb cause we just reunited
Let's make a move from these herds, go somewhere in private
I'm talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot

[Hook: Tru James]
Just me and you girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you girl
Wooooaah ohhh

[Spoken Verse]
Fitter, happier, more productive
Comfortable (Not drinking too much)
Regular exercise at the gym (Three days a week)
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well (No more microwave dinners and saturated fats)
A patient, better driver
A safer car (Baby smiling in back seat)
Sleeping well (No bad dreams)
No paranoia
Careful to all animals (Never washing spiders down the plughole)
Keep in contact with old friends (Enjoy a drink now and then)
Will frequently check credit at (Moral) bank (hole in wall)
Favours for favours
Fond but not in love
Charity standing orders
On Sundays ring road supermarket
(No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants)
Car wash (Also on Sundays)
No longer afraid of the dark
Or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace
Slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned (But powerless)
An empowered and informed member of society (Pragmatism not idealism)
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet (Shot of baby strapped in back seat)
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
That's driven into
Frozen winter shit (The ability to laugh at weakness)
Calm
Fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig
In a cage
On antibiotics

[Chorus: Future & B.o.B]
How 'bout we hit the club and walk up straight through VIP

Pack so strong if you smell it you'll probably catch contact
Freaks, what's up, show a young nigga what it do
Show me what that thing hittin' like and I'll show you how to turn a four-door into a coupe
Gettin' all mad at me cause your girl gettin' loose
Yeah, it ain't no hype, I live that life, what you want me to do?
Well the blue one came out, then the red one came out, now I gotta get two

Why you all in my face, you ain't even in my circle dawg, you ain't even in the loop

How 'bout I pull up hard, 'Rarri on the front
How 'bout I get the racks and go shopping every day this month
How 'bout I go to Pluto and go crazy with them bands

Walk in the club like "guess who home"
King of the city, so well known
Run up trippin', this heat get shown
N -double-ACP, all black stones
Four-time trapper, trappin' all fours
I ball like Diddy, money so long
Tryna pick what chick fi'nna come home
I bet you gon' learn to day, how 'bout that
Walkin' up out of here by myself, I doubt that
Go in hop in that Challenger parked out back
Any wardrobe she in, she hoppin' out that
Old-school game, I ain't never seen foreign, hit the club buck and turn it to a party
Automatic range, where to get started, crews in the back if you run up on me retarded
Bottles gettin' popped, haters get dropped, everything go, nothing can stop
Realest left, only way I rock, I'm the truth, they know that off top
Jealous niggas, yeah they gon' knock, thirsty bitches, yeah they gon' bop
On my dick is pro'bly where they hop, bunch of losers they gon' block

[Chorus: Future & B.o.B]
How 'bout we hit the club and walk up straight through VIP

Black Benz, European, give a fuck about this paper
Say your girl is a fan? Now that bitch up at my table
Every day the same cycle, got the weed, got the liquor
Got the swishas and these bitches, we gon' pull an all-nighter
Doin' this shit for V.A., 200 on the freeway
They blowin' up my phone 'cause they tryna get a three-way
This shit lookin' like a relay, she already chose
'Cause there's too many niggas with you, not enough hoes
Goddamnit, I know you can't stand it, while I just command it
I do damage if she pull her panties down to the floor
She let me cut like I need a bandage, I'm a pussy bandit
If your nigga trippin' 40 on me, tell me when to go
I put 500 thousand on you, why you rent it for?
If that shit is yours, then what's it tinted for?
Throw that Westside up with them Lamborghini doors
And I step right up, I make it rain, I make it pour, ha
Who a low life? Nigga, get it straight
All this ice, in your face
All this money, I don't need to save
How you talkin' money to a fuckin' bank?
Now throw a couple bands on it
Walk the plank, walk the plank, yeah, stand on it
That's your bitch? I'm sorry, she put her hands on it
I know you hate it, but you know you a fan, homie
Okay, I love them Asians, I love them red dots
She give me brain, what I call a head shot
Them white girls say they love 2Pac
It's hella black bitches all up on this white yacht
Yeah, because it's snapbacks and tattoos
Girl, take them tights off, gon' let that ass loose
This a tax write off, you know I'm that dude
And my flow is eughhh like that pink thing on that baboon
Shitted, my niggas with me ridin' for my city
Got Virginia on my back, my autograph across her titty
Pop that pussy like I pop a wheelie, OHB, I committed
On the dick actin' silly, gon' girl, get it, get it
Fuck bein' low-key, I be on that loud pack
All this smoke up in the air, can't see where the crowd at
Thinkin' you gon' drink for free? Bitch, I can't I allow that
Real nigga section, bitch, you are around that, alright

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I'ma be that n-n-n-na-na-nail in your coffin
Saying that I softened? I was ducking down to reload
So you can save your petty explanations
I don't have the patience, before you even say it, I know
You le-l-l-let your pride or you ego talk slick to me?
No, that is not the way I get down
And look at how you lose your composure
Now, let me show you exactly how the breaking point sounds

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I want to see you choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
What is it you want me to tell you?
I'm not the failure, I would rather live and let be
But you came with the right kind of threat to
Push me to let you know you can't intimidate me
You di-di-disrespect me so clearly
Now you better hear me: that is not the way it goes down
You did it to yourself and it's over
Now, let me show you exactly how the breaking point sounds

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I want to see you choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
I want to see you choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
You did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
You did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
You did it to yourself! You did it to yourself!
You did it to yourself! You did it to yourself!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I want to see you choke on your lies! Swallow up your greed!
Suffer all alone in your misery!
Choke on your lies! Swallow up your greed!
Suffer all alone in your misery!

Aw, let’s go!

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
It’s a Friday night, now here we go
I ain’t no stripper, but I work the pole
Bartender, can you pour some mo'?
And I’m so tipsy, coming out my clothes
Fly high, high, high, and I can’t see, so I can’t drive
I party 'til I’m out my mind
I kiss on him, but he don’t mind
Then I wake up in the morn
I got a guy in my bed, like: "Hello, good morn"
Don’t remember how I got him home
But Friday night, it was nice and long

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're going to stop-op, oh whoa

[Post-Chorus: Katy Perry]
But this Friday night, do it all again
This Friday night, do it all again

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're going to stop-op, oh whoa

[Post-Chorus: Katy Perry]
But this Friday night, do it all again (Do it all again)
This Friday night, do it all again (Do it all again)

[Interlude: Missy Elliott]
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
(Let’s do this shit like every weekend)
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
(Now pour my drink, 'til there ain’t nothing left)
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa

[Post-Chorus: Katy Perry]
But this Friday night, do it all again

[Intro]
Mr. Worldwide
First letter of Cuba, is an open letter
So you know I had to do this
Let's start like this

[Verse 1]
Born in Miami, right on time
Scarface, El Mariel, Cuban crime
Admit it if you want to, truth is the truth, lie if you want to
Politics, yeah that's politic
Let's not act like half of our families ain't flipped bricks
We made Miami something from nothing
Let's not forget that we came from nothing
Los judios del caribe, ahora estan jodidos en el caribe
Blood is blood don't act like we anaemic
Elián got snatched back, the whole world seen it
Russian missile crisis had America skating on nuclear ice
Bay of Pigs big bluff
We thought they had our back, but they left us straight stuck
I ain't here to hold a grudge
I love the freedom that has been given to us
Now break down us, get it? U-S that's right god bless

[Hook x2]
Here's the freedom we ride for, here's the freedom we die for
C-u-b-a hope to see you free one day

[Verse 2]
Abuela y tía, Sierra Maestra, wich led to my mother in "Pedro Pan"
In Cuba hit the lotto that means get your family search for freedom and run
Havanna made Vegas, ask Meyer Lansky
That's if you know where his grave is
Hermanos al Rescate, brothers to the rescue
Don't agree with the change Castro talk
But it's hard to understand unless they educate you
Politicians loves to hate you
But then they runaway when it's time to debate you
Question of the night, would they have mess with Mr. Carter if he was white?
Hm, rhyme with treasury
When way another in Cuba is where they'll bury me
Happy 5th year anniversary, Jay and B don't worry it's on me

[Hook]

[Outro]
Y para todo el mundo en Cuba
Con la ayuda de dios, nos vemos pronto
Dale

[Verse 1 : Gucci Mane]
I used to trap on the corner but that was decades ago
I was high as a cloud, and that was seconds ago
I had the game in the lock, a couple records ago
And I ain't never trust nobody, I was checkin the door
And if you spend a lil' bit mo', then your necklace a glow
He see me textin her phone, and now he chokin a ho
But he keep talkin bout a gangster he provokin a ho
I gave my dentist a 50 just for my trophies to show
I look like Pablo Escobar the way I'm holdin the dro
I feel like Boston George, I got so many bales from the plug
I got a suite apartment wit an apartment under the rug
And every drank in my 'frigerator filled up with mud

[Hook : Gucci Mane]
I don't know bout nobody else, but I'm servin
And as long as these bags come in, I'm gone serve em
Niggas say they ain't getting money but I'm workin
I'm riding with so much dope that I'm nervous
If the police try to pull up on me, I'm gone swerve em
You ain't never seen so many guns on one person
Dump truck, two trucks came on one Thursday
You need to switch up the shit you doing just ain't workin

[Verse 2 : Gucci Mane]
They got me feeling Nino couple mill in the safe
But when he snitched at the end it was a slap in the face
I need a bitch like Keyshia, shoot you middle of the day
And Pookie smoked, why the fuck G Money put some trust in a J
$30,000 worth narcotics, wrapped in some tape
I spend $130,000 dollar's just on my drapes
I got a coke model, super-model feedin' me grapes
And you can keep the money nigga, cause you paid me too late
And you ain't comin with me nigga, you tryna ride in the way
You just a spy, telling lies, tryna look at our place
You call me country to my face, I'll hit your ass with this 'K
Tomahawk, chop your head off, home of the Braves

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I don't know bout nobody else, but I'm servin
And as long as these bags come in, I'm gone serve em
Niggas say they ain't getting money but I'm workin
I'm riding with so much dope that I'm nervous
If the police try to pull up on me, I'm gone swerve em
You ain't never seen so many guns on one person
Dump truck, two trucks came on one Thursday
You need to switch up the shit you doing just ain't workin

[Hook]
Everybody wanna play that tough guy
'Til them things come out and them shots fly
Say your last words homie and it's bye bye
You shouldn't have been playin' with me
Everybody wanna play that tough guy
'Til them things come out and them shots fly
Say your last words homie and it's bye bye
You shouldn't have been playin' with me

[Verse 1]
I ain't no killer but don't push me
Them very words said can resurrect Pac straight from the dead
And it takes a young nigga like me to push the limit
No gimmick, this is real homie
I wake out of my sleep, sweat drippin' off my face and cheek
I swear to God, death callin' for me
That's why I carry a heat, roamin' these streets 'til they come and get me
Cause ninety percent of them are comin' with me
C4 your car doors and watch your shit blow in a jiffy
Quick, boom, explode when I empty
I'm on the edge so please don't tempt me to jump
I walk around with a pump, just to scatter you punk's heads
Then go and get some head by that woman you want
She does what I says, I says what I does
Crazy back then, yeah that's what I was
But now I'm psycho, mental nigga, holdin' a grudge
I put a hole in your mug, and let the blood leak out
Until it fill up a tub, then put your son in it
This is no image, this is ether
Cocaine, reefer, alcohol mixed with it
They tried to label your boy as a menace
Put me in some records, along with Guinness
I just started, I ain't finished
Chest to your head, until all you motherfuckers diminish

[Bridge]
I hope y'all ready to ride
Cause it's do or die
If not, stay inside
I hope you ready
If not, be quiet
Cause when shots fly
Somebody will cry
I hope you ready
I hope y'all ready to ride
Cause it's do or die
If not, stay inside
I hope you ready
If not, be quiet
Cause when shots fly
Somebody will cry
I hope you ready

[Intro]
Uh-huh, yeah
You know what it is
It's that Compton shit, nigga
Get back

[Chorus]
If I gotta ride
Then you's gonna die

[Verse]
I hope niggas ain't really tryin' to break my bones
Cause if you are make sure you know a nickname you want for that tombstone
Play hard as a rock bullets can break stones
Break bad boys down like Jenny did Sean Combs
I'm hot as an oven, you just a pressin' comb
I'm not impressed homes you should've stayed home
And prayed that rooftop blocked you from gettin' shitted on
I gives a fuck if A&R's don't pick up the phone
I swear there's no one like me but if there is then I gotta long lost twin or they made me a clone
I don't care about friends, I was made to be on my own
I came in this world by myself and I'm leavin' alone
Hopefully with a crib that I can call my own
With a backyard the size of the fuckin' Georgia Dome
Pop you popped shit and I might pop your dome
Give your homies a reason to make a memory song
Niggas swear that they love when the beef is on
Knowin' that plummet time the only time he'll roam
You better hold your breath, I give you workin' death
And recommend the gun be your chaperone
I know young niggas that look up to Al Capone
And they look 17 but I swear that their mind is grown, shit
I'm so grown and the reason why I write this way
Pac and Big be ghostwritin' my songs
You can play the boss but if you get shot
From bein' on top then, homie, that's your loss, shit
I'm nice wit' it
I'll pop your man then leave some money on him so it can pay for his funeral costs, get it?
The niggas tryin' to get money like Fort Knox
Either from the rap shit or back down to the cut rock
And you can play a baller but deep inside you know you just an actor
Yeah, somethin' like Rick Fox
You ain't a thug, homie, you just a fox
In the midst of werewolves somewhere in the boondocks
And I'm really from the streets
So if I ask for beef, homeboy, don't bring me no pork chop
I turn your skin to pork, homie, with one chop
With a rusty switchblade that's dirty like bum socks, heh
They say the flow is crack
So wherever I rap best believe you can call it a dope spot, bitch

[Chorus]
(I swear) I'm gon' ride (Yeah, you know what it's)
And this gotta cut (Bitch)
Came from shit, nigga (OK)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Once again it's on
I'm the youngest in charge, I am not playin'
I fear no man else than God
Scatter your features, give you a face collage
Not one, but two, I face menage
No hands involved, mommy would rather give a mouth massage
General, you can call me the sargeant
$7.45, five percent tip
I know I'm the shit, please hold the applaud
I spent summers writin' rhymes, winters freestylin'
Daydreamin' Gilligan thoughts on an island
I didn't develop, I was born with this talent
Brain swell up, whenever you come to me you were the challenge
I need a way to balance street shit from the rap shit
Stay on my toes, feet grounded to the souls of the dead
But still bulletholes surrounded the arc in my feet to the crown on my head
Preach, listen how I pledge
I've been gettin' this money since you dummies were peein' in bed
To poppin' wheelies on handlebars and pegs
To poppin' Big Willy at the bar with bread
Pause, it's real talk, I know you gotta crawl before you walk
Shit, I decided to jog
I'm ten brains better than y'all
Propane make emergency calls, whenever them boys speak
I fold niggas up, make both of the ends meet
You 'bout to fitness a lyrical fitness
This is what it'd sound like if God spoke over beats
I cash in my rap friends
Peep the way I deliver, make you wanna tell your peeps
I consider that they learn from me
This is volcano hot, fuck a third degree
Burn, You gotta be K-D-O-T

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Once again it's on, I am through with niggas
Twin Glocks, it'll shoot niggas
Put you next to a plant, under a root nigga
Hands folded together up in a suit nigga
This what we do nigga, run your mouth, we remote control mute niggas
Matter of fact, I recruit niggas

[Verse 3: Bill Thrill]
Bill Thrill straight spook niggas
Sixteens that'll ruin niggas
You mad cause I'm gettin' figures
I'm the bigger picture, you losin' dough and mine's gettin' thicker
I got somethin' that'll sting yah I call it the pinch hitter
Gather your mans so they can die with yah
Bill and K-Dot, now y'all dealin' with the best (right)
Side by side, yeah we somethin' like breasts
Flow game killin', I spit bars of death
Now they yellin' could it get any worse

[?] definition of Hell on Earth
Keep somethin' on the side, yeah you know that work
One false move, it'll make your whole body jerk
Think before you cross this turf
You'll get turned into ashes, or even laid in the dirt

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
For my niggas that hate the fights
Get it with the Glocks
Get it with the Glocks
Get it with the Glocks
For my niggas that hustle nights
Bakin' with the pots
Bakin' with the pots
Bakin' with the pots
For my niggas that know right
K-Dot is hot

K-Dot is hot
See my game still the same, never trick on a bitch (Ugh)
You don't have to tell me, I know I'm the shit

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm a nice dude (Okay), livin' my life dude (Ugh)
Trick on a dumb bitch is nothin' I might do (Nope)
Some try to play fools, the shots that they fake shoot
I'm mean like a Red Bull is mean when the eighth pull
I'm faithful to whatever I stand for
It means dough, gettin' my pesos
Gecko or Geico, whatever it stand for (Ha)
Red and blue flags, yours are like a rainbow, ha
Pants hang low
Born with the best flow since LL was rockin' a Kangol (Woo)
'87, one man, eighty weapons
I go hard without usin' protection
Hard out, learn your lesson
When I pull out, make like R. Kelly, get to steppin', haha
I'm the best at this profession
I can't help but bring it back to the essence mothafuckas

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
For my niggas that hate the fights
Get it with the Glocks
Get it with the Glocks
Get it with the Glocks
For my niggas that hustle nights
Bakin' with the pots
Bakin' with the pots
Bakin' with the pots
For my niggas that know right
K-Dot is hot
K-Dot is hot
K-Dot is hot
See my game still the same, never trick on a bitch
You don't have to tell me, I know I'm the shit

[Verse 2: DJ Dave]
I'm a young dude, smoke the best weed
See the act right, see them dubs clean
A sexy bachelor, hit 'em in your strokes
Never bust a nigga, goin' down your throat
The Phantom, not rich enough to cop yet
But picture 

[?] for the niggas outta pocket
I can exercise you, you can get a

When I lean back, don't dance, give me

Killa got that heat, we know killas in the street
With the heat that make you feel like a fat boy at the beach
So don't try to run up on 

[?] talkin' all that 

[?] and shit
I can rhyme and shit
If you niggas pay attention, you won't ask me shit
You should think about it, take a second, one
Matter of fact, you should take four b
Think before you fuck with real killas in the street

See my game still the same, never trick on a bitch
You don't have to tell me, I know I'm the shit

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm from a small city, no pity shown 'cept hammers thrown
Quickly push back your dome like a hot comb
So swiftly, come get me
If I had every bitch in the world, boy, you still ain't fuckin' with me
I'm 'bout my money strictly, as long as I stack my banks up
I'll have enough Young Bucks to fuck with 50
Now who fuckin' with me? Me and that gun was born siamese twins
So where I move, it's comin' with me
You down right, play with me, think I won't take your life
The scope'll have more dots on you than a website
I'm 'bout my head right and yours left
I swear in the vocal booth is where I'll take my last breath
That's K-Dot, oh you ain't heard? Shit, that boy hot
With dime bitches runnin' on beaches like baywatch
You sit and watch the young child with my money stacks
Add up faster than cell phones on speed dial

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
For my niggas that hate the fights
Get it with the Glocks
Get it with the Glocks
Get it with the Glocks
For my niggas that hustle nights
Bakin' with the pots
Bakin' with the pots
Bakin' with the pots
For my niggas that know right
K-Dot is hot
K-Dot is hot
K-Dot is hot
See my game still the same, never trick on a bitch
You don't have to tell me, I know I'm the shit

[Intro]
Yeap, it's all raw
Motion right here, no paper, no none of that

[Hook]
I must be dreaming, yeah, I must be dreaming
Yeah, cause I got the cars, got the clothes, got the money, and the hoes and the way I see that ain't gon' change
I must be dreaming, yeah, I must be dreaming
Yeah, cause I got the cars, got the clothes, got the money, and the hoes and the way I see that ain't gon' change
I must be

[Verse 1]
I wake up early in the morning to a fat blunt
A phone full of missed calls, my shit backed up
A flight to catch, my shit packed up
Them superstars you hear about, that's us
Them 12s in the trunk hit like a Mac truck
I see your bitch, it's a wrap like a packed lunch
My diamonds shining, they motivating
I see you smiling, I know you hating
I'm on the road like here, there and everywhere
In Hollywood, eating good, smoking heavy there
Ain't comfortable unless I got a lot of money near
I'm in exclusive shit, you got a lot of funny gear
Flat screen TV, no glare in 'em
And all my rooms got king size beds in 'em
I'm not just talking, that's all it seem and my life's a movie

[Hook]
I must be dreaming, yeah, I must be dreaming
Yeah, cause I got the cars, got the clothes, got the money, and the hoes and the way I see that ain't gon' change
I must be dreaming, yeah, I must be dreaming
Yeah, cause I got the cars, got the clothes, got the money, and the hoes and the way I see that ain't gon' change
I must be

[Verse 2]
I go to sleep in a new city every night
And pray to God looking over me on every flight
A new time zone, you hear me right?
LA to MIA, I'll be there tonight
Then I'm in Daygo, shopping for new shit
Eating at Ruth's Chris, right across the cruise ships
Hear niggas talking about it, I really do this
You couldn't walk a mile in this niggas shoes here
Car service when I land, homie I'm the man
Don't live the life of a star, it's hard to understand Everywhere I go, they know my name
They see me smiling, they know my chain
Plus they know I got flow like a sink bruh
Diamond linked up, all my niggas inked up
A lot of starving, I'm out here eating and making history

[Hook]
I must be dreaming, yeah, I must be dreaming
Yeah, cause I got the cars, got the clothes, got the money, and the hoes and the way I see that ain't gon' change
I must be dreaming, yeah, I must be dreaming
Yeah, cause I got the cars, got the clothes, got the money, and the hoes and the way I see that ain't gon' change
I must be

Murder 101, the hottest nigga under the sun
I come from another planet, holdin' that cannon
Best believe I will dump 'til all of you vanish
BLAW one to the throat, you ain't livin' no mo'
Now you know I go harder than most
I'm on that pimpin' shit, take your bitch, guard your ho
And I don't give a shit, if I hit, long as she blow
Just as much as a ref does a whistle
I got dimes, just multiply two nickels
From Lisas to Keishas down to Nicoles
Got they mind fucked up, they'd sell me their soul
Y'all niggas should already know, I got hoes, boy
But you already know that, pimpin'
A baller slash killer like O.J. Simpson
Close to the mic like Scottie Pippen
Superglue grip, I ain't ever slippin'

And I move with the coupe through traffic
Real talk, homeboy, not just rappin'
With the tool, mami know that I practice
Cause when I pull it out, I be shootin' it backwards
She like "Damn, how you do that stuff?"
I said "Don't worry, finish suckin' me up", oh fo' sho'
Aye desire, they better act like they know what's up
Before I send 'em to the heaven, let 'em know what's up, damn
Oh yeah, I'm what people need
And I'm out of y'alls speed 'cause the flow got gas
Yeah, our shit be the bomb
My suggest, you get your pom poms and cheer
I'm goin' down as the minor of the year
Seventeen, fresh to death, clean, diamonds in my ear
Play with me, have them triple beams aimin' at your rear
Honestly, I'm the mothafucka that niggas fear

Dave, man, put them niggas in the grave, man
Fuck a pistol, let them niggas feel the K, man
I'm still gettin' that cake, man
'Cause my uncle's still pitchin' rocks like a caveman
You snakes, stay far from my home
Before I play Nelly and get my Desert Eagle on
Aim at your belly 'til you throw up your own shit
Thinkin' you the shit, face in the toilet
You wanna witness the livest nigga existin'
Then come and pay me a visit, you have to pay for admission
I'm on my mission to conquer my competition
My ego bigger than Jay-Z, for sure, not a maybe
I got the streets in a frenzy, dudes in the streets, they commend me
Don't try to creep, I got semis and best believe they will empty
Mix the juice with the Remy got me feelin' so damn tipsy
Just crashed in front of that Bentley, smokin' blunts the bitch with me
She takin' shots in my gymmy, couple back shots I got plenty
Tell her stop, she said gimme, y'all can see that I'm simply

[Verse 1]
When morning comes to Morgantown
The merchants roll their awnings down
The milk trucks make their morning rounds
In morning Morgantown

[Verse 2]
We'll rise up early with the sun
To ride the bus while everyone is yawning
And the day is young
In morning Morgantown

[Chorus]
Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams, a dollar down
Morning any town you name
Morning's just the same

[Verse 3]
We'll find a table in the shade
And sip our tea and lemonade
And watch the morning on parade
In morning Morgantown

[Verse 4]
Ladies in their rainbow fashions
Colored stop and go lights flashing
We'll wink at total strangers passing
In morning Morgantown

[Chorus]
Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams, a dollar down
Morning in any town you name
Morning's just the same

[Verse 5]
I'd like to buy you everything
A wooden bird with painted wings
A window full of colored rings
In morning Morgantown

[Verse 6]
But the only thing I have to give
To make you smile, to win you with
Are all the mornings still to live
In morning Morgantown

[Chorus]
Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams, a dollar down
Morning any town you name
Morning's just the same
Morning's just the same

[Verse 1]
I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from the schools

[Chorus 1]
I was standing on a noisy corner
Waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet for free

[Verse 2]
Now me I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I got a black limousine and two gentlemen
Escorting me to the halls

[Chorus 2]
And I'll play if you have the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one man band
By the quick lunch stand
He was playing real good for free

[Verse 3]
Nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never been on their TV
So they passed his music by

[Chorus 3]
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain
As the signal changed
He was playing real good for free

[Verse 1]
The priest sat in the airport bar
He was wearing his father's tie
And his eyes looked into my eyes so far
Whenever the words ran dry

[Verse 2]
Behind the lash and the circles blue
He looked as only a priest can, through
And his eyes said me and his eyes said you
And my eyes said, "Let us try"

[Verse 3]
He said, "You wouldn't like it here
No, it's no place you should share
The roof is ripped with hurricanes
And the room is always bare"

[Verse 4]
I need the wind and I seek the cold
He reached past the wine for my hand to hold
And he saw me young and he saw me old
And he saw me sitting there

[Verse 5]
Then he took his contradictions out
And he splashed them on my brow
So which words was I then to doubt
When choosing what to vow

[Verse 6]
Should I choose them all, should I make them mine?
The sermons, the hymns and the valentines
And he asked for truth and he asked for time
And he asked for only now

[Verse 7]
Now the trials are trumpet scored
Oh will we pass the test?
Or just as one loves more and more
Will one love less and less?

[Verse 8]
Oh come, let's run from this ring we're in
Where the Christians clap and the Germans grin
Saying let them lose, crying let them win
Oh make them both confess

[Verse 1]
It was a rainy night
We took a taxi to your mother's home
She went to Florida and left you
With you father's gun alone
Upon her small white bed
I fell into a dream
You sat up all the night and watched me
To see who in the world I might be

[Verse 2]
I am from the Sunday school
I sing soprano in the upstairs choir
You are a holy man
On the FM radio
I sat up all the night and watched thee
To see who in the world you might be

[Verse 3]
You called me beautiful
You called your mother, she was very tanned
So you packed your tent and went
To live out in the Arizona sand
You are a refugee
From a wealthy family
You gave up all the golden factories
To see who in the world you might be

[Verse 1]
He comes for conversation
I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows that's what he'll find

[Verse 2]
I bring him apples and cheeses
He brings me songs to play
He sees me when he pleases
I see him in cafés

[Chorus 1]
And I only say, "Hello"
And turn away before his lady knows
How much I want to see him
She removes him, like a ring to wash her hands
She only brings him out to show her friends
I want to free him

[Verse 3]
Secrets and sharing soda
That's how our time began
Love is a story told to a friend
It's second-hand

[Verse 4]
But I'll listen to his questions
I'll give my answers when they're found
He says she keeps him guessing
But I know she keeps him down

[Chorus 2]
She speaks in sorry sentences
Miraculous repentances
I don't believe her
Tomorrow he will come to me
And he'll speak his sorrows endlessly and he'll ask me why
Why can't I leave her?

[Verse 1]
He comes for conversation
I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows that's what he'll find
He knows that's what he'll find

[Verse 1]
Trina wears her wampum beads, she fills her drawing book with lines
Sewing lace on widows weeds and filigree on leaf and vine
Vine and leave are filigree and her coat's a second-hand one
Trimmed with antique luxury, she is a lady of the canyon

[Verse 2]
Annie sits you down to eat, she always makes you welcome in
Cats and babies round her feet and all are fat and none are thin
None are thin and all are fat, she may bake some brownies today
Saying "you are welcome back," she is another canyon lady

[Verse 3]
Estrella, circus girl comes wrapped in songs and gypsy shawls
Songs like tiny hammers hurled at beveled mirrors in empty halls
Empty halls and beveled mirrors, sailing seas and climbing banyans
Come out for a visit here to be a lady of the canyon

[Verse 4]
Trina takes her pins and her threads and she weaves a pattern all her own
Annie bakes her cakes and her breads and she gathers flowers for her home
For her home she gathers flowers and Estrella, dear companion
Colors up the sunshine hours pouring music down the canyon

[Outro]
Coloring the sunshine hours, they are the ladies of the canyon

[Verse 1]
Willy is my child, he is my father
I would be his lady all my life
He says he'd love to live with me but for an ancient injury
That has not healed
He said I feel once again like I gave my heart too soon
He stood looking through the lace at the face on the conquered moon
And counting all the cars up the hill and the stars on my windowsill
There are still more reasons why I love him

[Verse 2]
Willy is my joy, he is my sorrow
Now he wants to run away and hide
He says our love cannot be real
He cannot hear the chapel's pealing silver bells
But you know it's hard to tell
When you're in the spell if it's wrong or if it's real
But you're bound to lose
If you let the blues get you scared to feel
And I feel like I'm just being born
Like a shiny light breaking in a storm
There are so many reasons why I love him
Willy is my child, he is my father

[Chorus]
You could have been more than a name on the door
On the thirty-third floor in the air
More than a credit card
Swimming pool in the backyard

[Verse 1]
While you still have the time you could get away and find
A better life, you know the grind is so ungrateful
Racing cars, whisky bars
No one cares who you really are

[Verse 2]
You're the keeper of the cards
Yes I know it gets hard keeping the wheels turning
And the wife she keeps the keys
She is so pleased to be a part of the arrangement

[Chorus]
You could have been more than a name on the door
On the thirty-third floor in the air
More than a consumer
Lying in some room trying to die
More than a credit card
Swimming pool in the backyard

[Outro]
You could have been more than a name on the door
You could have been more than a name on the door
You could have been more
You could have been more
You could have been more

[Verse 1]
Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star

[Chorus]
And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game

[Verse 2]
Then the child moved ten times 'round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like "when you're older" must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams

[Chorus]
And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game

[Verse 3]
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town
And they tell him, "Take your time, it won't be long now
'Til you drag your feet to slow the circles down"

[Chorus]
And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game

[Verse 4]
So, the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through

[Chorus]
And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game

[Verse 1]
Lady called the blue boy love, she took him home
Made himself an idol, yes, so he turned to stone
Like a pilgrim she travelled
To place her flowers before his granite grace
And she prayed aloud for love to waken in his face
In his face

[Verse 2]
Sometimes in the evening he would read to her
Roll her in his arms and give his seed to her
She would wake in the morning without him and go to the window
And look out through the pane
But the statue in her garden, he always looked the same
He looked the same

[Verse 3]
Bring her boots of leather and she will dance for him
Shyly from a feather fan, she'll glance for him
Here he comes after midnight to find her again
He will come few times more
Till he finds a lady statue standing in a door
In her door

[Hook]
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me

[Verse 1]
My gun got many ways to get you
You get hit with a missile and live, you would need barbed wire to stitch you
This is not fictional, this here is typical
I will bring it to your door if you can't see the visual
Black Manson, won't you ask him
How I have sex with the trigger just to make the barrel orgasm
Remember when it started, nobody protected me
Had to make way for school in the mornin' and niggas sweatin' me
Where you from? Like shit, I'm tired of niggas questionin' me
Now I'm in, I gotta have that thing next to me
Went to my pop's closet
The next day I'm pullin' up my pants, grabbin' my crotch and walkin' awkward
Somethin' pop off, then I have somethin' to spark with
By the bus stop like man I wish somebody'd push me
I'mma let the hawk spit, with a killin' instinct
Like some of these students gonna have an early coffin

[Hook]
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me

[Verse 2]
Now I got a love Jones for that 

[?] still on
Michael Jackson niggas, the fifth'll change your skin tone
Sniper guns'll chirp 

[?]
They'll prolly chirp silent when your Nextel is off speakerphone
How real is that? Never
Now niggas do dirt in daylight cause the 

[?] is clever
I resign to the fact, that any 

[?] where the drama is at
I'm reclinin' 

[?]
Keep your wordplay intact
And 50 couldn't say it better
Can't find you, show me where his mama live at
You a gangsta, I'm not one, but it doesn't mean
By all means, I'm not very able to pump a shotgun

[?] and watch as you 

[?]
With the MAC or the Ruger, nigga I got options
So while you play possum, I sit and watch 'em
Creepin', Nas got his so you fucked if you don't got one

[Hook]
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard meYou can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me

[Bridge]
I don't know about you, but see, baby I'm ruthless
Try to fight me, and see, baby you're useless
Shots from the MAC do more than have you toothless
The sound is exclusive, bang bang bang, boom

[Verse 3]
I explode like a Vietnam bomb
Hotter than firemans but my hand got a firearm
Fire at your arm, titty, and hands, breakin' your palms
Usin' them to snatch purses the brand of Louis Vuitton
Nigga, what type of shit you on? It's simple mass destruction
Revengeance, tension, you see I've had enough
Did I mention? I sniff you pussy niggas out
The smell that you bring has aroma like an incensce
Play matrix, see if you the one
It's a million ways to die and this here is number one
And that's starin' down a barrel of a gun
After I smack you 'til it's gun powder on your tongue
Cause boy them shells get hotter than the sun
And boy when I spit, please be prepared to run
Boy, don't forget to have a vest when I come
Cause I'll hit your chest and clog up your lungs mothafucka

[Hook]
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard meYou can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me

[Verse 1]
If you can just get your mind together
Then come on across to me
We'll hold hands, and then we'll watch the sunrise
From the bottom of the sea

[Chorus]
But first, are you experienced?
Or have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have

[Verse 2]
I know, I know you probably scream and cry
That your little world won't let you go
But who in your measly little world
Are you trying to prove that
You're made out of gold and, uh, can't be sold?

[Chorus]
So uh, are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have
Ah, let me prove it to you

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Trumpets and violins I can, uh, hear in the distance
I think they're calling our names
Maybe now you can't hear them, but you will, haha
If you just take hold of my hand

[Chorus]
Oh, but are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?

[Outro]
Not necessarily stoned, but beautiful

Fuck her on the floor 'fore we make it to the bed
That's what yo' ass really call started from the bottom
Yes, Lord, OVO Sound, man, I'm proud of my niggas

All my bitches love me; if I had a baby mama
She would probably be richer than a lot of you niggas
Ayy, that's luxury, dawg

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, I'm here with my niggas
I'm too high to be friendly
They throw dirt on my name
Well, that's why they still dig me
And I'm tired of all this hatin'
I thank God for my patience
I thank God for my homies
I wish we could trade places
Bitch, we good-fellas

And if we ball, catch us

[Spoken: Eminem]
Ayo Paul, it's Em
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing
And I know that he's not "thrilled" about the video
What, does he wanna be startin' somethin'?
Wow, well, I'll show him who's really bad (Burp)
Paul, the way you make me feel with these calls
You should really take a look at the man in the mirror
And tell him to beat it, because I won't stop 'til I get enough
Do you remember the time
We were watching the "Billie Jean" video?
Well, he'll always be that Michael to me
And it doesn't matter if he's black or white
Because I can't stop loving him
And I hate plastic surgeons, and I hope they all fucking die
How do you like that? And I like him, I like him a lot
I wanna' touch him, but I can't (Mouthing noises)
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit, sorry
Anyways, call me back
I have this idea about how I want to end the show
So, hit me when you get this message, fucker
Oh, and by the way, no, I don't have a new gun
(Gun cracks and bullets fall out) God damn it!

[Intro]
*Coughing*
Damn
Aight, uh

[Verse 1]
Smokin' on this purple got my mind all hazy
But it never put my grind on lazy
I just wanna get my shine on, baby
I know it drive you crazy that my grind's on daily
'Cause I be gettin' blowed every day of the week
This haze got me so cheifed that I stay in my seat
You wanna get me to spit, just play me a beat
I strive to win in everything 'cause i hate the defeat
So I elevate my mind (Mind)
Gotta stay cheifin'
And I don't even rap, boy, this just the haze speakin' (Haha)
My room bangs and it got the rays tweakin'
Smokin' blunts of haze, i just watch the day leavin'
With L's around the circle, you can tell that this some purple
'Cause this dank is so potent, If you smell it, it'll hurt you
I smoke that fruity with the funkiest fumes: Pepi Le Pew
Got a little skunk in the room, now chill
Lay back, meditate (Meditate)
I'm floatin', feelin' lighter than a featherweight (Featherweight)
My body asleep, but my head awake
I dedicate the rest of my night to makin' hella cake (Haha)
Pardon the lingo, it's prolly this Cali
The addiction and the plague got me wantin' it badly
I chase money like a hard to get female
Then throw it back up in the water like a seashell

[Chorus: Sample & Mac Miller]
Sitting in the silent twilight
The purple half light of the twilight
Wrap the night around me (Hey, Jerm, where you find this weed at, man?)
Blanket of black on my back (Got the boy a blunt in here)
I feel safe in the darkness (Cheah, cheah)
(That purple, gotta love that purple)

[Verse 2]
I get blowed then melt into the chair
Blow a L up in the air, eyes is red, but I don't care (I don't care)
Right now I prolly shouldn't be spittin' (Nah)
'Cause I'm lifted and mixin' up my diction
I'm feelin' high like the top of a water tower
Cop a sour then it's gone in a hour
Heavily medicated, sedated and faded (Faded)
Relaxed, chasin' an oasis
I'm in a safe haven (Haven), free from any trouble
Stumble, damn, this kush got me seein' double (Damn)
Need not fumble
Gotta keep my head straight
'Cause I stay puttin' haters in the checkmate (Bitch)
Uh-huh, now I'm way past blowed
Purple weed got me feelin' on my own
Ain't nothin' like a purp high, the type to make a nerd high
It got me coughin' up a lung like it's my first time
Metaphors and similes from Ecuador to Italy
Back in fifth grade when I lost my weed virginity
Smokin' like a chimney, blowin' out a cloud
This purple, last kush stay stinkin' up my house

[Chorus: Sample & Mac Miller]
Sitting in the silent twilight (Man, I love when she sing like this, right? Go 'head, girl)
The purple half light of the twilight (With that purple, get high)
Wrap the night around me
Blanket of black on my back
I feel safe in the darkness (So, y'all can ash your blunts now, roll up another)
Blanket of black on my back (Ooh, I like that, Jerm)
I feel safe in the darkness

[Outro]
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, haha

[Intro: Future]
Rich Gang, Mac what it do fool!

[Chorus: Future]
Hoes go crazy, hoes go crazy, hoes go crazy, hoes go crazy

Hoes go crazy, hoes go crazy, hoes go crazy

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I fuck around with these hoes
Never give them no money, still they stripping out of their clothes
A slut, thats the shit that I like
Take a little of that po', then we mix it up with that Sprite
Hoes go crazy
See them popping all of those beans
Hoes go crazy

Hoes go crazy
Doing drugs and getting that fuck on
Better suck this dick bitch, this ain't no love song
Woah, Riding round with these hoes

[Chorus: Future]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone, then

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy, James Fauntleroy & Drake]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, uh
Say my name, say my name
'Cause those other men are practice
And this ain't no time for actin'
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, "Get money and fuck these hoes"
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

[Verse 1]
Wish I was prettier a little for ya
Maybe I’ll understand when I get older
I just don’t get it yet
I’m not finished yet

Feel like maturity is overrated
None of my panties match my momma hates it
I’m not into that
She just dont get it yet

[Pre-Chorus]
Who could I be?
Visions clearer for me, me-e, me

[Chorus]
Tell me if it's easier for ya
Tell me if it's easier for you
Tell me if it's easier for ya
Tell me it gets easier for me

[Verse 2]
Shattered a thousand times before you found me
Picking the pieces, I bet I’ll never amount to anything
I just don’t get it yet
Not meant to get it yet

Boxes and paradigms, I move around it
Spaces inside your mind, I’m safe and sound where
I can breath, I feel I can breath
Don’t leave me yet

[Pre-Chorus]
Who could I be
Visions clearer for me, me-e, me

[Chorus]
Tell me if it's easier for ya
Tell me if it's easier for you
Tell me if it's easier for ya
Tell me it gets easier for me

[Outro]
Sandcastles and all that shit that I like

[Intro]
More to love when your hands are free
Baby, put your pom poms down for me (Okay)
Come on, shake it up, 1-2-3
Baby, put your pom poms down for me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, they come from miles away
Just to see how you get down
Feels like an earthquake
Every time you come around
You hear 'em saying, "Yeah" (Yeah)
Every time feels like a revival (Glory)
So get up, right now
We're coming for the title

[Chorus]
More to love when your hands are free
Baby, put your pom poms down for me
Come on, shake it up, 1-2-3
Baby, put your pom poms down for me
When you move I fall to my knees
Baby, put your pom poms down for me
Come on, shake it up, 5-4-3
Baby, put your pom poms down for me

[Verse 2]
I want you on my team
Want you like kid just wants a milkshake
And I won't let it go to waste, if I get a taste
I'm gonna drink the whole thing
You hear 'em saying, "Yeah" (Yeah)
Every time feels like a revival (glory)
So get up, right now
We're coming for the title

[Chorus]
More to love when your hands are free
Baby, put your pom poms down for me
Come on, shake it up, 1-2-3

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Pecan, puerto rican, blackanese
All my bitches steppin' in Louboutins, spend a couple racks on them jeans
LIV on sunday, King Of Diamonds Monday
They not goin' in no club unless they comin' out with that money
They spend it, they spend it, they winning, they winning
Got a bad clique, you ain't a bad bitch then you ain't 'bout to be in it
I be drippin' of the murder, bitch you know you want a picture
Comin' out, straight bummin' out, but they turn around when they see her
(Bad bitches gon' link up) and we gonna do whatever we think of
Got bitches all in Bugatti's at my crib to come and pick me up
(Bad bitches gon' link up) you know how many bad hoes I own?
I got pimpin' in my blood, somebody get Taz on the phone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Trippy... trippy
Thumbin' through a check with a bad bitch, she's a hollywood actress
Don't worry 'bout what we doing ho, all you need to know is we cash checks
My other bitch is a supermodel, and her pussy gets super wet
Me, her and my actor bitch 'bout to have us some group sex
Bad bitches gon' link up, patron shots gon' drink up
We ball out all week long, you broke niggas can't keep up
I make it rain I gotta sweep up, she suck it slow and then speed up
Poolparty on the rooftop, you need a helicopter to see us
Ballin' out cause I'm rich as fuck, ballin' out cause she pissy drunk
You ain't imagine that loud pack then hell no you can't hit the blunt
Pullin' up in my foreign car, that spare tire go in the front
Damn right I got my hood behind me, that purple stuff all in my pot

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Aisha lemme lick up on that cat
Hit it while you kissin' on that, get it from the back
I keep a bad bitch to breed bad bitches back
Pretty in the face with a ass hella' fat
Bad bitches link up, bad bitches wassup
And if you mad bitch it's cause you average so shut the fuck up
Get your drink up, pretty blowin' that's stink up
Strokin' forever need her, you broke, you gon' never meet her, see them
(Bad bitches gon' link up) and I'mma try to fuck them all
Then I tell her bring some more, I'mma let 'em buy the mall
(Bad bitches gon' link up) and for every bitch that I own
That ever texted my phone like, "can you bring some bitches home?"
This for y'all

[Hook]

[Intro: Kanye West]
Everywhere I go I'm a star, I'm a star
Damn, Kanye, is that your car?
Every—Everywhere I go I'm a star, I'm a star
Damn, Kanye, is that your car?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Niggas repping the 'Go, but we can't tell
You claim you got hoes, nigga, we can't tell
You claim you got dough, but we can't tell
You bought one pair of 1s at a two-for-one sale

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Politics kept me at the end of the mixtape
So I dropped my own get-well-soon-from-sick tape
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight (Uh-huh)
I'm tryna do numbers like Pac did
But it ain't Shakur, it's the brand new Roc kid
Niggas wanna get me like they got BIG
'Cause I moved up out the city and got big
That's the poison that run through their veins
And attacks they soul and just start to tear 'em up
Niggas talk so much shit about me in barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut ("Where you going?")
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun talk, and I don't go there enough
But don't get it fucked up, you can still get your head bust
I'm making way too much dough to be playing (I ain't playing with y'all niggas)
And this is a classic in the making, history repeats itself
He do the rhymes and the beats hisself
The only-child syndrome, make hits on his own (Uh-huh)
And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Y'all bout to blow, man, we can't tell
You claim you got hoes, man, we can't tell
You niggas gettin' dough, dog, we can't tell
You copped one pair of 1s on a two-for-one sale

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I cop Ides by the case like Dirty
I made it to the Power 30 a whole hour early
I'ma pull out the shank and bang ya
I'ma cut a nigga up like LL trainer
This is the future of the Chi
This is the legacy of Twista, the Flic', and Do or Die (What up)
So first of all, who am I? ("The fuck is you?")
My—My—My name is Kanye and not Kayne, bitch
At home like Cambridge, look at what I came with
No, none of that same shit, that new and improved
Now, I don't know if it's me or how yellow my Roc-A-Fella chain is
But I'm so live/smooth, there's nothing to prove (Ooh-OOH!)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
You niggas 'bout to blow, man, we can't tell
You claim you got hoes, man, we can't tell
You niggas gettin' dough, dog, we can't tell
You copped one pair of 1s at a two-for-one sale

[Outro: Kanye West]
Ayo, everywhere I go I'm a star, star
Damn, Kanye, is that your car?
Now, everywhere I go I'm a star
Damn, Kanye, is that your car?

[Verse 1]
Delilah, Delilah
Oh my, oh my, oh my
You're irresistible
You make me smile
When I'm just about to cry
You bring me hope
You make me laugh and I like it
You get away with murder so innocent
But when you throw a moody
You're all claws and you bite
That's alright!

[Verse 2]
Delilah, Delilah
Oh my, oh my, oh my
You're unpredictable
You make me so very happy
When you cuddle up and go
To sleep beside me
And then you make me slightly mad
When you pee all over
My Chippendale suite

[Bridge]
Delilah, Delilah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You take over my house and home
You even try to answer my telephone
Delilah, you're the apple of my eye
Meeow meeow meeow
Delilah, I love you, Delilah

[Verse 3]
Ooh, you make me so very happy
You give me kisses
And I go out of my mind, ooh
Meeow meeow meeow
You're irresistible, I love you, Delilah
Delilah, I love you

[Outro]
Hah-hah
You make me very happy
Oh yeah
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your, your, your kisses
I love your kisses

[Verse 1]
It's that D-O double 'Bino
Nigga, how you livin'? Yeah, my life so cappuccino
Bittersweet, I'm giving everything I got, I feel so
Helpless, help us, shopping at the Gelson's: soymilk, shellfish
Used to stunt Kitsune, used to date Katsumi
But then I got a new one, but she ain't talking to me
IMessages unread, pain that was unsaid
Laughter that we ain't heard from children we ain't had
I'm a boss, homie. Die a boss like I'm Steve Jobs
They thought I was Jamaican, I got three jobs
They must have been mistaken, I ain't feel ya
They respect the grind and zone 6 lookin' real soft
Dear Mom, you sound sick every time I call
Dad's lying to me, I can hear it in his tone
I don't want nobody help, leave me the fuck alone
Brother holding my head in the shower don't know what I'm on
Rivers running through my nappy afro
Feeling guilty, won the raffle
But the lotto ate my motto at my core
I'm just an apple and they want me PC
Paid for my house but this show is not me
More than the music, we going for that mastery overload
Da Vinci Code comatose to sport a beard like I'm OVO
Got that cream, I'm an Oreo
You know how the story goes
DatPiff four page cause you suck something glory hole
It's that Fresh Prince, Royalty means you deserve it
We were best friends, they talking bout him and I
They loving this silly guy, I'm popping Abilify
Niggas was wildin' out cause they want me so civilized
They say anytime that you getting cheese you in a rat race
Any movies that they offer me is black face
It's so post racial, so I can't prove it
We the same thing, we in the same movement
Business is business, we eating lunch, just not on silent
It's the Diddy and Biggie driving backwards, I'm so iconic
If I'm dead before Detox it doesn't mater, I heard The Chronic
You gon' sell it on eBay, just be glad that I fuckin' signed it
I ain't mad, though, you gotta eat, right?
I know your voice, man, you Marshall Lee, right?
Nah, I'm what you hear in your dreams saying it's not enough
God had made a lot of land, I gotta buy it up
I'm bouncing on the highway, blast it in my driveway
Put that shit on replay, turnt up on agave
Check the kimosabe, my life is so behind me
If you ain't feeling it, come and find me
Come and find me

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm so on to you
I'm so on to you
I'm on to you
We need your love, to shower down
In our hearts, hear us now
We need some answers
I know you’re hurting, I hear you crying
But come tomorrow, there’s a place you can go
On the blue sky, hear the choir sing
Feel the power, of miracle,
Healing both, you and me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We need the world, call an angel
Show us a sign, let us know
Give us all, we’r waiting on you
To give us friends, to carry on
Help us up, and take us home now
I know you’re hurting, I hear you crying
But come tomorrow, there’s a place you can go
On the blue sky, hear the choir sing
Feel the power, of miracle,
Healing both, you and me
I know you’re hurting, I hear you crying
But come tomorrow, there’s a place you can go
On the blue sky, hear the choir sing
Feel the power, of a miracle,
Healing both, you and me
I know you’re hurting, I hear you crying
But come tomorrow, there’s a place you can go
On the blue sky, hear the choir sing
Feel the power, of miracle,
Healing both, know you’re worthy.

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh huh, the Roc in here (yeah)
It's ya boy Kanye To The
Listen up man

[Verse]
I got girls in my room like hostages
Giving me neck like ostriches
Give some play to the real Kanye
'Cause we all know who the imposters is
All my gangsters, mob to this
And all my strippers, do your job to this
Hell no, I can't give you my cell phone
But you know where the hotel lobby is
For ya'll the same girls wouldn't give me no ass
Now I done highly surpassed my whole upper class
Bet if I meet her now I can fuck her fast, I pass
I be on some new shit
I wouldn't fuck none of the girls I went to school with
Fuck around, I ain't be on no cool shit
Like you don't see the models that me and my crew get
You don't see the frivolous jewels I bought with The Blueprint
She said "Whoa! Kanye don't get caught up in the hype
Ain't no telling they gon' love you after the night"
Well, if tonight's the night, pop bottles, fuck models
Spend money till you're broke my, nigga, live your life
'Cause I'm living international nigga American dream
And all my dawgs living vicariously through me
So if I get head from Trin', that one for the team
Fuck 702, that one for the crew
My dawg Hip Hop really love Claudette
So if I ever get to smash, this fuck's for you
I can barely drive the G5 down King Drive
Just like a Brinks trucks, they know it's money inside (Ching!)

[Outro]
Uh huh, (uh huh)
The Roc in here

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Maine on fire, my empire be higher
Than an octave on Mariah, you niggas should worship sire
Your crew holding dead weight like a fuckin' hearse's tire
Meanwhile I'm like the flow diversifier verse is flyer
Gave you truth at a time when niggas prefer the liars
I was David promising the world that I'mma serve Goliath
Then I swam with sharks, made it to the land and parked
My dick in bitches with intentions sick as satan's worst desires
Hell of a intro speedin' through this life at a hell of a tempo
Get my head out the window
20k in my pocket as im feeling the wind blow
And I ain't have a wallet since Nintendo, comprendo
Orchestrating these capers watch my paper crescendo
I used to wanna save the world, now all I do is spend dough
Till I snap back like Hov hat
Now I'm back with this big black strap like hol' that

[Hook]
Maine on fire
Top down bitch i ain't no liar
Henny on the rocks and plenty on the watch
Middle fingers to the ones who say we can't go higher
Maine on fire
Every week can see my name on flyers
Henny by the shots many bottles pop
And if she say that she ain't let me she a dang on liar

[Verse 2]
We collect a hundred thou
Getting over on promoters might as well say run it now
I was such a cunning child
The one your girl mama wish she brought back home instead of you
The one your mama glad you hung around
Cole a charming nigga that can harm a nigga
Chest out in your hood like I walk around with armor, nigga
But its just me and all my nigga's and we fuck the baddest
Bitches on the planet witnesses this is
Hustle at its, finest cause while you nigga's chase vaginas
We just let the paper blind us
While vaginas chase behind us
Take notes make money don't make jokes
For the master grab his rope and make us all scapegoats
Real shit but if the world really bout to end
We might as well let my nigga Craig out the pen
Pain so deep the words bled out the pen
And maine don't sleep nigga I win then come again

Huh

[Hook]

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Hello, it's the Mack, sit back and relax

Better hop in that whip with the coochie, then she lick dick to the new king

Better get them chips 'fore it's too late, it's a new bad bitch with a booty
Who sucking and fucking for Kool-Aid and keeping that pimp in a new Range (Oh, Lord)

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]

And she get a pimp nigga like me, rich as fuck

[Intro]
I'm an animal, baby
Can you still love me, baby?

[Hook]
I'm a beast, here my roar
Fingernails, on the floor
I'm an animal, baby
Put a gate around my heart
Don't you let me out the yard
I'm an animal, baby yeah

[Verse 1]
I got a chemical that makes me go numb
Don't know what to do with my opposable thumbs
I got a mean temper banging like an Indian drum
And if you press one of my buttons I'm gon' do something dumb

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I said "A", "A" yeah
"N", no, no, no
"I", "I", "I", "I"
"M", I'm a man

I'm an animal, yeah
Can you still love me baby? Yeah

[Verse 2]
Should've played it cool
But I pushed it to the edge
Now she's slipping through my hands
And she's dangling an edge
Never had a discipline or knew when to say when
I wasn't civilized, I'm an animal to the end

[Hook]

[Bridge]

I take advantage, girl
I'm smokin' TNT
I'm drinking dynamite
Can you still love me?
I'm an animal, yeah
Can you still love me, baby?

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 1]
Sailin' heart ships through broken harbors
Out on the waves in the night
Still the searcher must ride the dark horse
Racing alone in his fright

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay
But young enough to sell?

[Verse 2]
Tell me lies later, come and see me
I'll be around for a while
I am lonely but you can free me
All in the way that you smile

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay
But young enough to sell?

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay
But young enough to sell?

[Intro]
Song without a home

[Verse 1]
When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will you think of me and wonder if I'm fine?
Will your restless heart come back to mine
On a journey through the past?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?

[Verse 2]
Now I'm going back to Canada
On a journey through the past
And I won't be back 'til February comes
I will stay with you if you'll stay with me
Said the fiddler to the drum
And we'll keep good time on a journey through the past

[Outro]
When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?

[Verse 1]
My life is changing in so many ways
I don't know who to trust anymore
There's a shadow running through my days
Like a beggar goin' from door to door
I was thinkin' that maybe I'd get a maid
Find a place nearby for her to stay
Just someone to keep my house clean
Fix my meals and go away

[Chorus]
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid

[Post-Chorus]
It's hard to make that change
When life and love turns strange
And cold

[Verse 2]
To give a love
You gotta live a love
To live a love
You gotta be part of
When will I see you again?

[Verse 3]
A while ago somewhere I don't know when
I was watchin' a movie with a friend
I fell in love with the actress
She was playin' a part that I could understand

[Chorus]
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid
A man needs a maid

[Outro]
When will I see you again?

[Chorus]
Oh no, no, no, no
I can't take no ho
To my mama place, I can't take no ho to my mommy place, plus
My trigger finger just itchin'
My trigger finger just itchin'
My trigger finger just itchin'
My trigger finger just itchin'
My trigger finger just itch, trigger finger just itch
My trigger finger just itch, trigger finger just itch

[Verse 1]
That 40 on my waistline, I got that .40 on my waistline
So don't play with me, 'cause I don't play with you
Out my respect I'll come lay with you if that's okay with you
Choppers, AK's, hand grenades, we take that, kill shit, no payback
But I'll kill you and listen close no mistake that
But we don't play basketball, bitch there's no take back
And all my niggas strapped up every day
No candy but you know everyday is payday
And if you ever ever ever play its gon' be mayday
Take a nigga bitch by my goddamn self, I don't really need no foreplay

[Chorus]
Oh no, no, no, no
I can't take no ho
To my mama place, I can't take no ho to my mommy place, plus
My trigger finger just itchin'
My trigger finger just itchin'
My trigger finger just itchin'
My trigger finger just itchin'
My trigger finger just itch, trigger finger just itch
My trigger finger just itch, trigger finger just itch

[Verse 2]
CRE, cash rules everything around me
Cash rules everything around me
Cash rules everything around me, hold up
Draw down with this 4 pound, pussy nigga don't make a sound
Don't make no sounds, pass baby girl them boots
Oh, damn she don't take molly, I'ma take some for you
Then, I just went to see the priest, he say I need new friends
Just like horse food, baby I ain't tryna see the pen
Boom, boom, boom, boom, C4 bro
I got automatic bars, 5-0 Glow
You get caught up on the road, say you John Doe
All these lessy ass niggas need a little mo'

[Chorus]
Oh no, no, no, no
I can't take no ho
To my mama place, I can't take no ho to my mommy place, plus
My trigger finger just itchin'

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'll shoot at you and yo ho, like a porno movie

And if the girl wanna come, let her in
Word around town is that them young niggas went in
I'm sittin' at the end while you still beginning
I love her friends, I love her friends, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
He ain't came in my spot, come skatin' under my blocks
Unless you heard 'bout it, then get shot, I ain't no ho, nigga
And even at a concert, I'll show a nigga
Or just like double seals, I'll pour that nigga
That's my protocol, my word law
My birds soft, my horse boss
Feed me, feed me
I don't rap for free, the opposite of freebee
I want a whole grammy, I wanna hit yo nanny
I'll take another .5 now I'm the last standing
I call him Damu Nick, 'cause he stay with that cannon
And he gon' sit in your front yard, even if you was Stanley

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'll shoot at you and yo ho, like a porno movie
I'm always high, call this condo music
And if the girl wanna come, let her in
Word around town is that them young niggas went in

I love her friends, I love her friends, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Wicced]
I should take a pic, all this fly shit I got on
I'm fly, I'm fly, like I've been airborne
Yo girl suck me up, she suck me up like she work on porn
It's so hot, it's so hot call her remy like all star
I'll take a aim and skeet right in her jaw
You ain't gettin' paper that's a personal problem, it ain't my fault
I'm too focused and level-headed, fill up a money vault
You try some stupid shit, pull out the sticks and come chalk 'em out
I'm on four different drugs, shit I'm high as a loft
I just buy expensive clothes, fuck what the shit cost
Keep a closet full of work, ain't no such thing as drought
'Migo drop 'em off, we get 'em in and we get 'em out

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'll shoot at you and yo ho, like a porno movie
I'm always high, call this condo music
And if the girl wanna come, let her in
Word around town is that them young niggas went in
I'm sittin' at the end while you still beginning
I love her friends, I love her friends, oh yeah

Bitch, I ain't Barry, but I play with white
Bitch, I ain't scary, I could never fright
Hundred black choppers like a fuckin' night

[Chorus]
Panoramic Porsche
Pull up on a bitch like "pass me the torch"
Let me fire this spliff up
I ain't from New York, but ayy, ayy, bruh
I don't need no pork, I just need to two cups stuffed
Lotta ice, I just need two cups stuffed
Gimme a cup twice, I just need two cups stuffed
Go light on the ice, I just need two cups stuffed
Gamble with ya life if I don't get two cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed

[Outro]
Thugga, Thugga, baby

[Verse 1]
You'll never see the courage I know
Its colors' richness won't appear within your view
I'll never glow the way that you glow
Your presence dominates the judgements made on you

[Pre-Chorus]
But as the scenery grows, I see in different lights
The shades and shadows undulate in my perception
My feelings swell and stretch I see from greater heights
I understand what I am still too proud to mention to you

[Chorus]
You'll say you understand, but you don't understand
You'll say you'd never give up seeing eye to eye
But "never" is a promise and you can't afford to lie

[Verse 2]
You'll never touch these things that I hold
The skin of my emotions lies beneath my own
You'll never feel the heat of this soul
My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown to you

[Chorus]
You'll say "Don't fear your dreams, it's easier than it seems"
You'll say you'd never let me fall from hopes so high
But "never" is a promise and you can't afford to lie

[Verse 3]
You'll never live this life that I live
I'll never live the life that wakes me in the night
You'll never hear the message I give
You'll say it looks as though I might give up this fight

[Pre-Chorus]
But as the scenery grows, I see in different lights
The shades and shadows undulate in my perception
My feelings swell and stretch, I see from greater heights
I realize what I am now too smart to mention to you

[Chorus]
You'll say you understand, you'll never understand
I'll say I'll never wake up knowing how or why
I don't know what to believe in, you don't know who I am
You'll say I need appeasing when I start to cry
But "never" is a promise and I'll never need a lie

[Verse 1]
Lost your job, lost your mind
Living on the street for the second time
All you do is dream; morning, noon, and night
I see blue skies in front of me

[Chorus]
Baby, never give up
Don't stop now, it's never too much
Never give up, never give up
Hold on baby, never give up

[Verse 2]
Lost your heart, lost your will
On your hands and knees just for a dollar bill
Lost your faith and your confidence
Nothing seems fair, nothing makes sense

[Chorus]

[Breakdown]
Never give up
Never give up
Never give up
Never give up

[Verse 3]
Feel like a joke, feel like a fool
Should've smarten up, should've stayed in school
What I'm gonna do? How I'm gonna get by?
Ain't got no answer, but can't I can't stop trying

[Chorus]

[Intro]
We're the new generation
The new generation
And we believe now
We believe

[Verse 1]
It's a televised revolution, we want democracy
We fight all the pressure, we're tired of murder and grief
We want our freedom like the Statue of Liberty
We want to see our children live better than you and me
The whole city is a dance floor, it's a celebration
We want the whole world to see things are really changin'
From Africa to Asia, through Europe across the seas
Everybody's got their head up and nobody's on their knees

[Hook]
And the bombs would stop flying and we gaze a quiet sky
And we stand in love and wonder at the miracle gone by
And it ain't like it used to be cause it's better than it was
We're the new generation, we believe in love
We believe in love
We're the new generation, the new generation

[Verse 2]
Now we're sharing our money, now we're helping tough lives
Now we're calling up our brothers saying "I apologize"
Love is stronger than the Terminator, love's in every baby's eyes
Your crawling out of that dirty gutter with tuxedos on your mind
You want a glass of champagne, you want it paid for by the pain
Shout your national anthem for all your country men that died in vain
You're the new prince ruler, the red dog Cairo King
An international inspiration, the number one topic most trending

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now you can't get between us, we're connected like mother and child
It's a worldwide network, you better log on before you die
Cause the old god is over and the new way is baptized
And now we're storming through the palace singing, dancing, you know why
Waving peace flags on the balcony, yeah we just changed history
And we all join hands and thank God for listening

[Hook]

[Intro]
Love after war
Love after war
Love after war
Love after war

[Verse 1]
Ooh, it's a knockout, baby, you won the fight
I said "I'm sorry that I acted like a selfish child"
Please forgive me, baby, I was out of line
You know I can make it right
D?on't you love it when we fight

[Chorus]
Love after war
(Yeah, ooh, I need you tonight, baby)
Love after war
(Come on and let me make it right, baby)
Love after war
(Ooh, I'm knocking on your door)
Love after war
(You know I want it, you know I want ya)

[Verse 2]
Caught in lies, doves cry, doors slam and broken lights
Bottles hit the TV screen, "You gotta go or I'm gonna leave"
Throwing clothes into the yard, when we go we go so hard
It only makes me want you more, more, more and more, baby, woo

[Chorus]
Love after war
(Ooh, I need you tonight, baby)
Love after war
(Come on and let me make it right, baby)
Love after war
(Ooh, I'm knocking on your door)
Love after war
(You know I want it)

[Bridge]
(Love love, love love) Ooh, yeah
(Love love, love love) Love you, baby
(Love love, love love) Uh-huh, yeah
(Love love, love love) That's all we need
(Love love, love love) All we need
(Love love, love love) That's all we need
(Love love, love love) That's all we need, mmm, mmm
Love after war
(Ooh, I just wanna love you, lady)
Love after war
(We're gonna put down our weapons, baby)
Love after war
(Lay your guns down on the floor, love)
Love after war
(And give me some love after war, baby)

[Chorus]
Love after war
(You know it's gonna be all night)
Love after war
(You know the way that we fight, baby, yeah)
Love after war
(Ooh, just drink this glass of wine)
Love after war
(And girl, remember you're mine, baby)
Love after war
(Remember you're mine, baby; you're mine, baby)
Love after war
(C'mon and let me in, let me in)
Love after war
(Let me in, let me, let me, let me in, baby)
Love after war
(Yeah, you know I want it)

[Outro]
You know I want you, babe
You know I want you, baby, ooh
You know I want you, babe, yeah
You know I want you, baby, yeah, hey
(Love after war) Ah baby, ah baby
(Love after war)

[Verse 1]
Hey girl, I've been thinking
About you in see-through secrets
Crawling on my thousand-thread count down, down, down
Play, play hard to get as you know I love to chase that
Till you push me on the bed and start your show

[Hook]
Baby, cause I'm all tied up inside, come save me
I get lonely, I get blue
I want you baby, I need you
Baby, cause I'm all tied up inside, come save me
I get lonely, I get blue
I want you baby, I need you

[Verse 2]
Lay, lay across my pillow, as you make love to me ego
And you always treat me like a superstar
Oh, I'm so obsessed, you know I'm such a mess
When I see you get undressed and start your show

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I'm all tied up
(And I get so locked up inside)
I'm all tied up
(All I need is you and you got the key baby
Only you can release me)
I'm all tied up
(I need your love, Oh I need you to save me, baby
Oh, you got the key, come on and set me free)

[Hook]

 

[Verse 1]
Ooh, it's been so long, good to be home
Bring down the lights, power down the phone
Oh, put it on vibrate, call you all night
And Ooh, are you ready to go?

[Hook]
Making it my mission, taking it nice and slow
I just need your permission, but you seem all ready
All ready to go

[Verse 2]
It's good to be back, back in your arms
Here with my baby, right where I belong
It's good to be back, ain't nothing changed
I'm the same body, you want it

[Hook]

[Bridge 1]
Whatever you need; I got it
Just tell me; I got it
Your energy; I want it
You and me

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]
When you get that energy, and your body's calling me
First if I'm ready cause I, I wanna tell you alone
When you get that energy and your body's calling me
First if I'm ready cause I, I wanna pass it along
And on my bedside I'mma tear it up
So how can I love you? How can I love you, babe?
When you get that energy, and your body's calling me
First if I'm ready cause I, I wanna pass it along

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Listen here doll, be a good girl
I'mma tell you something I know about the world
It's the same thing that I've been trying to tell you
Don't make me run around, run from your blues
Don't make me close my heart, oh no, you're bad news
Use your crying eyes wisely, and don't push me into a corner

[Hook]
Crazy in the morning, afraid of the night
Stories always changing, something ain't right
Don't know if it's real or fake, I can't trust the bait
Of your tears on my tuxedo
Tears on my tuxedo, tears on my tuxedo
Either you're truly scared, or you've come prepared
With your tears on my tuxedo

[Verse 2]
You got me like I'm Sam Spade trying to figure you out
Are you a jewel encrusted falcon or future empty house?
I must rely on my instinct cause I can't trust your words or your tears no more
Cause just when we're about to get down to the truth
You start crying bout how life is so cruel to you
And there's nowhere to go but try and console
It ain't working no more
It ain't working no more

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I don't know when it's real
I dont know how to feel
You got me right where you want me
Breaking all of my own rules
So listen here doll, don't turn us into fools
I know I'm the one that put most of those tears on you
And there's no way to change it but doing the best I can do
I just keep falling for you

[Hook]

[Ending]
Cry all you want to, babe
You can cry all you want to, baby
Cry all you want to, babe
You can cry all you want to, baby

[Verse 1]
Why would I go to Rome, or stand in St. Peter's Square?
Or gaze at Mona Lisa with someone who can't compare?
I'd never go without, I wouldn't even dare
Like Rio De Janeiro was never even there
No need to spend my birthday with all of my friends in New York City
(Boring)
No need to have floor seats; seventh game Celtics and Kobe
(Boring)

[Hook]
You make me say "Glory, Hallelujah"; you're never boring
You make me say "Glory, Hallelujah"; you're never boring
You make me say "Glory, Hallelujah"; you're never boring

[Verse 2]
There's no need to go to Victoria Secret's show
Or stay in Central Bay on Jay and Beyoncé's boat
No supermodel or Obama could interest me mo'
It's like everything's meaningless without you close

[Hook]

[Ending]
Boring, boring
Boring, boring

[Verse 1]
There you walking by there
You are the apple of my eye
And I see you coming towards me
And I get this sweat and butterflies
And you should know it
You've got to feel it
I'm in love with you for real and
I have got to have you tonight

If you knew how cute you looked in your tight dress and your high heels
You'd understand why I get caught up staring at you every time
You pass me by, I see your eyes
I feel your hair, I see your smile
I just wish that you could see me too

Walking down the beach together hand-in-hand, let me paint the picture
You can see it now, whatever you will now we'll get somehow
What do you want to try, baby? What do you wanna eat tonight, baby?
I have got to have you tonight

[Hook]
There she goes, my pretty baby
There she goes, my lovely lady
I need her to know I need her for life
There she goes, my pretty baby
There she goes, my lovely lady
I need her to know I need her for life

[Verse 2]
There she goes walking by there
She caught my eye, she's looking at me
I tell her "I'll leave you never"
She thinks I am oh so clever
Know baby, I'm telling the truth
I am the only one for you
I will love you until the end of time

[Verse 1]
I'm dangerous, so dangerous
I'm dangerous, you better stay away
Stay away from me, I'm dangerous
I'm dangerous, so dangerous
You're a lone hitchhiker, I'm a traveling truck
You better not get on this ride
You might lose your luck, I'm dangerous
You better heed the sign, the skull and cross bone nights
Stop lights in use, I'm slippery when wild
Cautions and red flags, I'm gonna cross that line
I'm dangerous

[Hook]
So don't you, don't you say maybe
Baby, I'm crazy, crazy for wanting
Wanting you badly
Madly I'm serious
And you're so curious
But I'm too dangerous

[Verse 2]
You better not kiss me once
You better not fall in love
I'm a pterodactyl, and you're a wondering dove
I don't mean to be greedy, but it's never enough
I'm dangerous
I'll tell you I'll love you and I'll believe it's true
Oh, then I'll do something so bad to you
And you'll say "I hate you"
And you'll be screaming in a dream
Where no one can hear you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You're idealistic, so filled with glee
You see me as your shining prince
But I'm a treacherous king
You'll accept my olive branch, but I'm poison ivy

[Outro]
I'm dangerous, so dangerous
I'm dangerous, you better stay away
Stay away from me, I'm dangerous
I'm dangerous, so dangerous

[Verse 1]
She's the girl you see walking down the street
Holding her head high; unstoppable
She's confident, got a lazer eye
Swinging to her own beat in an A+ smile
She's a winner
Ooh, she is where it's at
She's the lion's meow, she can stop a whole crowd
She's heaven leant, cause I know they want her back

[Chorus]
She's a full time believer
She wakes up early everyday
She's a full time believer
She could care less what you say
She's a full time believer
Don't you get in her way

[Verse 2]
She combs her hair with her diamond eyes
Staring at her self cause she looks so fine
She can't help but show it, she's got that glow
And you know it, and I know it, and they know it
She's the rarest wine, an astrological find
And when she stretches on by she blows my mind
She don't need nobody
I only wish she was all mine

[Chorus]

She lays in bed with a real hard book
About a Chinese girl and a chance she took
She defied all odds, they re-wrote the law
Oh, her daddy would be proud if he were still around
She turns the light off and dreams of kings and gold
You can't touch her soul, or keep her under control
She's a leader to be, someday you're gonna see
She made me a

[Chorus 2]
A full time believer
Now I get up early everyday
I'm trying to be a full time believer
I'm hoping that for me you will pray
I wanna be a full time believer everyday

[Chorus]
I don't know
I don't know how it feels to be you
Though I try my best to understand what you're going through
I don't know how it feels to be you

[Verse 1]
Though I try to learn your steps
I don't know what makes you dance
I don't know what turns your gray skies back to blue
Though I try to see your side
And swallow all my pride
There is no way I can take a step in your shoes

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know
I don't know how it feels to be you
Though I try my best to understand what you're going through
I don't know how it feels to be you

[Verse 2]
So lay your cheeks upon my chest
Tell me everything that haunts your mind
I may not have all of the answers
But if you let me I can at least try
(Let me try, baby) Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
And when I'm sure I've had enough
The angels tell me just to wait awhile, woo-hoo, ooh, ooh
And baby, I am sorry
For being so hard on you sometimes, oh yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
But I don't know
I don't know how it feels to be you
Though I try my best to understand what you're going through
I don't know how it feels to be you, oh yeah yeah

[Bridge]
(Da-da-da-da) Oh, (Da-da-da-da) C'mon, baby, yeah
You know that I love you (Da-da-da-da)
You know that I try, baby (Da-da-da-da)
You know that I need you all my life, baby
I don't know
I still don't know how it feels to be you, oh, ho

[Verse 3]
And every day I ask myself
Are we really on the very same page? Whoa, hoo, hoo
And every day I wonder
Is there something that I'm supposed to say?
I wonder, baby
'Cause you and I are so in time
Maybe I'm just picking the wrong lines
'Cause I feel it in my heart
You know I adore you
But sometimes you can't even look me in the eye
Why? Why? Tell me why

[Chorus]
I don't know
I don't know how it feels to be you
Though I try my best to understand what you're going through
I don't know how it feels to be you, oh yeah, baby

[Outro]
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da) Ooh baby
C'mon, baby, c'mon
You know that I love you (Da-da-da-da)
You know that I try, baby (Da-da-da-da)
You know that I need you all my life, baby
I can't walk in your shoes (Da-da-da-da)
I can't sing your blues (Da-da-da-da)
You know I can't read your mind
I can't see life through your beautiful eyes
But you know that I love you (Da-da-da-da)
You know that I try, try, try (Da-da-da-da)
You know that I need you
Tell me why, baby
'Cause I don't know (I don't know)
I still don't know (But I'm trying, baby)
I don't know (I don't know)
I still don't know how it feels to be you (I don't know)

[Verse 1]
No complaints, no hour of need
I just wanna be free
I'm just trying to get by
Don't you worry baby, I'll be alright
I'm doing just fine
Sitting here, living on cloud nine
Living on cloud nine
I'm doing just fine living on cloud nine

[Verse 2]
Ain't got no worries, ain't got no friends
Living on cloud nine
He thinks she's this, and she thinks she's that
Delusional people living life too fast
So I'm taking my time
Sitting here living on cloud nine

[Verse 3]
Oh, it ain't a fantasy, baby
I'm just sitting here like a leaf upon a tree
Like a bird on a wire, I'm just taking my time
He's a dog, she's a pussycat
Could've ruled the world and stuff like that
Never enters my mind
Sitting here living on cloud nine

[Verse 4]
Oh, living on cloud nine
So if you ever get down
Come and sit here right next to me, baby
I'll be waiting for you
Living on cloud nine
Living on cloud nine
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sitting underneath the stars holding on to your hand
Wishing on a miracle and waiting on the sand
Falling leaves and fallen dreams, they get back up again
When you stare into my eyes and I never want it to end

[Chorus]
The sounds of the jungles and the blue of the sky
The earth underneath my feet and a family to call mine
Yeah, it's the little things that always get me by
Yeah, it's the little things that always make, always make me smile

[Verse 2]
First words and first heards, walking on the shore
Having friends stick by you when your back's against the wall
Memories and golden years, wrongs that I've made right
Dancing with the one you love on New Year's Eve at the stroke of midnight

[Chorus]
The sounds of the jungles and the blue of the sky
The earth underneath my feet and a family to call mine
Yeah, it's the little things that always get me by
Yeah, it's the little things that always make, always make me smile

[Outro]
Yeah, it's the little things
Yeah, it's the little things
Yeah, it's the little things
That always make me smile

[Verse 1]
What would I
What would I be without you loving me
I'd be bad, and sad, and lonely
Tying to get you back to me
I wake up every morning
The same things troubling my mind
I say to myself, "Come on, now
It's only just a matter of time"
But the cold winds blow
And the hard rains fall
And there's only one reason I can stand through it all

[Chorus]
What would I, what would I
What would I be without you loving me?

[Verse 2]
Simply put: I'm all messed up
Selfishness and guilt got in my blood
And I'm trying, baby
Trying to clean myself up
But without you I'm so blue, seeing red
Thinking bad, nightmares, morning sweats, foolish regrets

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Just when I think I can't make it
You kiss me on the lips and say "Don't you worry, baby"
You're the one, the only one
To silence the clouds and bring out the sun
The only one that makes me feel like I can be someone

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'd be bad, and sad, and lonley
I'd be so bad, and so sad, and so lonley
Only trying to get you back to me, baby
Trying to get you back to my love
Trying to get you back to my heart

Got a crew full of untamed dogs, and I'm thinkin' that I'm really bout to let 'em off the leashes (WOOF)
I'm scratchin the surface, the nigga with the million dollar verses (WHOO)
These rappers are worthless and all I really wanna do is piss 'em off on purpose

Givin' them a two piece with a biscuit and hell no I ain't talkin 'bout churches (OHHH)
Get nervous, get robbed of your valuables nigga like I'm snatching your purses
And I got a couple urges to clown on you niggas like a three ring circus

So keep my name up out your mouth before I close your curtains

[Paul Rosenberg]
Times Square

[Eminem]
In Times Square, I got blonde hair, I'm higher than con air
Rappers don't want to see me, I'll butt fuck Goldie Hawn bare
In a lawn chair, cause I'm there

[Paul Rosenberg]
Kurt Russell

[Eminem]
With Kurt Russell, saying, "Come here Goldie, you want my love muscle?"
I know you want it, I get blunted, then I
Kick these, freestyles just like whipped knees

[Paul Rosenberg]
Taxicab

[Eminem]
With a taxicab, I'll smack a bitch with a maxi pad
Where we going? Don't ask me dad
Leave me alone, I'm not trying, to even hear you
Dad, I hope you're fucking dying, off this porno mag
Yo, did you see my ad? Yo, wait a minute, did you see my ass?
Is what I meant to say, I meant to say a rhyme that goes this way is elementary
For the century, Slim Shady's is gonna be the illest

[Paul Rosenberg]
Flamingos

[Eminem]
What? Flamingos? My mother goes out and plays bingo
Every single day, at the bingo hall, that's why my dick is single, small
Didn't blow up, just don't give a what? A cuff?
Didn't blow up, just don't give a what? A cuff?

[Paul Rosenberg]
DT's fired

[Eminem]
But DT's fired, he's retired, he's not hired, yo
Plus I'm tired
Of busting and spitting this rhyme nonstop, I'm on top
Taking records to the pawnshop, stretch
Damn, see my big ick? Catch
Put a D in front of it, rappers don't want none of it
Coming with a ton of shit to spill, Slim Shady out, I get ill with the skill
Baby, aight baby, Slim Shady
Kick eighty million rhymes, till I'm older than Grady
Spilled gravy, all over my damn navy blue avi
Bye bye

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Up early, smokin' and plottin'
Looking at these lames being thankful I'm not them
This year couple million out the game
And you're wondering how I got them
I got it from going hard, I always stay on my job
Wanna get high you should come to my spot then
And smoke with some heavyweight niggas
Jets, Taylor Gang nigga losing's not a option
Now I'm always on the road
And everywhere I go people asking what I'm rocking
I tell em this is next year's fresh and this year's best
And some shit you niggas not in, so quit copyin'

[Interlude: Wiz Khalifa]
(Hahahaha)
Yeah man
You niggas got it confused, trying to do what we do
That's not the point
The point is for you to do you
It's a beautiful thing

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
I'm in the regal, you in a rut
Stuck, can't come up
Old, jealous niggas hatin' on us
Bitches is wishin' you'd shut the fuck up
I'm in the position, set my niggas up tough
What the fuck, just jump
Continents I promise it
I could go from bucks to billions in a minute
Made a split second decision
Executed with precision
I feel attention when I walk in the room
Old cuddly ass niggas go to hidin' they woman
Thinkin' I'mma walk up to 'em, but I don't do it
Baby girl know the big shit from the manure
I could help you shine like a jeweler
Candy paint make an old whip newer

[Verse 1]
As around the sun, the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing, will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

[Refrain]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

[Verse 2]
Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day?
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always
As today, I know I'm living, but tomorrow
Could make me the past, but that, I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

[Refrain]
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Did you know you're loved by somebody?)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (I'll be loving you forever)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)

[Bridge]
We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truth and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great-grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you

[Refrain]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Be loving you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Loving you)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Loving you)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Loving you)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Loving you)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Be loving you)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Loving you)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Loving you)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Now ain't that loving you?)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Ain't that loving you?)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (And I've got to say always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Always)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Always)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Always)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you

[Intro]
Funkmaster Flex night, yeah, yo
Put your hands up if you feel like
You a salamander (Me, me, me, me), you ain't no human
You a salamander (I'm a salamander)
Put your hands up if you feel like
I'm all Red Bull and coffee right now, so I'm finna spaz
(Feel like) You a motherfucking form of energy
Hargh
You ain't even, these
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Electrons, these bones just keeping it all together
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
But you full of spirits, look, uh

[Verse]
American born, welcome to my stomping grounds (What's good)
In point breeze, where I used to walk around my father's house (Oh)
Older brother used to always say I was adopted
Convinced I'm a Russian foster child my family forgot about (Damn)
Curious toddler, such imagination (Imagination)
Didn't have the patience to be top of the class at my graduation (Fuck that shit)
Little pervert infatuated with masturbation
Couldn't wait to bust a nut, watching porn, in love with sluts (Titties)
Rusty trumpets and such, disgusting sleezy shit
12-year-old sexual deviant, got my penis licked
In seventh grade (Uh-huh,) thought I was a man now (Uh-huh)
Couldn't understand how my parents still thought I was a little kid (Okay)
I had the mind of a 109-year-old elder man
The passion of the Christ and the memory of an elephant (Whoa)
Used to wonder all 'bout heaven and hell
Witnessed death at a young age, I said to myself
We all mortals (Whoa,) we leave this world into eternal life
Other kids of different religions wonder which person's right (You never know)
Worry 'bout your fate, no separation of church and state
You be good, never break the law, you'll see the pearly gates (Huaaah)
Fuck philosophical, back to the diabolical
Binoculars couldn't see my skills, I'm way too ill for that (I'm way to ill for that)
I feel my raps will be underrated and under-appreciated
Until I (*Click-clack) pow, blow my brains out (*Gunshot*)
I need to stop paying attention to opinion shit
I rather be the pen that come and sign your death certificate (Certificate)
Kill your career if you give me a year (Yep)
The X Factor, whip my dick out, give Britney the spear (Haha)
Got some shit for your ears, it's something to be excited 'bout
Here to give you industry critics some shit to write about (Yeah)
Me or you, who got the nicer house? (Hmm)
You got a daughter of age? Might have to pipe her now (Uh)
If Sean Price is Mike Tyson now (Bitch)
I might as well turn my life around and check these fools like Nike town (Yep)
What would have happened if Lance had never biked a mile?
I was blind, but I'm seeing like a psychic now (Uh-huh)
I know the future like Atlanta (Lanta!)
I knock it out the park like my name was Joey Randa (How?)
Ball like (What?) Miguel Cabrera (Okay) or Garciaparra (Okay)
Sail the French Riviera and my camera panorama (Woo)
This radiation, sample the gamma (Gamma)
I look like money, Willy Whips looks like a panda, word (Tahaha)
Sinister, administer bits of comic life
You bullshittin', homie, go and get your economics right (Money)

[Chorus]
How many MCs wanna come and test me and my technique?
Weaving through this traffic on my jet ski (Don't be mad, I'm way better)
Looks can be deceiving and my raps are so friendly (Ah, they're so nice)
Oh, yes, my raps are so friendly (So polite)
How many MCs who wanna come and test me and my technique
Weaving through this traffic on a jet ski (Hey, you suck my dick)
I know that looks can be deceiving and my raps are so friendly
(Very nice!) So you MCs commend me

[Outro]
Please tell me I'm good, makes me feel better
Witcha little make pretend-steez
Yeah, you ain't real
You bend the knees and then deez
Nuts are in your mouth bitch (Oh shit)
Fucking on your couch bitch (Oh shit)
Bustin' on your mothers comber button blouse bitch (Woo, damn)
Trying to get rid of me? This ain't Auschwitz
Wow, wow, wow, that's a little...
I pound bitches in their ass 'til I got brown dick (Ou, ass fucking, ass fucking)
You surrounded (Oh, you surrounded)
Do you know of satan and denounce his
Doings? (Do you?) Ruined, I'm out this (Do you?)
You don't count my vote, you better count this
Biatch

I wanna be myself tonight
Can you get me bodied?

Wanna party, wanna dance
Wanna be myself tonight, I'm bodied

[Bridge]
Baby, all I want is to let it go
Ain't no worries, oh
We can dance all night
Get me bodied
That means come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
And your body's touching my body
All I need is to let it be
Ain't no worry, no
Boy, dance with me
Feel my body
Don't stop, just come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
With your body touching my body
All I'm thinking 'bout is getting bodied
Ain't no shame 'cause I gotta get mine
I swing my hair and kick off my shoes
Come here, boy, let me work on you

[Chorus]
I ain't worried, doin' me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight gettin' bodied

[Verse 1: Currensy]
Money in the floor, weed in a bowl
On the couch, life like Ox
Big TV, nigga, big ass remote
Motion sensors all over my house
For investigative ass hoes
That's waiting for me to pass out
So they can tiptoe all over my home
Woah, pump your brakes, slow your roll
I got cake, bread in loaves
State to state, hit that road
Hit that bank when I get home
Hit that lot tomorrow morn'
I think they got the one I want
Top I drop like my ex ho
Top get dropped like I let it go
Fool I close Ferrari doors
My driveway is a horse show
Smoke my weed, eat my breakfast
My bitch read our horoscopes
Out loud

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Talk about what's gon' get done to a nigga, until I run in to niggas
Might dress kinda funny to niggas, I got more money than niggas
These niggas lackin positive influence so I'm son'ing these niggas
You niggas more Calogero I'm more Sunny than niggas
That's why I got a couple of cribs and everyone one of 'em owned
Shoulda had my Ferrari by now, but had to get my mother a home
Just bought a few pounds the other day and everyone one of 'em gone
Just counting my chains, tomorrow I'mma put everyone one of 'em on
You niggas must be trippin' yeah that's a Benz, nigga what's the edition
(Niggas jealous cause they see me gettin' money)
See me and Spitta in this bitch, they like yeah niggas must be twistin'
(So much swag and you niggas looking bummy)
And we been giving swag but on the real that wasn't the intention
(So much swag make a nigga wish he was me)
It's kinda funny cause a nigga thought I was being different
(I'm getting high laughing at you niggas cause it's funny)

[Intro]
Damn, that was so good
I wanna buy him a short set

[Verse 1]
I’ma be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store
I’ma be like a waffle cone that’s drippin' down to the floor
The way you do it for me, I can’t lie (Lie!)
About to be up in the mall all night (Yes!)
Whatever I get, you putting it on (Yes!)
Don’t give me no lip, let mama do it all

[Chorus]
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
Your suga, give mama some suga mama
Suga ma-ma, ma-ma

Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
New whip, new heavy on my waist
'Cause I’m a suga ma-ma-ma-ma
I’m your suga mama (Suga mama, hey, hey)
Sit on mama lap, hey!
Come sit on mama lap, hey!
Come sit on mama lap, hey, hey!
Come sit on mama lap, hey!

[Verse 2]
It’s so good to the point that I’d
Do anything to keep you home (On the phone)
Baby, what you want me to buy?
My accountant’s waiting on the phone (On the phone)
Just the thought of making love to you (You!)
Dropping everything, that’s what I’ll do (I'll do!)
Whatever I get, you putting it on (Oh!)
Now, take it off while I watch you perform

[Chorus]
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be

[Bridge]
And I’ve always been the type to take care of mine
I know just what I’m doing
Don’t you worry it’s cool and everything is steady
Got you on my taxes already, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I promise I won’t let no bills get behind
'Cause every touch, every kiss and hug
You best believe it’ll be on time
Suga mama, mama, mama, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
Your suga, give mama some suga mama (I give you all my money, baby)
Suga ma-ma, ma-ma (Turn me out, boy, something crazy)

New whip, new heavy on my waist (Don't forget to give mama some sugar)
'Cause I’m a suga ma-ma-ma-ma (Some sugar, when you walk out that door)

Sit on mama lap, hey, hey!
Come sit on mama lap, hey!
Come sit on mama lap, hey, hey!
Come sit on mama lap, hey!

[Verse 1]
I wish I could believe you, then I'll be alright
But now everything you told me really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Lovin' you was easy once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied

[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

[Verse 2]
Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing (Mean a thing), no
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you, and I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you, I know it ain't the same (It ain't the same)
And it's all because you lied

[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time (Hard time)
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this (Forget this)
But I'm much too full of resentment (I'm much too full of resentment)
I may never understand why
I'm doin' the best that I can, and I
I tried and I tried to forget this (Forget this)
But I'm much too full of resentment

[Bridge]
(You lied) I'll always remember feelin' (You lied)
Like I was no good (You lied)
Like I couldn't do it for you (You lied)
Like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than ever (You lied)
More than my own life (You lied)
But that part of me I gave you (You lied)
It was sacrificed (Sacrificed)
And it's all because you lied

[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like (I can't go on and pretend like)
I tried and I tried to forget this (I tried and I tried and I tried)
But I'm too damn full of resentment

[Outro]
I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been ridin' with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?
I know you're probably thinkin', "What's up with B?"
I been cryin' for too long, what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm cryin', can't stop cryin', can't stop cryin'
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes (You lied)
(You lied) And see she's had half of me (You lied)
How could you lie? (You lied)

[Chorus]
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo' average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick

[Verse 1]
Everybody know that face
Even with her head low, they still know that shape
When she come through the club, people take they place
Chicks throwin' handcuffs 'cause they knowin' that they man ain't safe

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she the one switchin' up flows
If it's four door, two gotta go
Chicks like, what kinda jeans is those?
And fellas watchin' like, please, get low

[Chorus]
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo' average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick

[Verse 2]
Everybody can't do this
Some ain't gotta clue till they hear me spit
Achoo, I spew 'cause yo' girl is sick
Is it the change or the hips--you can't tell, but you know it's thick

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she the one switchin' up flows
If it's four door, two gotta go
Chicks like, what kinda jeans is those?
And fellas watchin' like, please, get low

[Chorus]
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo' average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick

[Bridge]
For this type of girl it's not that hard
You see her 'cause she too far gone
Though they pray and pray for her downfall
Why they gotta be so envious?
Doin' what it do fit to be a plus
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Back up, back up

[Chorus]
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo' average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Back it up now
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Intro]
OMG, you done lost yo' motherfreakin' mind!

[Chorus]
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind

[Verse 1]
I could shed so many tears
But I won't let you see me crying
Now it all adds up
Even the numbers
Let me exactly hear
But you you wonder
I know how my mama felt
Getting ran over
But this ain't a cycle here
This one is over
Something told me to check my time
If I'm the one that's always crying

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that it's over
I can move on from here
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
I could've told ya
It's all in the atmosphere
I can't control ya
But I'm not a pushover no more

[Chorus]
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind

[Verse 2]
You could shed so many tears
But you won't let me see you crying
If she really loves ya
Than that's what ya need to build
I'm more than your woman
I know you don't love her
I painted it for ya
But you picked the colors
At night you'll get over
Yeah, like you will never
I trusted you through all these years
And I'm the one that's always crying

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that it's over
I can move on from here
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
The melody told ya
Exactly the pain I feel
Reap what you sow, boy
I'm not a pushover

[Chorus]
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (You lost it)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind

[Bridge]
I always knew you were counterfeit
That's what you get
I see you crying
Excuses after excuses
Pretending that we exclusive
I stuck around all these years
I dried and cried all your tears
I trusted you despite my fears
And I refuse to keep on trying

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that it's over
I can move over
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
You just confirmed it
This ain't a warning
Been living a double life
You must have lost yo mind

[Chorus]
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
(You crazy!)
You must've just lost yo mind
(You crazy!)
They told me 'bout all the lies
(You lost yo mind!)
I took you back all those times
(Tell ya one more time!)
You must have lost yo mind!
(You lost yo mind!)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine
(It was not mine!)
Many earrings must I find?
(Hey!)
You must've just lost yo mind
You just lost yo mind

[Verse 1]
Baby, I see you, that look in your eyes
Hips that keep shaking, mysterious style
Exotically tempting, familiar to me
That Creole sexy, it's all over me

[Pre-Chorus]
So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it Creole
So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it Creole

[Chorus]
(Creole!) When I look real good
(Creole!) Whenever I talk real good
(Creole!) Whenever I bounce real good
Just in case you wanna know, that's your secret
(Creole!) When she look that good
(Creole!) Whenever she talk that good
(Creole!) Whenever she bounce that good
Ladies, if you wanna know, this your secret
Creole!
Bad, bad, bad, bad yellow bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad red bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad brown bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad to the bone

[Verse 2]
For all of my brown bones
That make a good broth
And all of my red bones that make a good sauce
The yellow bone flavor is familiar to me
Mix it all together; it's a delicacy

[Pre-Chorus]
So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it Creole
So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it Creole

[Chorus]
(Creole!) When I look real good

Just in case you wanna know, that's your secret

Ladies, if you wanna know, this your secret
Creole!
Bad, bad, bad, bad yellow bone

Bad, bad, bad, bad brown bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad to the bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad yellow bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad red bone

Bad, bad, bad, bad to the bone

[Pre-Chorus]
So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it Creole
So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it Creole

[Chorus]
(Creole!) When I look real good

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Sports coupe spoiler
Sipping on a bottled water
Dead serious like the fourth quarter
Niggas can't get the shit, it's on back order
Holla at the waiting list, I'm already sporting 'em
Bout to give away the shits, can't get bored of the money spending
High performance exhaust system
Straight bossing, more than often
Nigga I'm always getting it, straight Jet living
I got all my cars, all my weed, all my women
Valeting exotics at mafia style dinners
Ducking pictures as we toast to getting richer
It was all planned out for us to stand out
The have-nots have it all, without accepting handouts, dog
Twisting the top off the big jar
Higher than a...

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Niggas out they rabid ass mind
Thinking I ain't gon' try to get as much money as I can make this year
You must be on some hardcore drugs
I'm just flipping through magazines and rolling them Raws up
My red cup filled up with gin
That's my gang and they destined to win
In this thing and you better spend
Give good brain, you should let her in
Leave your cigars, joints already rolled
In the morn' look at a Polaroid of it
Wake up feeling way better than you ever did
With the nigga that you was with
And now you got the nigga all upset because of it
Would call my phone but he know that I don't play that
Send some real niggas where he stay at
Made it quite clear, take ya lips put 'em right here

[Intro]
I love to love you, baby (To love you, baby)
I love to love you, baby (To love you, baby)
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling sexy
I wanna hear you say my name, boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame
I'm feelin' kind of n-a-s-t-y
I might just take you home with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
The vibe is just takin' over me
I start feelin' so crazy, babe
Lately, I feel a funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy, babe

[Chorus]
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We gon' turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

[Verse 2]
You're so sexy
Tonight, I am all yours, boy
The way your body moves across the floor
I'm feelin' kind of n-a-s-t-y
I might just take you home with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
The vibe is just takin' over me
I start feelin' so crazy, babe
Lately, I feel a funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy, babe

[Chorus]
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We gon' turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl

I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

[Bridge]

I love to love you, baby (I love to love you, baby)

[Chorus]
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We gon' turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We gon' turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

[Intro: Big Boi]
Pure players
Pure players

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Slowly as Sir Luscious step up like a Q-Dawg
A-town's up, deuces down it's the new call
And you can dial 1-888-cut-something
I'm your kinky operator when you wanna fuck something
Ain't no dial tones just milestones of pleasure to reach
To each his own, I'm a stone cold Aquarian freak
Humanitarian, barbarian, but under the sheets
It's the player from the point
And your girl from the D

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Are you infatuated with me?
I could end your curiosity
If you don't think I'm too rude
Here's your chance to make your move
I sit and wait for nobody
People say that my, my style is so crazy
I think you like it, baby
Do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With a hip hop star
Bamboos on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby, let me know if you wanna ride with a
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Do I blow you away?
Do I stimulate your mind?
Would you taste my love if I give you time?
I have none to waste with you
I guess you can say
My style is so crazy
I think you like it, baby
Do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With a hip hop star
Bamboos on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby, let me know if you wanna ride with a
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

[Break: Beyoncé]
Undress me, undress me
You can come
Come, baby, undress me

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers
The girls all pause, got them drippin' down they sugar walls
Aw naw! Getting to the nappy root
Knocking boots in stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!
A cool type of fellow, mellow got the gold medal
Never settle for less my rose petal
Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! Spit game!
Venom to get it up in 'em, let me "p" pop that thang
First check her brain to see if she's sane
Deranged or strange or crazy as hell
You never can tell these days
Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins, man!

[Break: Sleepy Brown]
The way I feel
Ooh girl, I know its 'bout to be
Me all over you
And damn girl, you all over me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With a hip hop star
Bamboos on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby, let me know if you wanna ride with a
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

[Intro]
Ooh, baby
Ooh, baby

[Verse 1]
I love the way you make me feel
It slows down time
Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights
You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me lets me know you're mine

[Chorus]
I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name
And there's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you 'cause you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy, I'd rather be with you (Boy, I'd rather be with you)

[Verse 2]
I love the way you look at me
Stare into my eyes
What do they say to you?
Boy, don't be shy
Tonight's the night your fantasies will all come true
I am your woman
I belong to you, whoa
There is nothing I won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when I'm alone with you
I'm holding back nothing
Saving it all for you
Baby, I love making love to you
It's like a high, I can't come down from you

[Chorus]
I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name (Scream my name)
And there's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way (Feel this way)
I'd rather be with you 'cause you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy, I'd rather be with you (Boy, I'd rather be with you)

[Bridge]
I'd rather be with you, oh, yeah
Boy, I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, oh, yeah
Boy, I'd rather be with you

[Chorus]
I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name (Scream it louder. baby)
And there's no other man that gives me what I want (Woo)
And makes me feel this way (Make me feel good)
I'd rather be with you 'cause you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy, I'd rather be with you (Boy, I'd rather be with you)
I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name
And there's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you 'cause you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy, I'd rather be with you (Boy, I'd rather be with you)

[Intro]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

[Chorus]
I said yes to your number
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
I said yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say no, not tonight
You actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)

[Verse 1]
You was on the wall
I was with my crew
You was watchin' me, baby
I was watchin' you
Slowly, you walked over
I maintained my cool
You said hello to me
I said hello to you
You asked me where I'm from
I asked you what you do
You somehow intrigued me
I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye, I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night, so I gave my number to you

[Chorus]
I said yes to your number
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
I said yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say no, not tonight
You actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)

[Verse 2]
Certainly, you can call me, baby
I love to hear from you
Yes, of course, you can come and see me, boy
Wanna get to know you more
Sure, I'm feelin' you
"No, baby, not yet, we can't take that next step"
Why you getting so upset?
Boy, you act as though I never told you yes before
You are so ungrateful, mm-mm-mmm

[Verse 3]
You was at my house
I was sittin' on my couch
You was really buggin', so I
Told you to get out
I had been misjudging you
You had a lotta nerve
You too damn old to be so immature
I hope you learn
You said I move too slow
I showed you to the door
You said you'd call me later
I said don't call no more
It is cool if you can't wait for me
I'm glad you let me know
'Cause you showed me your true face, baby
The first time I said no

[Chorus]
I said yes to your number
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
I said yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say no, not tonight
You actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes before)

[Outro]
I said yes to your number
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)

[Chorus]
You've got me (You've got me)
You've got me (You've got me)
You've got me (You've got me)
You've got me speechless

[Verse 1]
Where you been, baby?
Waited for you all day
Waited for you to use the key
That opens my place
My heart starts trembling
As I hear your footsteps pace
Lock opened, doorknob turned
There appears your face

[Pre-Chorus]
Going out my head, I think I'm losin' all my mind
Drive me crazy, burning candles, making love all night
Feels so strange, it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms, lost for words
You've got me

[Chorus]
You've got me (You've got me)
You've got me (You've got me)
Ohh
You've got me (You've got me)
You've got me speechless

[Verse 2]
Laying so closely
I feel your skin rubbin' and touchin' me
Only sweat between us
Feelin' you kissin' and pleasin' me
I rub your back
I kiss your neck
I know that you love when we touch like that
I can feel you need me
Feels so good to me
Feels so good to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Going out my head, I think I'm losin' all my mind
Drive me crazy, burning candles, making love all night
Feels so strange, it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms, lost for words
You've got me (You've got me)

[Chorus]
You've got me (You've got me)
You've got me (You've got me)
You've got me (You've got me)
You've got me speechless

[Outro]
Yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes
Speechless, all I can say is
Yes, yes, yes
All I can say is
Yes, yes, yes, yes, ooh
Kiss me
Hold me
You've got me
Speechless

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Year-round we them niggas
You seasonal, temporary living
Your run'll be done in a minute
You are not infinite
Bitches can tell the difference, they know better than to smoke with ya
Back up a lil' bit, you'll get the whole picture
So much sicker than them niggas, I'm coughing they just got hiccups
KC lights, roll bars on my Chevy pickup
Off-road style, lift kit, heavy duty springs
Stomper tires get it done when the time is crunch like sit-ups
To the challenge I rise, Lamborghini doors
'85 Countach never seen a real road
From the showroom floor to my seven car garage
Got a storage 'cross town with like seven more rides
Tucked inside - that Grand Theft Auto life
Rolling up in my safe house I'm looking down
Done it by my design, refusing to comprimise

[Hook]
Mestizo eyes
Mestizo eyes

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
They saying shit changed cause shit changed
Not just the horses in my motor, but the cost for me to show up
I'm a boss, and my whole team fly private
Black cars when we roll up, quarter pounds when we blow up
Hit the ground running
My watch new cause a nigga sound bumping
And ya girlfriend leaving you cause she just wanna be around something
Like playing Xbox and wearing weed socks, speeding 'round stunting
Orderin' thousand dollar room service, rolling weed up by the onion
Ooo I got it made, but I ain't make it on my own
Who would've thought a Pittsburgh nigga would go and buy an LA home
Rolling up papers, turning down favors
All these fake kushes, I got my own flavor
Homie that ain’t KK in that brand new bag
Got it made to make that brand new crib
Need a whip to match that brand new car
Thinking maybe Maybach brand new insides
Everything black, young ass nigga blowing OG in the back
Last time you heard from me, I was rolling bud up
Looking dope in my brand new clothes
Eyes closed like someone told 'em to shut up

[Hook]

[Refrain]
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop

[Verse 1]
Don't let me hear you say
Life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
(Come get up, my baby)

[Chorus 1]
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

[Verse 2]
Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
(Come get up, my baby)

[Chorus 2]
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

[Verse 3]
Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car twenty foot long
(Come get up, my baby)
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day
I believe, oh Lord, I believe all the way
(Come get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

[Chorus 1]
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

[Bridge]
Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

[Chorus 2]
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Broke the rubber
Busted a nut up in your mother
So how you feel about having another little brother
Nasty motherfucker
Talking like a trucker
Snatch your bitch up out of your track
I Smack her up and fuck her
Always talk shit high
Smoking chocolate Thai
So y'all can die
Just by walking by giving an awkward eye
I've lost my motherfreaking marbles
Smelling like a brewery
Jewelling at the way your jewellery sparkles
Head full of charcoals
Smoked out brain particles
Burning holes in clothes articles
A retarded fool since I started school
Burned the weed before I learned to read
Disregarded rules
Skip the classes to blaze the blunt ashes
Kissing front dashes and smashing up cars like stunt crashes
Hall passes for restrooms
Chewing mushrooms
Doing rush fumes in the lunch room
Looking nervous
Liquor in my thermos
Hung with hermits who carry guns without permits
Staring at the bitch with firm tits
Jacking off
Aiming straight for both lips when my sperm spits

[Intro: Tyga]
Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up {*3X*}
Twist it all up! (Remix baby~!)

[Lil Wayne]
I'm, about to go dumb
I'm about to go dumb, like Fred Sanford's son
Ah-um, I'm about to go coconuts
And when it comes to money man, I'm about to go Oprah
And you ain't got to vote for us cause we ain't never runnin'
So you better get back like we ain't never buntin'
Yeah, I put the lime in the open blunt
And twist it all up baby I am not the sober one
I'm from the jungle where the lion ate the cobra
And I get money, got a no-money phobia
Uh-huh, Tyga-Tyga what it do
Man, we are flyer than the pigeon in the coop
Man, I am hotter than a nigga in a suit
In the middle of the summer, and I bang like a drummer
Wayne's that nukka, holla at ya gualla
Make the money chase the shadow, call it dollar after dollar

[Hook: Tyga]
Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up {*3X*}
Twist it all up! Twist it all up!

[Hook Two: Tyga]
Coconut juice got me real loose, like
Got me leanin' three thousand proof, like
Coconut juice all on the dance FLOOR
Fellas let your ladies GO ladies let your fellas GO

[Tyga]
In low, +No Introduction+
WAIT, was that an introduction?
Fo-forget it, I stu-stu-stu-stutter just so you can get it
My diamonds so bright, I get picture tickets to tit it
No, Im lyin', right here the Tyga, no Lion
Tyga flowed, humanater, a butter roll tale, you do this slow
Smokings on me, don't touch me, still blow
Cause she won't be missed like Ben Gorden free throws
Uh-uh, Its the cheap coal from marciano
And I'm in the game, but my fame on the d-low
Me no, speak no, broke money english
Loyal I'll be forever in a lake like seaglus
Jesus, couldn't even save me from the visa
So I keep ha, historic names in my James
Ben Frank, name tag be Tyga man
Oh, you mad cause the chase, stylin' with straight Tyga man

[Hook One]

[Rich Boy]
I'mma get some flames over the horn of artagrab
Bitch ain't a buff, until you have a whole sale
I'll take the coconut juice and mix it with a old goose
Hutchy hoot-a-hoot fryin' some Russian red kook
My livin' ATM, wishin' my shit money grain
I should have bought an office, I went and bought a ring
Instead I ride dirty, said I shoulda bought the ring
Instead of coconut juice it I mixed it with the lean
AKA the rich one, Cartier yeah the Benjamin
If you ain't a bitch, why the fuck you ain't that feminine
When I twisted it up, she licked it up, the whole coconut
Thats it, the whole coconut

[Hook One]

[Hook Three: Tyga]
Everybody in the party
Hold your cup high move your body
If you twist it, scream it loudly
Ay, ay, ay, HEY! Ay, ay, ay, HEY!

[Verse 1]
I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff on my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty 'cause you just got paid

[Chorus]
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
Please stay

[Verse 2]
You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you, baby, you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions for a sack full of cheques
You've made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex

[Chorus]
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh yeah
Ooh, stay for a day
Ooh yeah
Don't you dare
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Woo!
Woo!
Oh yeah
Weed lacer
'97 burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary
Had to ditch the Mercury Tracer
I'm on some Loc shit
Some fed up wit the 'being broke' shit
I'm not to joke with
Bitch, I don't sell crack
I smoke it
Having a coke fit and going through withdrawals daily
Shoot up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter Hailie
My brains dusted
I'm disgusted at all my habits
Too many aspirin tablets
Empty medicine cabinets
Losing battles to wack rappers because I'm always too blunted
Walking up in the cypher smoking
Talking about, "Who want it"
Thug and a crook
Every drug in the book
I've done it
My 9's at your brain
Is that your chain
Run it
Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavour
Aggressive nature's got me sticking you for your progressive pager
Spectacular
Battle rap manufacturer
Stole your mama's Acura
Wrecked it and sold it back to her
Cruise in Nike jackets
Escaped from psychiatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me
"I might be back quick"
So barricade your entrance
Put up some extra fences
A woman beater
Wanted for repeated sex offences
Chasing dips
Take them on long vacation trips
Kidnapping them and trapping them in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips
Slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Got you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with
Mama don't you cry
Your son's too far gone
I'm so high
I don't even know what label I'm on
I'm messed up
I feel just like an overworked plumber
I'm sick of the crap
What's Jack Kevorkian's phone number
If I gave you my love
I tell you what I'd do

[Intro]
Sweet baby

[Chorus]
I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of on-my-own
Won't you help me girl
Just as soon as you can

[Verse 1]
People say that I've found a way
To make you say that you love me
Hey baby, you didn't go for that
It's a natural fact
That I wanna come back
Show me where it's at, baby

[Chorus]
I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of on-my-own
Won't you help me girl
Soon as you can

[Verse 2]
I guess you know that I, uh, I love you so
Even though you don't want me no more
Hey hey hey hey, I'm cryin' tears
All through the years
I'll tell ya like it is
Honey, love me if you will

[Bridge]
Yeah baby
Tired of being alone here by myself, now
I tell ya, I'm tired baby
I'm tired of being all wrapped up late at night
In my dreams, nobody but you, baby
Sometimes I wonder (Oooooh)
If you love me like you say you do
You see baby, I been thinkin' about it, yeah
I been, I been wantin' to get next to you baby
Ya see, sometimes I hold my arms, I say mmmm hmmm hmmm (Oooh)
Yeah baby
Meeting you has proven to me
To be my greatest dream, yeah

[Outro]
Tired, baby
Yeah, you don't know what I'm talkin' about
Sometimes late at night I get to wonderin' about you baby
Oh baby, baby
I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of being alone…

[Hook]
Don’t want nobody to die
Don’t want to have to ride but in this game
I guess that’s just the way, I guess that’s just the way
Have it your way

[Verse 1]
It’s gonna be slow singing, flower bringing
Gat clinging, bat swinging, bullets flyin’, niggas dyin’
Mom’s cryin, faggots really don’t want it
Lead coming, blood gushin from ya arms, legs, head and stomach
I felt the hatred, cause when I turned around like the Matrix
Comin for me, an array of bullets headin dead for me
First the one, and then came the two and three and four
Five, six, seven, shots from a MAC-11
Platinum producer killed by haters tonight on Channel 7
He do beats for 2Pac, now coming out the spring from Heaven
Ya know my piece is, hotter than grease is
With no wrong way to eat ya face like a Reese’s
Seem like the second I get some shine
Niggas quit they fuckin’ job so they can hate full time
So, gimme the gat, I hit em wit that
Cock back, blat blat
Let me tell you niggas something familiar
Broke niggas don’t want war, man I’ll kill ya

[Hook]
Don’t want nobody to die
Don’t want to have to ride but in this game
I guess that’s just the way, I guess that’s just the way
Have it your way

[Verse 2]
Oh oh, I get it, this year, niggas don’t dance
But just rock bulletproof hats and steel pants
Now everybody got a gun in they hand, yeah bitch nigga run to ya man
Street sweeper aerials fuck where they land
Niggas close they eyes and don’t aim like My bitch when she pop champagne
Bottles, I tell you bout them damn models
They can’t cook for a lick, but they’ll lick a dick and swallow
Look I been living my life, Bullshittin’ when I write songs
Especially talkin’ bout havin’ ice on and I could barely keep my lights on
Niggas played me like Ty-Son, trying to take my light songs
Cuse they know I’d knock niggas the fuck out the box
Full Glocks, the fuck out the box, cocked
Who the fuck tryin to box right now?
I feel like, my whole city on my back
I feel like, next year, my whole city on the map

[Hook]
Don’t want nobody to die
Don’t want to have to ride but in this game
I guess that’s just the way, I guess that’s just the way
Have it your way

[Verse 3]
I’m from, Chi town, where the raps the realest
The tracks gorilla, we got the millas and we’ll be at ya scrilla
Close your doors, lock your windows
We be at them execs for them back end checks
Now, We on the court, and we got next up
Now, This summer we got benz, we got Lex truck
It’s kinda like trading places huh? I never plug
But I’m guilty by association, so gangstas show me love
For that track I did, yeah I know, the rest the album wack as shit
Ooooh, its Kanye to the with that platinum shit, ya punk bitch

[Hook]
Don’t want nobody to die
Don’t want to have to ride but in this game
I guess that’s just the way, I guess that’s just the way
Have it your way

Sweeter than sugar, sweeter than love
Sweeter than sugar, sweeter than love
Sweeter than sugar
Sweeter than sugar

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Follow me as I get high, and ride
In the car I just bought, but I prolly never drive
I heard it's easier that way
My weed is gettin' stronger my Visa is gettin' straight
My whole team is gettin' cake
Call us leaders in the game, niggas follow cause they need us
Ain't just wannabe's they want to be us
Thats why they throw our gang up when they see us
Rollin' planes up, hear them niggas who talk the same
But they ain't us
Took my success and I shared it with everyone next to me
So they sayin' that we came up
Got some fire weed and some niggas down to smoke
So we all gon' be high as can be
At that point you aspire to be
Hermes belt, I'm the flyest degree

[Sample: Bobbi Humphrey]
Sweeter than sugar
Sweeter than sugar

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
The view from my lair
Will have a married woman playin' truth or dare
At my crib cleanin' rooms in there
So many shoes, you think I buy my shoes a pair
A fuckin' fool, highed up with Pittsburgh pimpin'
Ever since my old crib, splittin' ounces
Goin' half on Chinese food
To flights Hawaiian, a two week cruise excursion
Far from the madness splurging
Learnin' 'bout scuba gear, sting ray sea urchins
Do it for my old heads
Same way they would've done for the OG's before them
They like, "how thick is your skin?"
I been through Hell and back fillin' up the tank for another spin
All the way out there goin' in, cash pourin' in
Gas pedals to the floor in 'em vintage wheel historian
Open the garage door finna bring another in

[Sample: Bobbi Humphrey]
Sweeter than sugar
Sweeter than sugar, sweeter than love
Sweeter than sugar, sweeter than love
Sweeter than sugar, sweeter than love

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Higher than you ever been in your motherfuckin' life nigga
Without even tryin'

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
The game got a grip, never slip
Can tell by the way I got my hands on it
Started at the bottom but now my money is so motherfuckin' tall I can stand on it
Ain't just happened homie I planned on it
You think you better don't just talk 'bout it put some grands on it
Sleep in Cali woke up in France on 'em
Took the life I live chose talk about it now my fans on it
Now is Dior all on my pants homie
Don't know where I'm going my schedule full so I can't call it
So much weed you see all them grams fallin'
Rollin' so much up that my fingers startin' to cramp on me
Hear you talkin' 'bout what I am
On top of that shit you sayin' you gotta say rich as fuck when you mention us
I get a hold of the bombest weed and I twist it up
Them Cadillacs in line out front just to pick us up

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
I woke up to a joint, cartoons and cereal
A coupe with zero miles and oatmeal interior
These chicks diggin' my style
I'm sincerely superior to whatever your doing right now
And whatever your plannin' to get into
I'm just clockin' my miles
On the road to these riches, these hoes wavin' and smilin'
But I don't pay 'em no attention, I'm all about my empire
We just trying to get bigger, we multiplying in size
These snakes trying to get with us, they lookin' for the co-sign
But a real nigga don't give a fuck, I'm too busy gettin' high
You can hitch a ride on another truck
Now excuse me as I kiss the sky
Peace signs to baby girl before she try to kiss me bye
She miss me like the sun in her eyes, can't catch a pop fly
Kush castles in the sky
The only hassle is when I smash and go she want to cry
I get dressed she wanna know where I'm going and why
Can't deal with that

[Verse 1]
Sitting here
Wasting my time for you
And I'm not too crazy about the idea
Of having nothing to do, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
Now it's time for a change
The idea might sound strange, oh
There's no time to waste

[Chorus]
Let's get married today (Let's get married)
Gonna get married (Let's get married)
Married today (Let's get married)
I love you anyway, oh my (Let's get married)

[Verse 2]
There must be something wrong
Or something here
That I don't understand
Oh, you don't believe me
You say you love me
Why don't you give me your hand?
Oh baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me tell you one thing
I'm tired of playing around
A girl in every town
I want to settle down
And stop foolin' around

[Chorus]
(Let's get married)
I've got to stop foolin' around
(Let's get married)
Stop foolin' around
(Let's get married)
You don't believe me but I want to stop
Foolin' around
(Let's get married)
Let me say it

[Bridge]
I didn't mean to say all the things I said, oh no
The way I felt in my heart
It came out that way
Let me tell you one thing
Don't want to say anything to drive you away

[Chorus]
Let's get married today (Let's get married)
Hey (If you love me, let's get married)
Alright
Wanna get married (Let's get married)
Let's get married today

[Breakdown]
Might as well
Might as well
'Cause take you in my arms and hold you
Take you in arms and squeeze you
Take you in my arms and love you every night
Just make everything alright, alright
I wanna soothe you baby, want to soothe you baby, want to soothe you baby, want to soothe you baby
I want to love you baby, want to love you baby, want to understand you baby

I'll tell you, will you talk to me?
I'll tell you you can talk to me
Try to understand your lovin' ways
Try to just let me, let me, let me
Soothe you baby, let me soothe you baby, I can soothe you baby, I can, I can wipe all your tears away
Wipe all your tears away
Girl, wipe all your tears away
Wipe all your tears away
Wipe all your tears away

Hey hey, hey hey
You can know me
You don't believe me
Ow, ow, ow, ow
Ow, ow, ow, ow
Let's get married today
I found out I didn't, I don't love nobody anyway
I really really love you baby
I really really love you baby
I tell the truth about it
I love you baby
I can feel the groove comin' on now
Hey hey
Hey baby
You don't know me
Let's get married today
I love you anyway

[Intro]
Holiday season (Ayy)
Shouts out my nigga Zaytoven (Huh? We back in the buildin')
We workin', Zay (Holiday Season)

DJ Holiday, Writing On The Wall (New mixtape, skrrt, skrrt)
("First Day Out") You know what it is
Ayy, Gucci, how you gon' start the day off, nigga?

[Verse]
I'm starting off my day with a blunt of purp (Damn)
No pancakes, just a cup of syrup (Well, damn)
Baking soda, pot, and a silver spork (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
You already know it's time to go to work
I'm back up off the kitchen workin' with a chicken
You get 63 grams for like twelve-fifty (Wow)
50 pounds of purp, 50 pounds of midget
As soon as it's gone, I sell another 60 (Huh)
My baby need some shoes, my aunty need a purse (Huh)
Summer coming real soon so I need a vert (Damn)
I hop up out that van with that duffel bag (Gucci)
And if a nigga try me, I'ma bust his ass (Bow)
I'm countin' up money in my living room
Birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room (Damn)
Pills in the cabinet, pounds in the den (Gucci)
Attic full of guns, basement full of Benjamins (Holiday Season)
Two AK-47s and a blow torch
Couple junkies knocking hard on my front porch (Huh)
A couple old schools in my backyard
If I don't know you, I'ma serve you through my burglar bars
Gucci back, bitch (Back, bitch), yeah, I'm back, bitch (Huh)
Did you miss me (Did you miss me?) or miss my wealth bitch? (Huh)
This that new shit (What?), that county jail shit (True)
That 7th floor, Rice Street, straight out a cell shit
You on my shit list, I'm on the Forbes list
Since I'm a rich nigga, I need a rich bitch (Gucci)
I got a sick wrist (Bling), it cost 'bout six bricks
I'm on that slick shit, that Zone 6 shit (Huh)

[Outro]
Huh, huh, what's happenin'?
So Icy CEO, we in the buildin'
Huh, huh, huh, Zaytoven on the track, huh, damn, damn
Burr, burr
Wow
Bling-blaow, bling-blaow
Roll 24s, mills In my disposals
Still blow dro and chill with a ho or two
Still tote steal cause jackers'll be all over you
Whether you worth a hundred mill or a O or two
Hatin' start small but jealousy's what it grow into
Hate to see me ballin' and bury me's what you wanna do
I'll front you 50 I owe you, I don't know you
Nigga and you better duck from whatever I'm gon' throw you
Nigga, keep plottin', I'm forced to .44 you
I'm so close to layin' you down and your folks too
Anti-social, toast you from a close view
Leave you layin' and wonderin' who you spoke to
I'll probably never go pop or bi-coastal
Cause in this game G's gotta die to get what they 'posed to
He don't matter, my flow the truth and I'm so cool
I'm the king of the south, nigga I told you

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm in a rush, I'm rollin' kush, I'm cookin' dope, don't interrupt
Fifty bricks came in a bus, I intercept, I finish up
Gucci Man, I'm sinister, politic like a senator
Better yet prime minister, eat rappers for dinner, bruh
From sellin' dope to sellin' big houses like a realtor
I pull up in a black on black Maybach like I'm the governor
Some critics say they can't understand me, I'm a southerner
Bad bitch, she rockin' Chanel but she a foreigner
Pull up in them twin Maseratis, yeah they identical
And I bought a new Kawasaki, I'm poppin' wheelies, bruh
Miami Beach police pulled me over, eh what's the ticket for?
He mad cause the bitch on the back ain't from America

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Now this shit really don't make no goddamn sense
Police chase me, jumped a goddamn fence
Ain't no room in the house for all these goddamn bricks
So many bails at the spot, don't make no goddamn sense
Don't make no goddamn sense, don't make no goddamn sense
Don't make no goddamn sense, don't make no goddamn sense

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Don't make no goddamn sense, man it's a goddamn shame
They talkin' shit from the bench, get in the goddamn game
I mean you boys need to chill, them niggas hot champagne
Nigga I do that shit, you don't do a goddamn thang
And I'm really sorry, I just got that Cali Rari
Smokin' Northern Cal Safari while I'm eatin' calamari
And these suckas can't stomach that, guess they can't digest
That I'm makin' major moves and they ain't makin' progress
Say "Hi" Just, y'all meet pretty Jessica
Know she got that good brain, I just keep on testin' her
Don't come with my package, I'mma have to kill the messenger
Smell that funny shit and I'mma spray that air freshener

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Now this shit really don't make no goddamn sense
Police chase me, jumped a goddamn fence
Ain't no room in the house for all these goddamn bricks
So many bails at the spot, don't make no goddamn sense
Don't make no goddamn sense, don't make no goddamn sense
Don't make no goddamn sense, don't make no goddamn sense

[Verse 3: 8Ball]
No off-brand niggas run with my click
Choppas so big, don't make no goddamn sense
Spend a whole lot of racks on a whole lot of packs
Spit a whole lot of crack on a whole lot of classics
Got a bitch in every city with a whole lot of back
Smoke a whole lot of weed, ate a whole lot of snacks
Had twenty-eight grams when I fell up in this bitch
Smoked it all 'fore I left, don't make no goddamn sense
I'm on kush, she on pills in a short-short dress
Bitch ass so big, don't make no goddamn sense
Gucci Mane was like "Ball, where you get that bitch?"
Bitch ass so big, don't make no goddamn sense

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Now this shit really don't make no goddamn sense
Police chase me, jumped a goddamn fence
Ain't no room in the house for all these goddamn bricks
So many bails at the spot, don't make no goddamn sense
Don't make no goddamn sense, don't make no goddamn sense
Don't make no goddamn sense, don't make no goddamn sense

[Intro:]
Fucking drugs got me
Drugs got me spiritual
Fucking drugs got me
Now I'm in my living room

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Why the good will struggle, tryna' see a bigger picture
Painting scriptures bout the trials of a young street nigga
Mad weed and liquor got me whilin'
Any day could hold my final hour
So I appreciate my mama smilin'
She tried to tell me no weapons against me prosper?
I've been sinning so much that praying to god is feeling awkward
These bright lights I see how they turn niggas to monsters
I'm just running through my field of dreams like Kevin Costner
Church, but don't find me in attendance
Cause I feel if niggas is pretending they're not in his image
Don't judge me, a little testy, and the line is thinning
So much trouble with my mind, spark a line and get me twisted
Can you dig it? I'm insane nigga, never find the same nigga
Dancing in the rain high off pain killers
And he depressed sitting next to the smith and wes
And in case I feel like questioning
Is there really a heaven? I'm gone

[Hook:]
So nigga ask when they look at you
They see more than your physical
I think these drugs got me spiritual
These fucking drugs got me spiritual
Still young and dumb going numb in my living room

Fucking drugs got me
Drugs got me spiritual
Fuckin' drugs got me spiritual
When they look at you
Still young and dumb going numb in my motha' fucking living room

[Verse 2:Remy Banks]
My eyes lower than my bucket breh
Tryna' avoid my future turning grim while whilin' in this world of sin
Doing 90 switchin' lanes on the van wyck
Without a care exhaling of the last hit
They wanna' know how from living right?
Read between the lines open your mind and see the world through my eyes
Weed by the zip extending my high
Mix the hoes and ice with balcony view to keep my mind tight
Back in the day they tried to play me like a sega
Now all these bitches throwing roses at me like I'm vega
Shit, I guess I came up from cheifin' on the dutch
And making Cali runs just to spend funds like I'm major
Motorola pagers on hipster neighborhood gangsters
Had me dreaming at an early age to get this paper
Now we collecting pay cuts
Living out in London next stop is Italy the rest is iceberg history

[Outro:]
My Niggas rough ride till' you high
Rough ride until you die
(Repeats until beat slows down and fades out)
Chorus 1: 

[T-Pain]
I wake up early in the morning, Hop up in the (????)

Chorus 1: 

[T-Pain]

Speakers going hammer, (Bammer bammer bammer) Speakers going hammer, (Bpeakers going hammer?)

[Verse 1]
On my roof
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof
I'm torn apart and you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold case love
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough

[Bridge]
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?

[Chorus]
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

[Verse 2]
Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes
Couldn't see (No)
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind you can keep
Release me now 'cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My heart's no longer cold and confined
I've had enough

[Bridge]
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?

[Chorus]
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

[Bridge]
We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along

[Chorus]
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
Love

[Chorus]
You might think you do
But you don't know
It's like a dream come true
But you don't know

[Verse 1]
Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that ver-say-see
Man I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, nigga you ain't up on this
That's why I'm iced out, medallion heavy on the wrist
My niggas servin' the checks like the first and fifth-teenth
So insecurr, cut that coke 'til it's so unpure
We all need furs by December the third
Cause you heard, Chicago winters is extra burr
Bricks, nicks, nigga so herb
Hustlin' to the whole world, never sober
Seats in the Rover, soft as sofurrs
Ballin so hurr 'till I need a chauffeur

[Chorus]
You might think you do
But you don't know
It's like a dream come true
But you don't know

[Verse 2]
Man I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy shorty a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby-daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

[Chorus]
You might think you do
But you don't know
It's like a dream come true
But you don't know

[Verse 3]
It may seems we living the nigga's American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
As any means to get that green
Cause society done turned us all into fiends
For the road to riches and diamond rings
And what about the teens moms hearts that broke?
Niggas got killed over Starter coats
But I can feel why the shorties be mad as shit
Without the Jordans, he feelin' inadequate
He be feelin' so insecure
Dawg, why that nigga got it? Man life unfair
He be feelin' like fuck the world and furthermore
Feelin' like it's worth
Killin' a person for
But when that pain's gone, it just hurts some more
It seems the sun never shine, that we searchin' for

[Chorus]
You might think you do
But you don't know
It's like a dream come true
But you don't know
You might think you do
But you don't know
It's like a dream come true
But you don't know

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I used the deadwood to make the fire rise
The blood of innocence burning in the skies
I filled my cup with the rising of the sea
And poured it out in an ocean of debris

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm swimming in the smoke of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
We held our breath when the clouds began to form
But you were lost in the beating of the storm
And in the end, we were made to be apart
Like separate chambers of the human heart

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm swimming in the smoke of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize I'm losing what I don't deserve
It's in the blackened bones of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm swimming in the smoke of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize I'm losing what I don't deserve
The blame is mine, alone, for bridges I have burned
So don't apologize I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve
What I don't deserve, oh
What I don't deserve

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
I use the deadwood to make the fire rise
The blood of innocence burning in the skies

[Verse 1]
You're hot for God, but we all got a hunch that
Maybe you've gone astray
Control yourself, but it's so hard
When you can look so good on Sunday
I know he knows that I knew what he's thinking
I know he knows
I know he knows that what he's doing is wrong
But I just tell him "Go on, sing a sad song."

[Pre-Chorus]
My baby has an eye for pretty things, pretty things
He thinks that little girls are butterflies and clips their wings
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Puts them on a roller coaster, lures them in with Coca-Cola!

[Chorus]
Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catchin' butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering high

[Verse 2]
You're hot to trot, but boy, you got a
Secret that you cannot betray
He likes it hot, you're burning up
But baby boy, your secret is safe
I know he know that I knew what he's thinking
I know he know
I know he know that what he's teaching is wrong
But, honey, this preacher's song has got me too far gone

[Pre-Chorus]
My baby has an eye for girls who sing, girls who sing
He's lucky I'm the type, that's his thing, that's his thing
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Dresses up in rings and rollers, poses as a Holy Roller!

[Chorus]
Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catchin' butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering high

[Bridge]
His butterflies are in a golden cage, safe and bound
He puts on "Lola" by The Kinks and he dances 'round
And he's so happy that his feet don't even touch the ground
And I'm in love cause I was lost and now I'm finally found

[Chorus]
Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catchin' butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering

[Outro]
Fluttering, fluttering
Fluttering, fluttering
Fluttering
(Psycho, sicko, psycho)

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I be like why not?
My nigga Khaled in here with me
I fucks with my homie
TS

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Young boy call me Weezy F Baby
Got a whole lot of money, and a bunch of ways to make it
I'mma country ass nigga got diamonds in my teeth ho
Chopper that I'm toting make me feel like Deebo
Rock a nigga boat then speed off on the speedboat
Take a nigga ho and skeet all in her speedo's
Take a nigga ho and show her how to break a kilo
Show the bitch how to turn a bird into a beetle
Weezle F. Baby, no cliche
Just money, hard dick, no foreplay
Standing in the court way, fuck what the court say
There's money on the corner baby, welcome to my workplace
Sippin' with my drink laced, you know how I get down
I promise baby I'mma fall asleep if I sit down
Uptown his town, Hollygrove hizzound
Fuck with the little man, you will never get found
211 187, I'm on a mission
Mother fuck whoever higher, but I gotta get mine
This time I'm going for the big climb
And the boy about to incline, Jigga man I'm nearby
When it come to realize, the sooner they'll feel mine
But I ain't on that, I got money on my mizz-ind
Little ass niggas, stand tall like I'm 6'9"
Cash Money, Young Money, meet you at the finish line, bitch nigga

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
See all these new rappers got me missin' Biggie and Pac
And all these fake Jacobs made me get rid of my watch
And Hollygrove you can't get rid of my block
With all these big-heads, you'd think this was Benjamin's block homie
Cinnamon drop hop out spit at your pops
Behind mine, I'll do 10 in the box nigga
My neck of the woods is Uptown ask for me
Young Maine, Young Money, Cash Money, Fast Money
Had the fiends hittin' the wall thinkin' that they crash dummies
While you little petty hustlers struggling for gas money
I'm on a full tank, bitch I'm bout me
You'll probably catch me and Weezy Baby on South Beach
In back of the Phantom the TVs playing
The game about to start, some bitch singing the National Anthem (fuck)
Whether it's the streets or the CDs, y'all gon' R-E-S-P-E-C-T me

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
If you lookin' for me I be with your bitch nigga
Ho I done fucked and she done sucked my dick (yea)
If it ain't 'bout dollars (yea), then I can't holler (yea)
And everybody know the Birdman the king
And he love his son Wayne so he give me everything
And that's the logics nigga watch it
Keep my name up outta that nigga gossip
Money gon' drain like a brand new faucet
Aren't you conscious? alert for the coppers
They give us the work then throw us in jail
Don't smile for the cameras gotta know when to sail
I'm blowin' an L, low in the 12
I ain't trippin' on life, I'm a go when I shall
I'm a gangsta baby I'm a gangsta
Weezy Baby please say the baby

[Verse 1]
Lost in the darkness, I fade from the light
Faith of my father, my brother, my Maker and Savior
Help me make it through the night
Blood on my conscience
And murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb
Into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine

[Chorus 1]
The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine, you keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?

[Verse 2]
Rivers of evil, run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal, and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes
You cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole?

[Chorus 2]
When will this nightmare be over?
Tell me
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?

[Verse 3]
To safeguard my philosophy
Until my dying breath
I transfer from reality
Into a living death
I empathize with enemies
Until the timing’s right
With God and Satan at my side
From darkness will come light

[Chorus 3]
I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine
I don’t need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is dead

[Bridge]
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side
Do you believe a word what the Good Book said?
Or is it just a holy fairytale and God is dead?
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead, right?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 4]
But still the voices in my head
Are telling me that God is dead
The blood pours down, the rain turns red
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead

[Verse 1]
A boy is born in hard time Mississippi
Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong moving in the right direction
Living just enough, just enough for the city

[Verse 2]
His father works some days for fourteen hours
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many
And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny
Living just enough, just enough for the city (yeah)

[Verse 3]
His sister's black but she is sho 'nuff pretty
Her skirt is short but Lord her legs are sturdy
To walk to school she's got to get up early
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty
Living just enough, just enough for the city (um-hum)

[Verse 4]
Her brother's smart he's got more sense than many
His patience's long but soon he won't have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
Because where he lives they don't use colored people
Living just enough, just enough for the city

[Bridge]
(Living just enough for the city)
Living for the city, yeah
(Believing just enough for the city)
Ain't nothing but a city
(Believing just enough for the city)
Living for the city, yeah yeah
(Believing just enough for the city)
Nothing but a city
(Believing just enough for the city)
Live for the city, yeah yeah
(Believing just enough for the city)
The fucking crud is shitty
(Believing just enough for the city)
Live for the city
(Believing just enough for the city)
Ain't nothing but a city, woo
(Believing just enough for the city)
Everybody clap their hands together now, woo
(Believing just enough for the city)
Hmm, for the city yeah
(Believing just enough for the city)
For the city, yeah yeah
(Believing just enough for the city)
For the city, yeah
(Believing just enough for the city)

[Spoken Interlude]
Bus for New York City!
Hey, bus driver! I'm getting on that, hold it
Thanks a lot
Wow, New York, just like I pictured it
Skyscrapers and everything
Hey hey brother, hey come here slick
Hey you look, you look hip man
Hey you wanna make yourself five bucks man
You look hip
Run this across the street for me right quick
Okay, run this across the street for me
What? Huh? I didn't know! What?
Gimme your hands up you punk!
I'm just going across the street
Put that leg up, shut your mouth
Hell no, what did I do?
Okay, turn around, turn around
Put your hands behind your back, let's go, let's go
A jury of your peers having found you guilty, ten years
What?
Come on, come on, get in that cell nigger
God, lord

[Verse 5]
His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty
He spends his life walking the streets of New York City
He's almost dead from breathing in air pollution
He tried and fought but to him there's no solution
Living just enough, just enough for the city

[Verse 6]
I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow
This place is cruel nowhere could be much colder
If we don't change, the world will soon be over
Living just enough, stop giving just enough for the city

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Eheh, eheh
Eheh, eheh
Eheh, eheh
Listen...

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
She got a mean walk, her attitude's cold
She got you beggin', waitin' - lookin' like an asshole
And now you're pullin' up your shit like a valet
You hangin' on to every little lyric she say
You bought a big rock hopin' she'd show it off
You tried to go hard but you end up lookin' soft
It took a couple stacks just to make her fall
And when you wasn't lookin' she took it all

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
She got her nails done red and they're sharp as a knife
Don't turn your back, cause she moves like a thief in the night
Your little plan had a (hiccup), got held up like a (stick up)
So watch it - she don't care if you're dead or alive

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You're dealin' with a bank (bank, bank) robber
Another hustler with a hand in your pocket
Takin' off with a rocket full of dough
And there she go
You're dealin' with a bank (bank, bank) robber
She's just a hustler with a hand in your pocket
Takin' off with a rocket full of dough
And there she go

[Hook]
I heard her say: "I love you, baby!"
I thought I heard her say: "I love you, baby!"
I heard her say: "I love you, baby!"
I thought I heard her say : "I-I-I love-"

No, you don't...

[Verse 2: James Fauntleroy]
She got you bankrupt - now you're recession-proof
The IRS withholding hoes that would have sex with you
Invested your bread before you thought of it
She used them baby VVS's out your starter kit
She made the checks stop like it's a red light
It didn't take a lot - just a red light
You need a couple stacks just to make her fall
And when you wasn't looking she took it all, yeah

[Pre-Chorus : Justin Timberlake]
She got her nails done red and they're sharp as a knife
Don't turn your back, cause she moves like a thief in the night
Your little plan had a (hiccup), got held up like a (stick up)
So watch it - she don't care if you're dead or alive

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You're dealin' with a bank (bank, bank) robber
Another hustler with a hand in your pocket
Takin' off with a rocket full of dough
And there she go
You're dealin' with a bank (bank, bank) robber
She's just a hustler with a hand in your pocket
Takin' off with a rocket full of dough
And there she go

[Hook]
I heard her say: "I love you, baby!"
I thought I heard her say: "I love you, baby!"
I heard her say: "I love you, baby!"
I thought I heard her say : "I-I-I love-"

Follow me?

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]
Your deal went South, maybe call Mr. West...
You need them 808s for that heartbreak up in your chest
She took your home account and she don't even care
Not even a dream couldn't save you from this nightmare
She got the swagger - a T.I. with a little Hov
And you got swaggered right out of your house and home
It's pretty painful but you can make it stop
And now you're Weezy, effed up - you got your lollipop

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You're dealin' with a bank (bank, bank) robber
Another hustler with a hand in your pocket
Takin' off with a rocket full of dough
And there she go
You're dealin' with a bank (bank, bank) robber
She's just a hustler with a hand in your pocket
Takin' off with a rocket full of dough
And there she go

[Hook x2]
I heard her say: "I love you, baby!"
I thought I heard her say: "I love you, baby!"
I heard her say: "I love you, baby!"
I thought I heard her say : "I-I-I love-"

No, you don't...

I heard her say: "I love you, baby!"
I thought I heard her say: "I love you, baby!"
I heard her say: "I love you, baby!"
I thought I heard her say : "I-I-I love-"

No, you don't...

And the flowers bloom in springtime
On my love that you can rely
And I'll stay with you

Oh I will stay with you through the ups and the downs
Oh I will stay with you when no one else is around
And when the dark clouds arrive

And there'll be heartaches and pains, yes it will
But through it all, we will remain
In this life, we all know

And in the end I know that we'll find
Love so beautiful and divine
And we'll be lovers for a lifetime, yeah
And I'll stay with you

[Chorus]
Oh I will stay with you through the ups and the downs
Yes I will stay with you when no one else is around
And when the dark clouds arrive
I will stay by your side

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me like Spalding
Catch me like Spaldings
If he indeed the MC
Vitamin like GNC
Can't see me like B-I-G, on C-M-T
Then a little bit of time on B-M-G
But this right here homie, this all me
Can you be down?
Naw, C-M-B
That's cold that ain't ice G
So what though?
Little homie remind me of Ice-T
By the way we share the same birthday
The word play is work but pimpin is easy
So catch me I'm ballin
I'm sick two of you?
Catch me like coughing back when I said you should catch me like Spaldings
It's cool cause most cats I bump into can't catch me that often
Most times they just end up fallin
Ball for a few then end up walkin
Catch me in the ball when a cinderella Waltzing
And I do it until it's no longer exclusive
Might go once, might go twice
But never three times like I auctioned to it
See I, walk into it, I do my thang
Then tell the owner that it's cool to let y'all into it

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me like Spalding
Catch me like Spaldings
If he indeed the MC
Vitamin like GNC
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me like Spalding
Catch me like Spaldings
A.B.B. to A.L.C
Man, we stay on the J.O.B

[Verse 2: Evidence]
We on some, E.V. to the T.O.P
Did a little bit of time on C.A.P
But this right here dawg, there is no fee
To gettin' down, if I don't really feel your steez
See, I never trust 'em, catch me I'm ballin'
Taylor made custom, must be I'm all in
Still wanted like Worst Come To Worst
To the point where I never call myself O.G
I end games, never go O.T
And if so, Time's Up like O.C
And if not, then it wasn't my calling
Catch me like Spalding
Catch me like Spalding
Rest in peace to my {edited}
Cali gold rush is here, we never staling
If all goes down, we still get fouled
Understand man, that's how it's supposed to be

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me like Spalding
Catch me like Spaldings
If he indeed the MC

Catch me like Spaldings
A.B.B. to A.L.C
Man, we stay on the J.O.B

[Verse 1]
Sometimes the windows combine with the seams in a way
That twitches on a peak at the place where the spirit was slain
Hey, one foot leads to another, night's for sleep, blue curtains, covers
Sequins in the eyes, that's a fine time to dine
Divine who's circling, feeding the cards to the midwives
Who love those alien days
The nonstop alien days
Ooh, the alien days

[Verse 2]
Must've skipped the ship and joined the team for a ride
A couple hours to learn the controls and commandeer both my eyes
Hey! Be quick dear, times are uncertain, one month crawling, next year blurring
Decades in the drain, monograms on the brain
Decide what's working and what's moved on to the last phase
The floodgate alien days
I love those alien days
Mmm...the alien days

[Chorus 1]
When the peels are down it feels like traveling in style
You don't need wings to hover forty-ton stones for a mile
And in the summer, virgin visions, mindless humming
Numbers can't decide if the day's supposed to smile

[Bridge]
Today, find infinite ways it could be plenty worse
It's a blessing but it's also a curse

[Chorus 2]
Those days taught me everything I know
How to catch a feeling and when to let it go
How all the scheming, soulless creatures
Can't find dreamer's honey in the hive
If it's right beneath the nose
And when the light is new, the sky shows trembling cartoons
You don't need smoke to cover most of the world in a gloom
But here comes racer number 7
Watch my fingers ripping out the lines
If it looks like we could lose

[Outro]
If it looks like we could lose
If it looks like we could lose
If it looks like we could lose

[Intro]
Diplo
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Better act right, 'cause I smack dykes
Give 'em blow and a bit of that bagpipe (Pipe)
Bitch wanna live that rap life (Life), but I already hit that last night
Think you're fuckin' with me, huh? (Huh?) Must be hittin' that crack-pipe

My cash like that cocaine, give me more, say, give me more
Don't worry 'bout it, ain't no thing, big titty hoes in my videos
Classy bitch, don't kiss and tell (Nope)
Smack her ass and then wish her well (Well)
Life sucks, better give 'em hell
Get money, fuck girls, free Biggavel
A million in my briefcase (Briefcase), 'bout to shop for some real estate
'Bout to party with drugs though, turn it up, bitch, feel the bass (Bass)
Throwin' money in your face (Face), feelin' good, livin' great (Great)
Bad bitches in different states, it's like I think I'm Vincent Chase
With porn stars, sports cars, and my crib got a courtyard
How we get all this money though?
You know how big his tours are? (Woah)
Greedy bitch, you a needy bitch
Want some money, but need some dick (Ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
And my belt monogram
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram, though
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram, though
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram, my hologram

[Chorus]
We in my black Benz, windows up
Gettin' head, smokin' blunts
Everybody know what's up, and I turn them girls to sluts
Crib's like a mob boss, my bitch get my car washed
We non-stop, my dick out, her jaw drop
'Cause all we do is fuck, fu-fu-fuck, fuck
All she wanna do is fuck, fu-fu-fuck, fuck
All she, all she wanna do is fuck, fu-fu-fuck, fuck
All she wanna do is fuck, fu-fu-fuck, fuck, fuck

[Verse 2]
Don't I look like a drug dealer? (Woah)
Don't I look like I'm somebody? (Woah)
Killin' beats with that Murder Inc., don't I look like I'm Irv Gotti? (Woah)
Ridin' through in my hippy van, you broke bitches don't give a damn
You softer than the Michelin man, your bitch put her pussy on Instagram
Better go hard when my flow start (Start)
They brand new, but they old cars (Cars)
Your pockets is on low carbs (Carbs)
She do a show, she a polestar
In the penthouse with her pants down
Get the camera out, no hands now
Them hard drugs, we done ran out (Let's go)
Can't believe that's somebody grandchild (Let's go)
She's so bad but I like it (Like it)
Wanna hear your pussy, I'll mic it (Mic it)
My credit card bill is righteous but, girl, that ass is so priceless
Spend the night with the right bitch, my dick ill, my pipe sick (Let's go)
Small pussy, tight fit, she loves to sniff that white shit
Fuck her free, no charge, I play the pussy like Mozart
Eat that pussy, I won't starve (Nope)
Love the pussy with my whole heart
Bitch named Layla my Clapton ho
Give me head, put the Benz in captain mode

[Pre-Chorus]
And my belt monogram
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram, though

When I die, bet she fuck my hologram

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
(Da Honorable C.N.O.T.E)
R.I.P. To Pimp
And O.D.B

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Getting head from a smart bitch
I’m pourin' up dark shit
And I might just have a change of heart
Better play your part, bitch
Tryna get too smart, bitch
I might just have a change of heart
Got a six-car garage, bitch
But I don’t need you to drive shit
‘Cause I done had a change of heart
Woke up in a mansion, grew up in apartments
And I’m the nigga that broke her heart
Got a car don’t need no keys, baby
Automatic starter, my finger, baby
Point a finger, start fightin' like Springer
‘Cause Gucci Mane ain’t no average
Got a girl, don’t need no weed, baby
You my dope, I'm your fiend, baby
Like Billy Dee, get in my ride
And girl, get out my dreams, baby
Work on your footwork like Hakeem, baby
All this green between me and you, lady
Put half on a baby with my homeboy
‘Cause every time I ain’t tryna have no baby
Smoking on kush got my eyes real lazy
You can ride me, baby, then drive me crazy
Rolling up half a pound, no shirt ‘cause girls around
All this money on me, girl, I’ll treat you special
Let me be the manager, girl, I can help you
Let me be the treasurer, get you a bezel
And you can be my trafficker, send you wherever, baby

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Like Pun and Joe, I don’t wanna be a player no more
Zone 6, I can’t be your mayor no more
Took all my jewelry, all my money, threw it out the door
Brick Squad goin’ broke? Nigga that’s a “hell no”
Am I fresh nigga? Yes, yes
And my bitch dressed nigga, yes, yes
Dress so fresh I impress myself
And I’m smoking on a pound of the realest
Yes or no, am I over dressed?
Asked for a pick up, said “hell yes”
Asked for the dick I said “hell yes”
“Do you wanna fuck me?”
She said “hell yes”

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Baby, I’mma go out my way just to please you
Please don’t leave me now, girl, ‘cause I need you
I’ll cut these hoes off right now, I really need to
And I don’t even know why, girl, but I believe in you
You’ve been stuck on my mind since you laid eyes on me
And I don’t like your hatin’-ass friend because she lied on me
And I just touched down, I made my girl so proud
I know her inside out, I know her upside down
And plus that girl stay down through all my ups and downs
Even the thought of losing her…
Some niggas might say no to drugs
All my crew say “hell yeah”
We don’t go get one pair, we go get twelve pair
All my niggas got brick fair, all my niggas got brick fair
At the Falcons game, and your bitch there
I was worth ten mill’ when Vick was here
And the same ‘hood you can’t come to
That’s the one, my mama pay rent there
Spin the globe, every point i’ve been there
I went platinum in Australia

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Like Pun and Joe, I don’t wanna be a player no more
Zone 6, I can’t be your mayor no more
Took all my jewelry, all my money, threw it out the door
Brick Squad goin’ broke? Nigga that’s a “hell no”
Am I fresh nigga? Yes, yes
And my bitch dressed nigga, yes, yes
Dress so fresh I impress myself
And I’m smoking on a pound of the realest
Yes or no, am I over dressed?
Asked for a pick up, said “hell yes”
Asked for the dick I said “hell yes”
“Do you wanna fuck me?”
She said “hell yes”

[Verse 1]
If you don't have a song to sing
You're okay
You know how to get along humming
Hmm, hmm

[Verse 2]
If you don't have a date
Celebrate
Go out and sit on the lawn
And do nothing
'Cause it's just what you must do and
Nobody does it anymore

[Chorus]
No I don't believe in the wasting of time
But I don't believe that I'm wasting mine

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
If you don't have a point to make
Don't sweat it
You'll make a sharp one being so kind
And I'd sure appreciate it
Everyone else's goal's to get big-headed
Why should I follow that beat being that I'm
Better than fine

[Non-Lyrical Outro]

[Intro]
Hey, hey, hahaha
I'ma go in real quick, man
Let me just talk some shit
If y'all don't mind
How we do it, like hey

[Chorus]
I like my seat back, cup full, weed rolled, fuck school
I've been gettin' money, what the fuck have you been up to?
(Up to, up to) What the fuck have you been up to?
Livin' out my dream, boy, what the fuck have you been up to?
I like my seat back, cup full, weed rolled, fuck school
I've been gettin' money, what the fuck have you been up to?
(Up to, up to) What the fuck have you been up to?
Livin' out my dream, boy, what the fuck have you been up to? (Hey, hey)
I like my seat back, cup full, weed rolled, fuck school

(Up to, up to) What the fuck have you been up to?
Livin' out my dream, boy, what the fuck have you been up to?
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 1]
What I'm up to? Workin' hard
Anybody askin', I'm on my job
Late-night lab, then a late-night cab
3-6-5, boy, no days off
Everybody know that the boy got sweet flow
Then my money get a couple more zeros
We go 'til the weed run out
Look at people in my past like, "See me now?"
On it, supersonic, my words gonna hook 'em on phonics
I got it, that's why I talk shit, bitch, I'm fillin' up my wallet quick
If they ever wanna come and try and copy me
It's mine, you can look at the apostrophe
You whine, but then you carvin' out apologies
Goin' at Mac Miller, now you follow me
Set the bar high, take drugs at the car drive
It's alright, a false eye
In it for the distance, par five
Yeah, I'm gifted, aren't I?

[Refrain]
Ride by, pump my shit
If you hatin', suck my dick
I'ma do me, homie, watch it get me fuckin' rich

[Chorus]
I like my seat back, cup full, weed rolled, fuck school
I've been gettin' money, what the fuck have you been up to?
(Up to, up to) What the fuck have you been up to?
Livin' out my dream, boy, what the fuck have you been up to?
I like my seat back, cup full, weed rolled, fuck school
I've been gettin' money, what the fuck have you been up to?
(Up to, up to) What the fuck have you been up to?
Livin' out my dream, boy, what the fuck have you been up to?

[Verse 2]
Ain't nobody hit a dope flow like me
The boy can speed it up like O-M-G
Don't claim to be tough, you can hate on him, but
I'ma still get money, homie, let me be
Job for you, career for me
Took you lifetimes, took a couple years for me
Now, I got the people all hearin' me
And they may not like it, but they listening
I'm so fresh, so clean
Hoes show ass to impress my team
I'm a MVP, you second string
That's why I got your girl text messaging
Tryna get enough money for a pinky ring
Make money, make money, it's a simple thing
Grind on, grind on, money what my mind on
It's gonna be my seat, called fives on
You ain't on what I'm on
Just chillin' here, tryna get my shine on
Now the fans want a pic, no Nikon
Hungover in the mornin', where the night gone?

[Refrain]
Ride by, pump my shit
If you hatin', suck my dick
I'ma do me, homie, watch it get me fuckin' rich

[Chorus]
I like my seat back, cup full, weed rolled, fuck school

I've been gettin' money, what the fuck have you been up to?
(Up to, up to) What the fuck have you been up to?
Livin' out my dream, boy, what the fuck have you been up to?

Relax, relax

I'm on my way home
About to hit the exit, do you need some?
'Cause I know you had a long day, whoa
Do you miss me? 'Cause I miss you
And that sexy little thing you make your lips do
Way your hips move, keep me thinking 'bout the love I wanna give you

You deserve the world if I could give it
Stars would come to you and ask permission to shine
'Cause only you shine

From your head to your toes, massage

About to turn the corner down our road

You deserve the world if I could give it
Stars would come to you and ask permission to shine
You the only one who shine in my world, 'cause only you shine

Head, shoulders, head, back

[Outro]
Just relax
Lay your body back

On a perfect day

When that's not possible
Tell me, can you weather the storm
Cause I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad times
She will always, always be right there

[Hook: ]
Sunny days, everybody loves them

So many diamonds on that I’m lowering the temperature
Wonderful, wonderful, damn I feel wonderful
I know you hate, bruh, but that’s so understandable

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Red bezel on my Jacob looking like a sliced tomato
Fuck a hater I blow acres of Jamaica in decatur
I’m so extraordinary while my bracelet so canary
Choppers that my niggas carry probably scare the military
Half your budget spent on luggage, spent your mortgage on a portrait
Purple bud look like an orchid, can't afford it? watch me torch it
Tell your shorty, gucci at her birthday party, cost a 40
This imported foreign flying saucer make me feel important
Tell big booty Gina from Virginia if you ever see her
I remember last November and I can’t wait 'till the sequel
Where’s my equal? I don’t see him, never met him, never meet him
If I meet him, I’ma greet him, beat him, eat him up and leave him
It's Gucci!

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Dippin’ raucies like a landshark, tell me where the gills
Switching gears, damn look the wheels leave me with the chills
On the real, Gucci vacuum sealed, fuck them record deals
Selling pills, moving pounds of med, kept a pocket scale
Bitches love me cause my pockets chubby, money stupid lanky
And I’m drankin' while I’m driving, diamond solitaire on panky
They ain't owing, so my money growin, blowin’, rollin’ o and
Drop top beemer, yeah it’s foreign, Ralph Lauren shirt, I’m sippin’ don
And then while I’m managin’, leave you stiff just like a mannequin
Frantic and they panickin’ they see we got advantages
Only got one life to get, I wish I had two or three
So icey the family so bury me as S.I.B

[Verse 1]
Lil' nigga here but I came from a whole lot
Say I don't give a fuck, if you hatin' nigga, hold up
Man, all of y'all niggas sold out
And I think it's still amazin'
I got niggas fuckin' with me, I know bitches that do too
Yeah, that salt around my city, ask them bitches that you knew
I'm gon' always judge a nigga by the bitches that you choose
Yeah, I keep my circle tight, but all them motherfuckers loose
Two cups full of Henny for some niggas that'll fuck around
With some bad bitches that we couldn't fuck with
Back when we didn't have fast whips and the money around with us all
I know they gon' hate, tell them motherfuckin' niggas, gon' hate it
I tell her give me space 'cause a motherfuckin' nigga so faded
And why the fuck you tryna play me?
Say you fuckin' with me when I know you fuckin' shady
That Kirk on, that whip playin', a little purp blowin', that Swiss chainin'
Niggas hatin' on me, they snakin' on me, I'm just sayin'

[Chorus]
I thought you were my friend, my friend, my friend
It turned out you pretend, pretend, pretend
You hate me on the low
How could you hate me on the low?
And I'm like damn, damn, damn
Ain't no way that you can be my nigga or my friend
You hate me on the low
How could you hate me on the low?

[Verse 2]
Tints all on my Benzo, black tuck in that blue thing
I'm like what the fuck I need friends for?
Always there when I got bread, never around when these heads low
Fuck you when that money come and don't never ask for no cents ho
It's too much bitches here, too much hoes to fuck
Too much liquor shit, bitch, I'm throwed as fuck
They got so much hate, I got so much love
I can't even fuck with these niggas, no
Old friends, I don't fuck with no more
They be all on my dick and so
Who the fuck is back there? Bunch a fake ass niggas that be trying to act serious
And as lame as that there, treat me different like I wasn't the same as last year
It's plain as black hair, y'all niggas be hatin' in that there
It's some lame shit, I'm tryna get paid like that there
Niggas hatin', I just wanted my change like cashier

[Chorus]
I thought you were my friend, my friend, my friend
It turned out you pretend, pretend, pretend
You hate me on the low
How could you hate me on the low?
And I'm like damn, damn, damn
Ain't no way that you can be my nigga or my friend
You hate me on the low

The Suggestion

[Verse]
Me, I'm just a fly guy lookin' for a lady

Hope you don't take it wrong, girl, you drivin' a nigga crazy
And I just gotta know, girl
You're fuckin' different
Fuckin' different
Fuckin' different
Fuckin' different

[Verse 1]
When I heard the Ladies' Man was dead
I saw the rolling stone stop moving
Saw my ancient hero on the Sunset Strip
He left behind a legacy of ruin
Now painted ladies want to hold my gun
Wonder if the whole time I'd been acting
When I sang "Moon River" in that silent film
Had I really made a sound when they called "Action"?

[Chorus]
I swear that man was womankind's first husband
They all died in a line to save him
I'm a steady hand, I'm a Dodgers fan
I'm a leading brand, I'm a one-night stand
I'm a ladies' man

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, only son of the Ladies' Man
Ooh, only son of the Ladies' Man

[Verse 2]
Couldn't see his used up body at the funeral
By virtue of the flailing of his conquests
They tied down his casket with a garter belt
Each troubled heart was beating in a sequined dress
Someone must console these lonesome daughters
No written word or ballad will appease them
The cowboy and the cop shot down the Ladies' Man
The humid nights in LA are now silent
I swear that man was womankind's first husband

[Outro]
(Ooh) Only son of the Ladies' Man
(Ooh) Only son of the Ladies' Man
(Ooh) Only son of the Ladies' Man
(Ooh)
It has been reported that I signed a new record deal, and that I did this to pay taxes. Yes, I have recently entered into an agreement with Sony Worldwide Entertainment, to launch a new label, on which my new music will be released. And yes, I am working on new music.

I’ve remained silent, after an extensive healing process. This has been a 10+ year battle, for a long time played out behind closed doors, but now in front of the public eye. This is an old conflict between art and commerce… free minds, and minds that are perhaps overly tethered to structure. This is about inequity, and the resulting disenfranchisement caused by it. I’ve been fighting for existential and economic freedom, which means the freedom to create and live without someone threatening, controlling, and/or manipulating the art and the artist, by tying the purse strings.

It took years for me to get out of the ‘parasitic’ dynamic of my youth, and into a deal that better reflects my true contribution as an artist, and (purportedly) gives me the control necessary to create a paradigm suitable for my needs. I have been working towards this for a long time, not just because of my current legal situation, but because I am an artist, I love to create, and I need the proper platform to do so.

The nature of my new business venture, as well as the dollar amount reported, was inaccurate, only a portion of the overall deal. Keep in mind, my past recordings have sold over 50,000,000 units worldwide, earning the label a tremendous amount of money (a fraction of which actually came to me).

Only a completely complicated set of traps, manipulations, and inequitable business arrangements could put someone who has accomplished the things that I have, financially in need of anything. I am one artist who finds value in openly discussing the dynamics within this industry that force artists to compromise or distort themselves and what they do, rather than allowing them to make the music that people need. There are volumes that could (and will) be said.

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Far, far, far, far away – way
People heard him say – say
I will find a way – way
There will come a day – day
Something will be done

[Chorus 1: David Gilmour]
Then at last the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall

[Verse 2: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Now, now, now is the time – time
Time to be – be – be aware

[Chorus 2: David Gilmour]
Carter’s father saw him there and
Knew the road revealed to him
The living soul of Hereward the Wake

[Verse 3: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Oh, my, something in my eye – eye
Something in the sky – sky
Waiting there for me

[Chorus 3: David Gilmour]
The outer lock rolled slowly back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes was Lucy in the sky

[Verse 4: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Oh, oh, did you ever know – know
Never ever will they
I cannot say

[Chorus 4: David Gilmour]
Summoning his cosmic powers
And glowing slightly from his toes
His psychic emanations flowed

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Remember a day before today
A day when you were young
Free to play alone with time
Evening never come

[Verse 2]
Sing a song that can’t be sung
Without the morning’s kiss
Queen – you shall be it if you wish
Look for your king

[Bridge]
Why can’t we play today?
Why can’t we stay that way?

[Verse 3]
Climb your favourite apple tree
Try to catch the sun
Hide from your little brother’s gun
Dream yourself away

[Outro]
Why can’t we reach the sun?
Why can’t we blow the years away?
Blow away
Blow away
Remember
Remember
Remember

[Verse 1]
Little by little the night turns around
Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotuses lean on each other in yearning
Under the eaves the swallow is resting

[Hook]
Set the controls for the heart of the sun

[Verse 2]
Over the mountain watching the watcher
Breaking the darkness, waking the grapevine
One inch of love is one inch of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine

[Hook]
Set the controls for the heart of the sun

[Bridge]
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun

[Verse 3]
Witness the man who raves at the wall
Making the shape of his question to Heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving?

[Hook]
Set the controls for the heart of the sun

[Outro]
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun

[Verse 1: David Gilmour, Nick Mason]
Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg
He won it in the war
In 1944
Corporal Clegg had a medal too
In orange, red, and blue
He found it in the zoo
Dear oh dear oh were they really sad for me?
Dear oh dear oh will they really laugh at me?

[Chorus: all band]
Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin?

[Verse 2: David Gilmour, Nick Mason]
Corporal Clegg umbrella in the rain
He’s never been the same
No one is to blame
Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream
From Her Majesty the Queen
His boots were very clean

[Chorus: all band]
Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin?

[Outro: all band]
Corporal Clegg, Corporal Clegg, Corporal Clegg...

[Verse 1]
Marigolds are very much in love
But he doesn’t mind
Picking up his sister, he makes his way into the see-saw land
All the way
She smiles

[Hook]
She goes up while he goes down, down

[Verse 2]
Sits on a stick in the river
Laughter in his sleep
Sister’s throwing stones, hoping for a hit
He doesn’t know so then

[Hook]
She goes up while he goes down, down

[Bridge]
Another time (Ah-ah)
Another day (Ah-ah)
A brother’s way to leave (Ahhh-ah)
Another time (Ah-ah)
Another day (Ah-ah)

[Verse 3]
She’ll be selling plastic flowers
On a Sunday afternoon
Picking up weeds, she hasn’t got the time to care
All can see
He’s not there

[Hook 2]
She grows up for another man, and he’s down

[Outro]
Another time (Ah-ah)
Another day (Ah-ah)
A brother’s way to leave (Ahhh-ah)
Another time (Ah-ah)
Another day

Another time (Ah-ah)
Another day (Ah-ah)
A brother’s way to leave (Ahhh-ah)
(Ahhh-ah, ahhh-ah)

[Intro]
Yeah, Yeah Yeah, E..

[Verse 1]
I'm often often, sittin' in my world in the coffin, coughin off the herb of the curb
Money, money, money is what they concur
Do they Agree? what they might see, could be
Not exactly what they thought
The car the rap star allgededly bought is probly the same car that the rap star rented
Front end in tennis, supreme in the snowfish
Tailin' the whip, parkin lot a double piece, parked then
My mom swore that I'd be the next come up
Them otha niggas far from it
Can't stand how these dick rock bandits even get granted the access
All up in the mix
Wanna be a Kanye
Wanna be a Skateboard P, but nigga
All the BBC cannot put you, in the same place or give you the same face
Find you first and you couldn't raise the stakes, higher
Not talkin shit just fire, please muthafucka
All this BAPE shit I rock is none otha
Who the best MC's in the Cleve?
Cas, Chip, da Cudder, triple da illness
And Ohio gotta feel this
Took a decade just to say I'm paid
Took a took a decade just to get girls to lay down, spread eagle, pop dat pussy ho'
Need the love below I'm the champ that needs a gold medal
Styles of flow homeboy, I got plenty
I payed for my noodle, the digital vortex. Textin' a freak
Digital phone sex
She wanna suck a dong 'cus my songs got me digital checks
Gigabytes decide the words that I write, I get gone nigga day and night
Unh. Take it literally

[Outro]
How more crystal clear can I be?
How more crystal clear can I be?
How more crystal clear can I be?
Can I be?
Can I be?
Unh huh, yeah
K.I.D.D.I
How more crystal clear can I be?
Can I be?
Can I be?

[Verse 1]
It’s awfully considerate of you to think of me here
And I’m most obliged to you for making it clear that I’m not here
And I never knew the moon could be so big
And I never knew the moon could be so blue
And I’m grateful that you threw away my old shoes
And brought me here instead dressed in red
And I’m wondering who could be writing this song

[Verse 2]
I don’t care if the sun don’t shine
And I don’t care if nothing is mine
And I don’t care if I’m nervous with you
I’ll do my loving in the winter

[Verse 3]
And the sea isn’t green
And I love the Queen
And what exactly is a dream?
And what exactly is a joke?

I'm in the studio
All day all night
Cookin' up the flow
Gettin' my career right
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
Cause all my life I've been broke
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
Aiming straight for the top

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hub City beat
87 baby 87 Cudi screamin' out "Fuck the police"
Bubble kush in the trunk, choppers in the front seat
Get your top peeled back, don't chitterchat, don't speak of me
I move low-key, I think like a double OG
Inside of an old school bumpin' oldies
So high off life, that bitch I could OD
Die twice, and come back the same nigga
Lame niggas get up out of my lane nigga
Before the big rig come through and run over your brain nigga
Me propane niggas for their dividends
Forgive you innocent, Compton all of my uncles wore Pendletons
West Coast rider, bitch I'mma ride her
'Til the wheels fall off, buy more tires
Mmm, say hello to the new prince
I'm high king behind black tint
Na'mean?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Get the fuck out of my business
Because I've been handling the fuck out of my business
Grinding got perfect attendance
Flyer than first-class and detention
Uh, been a winner since the beginning
And my records show, not even in the Guinness
What do you mean, am I finished? I'm just getting started
But you're on the sideline like Vince Lombardi
Weezy, new born baby? and it's my party
And I'm kicking like a horse on the stick-shift Ferrarri
Like new cocaine, bright yellow dope?
Bright red flag like a red velvet rope
Open for criticism, there really isn't any room for criticism
When this shit is in I'm in deeper than your pool, so I swim in towel-less
Bitch, I be and I been ballin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Mmm, fuck 'em all, kill 'em all off
Send 'em off to the holy one
Put a hole in one, like miniature golf
Price on your head, and they trying to purchase
No matter the cost
Hand over the cloth
Cloth over the gun
Gun over your jaw
Bullet over your tongue
Stick my dick inside hip-hop and shorty's sprung
Every time I get a chance to come over I overcome
Over the snare drums
They say, "Who fucking with you if you the god MC?"
I tell 'em none
Get it? I tell 'em none
Catholic nor Christian, holding the book of sums
In the back of my True Religions
Never passed the bar but
I ain't got to study law
Just to judge lyrics
Mmm, I should be the judge of lyrics
Bang the gavel, give you a life sentence

[Hook]
I'm in the studio
All day all night

Aiming straight for the top

[Intro]
You belong to me tonight, girl

A real love, oh

[Chorus]
You belong to me, tonight, my love
All I wanna do is make love slow
Girl, I want, make love slow, yeah
Girl, you know your body it deserves
Everything on this earth

[Verse 1]
And since we're only in the first verse
Girl, take off that purse and get in this room, ooh, get in this room
Now baby, oh baby, I'm ready, I'ma take control if you let me inside your world
Let me inside, please don't be afraid girl, no

[Verse 2]
And if I can't have your body, I don't wanna have nobody, I'd rather be alone
Ain't no substitute, they can't do what you do for me
Would you please take your clothes off or would you rather me do that part?
'Cause I don't mind, no I don't mind
Button after button, now the blouse coming off
Kissing on your stomach, now your skirt coming off
You feel so soft, where is your spot?
Kiss until I find it, must you be reminded

[Chorus]
You belong to me, tonight, my love
All I wanna do is make love slow
Girl, I want, make love slow, yeah
Girl, you know your body it deserves
Everything on this earth
I'll give it to you, ooh, I'll give it to you, yeah

[Bridge]
Aw there is no thrill
Like the thrill I feel making love to you, making love to you woman
Behold and I can't wrap my mind around it
Woman, your beauty perplexes me and you belong to me

[Chorus]
You belong to me, tonight, my love
All I wanna do is make love slow
Girl, I want, make love slow, yeah
Girl, you know your body it deserves
Everything on this earth
I'll give it to you, ooh, I'll give it to you, yeah

To get your love, let's get it on

My doorbell, ring my doorbell, get it

[Verse 2]
Guess who's coming to breakfast today?
Prancing all around with them pretty legs
When it's sunny side up, beat it like some eggs
'Cause there ain't nothing better than morning sex
Girl, it ain't a mystery
I want your lips kissing me
'Cause I've been waiting all day long
And I'm gon' tear your body up

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you baby, damn right I said you, baby

[Verse 1]
“Icy wind of night be gone this is not your domain”
In the sky a bird was heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied the deathly silence that lay all around

[Hook]
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer, making for the sea

[Verse 2]
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes settle on the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room

[Hook]
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer, making for the sea

[Verse 3]
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes covering the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into my city room

[Hook]
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer, making for the sea
Aye an a bit o' mackerel, fiddler, rack and fear
And I rutted down by the hade and the furrow
Well, I slipped me in a flop and hit down and I shied
And I cried, cried, cried
The fear of fallin' down aft' taken, never back to rise
And then cried 'Mary!' and I tucked up
Wi' a Claymore out and about
And I run down, down the mechyn sty
And beckoned the fiery whore
That was fallin' around the feet
"Never", I cried. "Never shall ye get me alive
Ya rotten hound of the Burnie Brae"
Well, I snapped for a blade and a Claymore cut and thrust
And I fell down before him 'round his feet
(That was pretty avant-garde, wasn't it?)
Aye, a roar he cried! Frae the bottom of his heart
That I would nay fall but dead, dead as a can by a feat deah...
And the wind cried back

Thank you

[Verse 1: King Chip]
If my niggas don't fuck wit' you, I don't fuck wit' you
That's just a code in my hood, don't let these guns hit you
Be a man of your word, don't ever let 'em play you
Stand up for your shit, make sure these haters pay you
Can't nothing stop a room full of real niggas
I got some bad rich bitches, they my real niggas
It's like working four jobs not to kill niggas
My little niggas love to ride by and spill niggas
If y'all fell out over some chips that ain't your real nigga
If y'all fell out over a chick that ain't your real nigga
Before I be a house nigga be a field nigga
I gotta Port Arthur chick, call it my trill nigga
I met Duke in 92 and we still niggas
Rockin Hilfigers before they was like chill niggas
Living well me and my niggas gon' eat
Before you hate, hit the brakes with both feet

[Chours: Kid Cudi]
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's supposed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's supposed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's supposed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's supposed to be
Hey yo, all right

[Verse 2: Rolla Costa]
If my brothers don't fuck with you, I'ma fuck with you
Egg your fucking whip right in front of your bad bitch
Didn't care if my swag was weird they staired
Like fifty flights so they couldn't keep up with my fly
But it's like when they see me with a new joint they wanna cyph
But I'm laughing like ain't this nigga said I can't ride a bike
Started rocking these jerseys and it trended to my brothers
Like Ben got my brother franklin working started from a boss at young
But rally just chillin' having fun
So when you see me just know I'm
Working
Trying to start a business
Ah tv show a clothing line
My nigga we be hoping the train back to the block
We saved guap for lil cezar pizza box (Ahhh) real nigga shit right there
For now crunch time is lunch time and one rhyme is dumb fine

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's supposed to be
This is how it's supposed to be
This is how it's supposed to be
This is how it's supposed to be
Hey yo, all right

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Max with the homies, try to teach them things
Teach them how to make a piece of change, even keep the change
But they neva change, bought a set of chains with another chain
Upgraded to a better chain, that Beretta sing, I ain't playing
Shoes on the 'rari start to look like hooves
Pigs by the crib start to look like wolves
Money neva change me only change the situation
The paper I be chasin got them sucka niggas hatin
Started from the pavement, basement Satan
Couldn't match my flames so they compare me to a mason
Free like slaves but they based and crazy
We talkin' bout crack or we talkin about blacks?
Spliffing the blunt up, then they pickin the gun up
Motherfuckers is trippin, they fixin' to run up
Then they gettin the come up, yup bitch
And they do it 'til the sun up
And this is for my niggas and my gang
Through the fortune and the fame
Only thing that never change is my niggas

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's supposed to be
This is how it's supposed to be
This is how it's supposed to be
This is how it's supposed to be
Hey yo, all right

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
I got the niggas that I need with me
Any issues my nigga you know to please hit me
No question no hesitation when it comes to holding fam down
If you creep me the fuck out you probably ain't around
Now you can hate on the side lines, I'm skippin past
You got me fucked up, keep talkin and kiss my ass
No sweatin the ho shit, too in tune with the family
I do got the ones that do know Scott
They give me the love that a nigga need
If its a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
Word to Dennis, ridin' thick and thin until we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished, clothes on our kids
And keep my niggas from goin away on a bid
Only wanted all the fly shit when we got big
Chasin these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggas up so 'bout it, 'bout it they go blind about it
We all grown, families of our own
Providing for 'em real niggas, real morals that's the code
Perform so long as I am my brother's keeper
He will provide me with a nine if I need or a street sweeper
The love I have for my niggas is another type
You gotta real nigga down with you for your whole life
Love for my niggas
The brothers that I never had made my life a lot less sad my nigga

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's supposed to be
This is how it's supposed to be
This is how it's supposed to be
This is how it's supposed to be
Hey yo, all right

[Part 1 - Instrumental]

[Part 2 - Instrumental]

[Part 3]

[Verse 1]
Following the path as it leads towards
The darkness in the north
Weary stranger’s faces show their sympathy
They’ve seen that hope before

[Chorus]
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can’t delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can’t catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

[Verse 2]
Mist is swirling, creatures crawling
Hear the roar get louder in your ears
You know the folly was your own
But the force behind can’t conquer all you fears

[Chorus]
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can’t delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can’t catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

[Verse 3]
Throw your thoughts back many years
To the time when love was life with every morning
Perhaps a day will come
When the lights will be as clear as on that morning

[Chorus]
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can’t delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can’t catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

[Intro: RZA]
Search inside my purse to buy something worthless

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
99 problems all gone in that one joint
And that neck gold froze like he held it at gunpoint
I'm a bubble in the belly of the monster
With a duffel full of troubles, trunk rattle in the Mazda
Ragged with the contra, Phantom of the Opera
And I'm standing on the cop's truck, stacking for the long run
The bags packed, roadside with the thumb out
Toe-tagged, don't gag, spit your gum out
Nomadic, chrome-grabbing when it's danger
I'm a manger-born puppy, holding flight like a hangar do
Knife to the trachea, spit scabies and bet
The label don't like me, but they pay me a grip
And you see how his day going by the state of his wrists
Y'all niggas busy Play-Dohing, bet the baker came swinging like
What the fuck you saying? All that aiming and miss
Ayy, I'ma fuck the freckles off your bitch

[Hook: RZA]
I'll fuck the freckles off your face, bitch
We could do this shit all night
I'll fuck the freckles off your face, bitch

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
You know me, drugs out, front the telly
I'm couch-drunk and ready to fuck, count fetti and bucks
Pack loud as that slap 'cross the belly
What's up? Fuck nigga, what's up? I'm at the deli
Scheming on a Fanta and a Camel Crush, screaming, "Saddle up!"
Like, "Fuck is beef?" Get your cattle cut, pansy
If them fans only local, why them flights transatlanti'ed up?
The rice and the patties cooked nice for the chancellor
Them teeth with the gold bright, the light switches mad at us
Snapchatting panty-clad baddies, I'm a bachelor
I'm high and polite 'cause po-lice is in back of us
And write with the same hand I smack 'em up with
Stretching out the fifteen I had initially
Icky Thump, sticky kush lit up in a rental Jeep

[Hook: RZA & Earl Sweatshirt]
We could do this shit all night
I'll fuck the freckles off your face, bitch
We could do this shit all night
I'll fuck the freckles off your face, bitch

[Verse 1]
Tell me what
What about this woman makes me want to do right?
Want to switch it up and stay with her the whole night
I don't know
What it is, but it feels all right yeah
Lord knows I tried (Lord knows I tried)
Lord knows I tried to convince myself that it wasn't no lie (wasn't no lie)
But it wasn't no way I was lettin' this sweet love pass me by
Now I know
What it is
It was just my pride

[Chorus]
When has love (when has love)
Benefited a fool? (benefited a fool)
I got nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
But everything is true
Now I know (now I know)
I know what I got to do (I know what I got to do)
Just stop lying to you (just stop lying, oh girl just stop lying)
And tell you the truth
Cause' when has love benefited a fool?

[Verse 2]
You were so fly
Yeah
You know you should've been an angel (you know you should've been an angel)
With those diamond eyes
Girl you look good from every angle (you look good from every angle)
Now I see (now I see)
Girl all this time you've just been waiting on me (been waiting on me)
And I know I don't deserve all that I receive from your love
But you never leave no, no, no

[Chorus]
When has love (when has love)
Benefited a fool (benefited a fool) yeah
I got nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
Oh but everything is true to you
Now I know (now I know)
I know what I gotta do (I know what I gotta do)
Just stop lying to you (just stop lying, oh oh just stop lying)
Tell you the truth
Cause' when has love benefited a fool?

[Verse 3]
Good book says that pride (Good book says that pride)
Comes before destruction (come before destruction)
I'd be destroyed (yeah)
If I lose your loving (yeah)
Girl I done changed
Know you done changed me
Give you the plane
Your love has saved me yeaaaah oooh

[Chorus]
When has love (when has love)
Benefited a fool (benefited a fool)
I got nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
But everything is true
Now I know (now I know)
I know what I gotta do baby oh (I know what I gotta do)
Just stop lying to you (just stop lying, oh oh just stop lying)
Oh oh and tell you the truth
Cause' when has love benefited a fool?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got lots of bricks, cops can't stop the shit
Fall off in the club just to stand on top of shit
Partner in the pen and he still got bales of it
I got a bale of it cuz I like the smell of it
Man I just reek of it, and I could see the shit
Say I'm conceited bitch, bitch man I need a bitch
When the rent was late I had to get the shit
I might of missed the shit I might just hit your trick
Hit in the head you bitch for what you said you bitch
Go get your dad you trick go suck your daddy's dick
Way above average bitch so can't fuck an average bitch
I break up marriages no horse and carriages
Fresh as a sparrow ho my watch named Lil Darryl, ho
Say that you are what you smoke that make you regular ho
My pack is so bougie it got me thinking I'm better than you
Pints of that medicine fool that's what they making it for

[Hook:Gucci Mane]
I got Drinkers in my family
Couple smokers in my family
Gang bangers in my family
And I'm smoking on that family tree
I got smokers in my family
A lot of drinkers
A couple gamblers in my family
And we smoking on that family tree

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Me and my famo rocking camo missing with that Ferragamo
And my uncle life in shambles cuz the nigga like to gamble
Say it's too cold to hold and too hot to handle
You done folded now your lights cut off and now you lighting candles
With a million I go broke you can't hide or deny
Girl you know you smoke that dope don't tell me that damn lie
And I know your uncle front that fire boy you know that boy get high
I'm mister sell you anything I can't work no 9 to 5
And when I hold this pistol on your boy don't act like you surprised
Be a cold day in hell if this nigga stay alive
If you run I hold like 20 bands and then I'mma shoot your ass like 20 times
Glock 45 stay by my side I carve your ass like a pumpkin pie

[Hook]
I got Drinkers in my family
Couple smokers in my family
Gang bangers in my family
And I'm smoking on that family tree
I got smokers in my family
A lot of drinkers
IAcouple gamblers in my family
And we smoking on that family tree

[Verse: Kanye West]
I walk through the halls of the school and it’s cool
To be known by many for my rapping ability
But what about the brothers who ain't got it like me?
Making money off the trade, you could say I had it made
Drugs are on the rise and it's not a big surprise
You see no soul in a young brother's eyes
Trying to be hard by the streets but the streets kinda hard
But here's another factor we wanna disregard
Black-on-black is a stab in my back
It really hurts my soul when I hear about that

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I remember being young, tough, brave
I knew what I needed
I was spending all my nights and days laid back day dreaming
Look at me I'm a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town
Now betcha I run this

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I put it down like that, d-down like that
And I'm making all these racks, a-all these racks
And I'm moving round like that, r-round like that
When I do it I don't look back, d-don't look back

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
They love the way I walk
'Cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk 'cause I ain't pretending
It took a while, now I understand just where I'm goin'
I know the world and I know who I am, It's 'bout time I show it

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I can be bad if I want
I can say what I want
I can live fast if I want
I can go slow all night long
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
I'm a grown woman, and I know that I got it
I'm a grown woman, ain't got no room in my pockets
I'm a grown woman, look down, got you so excited
I really want to know if you got it like that
'Cause I got a cute face and my booty so fat
Go girl, she got that bomb, that bomb
That girl, can get whatever she wants
That girl, she got that tight, that tight
Them boys, will do whatever she likes

[Bridge: Ismael Kouyate]
(African Vocals)

[Outro: Beyoncé]
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want

But you be steady cruising like you want it to last
How you made me a chocoholic, and right now my body's callin'

Before you go I'll scream damelo

[Verse 1]
Shakey threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmied and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so
Yea! it was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! so it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame

[Chorus]
Watch that man!
Oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man!
Oh honey, watch that man
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

[Verse 2]
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
So Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits were joking, the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played the Tiger Rag
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! I ran to the street
Looking for information

[Chorus]
Watch that man!
Oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man!
Oh honey, watch that man
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

[Outro]
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man

[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 1]
Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of dudes in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
A lot of records from here, they get no play
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride, Imma let those stay
So these nosy niggas don't know that I get checks all day
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying to guess it
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if it's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit
Both of the deals, nothin' under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'ma teach you beginners
'Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features, y'all better get me while it's cheaper than dinner
'Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats Imma send her

[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 2]
Check, the verses I'm writin', you might wanna learn it
You hatin' my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake, might wanna return it
'Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl
She'll forget you and I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along, your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed, wilin' in this, you ask me what the business is
And I'll write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music needed
Drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed
I got this dude they expectations I'ma exceed it
Like a single with only backgrounds
Y'all record and when it's done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here I'ma star with the timin'
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin'
This for anybody that's searchin' for cash
And purchasin' fast, you only get the dough when you grindin'
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhymin', boy

[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Bridge]
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to kick some new school lines
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is somethin' that the rest regret
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back

[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 1]
Gangsta Gangsta Gangsta Gansta
F-I Westside Chi-Town Thank Ya
Moms and Pops what drove me crazy
Spice-1, Twista, Biggie, Jay Z (Yeah)
Inspirings for writing in my spiral
Then put violence into firing like opposite of hiring
Cause weren't nobody hiring
They packin the four fifth
Back to tacting, sink your warships
Climbs your walls invade your fortress
From battling and hassling from samplings from rapping
And I'm trackling off Madison to trafficking in-to trampling
He be, easy, back again
Focused attacking them, the unbelievable
It's a mack back here like (???)
Don't be fooled by the packaging
I'm back to school like September
L-U-P Emperor

[Hook]
Suspects falling gangstas ride (Lean Nigga, Lean Nigga)
Ladies ballas, haters hide (Lean Nigga, Lean Nigga)
F-N-F is major now (Lean Nigga, Lean Nigga)
Don't you love it it's just I (Lean Nigga Lean Nigga)
This is how we get down

[Verse 2]
Jump!
Put your lighters in the air it's a fighter in stare
How you gonna escape If I set fire to the stairs?
How you gonna equate us it's like a hare compared to a lair full of lions tigers and bears
You don't like sharing his the (???) the medium rare, the well. Well you're in there
They think they gonna take me off of their square (Nah-Uh)
But I am far from a Now and Later rapper (wrapper)
Down to take a matter back up to with clappers
From tapping young trapper don't get caught up in my snare
Far from a producer dawg
Every block that you set up I'm will shut down
Turn your computers off, It's surprising though
Flow so wired requires tying to a chair
Somebody better come and get it cause I'm about to kill it
Just enough for every city and village to feel  it

[Hook]
Suspects falling gangstas ride (Lean Nigga, Lean Nigga)
Ladies ballas, haters hide (Lean Nigga, Lean Nigga)
F-N-F is major now (Lean Nigga, Lean Nigga)
Don't you love it it's just I (Lean Nigga Lean Nigga)
This is how we get down

[Verse 3]
Yeah!
This is how we get down this is how we get down
Like a top floor fire and I found the fire escape to get to the ground
I'm a top floor fire give em a pound
Sho'nuff respect to the young upset
The three at the buzzer hand to the fam
Sleeves of a hustle
He's ever upper
Crust, trust, sucker free like doctor visits
Wasa is it? Yup, Yuck Sickening
Tipping, Tipping, Tipping, Tipping
Chi-Town's rhetoric for getting it
Listen, lift them off the flow off we go
Piffin, recording, give em gore
Ninety-Two Bulls, Jordan's, Pippen
Welcome, cross em, caught you slipping
Off to the bucket don't make me un-tuck yeah!

[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band

[Verse 2]
Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could kill 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded, man,
Well hung, snow white tan

[Chorus 1]
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our bones?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was The Nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy, could he play guitar

[Chorus 2]
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind (ah)
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
Ooh

[Outro]
Ziggy played guitar

[Intro]
Yo, this that shit
Just to let niggas know
You can’t fuck with us

[Hook]
But I don’t even wanna hit on you, don’t wanna know his name
Sit down nigga, I know the game
Clothes shopper, I know the game
Take it and put it back into the store
Crazy cat, ah
And I don’t wanna hear all those excuses, they all the same
We should both be ashamed

[Verse 1]
Got me talkin bout love, you mean forever
You mean me falling in love, talking never
She’s missing me after this one chick got together
She told me she had a man but they not together
Let me tell you how I first met her
It’s kinda ill though
I’m downtown tryna find Anita
That’s where I find this diva stand in front the hospital
I double park the car, scream, yo man’s not with you
As for the cigarettes just brought the convo what went on
I man up and eat, her belly holdin on
And as far as she say
Oh that was over, he say she say
So you telling me your man stayed up in micro weeds
Mistaken identity like Cochise and I’m finna be
Holla at you now, know we’ll talk later
And I wanna get up but you got flavor
Now I’ma let you get the cell, let you get the pager
And if you ain’t around no haters you can call me later

[Hook]
But I don’t even wanna hit on you, don’t wanna know his name
I know the game, I know the game
Y’all know the game
And I don’t wanna hear all those excuses, they all the same
We should both be ashamed
Cause we know the game

[Verse 2]
She must’ve known where the dollars at
Cause it ain’t taken long at all but need to holla back
Gave me directions to the crib, told me follow that
And I could park in back where the Impala at
But she ain’t stayed on the southside, south southside
Deeper than the know when
Now I’m questioning whether I should get in that
Plus lasting a lot, walk into the door, haters asking a lot
And where you from nigga? You ain’t from round here
As I peeped out the window said baby I’m right here
He mad cause I’m with her and he ain’t with her
And he stayed down the hallway and he can’t get er
So when I came out the nigga hatin on me was waitin on me
And he had mo guys, no lie
Man I knew we were both wrong, bitch but I know nothing
Finna wear both chains but I know nothing

[Hook]
But I don’t even wanna hit on you, don’t wanna know his name
I know the game, I know the game
And I don’t wanna hear all those excuses, they all the same
We should both be ashamed
Cause we know the game

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Coming from a city where bullets turn bro's into souls
Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hoes
Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was Illmatic
Then I saw Kanye's hanging from his gold necklace
Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic
Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt
Used to pick me up from school, man, right after work
Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church
She asked why I rock all this gold, cause I'm coming in first
Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear-view
Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew
Now I'm in the penthouse, look at what a mill do
Looking in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you

[Hook: Big Sean]
Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Bridge: Big Sean]
BIG was the first one that had it
Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Verse 2: Nas]
What's the noise all about with this rap stuff?
I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up
I can say I never been chased, jumped, or backed up
I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up
'Cause it's a mental game
I learned that when I got my first initial chain
I didn't fake it, it was gold plated, I was posing relatin'
To those dealing with blow, had the big gold, bold anchors it was those gangsters
That bonus, that culture, those projects
Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint
They got in my bones, now I'm copping stones
Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs
18 karat gold Cuban on
Not too short, not too wide, not too long
My pendant offensive, in the truest form
Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?

[Hook: Big Sean]
Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Bridge: Big Sean]
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was Illmatic
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
On a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid
I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved
No matter what way I turn things go my way
I'm rocking chains everyday, so you know I slave
Even when I'm just walking 'round the crib, nigga
To remind me of everything that we did, nigga
Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'
No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flyin'
I know the higher the goal, the harder the climb
But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind
Police only work 12-hour shifts
'Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch
Trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues
FF, GOOD, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews
Stack bills on bills til' my backyards got pools on pools
Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge
God damn, I think I'm gon' O.D
Off this asparagus and bread and pasta
Need a doctor, I've been dodging shady hoes and rainy days
It's like I got a built-in doppler
And it's a shame, a fuckin' shame
I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'
But remember my first ass and the first time she came
It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain

[Hook: Big Sean]
Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Bridge: Big Sean]
Jay-Z taught me money ain't a thing
Came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame
And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Verse 4: Kid Cudi]
It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things
Niggas and bitches are with you cuz where you at?
I got my mind is on me, a couple others and dreams
Would've seen me and my niggas in this bitch
About two months in a week's time
Went from feelin' hellish to godly with lemon-lime shine
Now how the fuck can I chill now? Kanye think I'm dope
See this piece that I own now, how sick is the rope?
Taking life for what it is, the troublesome chick
Who throws fists; sometimes it's the weather
Things switch up, people trip up
The money come down, then climb up, but when it come again
The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'
Saying that you love me, I surely hope and if you don't
Motherfuck that sometimes, so dead it
Shred it; young nigga lost to the night
I'm so ready to let it go, my life is fucking awesome
I could be fuckin' dead right now, but I'm awesome
So fuck whoever has a bad thought don't know the god
'Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the God
It might be too late, but the songs will live on
Just know this fact, you were all wrong
Now watch me do my silly dance, not really a dance
More like a prance, I'm signing off with a crotch grab

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Thank you, man, for letting me get on this record, Sean
You the coolest
GOOD Music nigga, forever
Understand? Yahm

[Verse 1]
I just shook the handshake, I just sealed the deal
I'll try not to let them take everything they can steal
People always told me, said "Don't forget your roots"
I know I can feel them underneath my leather boots

[Chorus 1]
You toss all the mornings lost to the clouds
And you watch it go
Your fair weather friends on a parachute binge
Get lost when the wind blows
The handshake's stuck on the tip of my tongue
It tastes like death but it looks like fun

[Verse 2]
I was a loner, I was just waiting by myself
When you, warped temptress rose to bring me happiness and wealth
Black tears, black smile, black credit cards and shoes
You can call all the people you want, but it's you who's being used

Under your black eyes, honey, right beneath your nose
A curse on all creation, every single thing you know
White smoke, white light, white marble on the floor
It would only take a few seconds of darkness to figure out what's in store
Little girl

[Chorus 2]
You convince yourself that you want it
But you don't know
You keep trying to wash the blood from your hands
But it won't go
We're gonna keep you on the run
We got the handshake under our tongue
We got the handshake under our tongue
We got the handshake under our tongue
We got the handshake under our tongue

[Refrain]
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake

[Intro: B.o.B]
Mustard the beat, ho (Yeah, Bandz)

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Already got one rolled up in my left hand (In my left hand)
Pussy on my mind, tighter than a headband (Than a headband)
Kush in my lungs, got ganja in my sweat glands (In my sweat glands)
This shit I'm on, better than the next strand (Ayy)
Than the next strand, better than the next strand (Ayy)
She head down, booty poppin' in a handstand (Bandz)
I shine bright, I'll give your girl a slight tan (Woo)
I make that pussy whistle like the Old Spice man *Whistles*
I don't even understand, why she'd ever want a man
If she ever throw it, I'd catch it like a cornerback (Like a cornerback)
Like a cornerback, that's an interception (Interception)
You think I give a fuck? That's a misconception

[Refrain 1: B.o.B]
Oh, what a night (Yeah,) oh, what a night (Yeah)
The roof is on fire (Yeah,) so what? I'm high (Yeah)
I said, oh, what a night (Hey,) oh, what a night (Hey)
Yeah, she a bad bitch, all jokes aside (Woo)

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Hey, look at baby over there (Over there)
Wassup, lil mama, come here (Come here)
She started talking but I really couldn't hear (Ha)
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Do it in the mirror)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
She broke it down started moving like Shakira
Uh, like she do it in the mirror

[Post-Chorus: B.o.B, 2 Chainz]

Chop that ass down, chop chop that ass down
All I want you to do is just drop that ass down (Yeah)
Drop drop that ass down, uh, now look back at it (2 Chainz)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Whistling Dixie
Middle school, I was getting head on a ten-speed
Gigolo bloodline, pimpin' hereditary
Black on 28's, it remind of February
Day you can fuck with me, that would be Neveruary
Dead ass rapper should'a came with a cemetery
I am so cold, nigga like Ben & Jerry
Fill a nigga, deal a nigga, kill a nigga, obituary (Tell 'em)
My vision blurry, these bitches flirtin'
I been drinking all night, I think my kidney's hurtin' (Damn)
So I closed the curtains on the 62
Her ass'll knock your ass out, you better stick and move (True)
Chain hang to my ding-a-ling (What?)
Chain hang, chain hang to my ding-a-ling (Yeah)
To do a threesome you gotta intervene
Her legs so sexy when I'm in-between

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Hey, look at baby over there (Over there)
Wassup, lil mama, come here (Come here)
She started talking but I really couldn't hear (Ha)
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Do it in the mirror)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
She broke it down started moving like Shakira
Uh, like she do it in the mirror

[Post-Chorus: B.o.B]
I chop one, chop two, chop that ass down (Down)
Chop that ass down, chop chop that ass down
All I want you to do is just drop that ass down
Drop drop that ass down, uh, now look back at it

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
She do it like she do it in the mirror
Be cautious, that booty is bigger than it appears
She speed it up or slow it down, like she's switching gears
I'm looking for the baddest one here, I tell her like
Do that there, do that there
You gotta stretch it out, girl, move that there
She bend it over, touch her toes when she toot that there
Like hut one, hut two, girl, who back there?
Who back there? I'm back there
I could take a step back and sip my cognac there
Picture perfect body, that's a Kodak there
Now make a nigga feel welcome like a doormat's there, I'm like

[Refrain 2: B.o.B]
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night
The roof is on fire, so what? I'm high
I'm like, oh, what a night, oh—oh, what a night
That's a bad bitch, all jokes aside, there she go (Woo)

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Hey, look at baby over there (Over there)
Wassup, lil mama, come here (Come here)
She started talking but I really couldn't hear (Ha)
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Do it in the mirror)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
She broke it down started moving like Shakira
Uh, like she do it in the mirror

[Post-Chorus: B.o.B]
I chop one, chop two, chop that ass down (Down)
Chop that ass down, chop chop that ass down
All I want you to do is just drop that ass down
Drop drop that ass down, uh, now look back at it

[Verse 1]
As I reach for a peach, slide a rind down behind
The sofa in San Tropez
Breakin’ a stick with a brick on the sand
Ridin’ a wave in the wake of an old sedan
Sleepin’ alone in the drone of the darkness
Scratched by the sand that fell from my love
Deep in my dreams and I still hear her callin’

[Chorus]
“If you’re alone, I’ll come ho-ho-home”

[Verse 2]
Backward and homebound, the pigeon, the dove
Gone with the wind and the rain, on an airplane
Born in a home with no silver spoon
I’m drinking champagne like a good tycoon
Sooner than wait for a break in the weather
I’ll gather my far-flung thoughts together
Speeding away on the wind to a new day

[Chorus]
If you’re alone, I’ll come ho-ho-home

[Slide guitar solo by David Gilmore]

[Verse 3]
And I pause for a while by a country stile
And listen to the things they say
Diggin’ for gold in a hole in my hand
Open a book, take a look at the way things stand
And you’re leading me down to the place by the sea
I hear your soft voice calling to me
Making a date for later by phone

[Chorus]
And if you’re alone, I’ll come ho-ho-home

[Piano solo by Richard Wright]

[Verse]
My body is magnified
In the sun set me alight
My body and your delight
Burn me up, set me alight

[Hook]
I can't deny, your desire
Feel like I’m on fire
When you touch me
I feel the flame
Licking at my feet
And I kiss you, while the sun kisses me
Can you feel the heat on my skin
Can you feel all my loving
You and me, we're standing on the sun
Can you feel my heart burning
Make you feel all my good loving
You and me, we're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun

[Verse 2]
My body is glistening
So work with, two hearts beating

[Hook]
Can you feel the heat on my skin
Can you feel all my loving
You and me, we're standing on the sun
Can you feel my heart burning
Make you feel all my good loving
You and me, we're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun

[Verse 1]
They disembarked in '45
And no-one spoke and no-one smiled
There were too many spaces in the line
Gathered at the cenotaph
All agreed with the hand on heart
To sheath the sacrificial Knifes
But now
She stands upon Southampton dock
With her handkerchief
And her summer frock clings
To her wet body in the rain
In quiet desperation knuckles
White upon the slippery reins
She bravely waves the boys goodbye again

[Verse 2]
And still the dark stain spreads between
Their shoulder blades
A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves
And when the fight was over
We spent what they had made, but
In the bottom of our hearts we felt the final cut

[Verse 1]
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Summer Sunday and a year
The sound of music in my ears

[Verse 2]
Distant bells, new mown grass smells so sweet
By the river holding hands
Roll me up and lay me down

[Chorus]
And if you see, don’t make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a tongue so strange
Sing to me, sing to me

[Verse 3]
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Children’s laughter in my ears
The last sunlight disappears

[Chorus]
And if you see, don’t make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a tongue so strange
Sing to me, sing to me

[Outro]
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Oh, uh, me flakes, then uh, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, tomatoes... toast, coffee... marmalade, I like marmalade. Yes, porridge is nice. Any cereal, I like all cereals... oh God. Kickoff is 10am

Rise And Shine (1:00 - 3:34)

Breakfast in Los Angeles, macrobiotic stuff

Sunny Side Up (4:29 - 7:44)

I don't mind a barrow, I like barrowing the stuff in
I've got a terrible back. When I work, it hurts me
D'you know what I mean, John?
Well he's sort of, err… when driving on the road he has a sleep, gets ready for the gig
I don't know
He does all the electrical stuff. I can't be bothered with that its so fiddly

Morning Glory (8:17 - 11:54)

All my head's a blank

[Verse 1]
A cloud of eiderdown
Draws around me
Softening the sound

[Refrain]
Sleepy time, when I lie
With my love by my side
And she’s breathing low

[Bridge]
And the candle dies

[Verse 2]
When night comes down, you lock the door
The book falls to the floor
As darkness falls and waves roll by
The seasons change, the wind is warm

[Verse 3]
Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan
Behold a dream, the dream is gone
Green fields, a cold rain is falling
In a golden dawn

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
And deep beneath the ground
The early morning sounds
And I go down

[Refrain]
Sleepy time, when I lie
With my love by my side
And she’s breathing low

[Outro]
And I rise, like a bird
In the haze, when the first rays
Touch the sky
And the night winds die

[Verse 1]
You say the hill’s too steep to climb
Chiding
You say you’d like to see me try
Climbing
You pick the place and I’ll choose the time

[Chorus 1]
And I will climb that hill in my own way
Just wait a while for the right day
And as I rise above the tree line and the clouds
I look down, hearing the sound of the things you’ve said today

[Verse 2]
Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd
Smiling
Merciless the magistrate turns ’round
Frowning
And who’s the fool who wears the crown?

[Chorus 2]
And go down in your own way
And every day is the right day
And as you rise above the fear-lines in his brow
You look down, hearing the sound of the faces in the crowd

[Outro]
Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
Liverpool! Liverpool!

[Intro]
*Dog Barking*

[Verse]
I was in the kitchen
Seamus, that’s the dog, was outside

Well, I was in the kitchen
Seamus, my old hound, was outside

Well you know, the sun sinks slowly
But my old hound dog sat right down and cried

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Come on, my friends, let's make for the hills
They say there's gold and I’m looking for thrills
You can get your hands on whatever we find
'Cause I'm only coming along for the ride

[Chorus 1]
Well, you go your way, I'll go mine
I don't care if we get there on time
Everybody's searching for something, they say
I'll get my kicks on the way

[Verse 2]
Over the mountains, across the sea
Who knows what will be waiting for me?
I could sail forever to strange sounding names
Faces of people and places don't change

[Chorus 2]
All I have to do is just close my eyes
To see the seagulls wheeling in those far distant skies
All I want to tell you, all I want to say
Is count me in on the journey, don't expect me to stay

[Verse 1]
Heaven sent the promised land
Looks alright from where I stand
'Cause I’m the man on the outside looking in
Waiting on the first step
Show me where the key is kept
Point me down the right line because it’s time

[Chorus]
To let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there’s a chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I’m growing old

[Verse 2]
Flash the readies
Wot’s… uh-the deal?
Got to make it to the next meal
Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel
Mile after mile (Mile after mile)
Stone after stone (Stone after stone)
Turn to speak but you’re alone
Million miles from home, you’re on your own

[Chorus]
So let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
Cause there’s a chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I’m growing old

[Piano & Guitar Solos]

[Verse 3]
Fire bright by candlelight
And her by my side
And if she prefers we never stir again
Someone sent the promised land
And I grabbed it with both hands
Now I'm the man on the inside looking out

[Outro]
Hear me shout “Come on in!"
"What’s the news and where've you been?”
Cause there’s no wind left in my soul
And I’ve grown old

[Verse 1]
Stay and help me to end the day
And if you don’t mind
We’ll break a bottle of wine
Stick around and maybe we’ll put one down
'Cause I wanna find what lies behind those eyes

[Chorus]
Midnight blue
Burning gold
A yellow moon
Is growing cold

[Verse 2]
I rise, looking through my morning eyes
Surprised to find you by my side
Rack my brain and try to remember your name
To find the words to tell you good-bye

[Bridge]
Morning dues
Newborn day
Midnight blue
Turned to gray

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Midnight blue
Burning gold
A yellow moon
Is growing cold

[Verse 1]
You shout in your sleep
Perhaps the price is just too steep
Is your conscience at rest
If once put to the test?
You awake with a start
To just the beating of your heart
Just one man beneath the sky
Just two ears, just two eyes

[Verse 2]
You set sail across the sea
Of long past thoughts and memories
Childhood’s end, your fantasies
Merge with harsh realities
And then as the sail is hoist
You find your eyes are growing moist
All the fears never voiced
Say you have to make your final choice

[Verse 3]
Who are you and who am I
To say we know the reason why?
Some are born; some men die
Beneath one infinite sky
There’ll be war, there’ll be peace
But everything one day will cease
All the iron turned to rust
All the proud men turned to dust
And so all things, time will mend
So this song will end

[Intro]
One, two, free, four!

[Chorus]
The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
You shuffle in gloom of the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die

[Verse 2]
Life is a short, warm moment
And death is a long, cold rest
You get your chance to try in the twinkling of an eye
Eighty years, with luck, or even less

[Verse 3]
So all aboard for the American tour
And maybe you’ll make it to the top
And mind how you go, and I can tell you, ’cause I know
You may find it hard to get off

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
You are the angel of death
And I am the dead man’s son
And he was buried like a mole in a fox hole
And everyone is still on the run

[Verse 5]
And who is the master of fox hounds?
And who says the hunt has begun?
And who calls the tune in the courtroom?
And who beats the funeral drum?

[Chorus]
The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
You shuffle in gloom in the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die

[Instrumental Outro]

[Part 6 (0:00 - 4:38): Instrumental]

[Part 7 (4:38 - 6:02)]

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Nobody knows where you are
How near or how far

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on you crazy diamond

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Pile on many more layers
And I'll be joining you there

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on you crazy diamond

[Chorus: Roger Waters]
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph
And sail on the steel breeze
Come on, you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on, you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!

[Part 8 (6:02 - 9:00): Instrumental]

[Part 9 (9:00 - 12:27): Instrumental]

[Intro]
“…announced plans to build a nuclear fallout shelter at Peterborough in Cambridgeshire…”
“…three high court judges have cleared the way…”
“…It was announced today that the replacement for the Atlantic
Conveyor, the container ship lost in the Falklands conflict would be built in Japan. A spokesman for…”
“…moving in. They say the third world countries, like Bolivia, which produce the drug are suffering from rising violence…”

[Verse]
Tell me true, tell me why, was Jesus crucified?
Was it for this that Daddy died?
Was it you? Was it me?
Did I watch too much T.V.?
Is that a hint of accusation in your eyes?
If it wasn't for the Nips
Being so good at building ships
The yards would still be open on the Clyde
And it can't be much fun for them
Beneath the rising sun
With all their kids committing suicide
What have we done, Maggie, what have we done?
What have we done to England?

[Outro]
Should we shout, should we scream
“What happened to the post war dream?”
Oh, Maggie, Maggie, what did we do?

[Verse 1]
They flutter behind you your possible pasts
Some bright-eyed and crazy, some frightened and lost
A warning to anyone still in command
“Ranks! Fire”
Of their possible future, to take care
In derelict sidings the poppies entwine
With cattle trucks lying in wait for the next time

[Chorus]
Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?
(Closer, closer, closer, closer, closer, closer, closer)

[Verse 2]
She stood in the doorway, the ghost of a smile
Haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign
Her cold eyes imploring the men in their Macs
For the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs
Stepping up boldly one put out his hand
He said, “I was just a child then, now I’m only a man.”

[Chorus]
Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?
(Closer, closer, closer, closer, closer)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
By the cold and religious we were taken in hand
Shown how to feel good and told to feel bad
(Tongue tied and terrified we learned how to pray
Now our feelings run deep and cold as the clay)
Strung out behind us the banners and flags
Of our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags

[Chorus]
Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?
(Closer, closer, closer, closer, closer, closer, closer)

[Verse: Roger Waters]
When you’re one of the few to land on your feet
What do you do to make ends meet? (Teach)
Make 'em mad, make 'em sad, make 'em add two and two
Or make 'em me, or make 'em you, make 'em do what you want them to
Make 'em laugh, make 'em cry, make 'em lay down and die
Jesus, Jesus, what’s it all about?
Trying to clout these little ingrates into shape
When I was their age all the lights went out
There was no time to whine and mope about
And even now part of me flies over
Dresden at angels one five
Though they’ll never fathom it behind my
Sarcasm desperate memories lie

Sweetheart, sweetheart, are you fast asleep? Good
‘Cause that’s the only time that I can really speak to you
And there is something that I’ve locked away
A memory that is too painful
To withstand the light of day

When we came back from the war
The banners and flags hung on everyone’s door
We danced and we sang in the street and
The church bells rang
But the burning in my heart
The memory smolders on
Of the gunner's dying words on the intercom

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Floating down, through the clouds
Memories come rushing up to meet me now
But in the space between the heavens
And the corner of some foreign field
I had a dream
I had a dream
Good-bye Max
Good-bye Ma
After the service, when you’re walking slowly to the car
And the silver in her hair shines in the cold November air
You hear the tolling bell
And touch the silk in your lapel
And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band
You take her frail hand
And hold on to the dream!

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
(“Oi!")
A place to stay
("Over here, Morris!”)
Enough to eat
(“Get back! Get back, John!”)
Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street
Where you can speak out loud
About your doubts and fears
And what’s more, no-one ever disappears
You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door
You can relax on both sides of the tracks
And maniacs don’t blow holes in bandsmen by remote control
And everyone has recourse to the law
And no one kills the children anymore
No one kills the children anymore

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
Night after night
Going round and round my brain
His dream is driving me insane
In the corner of some foreign field
The gunner sleeps tonight
What’s done is done
We cannot just write off his final scene
Take heed of the dream
Take heed
Button your lip and don’t let the shield slip
Take a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask
And if they try to break down your disguise with their questions
You can hide, hide, hide
Behind paranoid eyes

You put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar
Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar
Laughing too loud at the rest of the world
With the boys in the crowd
You can hide, hide, hide
(“I’ll tell you what, I’ll give you three blacks, and play you for five")
Behind petrified eyes

(“Ta! You was unlucky there son”)
You believed in their stories of fame, fortune and glory
Now you’re lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age
The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high
And you hide, hide, hide
(“Time gentleman!”)
Behind brown and mild eyes
“Oi!”

[Intro]
(Hey! Get your filthy hands off my desert!)
(What'd he say?)

[Verse]
Brezhnev took Afghanistan
Begin took Beirut
Galtieri took the Union Jack
And Maggie, over lunch one day
Took a cruiser with all hands
Apparently, to make him give it back

[Verse 1]
Take all your overgrown infants away somewhere
And build them a home, a little place of their own
The Fletcher Memorial Home
For Incurable Tyrants and Kings

[Verse 2]
And they can appear to themselves every day
On closed circuit T.V
To make sure they’re still real
It’s the only connection they feel
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Reagan and Haig
Mr. Begin and friend, Mrs. Thatcher, and Paisley (Hello Maggie!)
Mr. Brezhnev and party
(Scusi dov’è il bar?)
The ghost of McCarthy,
And the memories of Nixon
And now, adding colour (Who’s the bald chap?)
A group of anonymous Latin-American meat packing glitterati"
Did they expect us to treat them with any respect?

[Bridge]
They can polish their medals and sharpen their smiles,
And abuse themselves playing games for awhile
Boom boom, bang bang, lie down you’re dead

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Safe in the permanent gaze of a cold glass eye
Their favourite toy
They’ll be good girls and boys
In the Fletcher Memorial Home for colonial
Wasters of life and limb

[Outro]
Is everyone in?
Are you having a nice time?
(Goodbye!)
Now the final solution can be applied

[Verse 1]
Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes
I can barely define the shape of this moment in time
And far from flying high in clear blue skies
I'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide
If you negotiate the minefield in the drive
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes
And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall
Dial the combination, open the priesthole
And if I'm in I'll tell you (What's behind the wall)
*Shot* (Yahoo!)

[Verse 2]
There's a kid who had a big hallucination
Making love to girls in magazines
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith
Could anybody love him
Or is it just a crazy dream?

[Verse 3]
And if I show you my dark side
Will you still hold me tonight?
And if I open my heart to you
And show you my weak side
What would you do?
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?
Would you take the children away
And leave me alone?
And smile in reassurance
As you whisper down the phone?
Would you send me packing?
Or would you take me home?

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down
I held the blade in trembling hands
Prepared to make it but...
Just then the phone rang
I never had the nerve to make the final cut

[Outro]
“Hello? Listen, I think I've got it."
"Okay, listen, it's a- Hahahaha!”

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Choir]
Fuck all that, we've got to get on with these
(Fuck all that, fuck all that)
Got to compete with the wily Japanese
There’s too many home fires burning and not enough trees
(Fuck all that)
So fuck all that, we've gotta get on with these
(Gotta get on with these)

[Verse 2: Roger Waters & Choir]
Can’t stop, lose job
Mind gone, silicon
Tsar bomb, what bomb?
Get away, pay day
Make hay, break down
Need fix, big six
Click, click
Hold on, oh no
Bingo! (Bingo!)

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
Make them laugh, make them cry
Make them dance in the aisles
Make them pay, make them stay
Make them feel okay

[Verse 3: David Gilmour & Choir]
Not now John, we've got to get on with the film show
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow
(End of the rainbow)
Who cares what it’s about as long as the kids go
(As long as the kids go)
So, not now John, we've gotta get on with the show
(Gotta get on with the show, gotta get on, gotta get on)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4: David Gilmour & Choir]
(Gotta get on, gotta get on, gotta get on)
Hang on John I've got to get on with this
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
I don’t know what it is, but it fits on here like- tsss
Come at the end of the shift, we’ll go and get pissed
But not now John, I've gotta get on with this
(Gotta get on with this, gotta get on)

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
Hold on John, I think there’s something good on
I used to read books but...
It could be the news, or some other amusement
Could be reusable shows

[Verse 5: Roger Waters & Choir]
Fuck all that, we've gotta get on with these
(Doo, doo, wah)
Got to compete with the wily Japanese
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
No need to worry about the Vietnapeace
(Doo, doo, wah)
Got to bring the Russian Bear to his knees
(Gotta get on)
Well, maybe not the Russian Bear, maybe the Swedes
(Doo, doo, wah)
We showed Argentina, now let’s go and show these
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
Make us feel tough and wouldn't Maggie be pleased?
(Doo, doo, wah)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
One, two, Free Four!
(One, two, Free Four!)

[Outro]
S'cusi, dov'è il bar? (What?)
Se parakalo, pou einai to bar?
S’il vous plaît, où est le bar? (Say it in English, fairy!)
Oi, where’s the fucking bar John? (Oh, now you’re talking!)
(Rule Britannia! Britannia rules the day)
Down! Go, Maggie!
Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, now!

[Verse 1]
In my rear view mirror the sun is going down
Sinking behind bridges in the road
And I think of all the good things
That we have left undone
And I suffer premonitions, confirm suspicions
Of the holocaust to come

[Verse 2]
The rusty wire that holds the cork that keeps the anger in
Gives way and suddenly it’s day again
The sun is in the east
Even though the day is done
Two suns in the sunset, hmph
Could be the human race is run

[Verse 3]
Like the moment when the brakes lock
And you slide towards the big truck (“Oh no!”)
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear (*Scream*)
And you’ll never hear their voices ("Daddy, Daddy!")
And you’ll never see their faces
You have no recourse to the law anymore

[Verse 4]
And as the windshield melts and my tears evaporate
Leaving only charcoal to defend
Finally I understand
The feelings of the few
Ashes and diamonds,  foe and friend
We were all equal in the end

[Saxophone Solo]

“…and now the weather. Tomorrow will be cloudy with scattered showers spreading from the east …
With an expected high of 4000 degrees Celsius”

[Intro]
*Boat rowing*

[Interlude: Nick Mason]
When the child-like view of the world went, nothing replaced it... Nothing replaced it… Nothing replaced it…
I do not like being asked to... I do not like being asked to... I do not like being asked to...
Other people replaced it... Someone who knows

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone, my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

[Chorus]
Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit, I

[Verse 2]
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try

[Chorus]
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit, I

[Verse 3]
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss

[Chorus]
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit, I

[Verse 1]
On the turning away
From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won’t understand
"Don’t accept that what’s happening
Is just a case of all the suffering
Or you’ll find that you’re joining in
The turning away"

[Verse 2]
It’s a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we’re all alone
In the dream of the proud

[Verse 3]
On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
Mesmerized as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share
It’s not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there’ll be
No more turning away?

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Dogs of war and men of hate
With no cause, we don’t discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned
Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale
Gather round and haggle
For hard cash we will lie and deceive
Even our Masters don’t know the webs we weave

[Hook]
One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world… One world

[Verse 2]
Invisible transfers and long distance calls
Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar
Has unleashed the dogs of war
You can’t stop what has begun
Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have our dark side to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

[Hook]
One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and they're gonna smash it down
One world… One world

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
One world… One world

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 3]
The dogs of war don’t negotiate
The dogs of war won’t capitulate
They will take and you will give
And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door
But wherever you go, you know they’ve been there before
Well winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change you know the dogs remain

[Hook]
One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and we're gonna smash it down
One world… One world

[Outro]
One world… One world
One world… One world

[Verse 1]
A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word her honour to defend
"I will, I will" she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I led the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence

[Chorus]
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you won’t forget
There’ll be no sleep in here tonight

[Verse 2]
Was it love or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone

[Chorus]
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life to a life
One regret, you will never forget
There’ll be no sleep in here tonight

[Outro]
One slip… one slip…

[Verse 1]
One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?
A man who ran: a child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

[Verse 2]
The use of force, he was so tough
She’ll soon submit, she’s had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still
He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He’s just the same as all the rest
He’s not the worst, and he’s not the best

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
And still, this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look
A man in black on a snow white horse
A pointless life has run its course
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun

[Verse 1]
I have always been here
I have always looked out from behind these eyes
It feels like more than a lifetime
Feels like more than a lifetime

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I get tired of the waiting
Sometimes I get tired of being in here
Is this the way that it's always been?
Could it ever have been different?

[Verse 3]
Do you ever get tired of the waiting?
Do you ever get tired of being in there?
Don't worry, nobody lives forever
Nobody lives forever

[Verse]
I will always be here
I will always look out from behind these eyes
It’s only a lifetime
It’s only a lifetime
It’s only a lifetime

[Verse 1]
The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

[Verse 2]
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

[Bridge]
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

[Verse 3]
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
As you look around this room tonight
Settle in your seat and dim the lights
Do you want my blood, do you want my tears?
What do you want?
(What do you want from me?)
Should I sing until I can’t sing anymore?
Play these strings until my fingers are raw

[Chorus]
You're so hard to please
What do you want from me?

[Verse 2]
Do you think that I know something you don’t know?
(What do you want from me?)
If I don’t promise you the answers would you go?
(What do you want from me?)
Should I stand out in the rain?
Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you?

[Chorus]
I’m not the one you need
What do you want from me?

[Bridge]
You can have anything you want
You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water
Anything you want
You can own everything you see
Sell your soul for complete control
Is that really what you need?
You can lose yourself this night
See inside, there is nothing to hide
Turn and face the light

[Outro]
What do you want from me?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci so flossy, all my broads are bossy
Head 'till I'm nauseous, they keep me exhausted
Niggas wanna get it, Gucci went and bought it
My flow has been frostbit, haters wish I lost it
Traded like a foster, ever since a youngster
My lines has been bonkers, I deserve an encore
I heard that she dumped ya, chose me, then I dumped her
Stanky like a dumpster, funky as an oyster
Used to be an Oiler, I think he divorced her
He say he adored her, but he couldn't afford her
I don't have to bore her, financially support her
He do all that lame stuff, I just keep it gangsta

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Please pardon me, please pardon me
I'm sorry I'm so spark-a-ly
I don't say this normally but please excuse my ornaments
Excuse me, excuse me
Please let me floss my jewelry
Gucci Mane ain't iced out, ha ha you must be kiddin' me
(2x)

[Verse 2]
I pull up in a Zonda, he pulls up in Honda
Thang short as a garden snake but mine's an anaconda
Wrist like the Artic, my neck is like the jungle
Wardrobe full of animals, my closet's like the Congo
Motor is a monster, trunk is a gorilla
Ask me where my top is at I left it with the dealer
Ballin' in the VIP they standin' in the line
My watch so stupid icy I can't even tell the time
My necklace full of diamonds, his piece gave him a rash
He bought it from the Texaco cause he didn't save his cash
Tryna be like Gucci Mane but he don't have a swag
Needs to take his jewelry off and throw it in the trash

[Hook]

I'm in the bank making depo's, while y'all be gettin' repo'ed
I'm zero, zero, zero, comma, zero after zero
My jewelry game sick, I think my jeweler needs chemo
Wonder Woman bracelet on but I'm no superhero
Cockiest, I'm rockin' this cause ain't nobody hot as this
So hot as hot lava get and I'm not with that modest shit
Poppin' Cris', think that I need Alcohol Anonymous
.45 in the club, I could kill a hippopotamus
Office chick, college chick, I got game for any chick
I hang out with stars, you would think I'm an astrologist
They should pay me back for all this fuckin' game they borrowin'
Thirty grand a feature and I don't got time for bargainin'

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Did you know
It was all going to go so wrong for you?
And did you see
It was all going to be so right for me?
Why did we tell you then
You were always the golden boy then
And that you'd never lose that light in your eyes?

[Verse 2]
Hey you
Did you ever realize what you'd become?
And did you see
That it wasn't only me you were running from?
Did you know all the time but it
Never bothered you anyway?
Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes

[Instrumental Break 2:11 - 4:11]

[Verse 3]
The rain fell slow
Down on all the roofs of uncertainty
I thought of you
And the years and all the sadness fell away from me
And did you know?
(Did you know, did you know, did you know)
(Did you know, did you know, did you know)
(Did you know, did you)
I never thought that you'd lose that light in your eyes

[Instrumental Outro 5:12 - 7:03]

[Verse 1]
On the day the wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high we raised a cry
For freedom had arrived
On the day the wall came down
The Ship of Fools had finally run aground
Promises lit up the night
Like paper doves in flight

[Chorus 1]
I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you

[Verse 2]
Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbors turn away
And there’s a change that even with regret
Cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey

[Chorus 2]
I woke to the sound of drums
The music played, the morning sun streamed in
I turned and I looked at you
And all but the bitter residues slipped away
Slipped away

[Instrumental Outro 2:19 - 4:17]

[Verse 1]
Sunlight bright upon my pillow
Lighter than an eiderdown
Will she let the weeping willow
Wind his branches round?

[Chorus]
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams

[Verse 2]
Every night I turn the light out
Waiting for the velvet bride
Will the scaly armadillo
Find me where I’m hiding?

[Chorus]
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams

[Verse 3]
Will the misty master break me?
Will the key unlock my mind?
Will the following footsteps catch me?
Am I really dying?

[Chorus]
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams

[Outro]
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
(Please save me!)
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
(Please save me!)
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
(Please save me!)

[Instrumental Intro 0:00 - 1:02]

[Verse 1: Richard Wright]
From morning to night I stayed out of sight
Didn’t recognize I’d become
No more than alive; I’d barely survive
In a word, overrun

[Chorus 1: Richard Wright]
Won’t hear a sound (He’s curled into the corner)
From my mouth (But still the screen is flickering)
I’ve spent too long (With an endless stream of garbage to)
On the inside out (…curse the place)
My skin is cold (In a sea of random images)
To the human touch (The self-destructing animal)
This bleeding heart’s (Waiting for the waves to break)
Not beating much

[Verse 2: Richard Wright]
I murmured a vow of silence and now
I don’t even hear when I think aloud
Extinguished by light, I turn on the night
Wear its darkness with an empty smile

[Bridge: Richard Wright]
I’m creeping back to life
My nervous system all awry
I’m wearing the inside out

[Instrumental Break 3:06 - 3:39]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
Look at him now
He’s paler somehow
But he’s coming around
He’s starting to choke
It’s been so long since he spoke
Well he can have the words right from my mouth

[Verse 4: Richard Wright]
And with these words I can see
Clear through the clouds that covered me
Just give it time then speak my name
Now we can hear ourselves again

[Chorus 2: Richard Wright]
I’m holding out (He’s standing on the threshold)
For the day (Caught in fiery anger)
When all the clouds (And hurled into the furnace he’ll)
Have blown away (…curse the place)
I’m with you now (He’s torn in all directions)
Can speak your name (And still the screen is flickering)
Now we can hear (Waiting for the flames to break)
Ourselves again

[Instrumental Outro 5:11 - 6:49]

[Instrumental Intro 0:00 - 1:08]

[Verse 1]
Her love rains down on me
Easy as the breeze
I listen to her breathing
It sounds like the waves on the sea
I was thinking all about her
Burning with rage and desire
We were spinning into darkness
The earth was on fire

[Chorus]
She could take it back
She might take it back someday

[Verse 2]
So I spy on her, I lie to her
I make promises I cannot keep
Then I hear their laughter rising, rising from the deep
And I make her prove her love for me, I take all that I can take
And I push her to the limit to see if she will break

[Chorus]
She might take it back, she could take it back some day

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Bridge]
Ring-a-ring o’ roses
A pocket full of posies
A-tishoo! A-tishoo!
We all fall down

[Verse 3]
Now I have seen the warnings, screaming from all sides
It’s easy to ignore them, God knows I’ve tried
All of this temptation, you know it turned my faith to lies
Until I couldn’t see the danger or hear the rising tide

[Chorus]
She can take it back, she will take it back some day
She can take it back, she will take it back some day
She will take it back, she will take it back some day

[Verse 1]
Where were you when I was burned and broken?
While the days slipped by from my window watching
And where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless?
‘Cause the things you say and the things you do surround me
While you were hanging yourself on someone else’s words
Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining sun

[Verse 2]
Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted
Outside, the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived
For killing the past and coming back to life

[Outro]
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
And headed straight… into the shining sun

[Verse 1]
I was spending my time in the doldrums
I was caught in a cauldron of hate
I felt persecuted and paralysed
I thought that everything else would just wait
While you are wasting your time on your enemies
Engulfed in a fever of spite
Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades
Like shadows into the night
To martyr yourself to caution
Is not gonna help at all
‘Cause there’ll be no safety in numbers
When the right one walks out of the door

[Interlude]
"Ladies and gentlemen!
The winner
By a knockout"

[Verse 2]
Can you see your days blighted by darkness?
Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
Stuck in a world of isolation
While the ivy grows over the door
So I open my door to my enemies
And I ask "Could we wipe the slate clean?"
But they tell me to please go fuck myself
You know you just can’t win

[Outro]

[Intro: Stephen Hawking]
For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals
Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination
We learned to talk

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
There’s a silence surrounding me
I can’t seem to think straight
I’ll sit in the corner
And no one can bother me
I think I should speak now (Why won’t you talk to me?)
I can’t seem to speak now (You never talk to me)
My words won’t come out right (What are you thinking?)
I feel like I’m drowning (What are you feeling?)
I’m feeling weak now (Why won’t you talk to me?)
But I can’t show my weakness (You never talk to me)
I sometimes wonder (What are you thinking?)
Where do we go from here (What are you feeling?)

[Refrain: Stephen Hawking]
It doesn’t have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
(Why won’t you talk to me?) I feel like I’m drowning
(You never talk to me) You know I can’t breathe now
(What are you thinking?) We’re going nowhere
(What are you feeling?) We’re going nowhere
(Why won’t you talk to me?)
(You never talk to me)
(What are you thinking?)
(Where do we go from here?)

[Refrain: Stephen Hawking]
It doesn’t have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

[Verse 1]
Last night I had too much to drink
Sitting in a club with so many fools
Playing to rules
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty
I had another drink (Drink – a – drink – a – drink – a – drink)
(Ah)

[Verse 2]
What a way to spend that evening
They all turn up with their friends
Playing the game
They're in the scene I should have been
Far away (Away – away – away – away – away)

[Hook]
Getting up, I feel as if I’m remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget

[Verse 3]
The telephone rings and someone speaks
She would very much like to go out to a show
So what can I do? – I can’t think what to say
She sees through anyway (Away – away – away – away – away)

[Verse 4]
Out of the front door I go
Traffic’s moving rather slow
Arriving late
There she waits, looking very angry
As cross as she can be (Be – a – be – a – be – a – be – a – be)

[Hook]
Getting up, I feel as if I’m remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget

[Verse 1]
Wasting my time
Resting my mind
And I’ll never pine
For the sad days and the bad days
When we was workin’ from nine to five

[Chorus]
And if you don’t mind
I’ll spend my time
Here by the fire side
In the warm light of the love in her eyes

[Chorus]
And if you don’t mind
I’ll spend my time
Here by the fire side
In the warm light of the love in her eyes

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
Love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
It's only what you got in the form of the highest power you seek
Now this right here's not a preview
I need to let it go
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Now this right here is not a preview
Of what the album goin' to bring you, or nuttin' like that
Sharing things I think quietly, with those that admire me
'Member MTV Diary? This something like that
I wear my heart up on my sleeve and I bleed for you
Cookin' beats hoping' to reach like each one you
When I release, trust if you feel like my shit is weak
When you see me on the street, then speak, I refund you
This sample was yellin' "loop me!"
Ms. Hill, please don't sue me
'Cause I ain't one of these rappers out here frontin' like he got it, nigga
I ain't fuckin' got it, nigga...
Throwing thousands in the strip club with Drizzy
Difference is I'm throwing four, he throwin' 50
Lord, forgive me, bitches saying, "You a rapper nigga, ain't you s'posed to tip more?"
I don't see no pussy, baby, ain't you s'posed to strip more?
Confessions of a cheap-ass nigga
But I finally put my momma in that E-Class, nigga
And I told her quit her job but hold your horses
If my next album flops it's back to the post office, both of us, shit
They're saying that's a real possibility
The thought alone is killing me

[Chorus 1]
I think I need to let it go
I need to let it go, uh
I think I need to let it go, let it go, let it go
I think I need to let it go
'Cause nothing even matters...

[Verse 2]
Anticipating rain, I can't make the same mistakes again
Them '90s niggas raped the game
And left us with a battered and bruised bitch with a few kids
The pussy loose but the truth is I love her, though
She ain't perfect, but who is?
Hoes saying "Cole, you is" don't be silly, ma, 'cause really I
Just a born sinner the opposite of a winner
Cole summer, I predict another winter
'Cause I'm fin' ta drop knowledge like a Five Percenter
Fuck the Bilderberg, nigga show 'em God sent ya
Rhyme with the skill, as if Nas went to
College on scholarship met Pac and said "I'm down witcha"
And when they wasn't writin' rhymes they fuckin' line sisters
Puffin' on swishers, what's up Milan?
Every time I drop I get the net poppin' like LeBron swishes
Kay told me kill ya, and I gotta respect my mom's wishes
When I let go this how my mind switches
No looking back, don't even want to see my prom pictures
Pardon the rhyme scheme, I guess I'm long-winded
Let me switch it now, back to Hell's Kitchen now
Up in Hova office like he the fucking principal
Put me in with StarGate, that shit was like detention now
Just tellin' my story so dissin' ain't my intention now
Drop a couple hits and all the dummies pay attention now
A shame when you learn the ins and outs of the game
And reminisce on little Jermaine in the south
Rappin' out loud with all the niggas that's cool to you
Just to realize that all them niggas was foolin' you
And they ain't who they said they were
Talk about the streets but nigga, that ain't really where they were, actin' just like Dede was
But who am I to judge? That's neither here nor there
Just know I know, my nigga, I just like being aware
If I had one wish, I would fuck Tia and Tamera
At the same time and put name tags on they titties
So I don’t get they names wrong, screamin' "Game on"
Like Wayne's World, that just came on
I'm rambling now, five days to finish the album, I'm scramblin' now
Took a break from samplin' now
Just to say a few words to this bitch named Summer
June'll make four years since I gave you my number
The Warm Up dropped, I got hot, you called it a classic
And Jay dropped "Autotune", you wanted him back, shit
Play my position, the whole while still wishin'
A year later Drake put his key in your ignition
And I told my fellas I dropped Friday Night Lights
In the winter just to make her jealous
Wanted to drop the album in the summer, but the label didn't think that they could sell it
Recoup the first week, I think it ain't shit they can tell us
Do you agree?
It's been a long time coming this thing between you and me

[Chorus 2]
I can't let it go
I can't let it go, nah
I think I need to let it go, let it go, let it go
They say I need to let it go
'Cause nothing even matters, ayy

[Outro]
Yeah
June 25th
Born Sinner, bitch

[Verse 1]
Tell me what did I do to make you hate me so much?
Why you angry all the time? Why you don't wanna ride for me?
Girl, we used to make love, when you called, I would follow
Now the only thing you love is a bottle, the only thing you got left is a shadow

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let this shit come between us
I'm wrong you're right
It's okay with my heart
But it's not how it's supposed to be, yeah
You always say, "I'm done, we're finished"
Fuck it, I'm wrong, you're right
Please God, help us
Guess I'ma leave it up to you tonight, oh woah

[Chorus]
She ain't bluffing, she gon' do it
I think it's time for me to face the music
I couldn't really give a damn about my pride
But the way you acting is stupid
You going back and forth
With the lies, never compromise
Girl, if you love me, better prove it
Baby, I can't win, I can't win for losing

[Verse 2]
Don't even matter if you scream and yell
Girl, you don't love me, you don't love yourself
But it don't matter if you raising Hell
I miss you, I wanna kiss you, yeah
I can't remember who you are, babe
Remember when your heart used to say
"Love me, babe, love me, babe"
I know them bitches got in your way but

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let this shit come between us
I'm wrong you're right
It's okay with my heart
But it's not how it's supposed to be, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
She ain't bluffing, she gon' do it (She ain't bluffing)
I think it's time for me to face the music
I couldn't really give a damn about my pride (Give a damn, girl)
But the way you acting is stupid (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You going back and forth
With the lies, never compromise (You never)
Girl, if you love me, better prove it (Better prove it)
Baby, I can't win (Oh-woah), I can't win for losing

[Bridge]
I'm not tryna waste our love
I'm just tryna save what's left of it
One day, one day my love
You gon' realize that you fucked up
And when that day comes, my love
I'm gon' be the same one still loving
How are you gonna cancel me out?
Say I won't listen, but I'm listening now

[Chorus]
She ain't bluffing, she gon' do it
I think it's time for me to face the music
I couldn't really give a damn about my pride
But the way you acting is stupid
You going back and forth
With the lies, never compromise
Girl, if you love me, better prove it
Baby, I can't win, I can't win for losing

[Verse 1]
See this a movement with this music you just tunin' in (yeah)
Units we maneuvering, and you niggas ain't due to win (no)
I'm with some all stars, god we superb
Fly with the words and good for stayin' high off the herb
Minus the herbs, my city's filled with live mother fuckers (Yes)
Where- niggas stack they paper, and you'll die if you touch it
I'm with guys that'll pump shit, and leave you dead
The Feds love how I paint a picture, seem so clear
Shit I'll make your face see through queer, I'm on top of my game
And treat these rappers like prey, I'm on top of the chain (Woah)
I got the heat cuz, heavy in these streets cause
I had a street buzz before I had peach fuzz (Yeah)
You niggas oughta know, I'm chillin' but my squad'll blow
A youngin' with a harder flow will probably get him larger dough (Yeah)
Zonin' blowin' tropical, ownin' me's impossible
I'm movin' on to larger scale, you workin' with a garbage flow

[Hook] (x2)
Niggas know, but they hate, so they act, like they don't
If you think, you gonn' try, I'm right here, what you want?
We can go, hood for hood, block for block, town for town
Niggas know, and that's it, and that's how, it goes down
And Y'all know

[Verse 2]
I maneuver the game, grape coupe swoop for the lane
You dudes losin' the game, state troops move for the cane
You get knocked for this shit
You start talkin' and shit (Woah)
Y'all dudes faking the part, cowards I'm breaking apart (Chyeah)
It be your right hand man that's a snake in the heart (Damn)
He see you holdin' them chips, see you rollin' them whips
And be the type to beef over a bitch- me I'll get another one just roll my dro in a spliff
These clown niggas got me holdin my dick, I'm so cocky
And you can send whoever you want, he won't stop me
I'm a double back, thoroughbred nigga from the PGH (Yes)
Hungry so we need a plate, takin' yours to feed the face
Makin' noise, Wiz Khalifa slayin' the streets
You niggas like Shaq, just started playin' with heat

[Hook]

[Intro]
Mild apprehension
Blank dreams of the coming fun
Distort the odds of a turnaround
Gut screams out next to none
So turn it on, tune it in
And stay inert

[Verse 1]
You say, "I've got the backbone"
The back way to escape the gun
Climbing a tree with a missing limb
And not saving anyone
And now it hurts to stay at home
And see flash

[Chorus 1]
The mirror ball's throwing mold
And you can't get a grip if there's nothing to hold
You see the flash catch a white lily laugh and wilt
And if you must smash a glass first fill it to the hilt

[Verse 2]
Plants, as far as I know, are still
Still bending towards the light
And if we dance until the heart explodes
It will make this place ignite
And even if this hall collapses
I can stand by my pillar of hope
It's just a case of flash delirium

[Bridge]
Here's a growing culture deep inside a corpse
Ages stuck together, taking it to the source
Timeless desperation, pictures on a screen scream
"Hey, people, what does it mean?"
Comfort keeps us nice
So quick to donate everything (nothing arrives)
Die wolken drifting blinding smiles circling (einkreisen)
And time's tingling spines
Attaching hands to floor
The rosy-tinted flash

[Chorus 2]
The hot dog's getting cold
And you'll never be as good as the Rolling Stones
Watch the birds in the airport gathering dirt
Crowd the clean magazine chick lifting up her skirt
Lines when I close my eyes and just (Why close one eye and try to)
Aim blindly at the sun (Pledge allegiance to the sun)
And hear love when the ghosts start singing
(When plastic ghosts start terrorizing everyone)
Terrorizing everyone
And (geometric troops aligning)
(Carried up to the burial mounds) with gold
It's a heavy time but your (My earthbound heart is heavy)
Your rhythm makes it light (Your heartbeat keeps things light)
And explode like a violent star keeps (With the violence forever)
(Threatening the night)
And (even if this hall collapses)
(I can stand by my pillar of hope and trust)
That our heads won't bust

[Pre-Outro]
66 55 red battleships
40 earthlike planets
3 holes 2 tits
1 fork in its side
Zero tears in their eyes

[Outro]
Sue the spiders, sink the Welsh
Stab your Facebook, sell, sell, sell
Undercooked, overdone
Mass adulation not so funny
Poisoned honey, pseudo-science
Silly money, you're my honey!
This might sound strange, this might sound strange to you, to you
I found someone that might just changed my life, yeah
I know, cause she's always on my mind, every night

[Chorus:]
I don't even know her name
I've never seen you up here before
I love what she do
I'm so into you
Cause I love the DJ
I Love the DJ, she's so sexy
I Love the DJ
I Love the DJ, wow wow

It turns me on when you spinning those records for me
I wanna come right up there and grab hold of your body
When ever you here, I know that you gonna play my favourate song tonight
I can feel you working on my mind, you are so fine

[Chorus:]
I don't even know her name
I've never seen you up here before
I love what she do
I'm so into you
Cause I love the DJ
I Love the DJ, she's so sexy
I Love the DJ
I Love the DJ, wow wow
Now you gonna slow down, slow it down, slow it down
For all the lovers in the building yeah
Slow it down, slow it down
Girl we will be in the club forever

Cause I love the DJ
I love the DJ, she's so sexy
I love the DJ
I love the DJ wow wow
Oooh... Oooh... Uh... Woo woo...
Umm... Yeah...

Girl, you're mine, and I thank the Lord for you
Cause ain't no other girl ever did me like you do
And all those times I did you wrong you stayed
Got my back, sheltered me from my enemies
Shared my pain even when it was all because of me
Make me throw up both my hands and say

Oh, there's somethin' religious about you
I wanna testify
There's somethin' church about you
And I just wanna tell the world that you're my girl

Hey, there's somethin' religious about you
Girl, there is
There's somethin' church about you
Tellin' everywhere I go, I want the world to know

There's no other way to explain just how I feel
Kinda like the R in R 'n' B, who's the big deal
And that's why I'm on my knees, oh
Because of you, girl, I repent and change my thuggish ways
Got a playa wakin' up extra early on Sunday
And you always prayin' for me, oh, that's why I say

There's somethin' religious about you
I wanna testify, oh
There's somethin' church about you
And I just wanna tell the world that you're my girl

Oh, there's somethin' religious about you
I can't put my finger on it
There's somethin' church about you
Gonna tell it everywhere I go

You make, you make me better, this is forever
Just say, just say the word
I remember, baby girl, it's whatever

When I was trapped you was the key that set me free
Out the streets, baby, you rescue me, I call you

You're my hero, you're my miracle
You're my miracle, there is no other, no
Baby, you remind me of my mother
And that's why I'm sayin'
There's somethin' religious about you
There is somethin' religious about you
There's somethin' church about you
Somethin' church about you
And I'm glad that you're my girl

Listen, all those times I lied
There's somethin' religious about you
Hey, all those times you forgave me
There's somethin' church about you
I broke your heart and made you cry
Cheated on you and you took me back, yes, you did

It's somethin' religious about you
See I know there somethin' about you
Somethin' church about you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
That you're my girl

There's somethin' religious about you
There's somethin' church about you
Seems like we're done here
Looks like that's everything
She walks by one last time
Checks for her things and leave the keys behind

There will be more tears
As she's beginning to drive away
It's all clear now
There's no real reason to have the pain

Now I know love has kept me here and my pride has kept me here
And hope keeps singing it's alright, I'll be fine

But she'll be going elsewhere
And she'll be lying else where
And she'll be wanted elsewhere
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her

And she'll be living elsewhere
And she'll be laughing elsewhere
And she'll be happy elsewhere
And I'll be just fine without her someday
That's what I keep telling myself
Was it the right thing?
Was this our biggest mistake?
Still call sometimes but she's got nothing to say
And still she stays away

It's got me questioning
If I ever meant the same to her
How could she? Why would she do these things?
Put me through this pain now

If love is what we have then how could it have been so bad
That she don't think it's worth a fight, she won't try

But she'll be trying elsewhere
And she'll be loving elsewhere
And she'll keep secrets elsewhere
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her

And she'll be willing elsewhere
And she will be giving elsewhere
And she'll have feelings elsewhere
But hope keeps saying Kells, you can make it

But in the meantime I can't sleep, I can't think
There's so many things in my head
Things she said, things that she meant
Things that I started feeling the day that she left
Things that I slept on, things that I should have accepted
Things I expected and the things I neglected
I better get up off my
Catch the first flight out and get her back or else

She'll be living elsewhere
And she'll be crying elsewhere
And shell be feeling elsewhere
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her

She'll be smiling elsewhere
And she'll be laughing elsewhere
Giving all of my sweet love away elsewhere
That's the reason why I gotta catch that flight
I'm out of time

[Verse 1]
I ain't a doctor
Can't save a life
To say I could, I'd be outta my mind
I ain't no pro athlete, can't run for miles
That's another thing I won't even try
See there's a lot of things I can't do
Can't hear mistakes, I make a lot of
But in a couple of categories, I do
I blow the competition out of the water

[Chorus]
There's only 2 things, in this world
That I'm the best at, it's true
Number 1 is music, baby girl
Number 2, can't nobody rock your body out
Like I do, like I do, like I do
Can't nobody work your body out
Like I do, like I do, like I do

[Verse 2]
I ain't a painter, ain't got a brush
To paint a portrait of love
I ain't no pilot
Can't take you up
So you can fly through the heavens above
See there's a lot of things I can't do
Can't hear mistakes, I make a lot of
But in a couple of categories, I do
I blow the competition out of the water

[Chorus]
There's only 2 things, in this world
That I'm the best at, it's true
Number 1 is music, baby girl
Number 2, can't nobody rock your body out
Like I do, like I do, like I do
Can't nobody work your body out
Like I do, like I do, like I do

[Verse 3]
I can be your trainer, I can be your trainer
Come to my health club and baby let me train ya

Come to my health club and baby let me train ya
Bend it over, stretch (ooh)

Can't nobody work your body out
Like I do, like I do, like I do

Oh, gonna make your body say

Now, usually I leave the club with a girl who has a man
And take her to the hotel for just a one night stand
See I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates
But much like my Patron man, I'm just tryna take it straight
Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty
Sweetest girl in the world on me and on top of that she's a cutie
I ain't seen nothing like her around here in a while
And if I had a girl she'd be the one to bear my child
Telling myself I'm a player so I keep tryna shake it off
But I keep on seeing this big old house with a picket fence and a dog
Never felt nothing like this, she's more than a mistress
I'm bout to handle my business, the put that girl in my kitchen

[Hook]
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant
(oh, that's what I told her)
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant
(woo, woo, woo)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant,(knock you up)
Pregnant
(Knock you up)

[Tyrese]
Now, all the pretty ladies please line up right next to me
How would you like to go on a little trip with your boy Tyrese
Raise your hand if you want me to fulfill your fantasies
I can have you co-staring, in one of my movies
Tell me what your name is, I can make you famous
We can pop champagne and, and get right down to sexing
Now I ain't got nothing to do, tonight I got away from my crew
I just wanna put something in you
And I can tell that you want it too (ay-ay-ay-ay-ay)
Ay (Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay) and I'm rea-a-a-ady babe
And your rea-a-a-ady babe
So come on ladies, let's get up out of this club

[Hook + Plus Tyrese]
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant
(You make me wanna)
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant

[Robin Thicke]
Oh this song has got me hungry baby, baby
So tell me that you want me baby, baby
And Girl I’ll love you till the sun shines (sun shines)
And girl I promise I will make you mine
Around the world in and out of clubs hanging out chicks
And I don’t see nothing wrong with having a kid
Ooh, ooh, sounds like heaven’s calling us
Ooh, ooh, and girl well that’s bout making love
If you chose me I guarantee
That the rest of your life would be, man drama free
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And get somewhere alone with me
Where there’s no phones to ring, and plant this magic seed

[Hook + Robin Thicke]

Something about being with you makes me wanna a baby
Put them pills on chill and girl give me my baby

In New York meeting with the realtor

[Verse 1]
Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses?
You've been out ridin' fences
For so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
But I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

[Verse 2]
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get

[Verse 3]
Desperado
Oh, you ain't getting no younger
Your pain and your hunger
They're driving you home
And freedom, oh, freedom
Well that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking through this world all alone

[Verse 4]
Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day
You're losing all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes
Away…

[Verse 5]
Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences
Open the gate
It may be rainin'
But there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
(Let somebody love you)
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late

[Talking]
Yup

I'ma tell you right now, nothing is safe!
Let's go, Songz (Songz), That right! (That right)
They gon' have to wait 'cuz I really do kill this shit
Stacks on deck, and baby you know the song
So sing along, c'mon

[Verse 1]

Shawty what it is though, you know who I is though
When we ready you can come, and you can let ya friend go
You can let your friend come too
'Cuz I picture your friend on you (Yup)
Smokin' killa Indo, got it from my kinfolk
Haters what you made for, 'cuz you know you dead broke
What they let you in for, shawty you a ten though
Won't you hop yo ass up in them Benz doors
'Cuz once you let me touch it, ain't no need for discussion
I'ma have yo body buzzin', like an automatic weapon
I know it's a recession, but I'm making an exception, for yo bad ass
If you want that damn bag, then gon' and grab it
You can have it, just one swipe of this here plastic
Girl I bet you won't be stressin', if you let them panties lessin'
I mean lossein' I'm the truth, and just want you fruits and juices
One more look at your pass, throw the deuces (Yup)

[Chorus]

Stacks on deck, that's on my life
You never wear the same thing twice
If you leave with ya boy tonight
You can have whatever you like
Yeah
And you gon' have the best sex of yo life
Twice, three time, four time
We gon' get it on tonight
You can have whatever you like
Yeah

[Verse 2]

We up on that E&G, some bonified drinker
She gave me that brain, she a hella fine thinker
Thought process is sex em from desk to the sink'er
Body so wet, I got her so wet
I be her supplier, she give me the fire
She never get tired, call her in her Energizer Bunny
Funny ride, I got my money right
You can tell what I'm doing, by the tires on my ride
Stretch out so wide, them 26's
Ya'll dudes listen, I'm screw pimpin'
Ya'll sto-pigeons, somethin' like when I'm on stool shittin'
Let me tell you what, ya'll dudes missin'
A bit of my style, a bit of my flow, a bit of my smile, a bit of my clothes
Maybe just a bit of my dough
Any time you want to, pick up the telephone to
Call me to your house, show you what I'm 'bout
I'll be so oblige, now hop up in my ride
With them gold packs, know that's extra L size

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

Tell me what you like, I got it
Tell me what you need, I got it
Tell me what you want, I got it
Tell me what it be, I got it
Supersize, like some fries
Like McDonalds, my big Ronald will make you roll yo eyes back
Tell me can you buy that, tell me can you ride that
Once I get inside, Imma glide like a slide at Water World
You the girl, and I'm the man
So understand

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Hurt, to think that you lied to me
Hurt, way down deep inside of me
And it breaks my heart...

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Get paid a pretty penny for my thoughts
I'm Hardaway with grammar, I'm hot
They only care 'bout a nigga when he handle the rock
Or when he dishing the pill, or when he grippin' the steel
Bailing out my brother, tell the lawyer "get the appeal"
With the flick of the pen, write the check and he out
Two years later he be at my shows checking me out
Know he proud of lil bro and how my records be out
Flashbacks to childhood when he was deckin' me out
Now it's clear lil 'Maine is the best MC out
Hands down, flow water, can't drown
My flow father, go harder, Cole smarter
Shout out to fiends in Queens, I'm team no daughters

[Pre-Hook]
I seen it all at this young age
The only thing left to do is die and hit front page
Should I knock on wood and pray like God forbid?
These hoes be poppin' pills, these niggas be poppin' shit, bitch

[Hook]
Pac on the mic in his prime
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy
Kenny Lofton, you feelin' my pace?
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball, mane
And it breaks my heart
The world’s a stage, I'll just play my part

[Verse 2]
Just caught fire like a young Richard Pryor with unforgettable quotes
They only care 'bout a nigga when tellin' a joke, or when he's sellin' his dope
They tell the reverend "Man, I rather get to heaven with coke
Then live in hell and be broke"
Shout out to black man who beat the odds by yellin' for hope
Today he asked if I could Twitter y'all and tell you to vote
My nigga, how could I, knowing what I know
It's a game of charades, masquerade for the dough
Read the teleprompter these niggas is actors on the low
Yeah I voted for the nigga 'cause he got the best show
Like I got the best flow
On your mark, set, go
Mama got us out the hood but we still ghetto

[Pre-Hook]
I seen it all at this young age
The only thing left to do is die and hit front page
Should I knock on wood and pray like God forbid?
These hoes be poppin' pills, these niggas be poppin' shit, bitch

[Hook]
Pac on the mic in his prime
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy
Kenny Lofton, you feelin' my pace?
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball, mane
And it breaks my heart
The world’s a stage, I'll just play my part

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
I said, you wouldn't know the truth if it was right there in your face
See I can't explain the feeling when the feds surround your place
In that PJ Rosé, I drink that shit by the case
Like somebody pray for me, Reverend Run, Pastor Mase
See I do this for my homie he got caught with a soft eight
When I say a soft eight, yeah that's two less than ten
If they let him out today he gon' do it all again
Say he lost the first time it won't stop until he win
Street life will have you drunk, I'm talkin Seagram’s Gin
Yeah we screamin' Scarface, but we all know how that ends
Every word is like dope, you can snort it like lines
If I said it, then I meant it, they reciting' every line
If I had to write a book, it would be the Life and Times
Every verse is that work, you can weigh it like a nine
You see I lost a lot of niggas and it broke my heart
Life is staged, I just played my part
Haha, yeah

[Hook]
Pac on the mic in his prime
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy
Kenny Lofton, you feelin' my pace?
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball, mane
And it breaks my heart
The world’s a stage, I'll just play my part

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker
Ayy, all you broke nigga be quiet

[Verse 1: J Cole]
I can't control this urge to fuck hoes and splurge
My sidepieces got real jobs, nigga, I don't fuck with no birds
My main chick she got real hair, never had to shop to get hers
Got a neat freak that don't eat meat, but goddamn she rocking them furs
Ball so hard ma'fucker wanna fine me, and now the ho wanna climb me
If real recognize real, that's why it took a motherfucker like Hov to sign me
Ball so hard, I'm the truth, nigga, All-Star game, catching 'oops, nigga
If you a bitch and I'm a bitch, I'm Sheryl Swoopes and you hoops, nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole (2 Chainz)]
Ha, Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker
Ayy, all you broke nigga be quiet

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Cole world, safe to say I'm cold-blooded
In this cold life the more cold you are, seem like the more the hoes love you
So I book a flight, she land today, she leave tonight with no luggage
Got the camera on in my bedroom, shoot the video with no budget, go
Only nigga up in first class, old lady tryna be friendly, ayy
She think I'm in the NBA, why a nigga can't have his MBA?
Next time I'ma flip the script, you know, kick some shit that's gon' shock her
"You're so tall, what team do you play for?" No bitch, I'm a doctor
Flow hella proper, Cole never flopped, nah, float like a propeller, no helicopter shit
Knots thick like a bowlegged chick, stick dick to a gold digger, won't give her dollar, ha
Fuck your 9, I'm a whole different caliber, nigga say they pop 'cause they don't fill they collars up
Read a book get your knowledge up, book a flight get ya mileage up, bitch nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole (2 Chainz)]
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker (2 Chainz)
Ayy, all you broke nigga be quiet

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I'ma start off with these four bars, I'm in a barbie at a sports bar
I'm rockin' gold bars, whoop your ass with this crowbar, I'm like "Oh Boy
Catch your girl off that rebound" (Rebound,) fix her hair up, get her a re-do (Re-do)
Just my car out the paint shop, so I guess that's a mothafuckin' re-coupe (Tell 'em)
Let me demonstrate, gotta think about it 'fore I go on a dinner date
Might eat a rich bitch (Might eat a rich bitch,) yes, I got me expensive taste (Yeah)
Got my pockets on full (Full,) stomach on full (Full,) gun on full, I got full coverage (True)
Niggas don't know the full story, I'm smokin' on gas, full service (Damn)
Money talk, true story, if you ain't got none then don't say shit (Uh)
Banana clips goin' apeshit, you don't make money, don't make sense
I got gold on my bracelet (Bracelet,) got your girlfriend chasin' it (Chasin' it)
Bust a nut in her mouth, so now she can baby sit, uh

[Chorus: J. Cole (2 Chainz)]
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker
Ayy, all you broke nigga be quiet

[Post-Chorus: J Cole]
This liquor I been sippin' got me kissing all these models
And I might not see tomorrow, I might not see tomorrow
Please don't tell my mama I spent my tuition on these bottles
Just to pay back all these loans, man, we gon' have to hit the lotto

[Verse 1: Bas]
They putting prices on heads, silver or lead
I pray the scores settle 'fore the devil notice you dead
Got me smoking the potent, my eyes open and Otis, they red
Thoughts of my eye roam and words that I hoped I had said
That aunty sippin on, we missin ya
Even tho you gone, your thought alone can lift us up
This is us
Got some niggas never call me 'less they need something
But I pick up, like, "whassup, what you need cousin?"
My niggas know that I love 'em
Give 'em roses while they can smell 'em
'Cause ain't no tellin' who'll be here tomorrow
Used to borrow your digital scale
Flippin' them sales
But now it's digital dash while you're still in the past
Boy, trust me when I tell you, the picture got much bigger
The swishers and dutch fill up
Bitches in lust with us
Momma would dissapprove, losing my way
Lost in the sauce, this bolognese is so amazing
Had a talk and she remark: "you so engaging"
Running game, it's all the same
I'm growing jaded
Had a couple things in common, like Lonnie Lynn
But I'm too faded for conversatin'
I'm sittin' here contemplatin' how to win

[Chorus: J. Cole + Bas]
Time keeps slipping away (—how to win), away
Another day another love song, hey
Another day another love song, hey
Time keeps slipping away, away
Another day another love song, hey
Another day another love song, hey

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah
Cousin in jail again, asking me for bail again
Close when I was 12, but I was much frailer then
He was like 16, a nigga from the gutter and
Years ago his favorite uncle had married my mother and
Here we are, runnin' through the Ville like dumb and dumber and
For that summer man I swear I wish you was my brother then
Well time passed and we fell off 'cause you moved back home
Little did you know Jermaine done grew a new backbone
Niggas thought he wouldn't make it 'till he proved that wrong
12 years later on the radio, that "Who Dat" song
Your homeboy bumps the Warm Up now you buggin'
'Cause you looking at the cover and you say "Yo that's my cousin"
And niggas looking at you like you lying but you wasn't
Next thing I know you blowing up my line all a sudden
And I'm showing love saying "yo look what I did
Man, nobody coming from here ever did this shit this big"
But now you saying "Man enough about you
Shit what about me, my nigga what about me?
Oh you forgot about me?
Same niggas showed you how to rap, now you don't know how to act
Boy I'm at the bottom you could pull a nigga out of that
Put me in a video, yo put me on your hottest track
Bring me on the road with you, you know 'cuz got yo back
And I'm strapped up if them niggas act up
See you headed to the top you need to let me catch up
Please let me catch up
Won't you let me catch up man?"
I'll see you when I see you
Harsh as it seems to say, I wouldn't want to be you
Bail you out for your daughter and I pray to God
A nigga never pull your card or she won't ever get to see you

[Chorus]
Time keeps slipping away, away
Another day another love song, hey
Another day another love song, hey
Time keeps slipping away, away
Another day another love song, hey
Another day another love song, hey

[Intro]
Now do I roll up, get higher?
Or po' up, get tired?
Do I roll up, get higher?
Or po' up, get tired? Yeah

[Verse 1]
Okay, I'm back on a mission to pay my tuition
Got loans out the ass, what you know 'bout my past?
I was so late for class, hit the probate, get trashed
Fell asleep off the Henny, back in '08, I crashed
With my foot on the gas, thank the Lord I'm still here
No insurance, so now I'm racin' home on first gear
On that morn' I shed tears, asking what I'm doing here
I should be rich, I'm sick, it's like I got the fuckin' flu in here
But yet I'm just chillin' like I'm back on the yard
My niggas say I'm the truth and when I rap they applaud
That what was my Unsigned Hype like in the back of The Source
It's like I'm tryna get the head, but she just jackin' me off
I needed more
Had to earn stripes, no Adidas store
Put my feet on floor, borrow money from mi amor
Just to cop a microphone, the same one that put me on tour
She held you down, now you out here fuckin' 'round

[Hook: J. Cole]
Now this is for my broke niggas, rich niggas, what?
Gold diggers, Crys sippers, what?
Cold nigga, flow sicker, what?
Muh'fucker, I'm a fuckin' head bussa, go
Coming down on the strip, liqour in the whip
Parking lot pimp, enough game to be sold
Learn from me, fuck bitches, burn money
Someone told me boy you got your whole life to get old
But everything that glitter ain't gold
The grass ain't greener, I've been told
She told me, "Boy you want your cake and eat it too?"
I said "It's cake, that's what you're supposed to do?"

[Verse 2]
Ok my granny just died, but I'm too broke to go
And she asking my fears but she too close to know
Got trust issues I'm trying, where it come from? Don't know
I just block out the pain, blow the fuck up, get dough
See, I thought that would help me, it turns out it's worse now
My girl want her first child, my label won't work out
My mama don't see me unless I'm on TV, I pray she (dont break down)
She strong, but she need me
They killed Saddam, now I wonder who's sane
How you balance being Batman, Bruce Wayne?
Old chick callin', but I'm onto new things
She still a dime, but I always lose change
Young Simba, went from bottom of the food chain to a few chains in a new Range
She tellin' me "So much has happened, would've thought you changed!"
We ain't fuck in nine months its safe to say I'm due man

[Hook]
Now this is for my broke niggas, rich niggas, what?
Gold diggers, Crys sippers, what?
Cold nigga, flow sicker, what?
Muh'fucker, I'm a fuckin' head bussa, go
Coming down on the strip, liqour in the whip
Parking lot pimp, enough game to be sold
Learn from me, fuck bitches, burn money
Someone told me "Boy, you got your whole life to get old."
But everything that glitter ain't gold
The grass ain't greener, I've been told
She told me, "Boy you want your cake and eat it too?"
I said "It's cake, that's what you're supposed to do?"

[Verse]
Yeah
Grew up with killers, I ain't know they was killers
We was just together, man, playing Mega Man on Sega, man
Your mama loved me to death, she reminded me of Afeni
Yeah, a real black queen, if I had a genie
I'd wish that she ain't struggle no more
Y'all wouldn't have to go to sleep with all the roaches if she wasn't so poor
You told me when you came to my house, the shit was like a timeout
From reality, one night you asked me what I'm crying 'bout
'Cause you was staying over for the weekend
I woke up from out my sleep when I heard mama and my stepfather beefin'
I don't know if he'd been drinkin', but I know that shit got loud
And I heard rumbling from struggling and rolling on the ground
Could never get used to that sound, my mama saying "Get off me!"
My tears is tumbling now, I wish that you never saw me, 'cause I
Felt like a coward, so powerless I was only 12
I wish I would've bust right through that door my fucking self
And grabbed the Glock right off the fucking shelf, if nothing else
Scared the nigga shitless, there goes two of my wishes
Forever scarred, determined to get some heart
No matter how big the nigga, no matter how small you are
Fast forward to our older years, two different paths
You used to talk to me 'bout college, but that shit didn't last
Wasted potential, getting cash, what could I say?
So tired of not having things, you'd never see it my way, too proud to fold
Your demise, one day much to my surprise
My nigga called me, told me you just caught a body twice your size
I asked if it was self-defense, he said it was defense of pride
And that they tryna give you ten, but if you lucky you'll do five, damn
Not my nigga, the same one that told me
That things always get better, just trust me, don't cry my nigga
The news call him a killer, but he my nigga
Sad shit, aye yo, genie last wish, free my nigga
Dear Till Family:

As a recording artist, I have always been interested in word play. My lyrics often reference people, places and events in my music, as well as the music that I create for or alongside other artists

It has come to my attention that lyrics from my contribution to a fellow artist’s song has deeply offended your family. As a father myself, I cannot imagine the pain that your family has had to endure. I would like to take a moment to acknowledge your hurt, as well as the letter you sent to me via your attorneys

Moving forward, I will not use or reference Emmett Till or the Till family in my music, especially in an inappropriate manner. I fully support Epic Record’s decision to take down the unauthorized version of the song and to not include the reference in the version that went to retail. I will not be performing the lyrics that contain that reference live and have removed them from my catalogue

I have tremendous respect for those who paved the way for the liberty and opportunities that African-Americans currently enjoy. As a business owner who employs several African-American employees and gives philanthropically to organizations that help youth to pursue their dreams my ultimate intention is to uplift rather than degrade our community

Best
Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr
Lil Wayne
Well the song says no one man should have all that power right?

There’s definitively been times I let
Let power, get the best of me…
And let the world take the rest of me
I look in the mirror and say
“God, is this, is this my destiny?
Is this what I’ve done
After all the years of you blessin’ me?”
Well maybe this is just a moment
A moment of you all testin’ me
To see if I can still act professionally
To keep me at bay
Like the Chesapeake
Guess it’s me
Just a ‘G
From the C.I.,
Honest… And why?

Why would you give me that Power?
Knowing I was just an artist
Knowing exactly where my heart is
And I will only work the hardest
And sometimes, put art, before being the smartest
And sometimes act retarded
Just look at what I started
And they wanted me to be dearly departed
Die, nigga die, and I had no reply
And I still looked her in the eyes
And said that I could touch the sky
And after all the drama
I wonder where I would be if I still
Had my Momma, Common
And everybody I was promising around me
You know how niggas from Chi town be, sometimes we wild
Act like a child
Get fouled
Stay in style
As of now …?
... flows through the veins of a modern day
Pharaoh. In American Apparel
Standing down the barrel of the media
For the man that face never made it in the encyclopedia
His story, His glory
…and they re-write history right in front of us - in front of us
But what happens?
When one of us is on the other side of that T.V. screen?
You know what I’m sayin’. Real niggas you know what I mean
- you know what I mean
- you know what I mean
- you know what I mean

Or at least that’s what I thought
But when they sayin’ “Hey that’s what the real nigga do, right?”
Naw not right, that’s just mean, that’s just me that’s not, right
Now how long did it take me to realize?
And open up my fucking eyes!
That this shit is just a disguise
All the fame!
And the power!
And the hour!
In the showers!
Of the diamonds!
And the jewels!
And the gold!
Everybody say you cold!
Everybody screaming at mothafucking shows
And you know what?
You wake up in the morning
And in awe you’re a real person
And worse you got the …?...
Got a little bit harder
A little bit more insignificant
You was the terrific shit
Buying expensive shit
Last year worked for Louis or Ford
Too much for me to even record
The only thing I had to do was get my heart out
The greatest blessing in the world is the fact you let me get my art out
The fact that you accepted me and didn’t neglect me
Even when I was a …?...
Even when I went to these meetings straight dolo
I had to go solo. I used to have a group
That group used to wear Adidas and
…?... and then I got stupid and left them niggas
And said I’m better than ya’ll when it was true
Now when I finally got the power man what the fuck did I do?

And I’m so sorry to ya'll, how every one of ya’ll had to fight for my name
Every one of ya’ll a year ago, that all waited for this change
Everyone who said “Kanye is that nigga, quit talkin’ names”
And all ya'll: I am the one to blame
And the people that I-I-I, let down
I want to tell you right here - right here, right now
That I’m a new man that understands why people abusing the power
*Crowd erupts drowning out the lyrics*

And make more music for the world to love!
And there’s so many people I could thank there’s my Mom and God and above
So all ya’ll, and everybody throw your hands in the sky!
Everyone touch the sky before the day never dies! Dies!

No one man should have all that power!
They say no one man should have all that power!
They say no one man should have all that power!
They say no one man should have all that power!

?...drums, give it to em or something right quick!
(Drum Solo)
{Kanye West}
Feel good, right?
Uh-uh
Kalil, keep time with that
Let's add some
1-2-3-4 let's go!
(Crowd claps along)
{Kanye}
In about 2 more bars
I want you to give me a ? you feel, right
Create (crank?) a feel, I want the whole building ? like ?
Let's go
(Drums intensify)
{Kanye}
They say no one man should have all that power
The clocks ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
No one man should have all that power
The clocks ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
(Crowd cheers)

Exclusive swave
Swavey
Ayo swavey, we did it to them

[Verse 1]
Every day stuntin', lil' buddy, gettin' money, you ain't never seen another one
Every girl love me, but there's only one me, there will never be another one
Oh my, so fly that I'm feelin' like flack yo feelings
Got stacks, stacks, stacks of that money at the top of the ceilin'
And a nigga do swerve, in the places of the world you ain't never been thought of
And a kid do ball like my nigga name Jordan and I'm Vince Carter
I could holla when you with her, she say don't like niggas, well I told her me either
And I like it like 12, I get all the white girls call me Justin Bieber

[Chorus]
Girl, pull back the curtains, let's have laid back fun
You ain't never done it in a Maybach
Girl, pull back the curtains, let's have laid back
You ain't never done it in a Maybach

[Verse 2]
Why you doin' that there? Why you wearin' that dress? Did you do that for me?
And if I look sexy, then nigga, my car is a flackin' Porsche
Break it down, say it loud, let me lay ya down, we can do it all out
Let me get into position, then maybe you can switch it and try to show me what you all 'bout
Got girls, got niggas, got hoes, got purp, got bitches on deck, boy
But a nigga gettin' at it, when ya love a nigga tatted from my wrist to my neck boy
Yeah I'm tryna get studded but a kid that stay stuntin' ain't nothin' on a lay back
Told her put a her tongue here and done it in a Maybach

[Hook]
Girl, pull back the curtains, let's have laid back fun
You ain't never done it in a Maybach
Girl, pull back the curtains, let's have laid back
You ain't never done it in a Maybach
Done it in a Maybach
Done it in a Maybach
Done it in a Maybach

[Bridge]
Baby, with me, you can ride with the stars
Whatever you need, I got it in my car
Baby, with me, you can ride with the stars
Whatever you need, I got it in my car, got it in my car

[Chorus]
Girl, pull back the curtains, let's have laid back fun
You ain't never done it in a Maybach
Girl, pull back the curtains, let's have laid back
You ain't never done it in a Maybach
Done it in a Maybach
Done it in a Maybach
Done it in a Maybach

[Verse]
Why'd you cut holes in the face of the moon base?
Don't you know about the temperature change in the cold black shadow?
Are you mad at your walls or hoping that an
Unknown force can repair things for you?
Pardon all the time that you've thrown into your pale gray garden?
If your ship will never come, you gotta move along

[Chorus]
Even a bird would want a taste of dirt from abyssal dark
The prick of a feather could make a kingdom burn
And the bloodshed start the falling apart
Made me a shadow in the shape of wonder the waves of black
If she's going under, I can hold my breath till the sky comes back
Or drown like a rat, rat, rat
He's a rat

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
To catch a monster, we make a movie
Set the tempo and cut and cut its brains out
It will inspire on the burning pyre
Half the distance, half the motion
Communication is easy as the ocean

[Verse 1]
I like the line between your belly and your thighs
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)
The smell of your hair, the sparkle in your eyes
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)
The smoke in your breath, the breathing hard and heavy
The back of your neck, the shine on your Chevy
The moon was so big when I drove it to the levy, girl
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)

[Chorus]
I found blood and I saw stars
All in the backseat of your car
And I told you it was love
But you don't wanna know the truth
I’m a young man in my prime
And my heart still filled with fear
And it goes on clear

[Verse 2]
The clean dreams, the sexy limousine
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)
Jason's got the energy, he used to be a coke fiend
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)
The skinny brown arms coming out of your shirt
Heart is in the right place, brain is in the dirt
You live life like everyone's an enemy
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)

[Chorus]
I found blood and I saw stars
All in the backseat of your car
And I told you it was love
But you don't wanna know the truth
I’m a young man in my prime
With my heart still filled with fear
And it goes on clear

I found blood and I saw stars
All in the backseat of your car
And I told you it was love
But you don't wanna know the truth
I’m a young man in my prime
With my heart still filled with fear
And it goes on clear

[Outro]
I found blood and I saw stars
All in the backseat of your car
And I told you it was love
But you don't wanna know the truth
I’m a young man in my prime (that's right)
With my heart still filled with fear
And it goes on clear
And it goes on clear
And it goes on clear

[Verse 1]
It's not a silly little moment
It's not the storm before the calm
This is the deep and dying breath of
This love that we've been working on
Can't seem to hold you like I want to
So I can feel you in my arms
Nobody's going to come and save you
We pulled too many false alarms

[Chorus]
We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

[Verse 2]
I was the one you always dreamed of
You were the one I tried to draw
How dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
I'll make the most of all the sadness
You'll be a bitch, because you can
You try to hit me, just to hurt me
So you leave me feeling dirty
'Cause you can't understand

[Chorus]
We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

[Bridge]
Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?

[Chorus]
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Burning room

[Outro]
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?

[Verse]
Yeah
Uh, eatin' shawarma, doin' drawings of Chewbacca
Bumpin' Flocka, fuck the drama
Marijuana been as calmin' as the fuckin' Dalai Lama
Your style common as a little league sponsor from retarded kid's fathers
I'm at meetings, shakin' hands and addin' commas to my net worth
Talk about my money please, and feelings might just get hurt
This the same effect and less words
Chillin' with this asshole, he call himself Sweatshirt
I think this might be some of my best work
I let these bitches dive in, but it's head first
Applyin' pressure when I put together letters
I'm a king, I'm a myth, beat a bitch down with my scepter
These Fendi treasures feelin' better than a million sweaters in Alaska
Your raps are corny as Nebraska
Lacksa-daisical bars, my throwaways will trash ya
High as NASA on acetone
Acid foam, talkin' trash like John McEnroe
You a little bitch, it's what the fuckin' cabbage patch is fo'
Watch me smack a ho
Turn around and catapult up above my castle's moat
Right into my fuckin' throne
Yo, this man is dapper, manufactured in hell
You candy rappers goddamn disasters, myself, I'm chillin'
Clubhouse, I'm demandin' passwords so villains can't infiltrate
This type of lifestyle that one simulates
My bitch is great, had a dinner date with William Gates
He took her to his big estate, the bitch flipped the safe
Slid, escaped through the kitchen, bang, dipped it down the interstate
Handed me the money, started suckin' me off
This a full-blown virus, we don't fuck with a cough
Made money off the white without touchin' the soft, I'm in there
Million dollars, I been there, 'bout a few times
Mulan, she on the futon, tryna do lines
This coupe, I'm in, highway about a buck fifty
Middle finger out the window, who wanna fuck with me?
I told Dom's and Hodgy, "Stop poppin' molly"
Tryna blow up and die: some real kamikazes
Young fisherman sinkin' in Lake Michigan
Innocence, voice of an angel, some Minnie Riperton
Exquisite bitch, gettin' lit, live from the Wimbledon
Still sinnin', this ill pimpin' is Bill Clinton
She butt-naked swimmin', I'm payin' her no attention
Workaholic, got a TV show
I know you seen the crib, nasty since a youngin' mind
Sanitary birth, watch a beat get buried in a hurst
Yeah, I kill myself
Mac hippie analog, you rap midi, turn the camera's off
I made you snap and slap your bandana off
Your bitch greet me like I'm Santa Clause, mouth wide
I'm high as a satellite, see
I'm in ancient Greece, gettin' head from Aphrodite
Mac is mighty, got a bunch of whitey's actin' like me
I set the bar high
This a bizarre ride, word to Pharcyde
In plaid pants, hit a hole-in-one on the par-five
Eyes closed, drinkin' whiskey, let the car drive
These hoes thirsty, see the dick and they large-eyed
The rawest rapper, baby forehead autographer
On top of Saturn, I'm sendin' shots from a rocket blaster
Believe me, this is where geniuses live
It's Most Dope, be holier than all of Jesus's kids
But we speakin' to heathens and all of these Even Stevens who don't need a reason
Just want a bitch they can feed with semen
No need for sleepin', cheeba gon' keep me dreamin', I'm faded
Been in Cali a little too long, it got me jaded
Hit Japan and I'm Instagramin' camera shy samurais
Fuckin' up a Jerm beat, teach you how to vandalize
The bandana Santana tied
My sound amplified
Screams on Kennywood's Steel Phantom rides
My pockets fat, still lookin' for some pants my size
They over-analyze everything I fantasize
We could have a conversation, we could pantomime
Or you could come a little closer, put your hand in mine
This life a prison, time to set you free
Watchin' movies in silence, describin' what I see
Word

[Pre-Chorus]
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew

[Chorus]
Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones

I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
Or have they given up and all gone home to bed
Thinking those who once existed must be dead

[Chorus]
Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones

[Pre-Chorus]
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew

[Chorus]
Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be lived with you
Lived with you
There's a way everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, ain't got you? Hey babe

[Chorus]
You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
In my brain
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
And I'm blind, so so sorrily blind
I'm a man, can't you see
What I am
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, ain't got? Hey babe

[Chorus]
You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

Oooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Chorus: Barry Gibb & Robin Gibb]
You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you
(Noo noo no-no nooo nooooo)

[Outro]
You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

[Verse 1]
When the world has turned
Paralyzed and wrong
Cold blooded claws never offered
Anything at all
Past the point of love
Shattered and untied
Waiting to pick up the pieces
That make it all alright

[Chorus 1]
But pieces of what?
Pieces of what?
Pieces of what
Doesn't matter anymore

[Verse 2]
Moonlight on my floor
Shining through the roof
They got the city surrounded
As if I needed proof
I forgot my fear
Feelings on the rise
Buried by all of the pieces
Falling from the sky

[Chorus 2]
But pieces of what?
Pieces of what?
Pieces of what
We used to call home
Pieces of what
We used to call home

[Outro]
Lay my dragon's teeth
And shallow water steel
At the Belgian gates
I waited for my meal

[Verse 1]
T'was down in Mississippi, not so long ago
When a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a Southern door
This boy's dreadful tragedy I can still remember well
The color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till

[Verse 2]
Some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up
They said they had a reason, but I can't remember what
They tortured him and did some things, too evil to repeat
There was screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds out on the street

[Verse 3]
Then they rolled his body down a gulf, amidst a bloody red rain
And they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain
The reason that they killed him there, and I'm sure it ain't no lie
Was just for the fun of killing him and to watch him slowly die

[Verse 4]
And then to stop, the United States of yelling for a trial
Two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till
But on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime
And so this trial was a mockery, but nobody there seemed to mind

[Verse 5]
I saw the morning papers but I could not bear, to see
The smiling brothers walking' down the courthouse stairs
For the jury found them innocent, and the brothers they went free
While Emmett's body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea

[Verse 6]
If you can't speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that's so unjust
Your eyes are filled with dead men's dirt, your mind is filled with dust
Your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and your blood it must refuse to flow
For you to let this human race fall down so God-awful low!

[Verse 7]
This song's just a reminder to remind your fellow man
That this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan
But if all of us folks that thinks alike, if we give all we could give
We'd make this great land of ours a greater place to live

[Verse 1]
In the name of it's for you I
Bought it all and it's all untrue I
Know, I'm a little slow
Desperate and it shows

[Verse 2]
In the name of spend-istry
Burning bush and a busted knee you
Stole, all the rain and snow

[Chorus]
Who will be my Eskimo
It's what I wanna know
It's time to undergo
Somewhere in Mexico
I'm making room for you
A simple point of view
Someone too deeper to

[Post-Chorus]
Aw
Searching for an eskimo
Searching and I wanna know, someone, like you
What did they say
Desperate and I gotta go
Searching for an eskimo, someone, like you

[Verse 3]
In the name of Jesus Christ I
Sold my son and I named my price I
Sold, just a little low

[Chorus]
Who will be my eskimo
That's what I wanna know
Before I undergo
Somewhere in Mexico
I'm making room for you
A simple point of view
Someone too deeper to

[Post-Chorus]
Ooooooh aw
Searching for an eskimo
Searching and I wanna know, someone, like you
Hey hey hey
Desperate and I gotta go
Searching for an eskimo, someone, like you

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
In the name of Oscar Wilde I
Saw the mess and I saw he smiled I
Go, toe to toe in the whole
World to find an eskimo

[Verse 1]
Kick back a little just to watch and see
Gettin' sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk
On the brink of sinkin' baby, but not yet sunk
How I listened, low when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
I wish it were so when you told me
That you were solid gold

[Verse 2]
Gravity-free is she, look at her
Highness on a mattress full of anti-matter
You never left a very mellow impression
Your smell or your go to hell expression
Quixoticelixer might
But it probably will not fix your bite
Tell me now, tell me how did I get
Your lipstick on my kite?

[Chorus]
I love this weather, it's a perfect storm
(Come back, come back, hey la la)
Just keep it comin' in its perfect form
(Come back, come back, hey la la)
I love this weather 'cause it keeps me warm
(Come back, come back, hey la la)
Just keep it comin' in its perfect form
(Come back)

[Verse 3]
Everyday depression in a beautiful dress
Oh, lady made a beautiful mess I guess
Dedicated mind in a medicated state
Is a highly overrated fate
Terrible is a soul, when she told me
That there is such a thing
Do you know that you glow when you go
From winter into spring

[Chorus]
I love this weather, it's a perfect storm
(Come back, come back, hey la la)
Just keep it comin' in its perfect form
(Come back, come back, hey la la)
I love this weather 'cause it keeps me warm
(Come back, come back, hey la la)
Just keep it comin' in its perfect form
(Come back)

[Bridge]
The madder the boy, the sadder the song
That's a wicked fate but the sick get strong
Mad boy, sad song
A wicked fate, but the sick get strong
Nobody's right and everyone's wrong
I refuse to punt on fourth and long
Mad boy, sad song
Wicked fate but the sick get...

[Verse 1]
Kick back a little just to watch and see
Gettin' sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk
On the brink of sinkin' baby, but not yet sunk
How I listened, low when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
I wish it was so when you told me
That you were solid gold

[Outro]
I swear to god I could not hurt you
I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you
I stand before then there's no curfew
I long to be inside your virtue
My heart is swollen when I search you
I swear to god I could not hurt you (no)
My heart is swollen when I search you (no)
I swear to god I could not hurt you (no)
I swear to god I could not hurt you (no)
I've got to be inside your virtue (no)
I can't contain my urge to search you (no)

[Verse 1]
And there were future reflections
On the face and the hands
On a green colored island
On a primitive man
It was the future reflecting
It felt familiar but new
A street was missing a building
The kids had something to do

[Chorus 1]
There was a feeling the spirit was leaving
Red like a marker
So my tribe, with my knife
Cut the heart from a lonely life

[Verse 2]
I saw patterns on floorboards
Deep in the dust was a leader
Someone was walking on floorboards
Turning from oak into cedar
He can assess the situation
I wrapped a string around my finger
Into the forest with the young ones
I don't expect to be a winner

[Chorus 2]
But as long as you feel it, I'm a believer
My heart is phosphor
Sea rolls and death tolls
Break the surface, don't break my bones
Off of the trail and off of your hands and
Onto a new plan
Is the cost to stay lost
Forever in an empty skin
Pale and thin

[Bridge]
If it's good, or if it's fortune, I can't tell
But pieces come together for some reason just as well
Their guns couldn't see us, there's a sea outside my door
And one day I'll appreciate the rush of blood and the washed out beat of the shore

[Outro]
And remember what it felt like
To be alone
Sitting in the sunlight
All alone

[Verse 1]
I feel your racing heart
My liquid silver arms extended
These waves aren't far apart
Black gold in claw foot tubs unchanging

[Chorus 1]
I am fire, where's my form?
Whisper crimson I intrude
There's light beneath your eyes
New overtones in view
Endless form, endless time

[Verse 2]
If what they say is true
You are a shadow in the fourth dimension
To float away with you
We see the corners where nothing happens

[Chorus 2]
While we drifted, we were one
Ceilings lifted walls were gone
You speak the language of the breeze
All your leaves were meant for me
The love that every person wants to be

[Bridge]
Stuck together, I don't like revealing secrets
I'll live inside your lips if you won't laugh
My heaving hands on rotten fruit at last
Fallow fingers, there's a surface I can count on
She'd fit inside my heart and take it over
Till her cape got blown into my red lungs
Either there's a purpose
Or I'm heading out at breakfast
Take a drink, take a drag
One more coffee, ugly hat
No more mirrors, woolen bag
And I am gone

[Vocalization]

[Intro: Que]
9 time out of 10 I’m probably fucking with some hoes
At the strip club playing "eeny meeny miny moe"
Walk in side the booty club, I’m picking any one I want
9 times out of 10 I’m probably fucking with some hoes

[Hook: Que]
9 time out of 10 I’m probably fucking with some hoes
At the strip club playing "Eeny meeny miny moe"
Walk in side the booty club, I’m picking any one I want

Eeny meeny miny moe, eeny meeny miny moe
Eeny meeny miny moe, eeny meeny miny moe
Eeny meeny miny moe, eeny meeny miny moe"

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
50 thousand hanging from my earlobe
With a bank account that most niggas would kill for
Stupid retarded crib, and all my whips clean
Rocking some Jays that don’t come out 'til 2015
I’m moonwalking bitch, yeah I’m Michael Jackson Thriller fresh
Slipped inside the Mirror, saw a pimp nigga in the flesh
Spray some Polo cologne, to match my Polo socks
Now Coke bottle bitches, make your soda pop
And drop it like I ain't ever seen you drop it before ho
Drop it for a legend or this DTP logo
Drop it for a little free marketing and promo
And let me Instagram this photo

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Scrolling through my Ho-lodex "eeny meeny miny moe", let’s see what hoe is next
So many to choose from, I can’t make up my mind
But whoever I pick better get up on the dick real quick, don’t waste my time
'Cause I got shit to do, so I’m just bout to smash
Soon as I’m through with you, back to counting this cash
I’m hung low to all these women, I’m their antidote
And when they on my dick look like they riding a banana boat
But on they period, I don’t want them mislead
So it’s a sign by my bed that say “No turn on red”
Treating women like spades, I’m so unstoppable
Just tying to leave the club with 'bout 3 and I’m possible

[Hook: Que]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Whattup French? Holla at 'em
Coke Boys in the house that cost a house
Disturbing The Peace, smoking that loud
Throw up 50 like nothing 'cause bitch I’m worth 20 Ms
Brick throwing got your bitch jumping like Shawn Kemp
Got a neck full of gold, fresh out the 'lympics (bling)
Stack never fold, pussy clap on the pole
Louis tax counting mills, Louis on that field
Coming fresh out the corner now he on that hill
With your, bitch, blowing smoke nigga
I ain’t, gang, banging, but Luda that’s my folk nigga
9 times out of ten house money I spend
Take your bitch and her friends
Montana

[Verse 1]
It can't pay attention
What slips into the system
A light touch, a whisper that puts you to sleep
Don't sympathize with the mystery disease
All it is is a feeling
Pain in a dress too revealing
A lost bond
An old friend who likes what it sees
You can't shake off the mystery disease

[Verse 2]
Lovers in a past life
Meet in the street close to midnight
A last look
Sweet like the end of a dream
Then fall back into the mystery disease
Go on, tell your symptoms to me
It's not in any of the books you can read
It's no fun to face what you don't get to be
But what's one more to the mystery disease?

[Verse 3]
Floating impatience
Snuffs my limited sapience
Black smoke as soon as the pressure's released
Deep space sighs, the Mystery Disease
Consumed by a weakness
Cut with perpetual unrest
You see stars, sunsets blurred through a screen
Trap what you want
Waste what you need

[Outro]
And when the west wind sweeps through the leaves
Emperors of history fall to their knees
Small fronds can't see the wood for the trees
Left in the dust of the mystery disease

[Intro]
What?
What you tryna say?
You know that's mine
That's my pussy!

[Verse 1]
Baby, why you keep doing shit?

[Verse 2]
Girl, I'm fucked up off that good, bitch, I know you see me calling
I'm blowing up your phone, tryna fuck you 'til the morning
That kitty crying tears, I go longer while I'm on the shit
Baby, bring it here, I'ma lick it just how you want it
You got me paying all your bills
Fuck around and take care of your kids
Love it when you put that thing on me
Hit it from the back and I give you chills
All I want is that pussy, girl, lemme get it
You know I own that cookie, you love it, you love it

[Chorus]
Don't make me have to tell you (Oh) again (Yeah), that that's my pussy, baby (That's mine)
You better not give it away way, way, way, way, way (You better not)
Don't make me have to tell you again, that's my pussy, baby

Lunch with a few Mai Tais
Purple kisses on my tie
Life can’t really predict love

No injection, I learned my lesson

Runnin’ through your mind like Jackie Joyner
Pussy pop like (boom!) go get me a burner

Baby, say goodnight
Text me when you get home safely
Like you always did when we was first dating

[Verse 1]
You're sittin' in your office, dreamin' of a different life
You say you wanna make me smile and see my wild side
If we don't leave town now
We're never gonna get out of here alive
I'm walkin' home from school
My thoughts are drifting into space
Why don't we leave tonight
And take off to a different place?
Don't tell my daddy why
Gotta get on that plane and just fly

[Chorus 1]
Take me to Paris
Let's go there and never look back
Paris (ooh), we can be crazy like that
You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid?
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to Paris
(Ooh, la-la, ooh, la-la)
(Ooh, la-la, ooh, la-la)

[Verse 2]
I wanna be that fantasy that you got on your mind
Flying across the sea to somewhere that they'll never find
We should go while we're young
'Cause one day, we will want to rewind

[Chorus 2]
To our time in Paris
Take me to Yves Saint Laurent
Paris (ooh), make out in a dark restaurant
We'll dance until we die
Why not go out every night?
Promise we won't say goodbye

[Chorus 1]
Take me to Paris
Let's go there and never look back

Why you taking that Polaroid?
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to Paris

(Ooh, la-la, ooh, la-la)

[Bridge]
Walking through the streets at dawn
We dance by empty carousels
Singin' at the Sacré-Cœur
And climbing up the Tour Eiffel
Under the stars, we are, we are
Dreaming (of Paris)

[Breakdown]
You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid?
Put on a show you'll enjoy

[Chorus 2]
Take me to Paris (ooh)
Take me to Yves Saint Laurent
It's Paris (ooh), make out in a dark restaurant
We'll dance until we die
Why not go out every night?
Promise we won't say goodbye
Take me to Paris

Bougie bitch, she’s super ratchet, keep that gat like inspector gadget
Hood nigga, I’m super classy, she can’t pass no beauty pageant
But she got stupid ass, me and my gas a gangster package
Headed to the package store, I had to drop off that extra baggage
4-5 on me, 50 racks, so yeah my pants got extra saggage

Guwop in this bitch, pour a doo-wop in this bitch
And I’m bringing trap rap back in hip-hop in this bitch
I said bitch stop when my 'rarri stop, I had to go get some blunts
Call me Gucci Mane, Gucci 2 Times
But I only can fuck you once, bitch

All my niggas got money on ‘em
Couple these niggas got warrants on ‘em
All these niggas got pistols on ‘em
Your ho got your eyes on ‘em
All these niggas got pending charges
All these niggas got suspended licenses
All my niggas got stupid goons
And all my niggas be super icy
Super, super duper icy
Walking, wanna ?
Yo ho keep on looking at me
Caught you emotional, looking frightened

‘Cause half of these niggas out here be biting
Gucci Mane cool and the boy go fool
But I swear to God, man, I don’t like it
When I see the nigga I’mma shoot him up
Better bring your gun and leave your Nikes
Take my advice might save your life
Nigga, make my day, don’t see your night
Nigga, pray every day before you leave your house
Get killed in your boots ‘cause you life ain't right
Gucci Mane I'm a real dirty nigga
All my niggas talk dirty pistols, ? in 30 minutes
Seeing them smoke 200 swishers
Came to the club like 50 niggas, but we snuck in 200 pistols
Life full of product, got a pocket full of molly
And that goddamn bitch gonna ?

Guwop in this bitch, pour a doo-wop in this bitch
And I’m bringing trap rap back in hip hop in this bitch
I said bitch stop when my 'rarri stop, I had to go get some blunts
Call me Gucci Mane, Gucci 2 Times

All these niggas got pending charges
All these niggas got suspended licenses
All my niggas got stupid goons
And all my niggas be super icy

Call me Gucci Mane, Gucci two times
But I only can fuck you once, bitch

[Verse 1]
We're living in a joke time, metaphorical coke time
Commerce and girl men
Run the whole world men
Bold, drunken debauchery
Old world brutality
Cold world killed softly
Whole world run savagely
Greedy men and pride fiends
Program TV screens
Quick scam and drag queens
Real life's been blasphemed
Think twice its past dream
Crime if you ask clean
Quick fast the poison has entered the blood stream
Psychological massacre
Consequences are tragedy
Mythological characters
Men and women as parody

Experience manufactured
In this neurotic, toxic society

[Verse 2]
It's like post war they're looking for the communists or who the Marxist is
10,000 pictures on Facebook
That's like the pot calling the kettle narcissist
Come on really
Saying the devil but you're the chief arsonist
Hypocrites can't even see their own part in this
No reflection
Vampire paradigm
No introspection
This star that star rants has a breakdown
3 months before, pure obsession, picture can't take down
Children it's a shake down
They're just looking for a sacrifice
They've been doing this since before Bobby Darrin sang Mack the Knife
Before James Dean's car did a jack knife
Perhaps because they lack life or lack guts
Never confuse the head with the butt
Opinions are like assholes and most of them stink
I was told by a woman so rethink
Don't ever let them to lead you to drink
Lead you to doubt
Lead you to fall
Get up stand up
(And) cast Lucifer out
Shake it up baby
Watch them twist and then shout
Insecure assholes just looking for a ticket
To ride on somebody
Like the Pick It
It's fucking wicked
Shame on a 'nuh'
This neurotic, toxic society!
Sick psycho psychology
In desperate need of psychiatry
Exorcisms, sobriety
Forcing
Social lobotomies
People stuck in dichotomies
Pseudo sicko anxieties
Serial criminals dressed in variety
Social transvestism
Subliminal dressed up as piety
Transference, projections
Like Cartesian images
Robbing innocence
Stealing inheritance
Quiet victims with no defense
Betrayed over dollars and cents
Maladjusted and ignorant
Mal addiction and dissonance
Too much addiction no consciousness
Don't trust it
This cosmology's busted, broken
And returns to the dust
It stinks of corruption
Oppression, deceit
Abuse in repeat
They don't feel complete
Unless they're misleading/robbing the sheep
Man is not a product if you call him that then stop it!
In this Neurotic, dominant society

[Verse 1: André 3000]
I, I, I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bed
Oh, and you, you and your head high
And your tears dry - get on without your guy

And I, I, I went back to a anew
So far removed from all we've been through
Oh-oh-oh, and you and you and you
You tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I'd go back to her
And you go back to...
You go back to...

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I, I love you much - it's not enough
I love blowing you lovepuff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...
I go back to black

[Outro: Jorma Taccone]
No wait, that's gross

[Chorus]
I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?
I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?

[Verse 1]
Tell me how you love me more
And how you think I'm sexy, baby
That you don't want nobody else
You don't want this guy, you don't want that guy
You wanna touch yourself when you see me
Tell me how you love my body
And how I make you feel, baby
You wanna roll with me, you wanna hold with me
You wanna stay warm and get out of the cold with me
I just love to hear you say it
It makes a man feel good, baby
Tell me you depend on it, I need to hear it

[Chorus]
I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?
I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?

[Verse 2]
Baby, you're the perfect shape
Baby, you're the perfect weight
Treat me like my birthday
I want it this way, I want it that way, I want it
Tell me you don't want me to stop (Don't stop)
Tell me it would break your heart
But you love me and all my dirty
You wanna roll with me, you wanna hold with me
You wanna make fires and get Norwegian wood with me
I just love to hear you say it
It makes a man feel good, baby

[Chorus]
I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you baby?
I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?

[Bridge]
Cause you will tell me every morning
Ooh, alright, baby
Oh, yeah, oh, baby
Oh, darling, alright

[Chorus]
I'm lost without you! Can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?
I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?

[Outro]
Ooh yeah, oh baby
Oh darlin', all right-right
Oh baby, oh darlin'
Ooh, ooh, baby, all right-right
Yeah

Back there hatin' on that man, nigga, quit hatin', nigga
Pussy

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
As I step in the door, you in your bathrobe
Pour you a little more wine, I see your glass low
Scared of a real man, from dealing with these assholes
Just drink ya wine and then will step up in the bath, slow
Soak your body, cause its begging for a loving touch
Light the candle, and ima light another Dutch
Then we slip into a place that's only you & me
Put it deep, like the bottom of the bluest sea
You too young to be locked down, truancy
Always got ya hair down, rockin your jewelry
Killing these other bitches, word, reading their eulogy'
Hips insane
The pussy? Foolery
At the end of the day baby it's you & me
At the end of the day honey it's you & me
Just you & me
When Eminem and I did "Stan" at the Grammys in 2001, we got together to rehearse out in the Valley. We had never met or really spoken, so I was a little intimidated. When we started to do the song and Eminem made his entrance, I got goose bumps, the likes of which I have not felt since I first saw Jimi Hendrix, Mick Jagger, James Brown and Aretha Franklin. Eminem was that good. I just thought, "Fuck, this man is amazing." There are very few performers who can grab you like that the first time — only the greats.

Eminem is a true poet of his time, someone we'll be talking about for decades to come. He tells stories in such a powerful and distinctive way. As a lyricist, he's one of the best ever. Eminem does for his audience what Dylan did for his: He writes how he feels. His anger, vulnerability and humor come out. That's why we look forward to listening to Eminem's lyrics and finding out where the hell he's headed next.

Eminem lives, sleeps and breathes music — he's a bit like me in that respect. He's pretty much a recluse. I think he's enthralled with what he's doing; he's intimately involved with his art. There's a mystique about him. From the start, I have always admired Eminem's thinking. That's the reason I wanted to appear on the Grammys with him when I was asked, despite all the nonsense talked about his being homophobic and crap like that. The Boy Georges of the world all got up in a twist about it. If they didn't have the intelligence to see his intelligence, that was their problem.

Eminem has the balls to say what he feels and to make offensive things funny. That's very necessary today, when irony is becoming a lost art. Artists like Eminem who use their free speech to get a point across are vitally important. There just aren't many people in the world with balls that big and talent that awesome.

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'll shove a gun in your grill, greasy and heated
Smothered in hot mustard so when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it
You need to be immediately treated
While you're breathing
And you'll be leaving the receiving room this evening with Jesus
You hate on us? We'll be waiting on eight corners
Swarming your hood with a thousand angry skateboarders
I'll hop in a jeep and slam on the gas and charge you
And bombard you in the car that your mom bought you
Fuck around and get choked and found in a moat
Floating around, drowned, faced-down in a boat
I'll pile five dudes in a Pinto and pull-up to the Seven Mile drive through
At McDonald's and pile-drive you
I got the power to snatch a driver out of his Eddie Bauer
When it drives by me at 90 miles an hour
This place is my house
I might as well erase my face with white-out
Cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Walking in swamp water with an M-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, ice in my veins, blowing your hand off
Dancing with the Devil leading - I won't die, I'm never leaving
I pledge allegiance to forever breathing
Street niggas with nuts, what? My meat's bigger
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a deathwish, thinking I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through them, put the heat to them
Be careful you might get what you ask for
That's what you false ballers get mugged and gagged for
Your life flashing in front of your eyes in fast forward
Dearly departed, I don't even listen to artists
I'm pissing the farthest, and I'm also hitting the hardest
I'm very intelligent
Compare me to cameras
I flash, and shoot what I see, and steady developing
I fly you out of your whip with one try of the trigger
Out of your clique, ain't one nigga out of his shit
You gotta be kidding, bring all of them niggas
They all gotta be hit quick, and they all gotta be hitten
It's not a game, and I ain't playing
Yo if I ain't lived it, did it, or seen it, then I ain't saying
I put a hole right in your chest
Stick a knife in your soul
Then take your life after taking your death
I'm nice!
That ain't even counting the endless bars
Friends with scars, wondering which Benz is ours
Pretending to ball could even be the ending of y'all
The minute you fall, my criminals will finish you off
I argue with no one
You got a gun? Alright show one
If you ain't got heart now, you ain't gon' just grow one

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm keeping it raw, illegal like Malik and Jamal
'Cause I don't believe in the law, like I'm Steven Seagal
Flipping off the police while I'm leaping a wall
Take a bunch of Tylenol, then fall asleep in a mall
I got your little son, you'll be receiving a call
You're lucky this little punks still breathing at all
Fuck the world, this how I get even at y'all
Pop shit, get rolled up and leave in a ball
I hit you in your mouth and sink your teeth in your jaws
You won't be able to eat shit, not even a malt
This lethal assault, is giving you a reason to stall
I'm cocking this deuce-deuce and I'm squeezing it off
At the first burp and a fart sniffle a sneeze and a cough
Get your arm chewed off like you was teasing a dog
I'm cold enough and hot enough to freeze and unthaw
I'll kick my girl out, in 10 degrees in her bra

[Verse 4: Royce da 5'9"]
I'm gonna give it to you straight this time
Lace this bong
Bring it to your face until the Jakes respond
Guard y'all shit
I don't care how hard y'all hit
I got cats with bats you wouldn't play hardball with
I splatter intestines quick, before you can blast
Or handle your weapon, you'll get stabbed in a matter of seconds
We ain't worried about threats cause God got us
We popping Cris, y'all sipping Moet by-products
I ain't scared to die, let's blast, it's gonna be either
If you both die then your casket is gonna be deeper
Yo, you ain't a Don
You don't even know what beef is
What you competing with, our hittin' make concrete give
Yo I came out
Naked at birth, making it worse
Making a verse sacred and shaking the Earth
Niggas got plenty opinions about Royce
But they ain't got a voice
I'm doper than them, so they ain't got a choice
Niggas be playing battle-battle
Not understanding themselves
They babble-babble that's why they stay on the shelves
Playing yourself, I'm promising threats to test y'all
Keep doing this rap shit until UPS calls
I see why you must hate me
I'm sharp enough to cut gravy
It's just crazy, niggas is such babies
Real as they come, dancing
Killing for fun, advancing
Healing my thumb, killing for fun
Cock, squeeze and make every nigga freeze in here
Stop breathing, there better be some cheese in here
If there's any MC's in here, I hope you read me clear
You seeing peace, beef with the C's in here
Yo you ain't fly
I got shit that you can't buy
You can't lie, you drink St. Ides and fake high
Take pie, try to flip it
You don't nothing about that shit
If was you I wouldn't risk it

[Verse 5: Eminem]
I wouldn't risk it...
Rappers get hit with this verbal biscuit
Hey yo, yo yo yo yo
Keep the same beat, keep the same beat, keep the same beat
It goes like this yo
My attitude is worse than N.W.A.'s was
I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people
Who ain't have shit to do with it, like Cool J does
You see me standing outside of your building; screaming
Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children!
I look at my life in a new light -- fuck it
Give me two mics; I write songs for me -- fuck what you like
You're probably hear me rap half-hearted; cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just trying to get my porno career started
Every place and event.. (been there, done that)
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
Want a deal? Study these 5 chapters
Lesson one: Throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson two: Face 'em and diss 'em
Don't give 'em a demo; kidnap 'em
And make 'em come to your basement and listen
Lesson three: Get a job at a label; switch demos with Canibus
And put yours on the owner's table
Lesson four: Know you heard this before:
"Hey let me get your number; I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!"
Don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed?
Get the whitest A&R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson five: Get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street; I ain't
Givin you shit bitch - don't even bother asking me
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spitting
Cause I'm always shitting when I'm rapping like Master P
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah
Gave Alyssa Milano syphillis, mono and gonorrhea
And all three of my main girls said see-ya
Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fucking Aaliyah
I splish splash while I'm taking a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh
White trash -- fucking your wife in the ass
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass
And it's like that, and it's like that

[Verse 6: Royce da 5'9"]
It don't stop
5-9, Slim Shady yo
The rap auctioneer, spitting out double figures
For fans to repeat, handling heat
The Commander in Chief, I should've been banned from the streets
Flee after I stab an MC with twin crutches
You've been had by the phantom of beef
Release when the paper and pen touches
While y'all talking
My venomous rap splits
Get your ass kicked punk
Your kind get offed often
80 niggas deep with heat at the mall walking
You'll either get shot with all barkers
Or get knocked upside your head with big blocks
Till you spit teeth
You're all soft and up shit's creek in a long coffin
I get work without a single fiend involved
I'm married to the mob, I mean for real, ring and all
Basically that means I ain't your average rap nigga
You'll get slapped and thrown in the back of an Ac(ura) bigger
With the latch cracked, trunk open
So you can look up at the stars
Fill your pockets with plastic explosives
Drive to cover, detonate the bomb
Blow you up with the car and flee the scene to cop another
Morph right into the physical form of your spirit
In front of your eyes, and make you battle yourself
Like Shang Tsung with wisdom in the brilliance of a million disciples
Equipped with a right hook to split a building
The pure repper of the African race
Sent here to knock you off your square and put you back in your place
Babylon battalion, holding your engineer ransom
For your master, so I can sabotage your album

[Verse 7: Eminem]
Yo, weed lacer, '97 burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the Mercury Tracer
I’m on some loc shit, some fed up with the being broke shit
I’m not to joke with, bitch I don’t sell crack, I smoke it
Having a coke fit, going through withdrawls daily
Shoot-up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter Hailie
My brain’s dusted, I’m disgusted at all my habits
Too many aspirin tablets, empty medicine cabinets
Losing battles to wack rappers cause I’m always too blunted
Walking up in the cypher smoking, talking about “Who want it?”
Thug and a crook; every drug in the book; I’ve done it
My 9’s at your brain, is that you chain? Run it
Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavor
Aggressive nature got me sticking you for your Progressive pager
Spectacular, crystal-meth manufacturer
Stole your momma’s Acura, wrecked it, and sold it back to her
Boosting Nike jackets, escaped from psychiatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me, I might be back bitch
So barricade your entrance, put up some extra fences
A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses
Chasing dips – take them on long vacation trips
Kidnapping ‘em and trapping ‘em in abusive relationships
Fuck up your face and lips, slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Cut you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with
Mama, don’t you cry, your son is too far gone
I’m so high, I don’t even know what label I’m on
I’m fucked up, I feel just like an overworked plumber
I’m sick of this shit, what’s Dr. Kevorkian’s phone number?

[Verse 8: Royce da 5'9"]
It's like this right?
Bust it
You get laced by the gun, in case you try to run
Hatred on my face by the tongue, get baked by the sun
Constructed of interplanetary rock and metal
Topping levels of combustion that's hot enough to stop the devil
Innovative flusher to enemies
The impact will be the generated destructive energy to flatten trees
Black, poised since birth
Birth? Tore the womb up
To hit the Earth like an asteroid and blow the moon up
Trust me, I'm the epitome, you better bust me
Any nigga can say fuck me and he gon' touch me
Smoking organic ganja inside of a stanza
Me and my man cypher with cans of volcanic lava
Man this is hot, I'm out of my shit
From the bottom I can leap out a bottomless pit and land at the top
Raw, that's what I came out here for
To raise and eclipse, and occasional trips to the beer store
And switch-up, the breed of MC to stick a bitch up
Bigger and speed to reach in the sea and pick a fish up
I'm fly against all laws of gravitation
I crushed all y'all, now you want a collaboration
But fuck that, you stepped up, so I'm gonna fuck your rep up
Tear the rest up, with every joint that I press up
Handling heat and ammo, bullets passing me by
Challenging me to battle? Man, you asking to die
Narrow off niggas, squeeze a grenade until it's dissolved
Bite the barrel of a revolver and spin it
Nigga forget it, I earned it
I kill you then come to your funeral and strangle you to confirm it
Minds carry malaria, sick
Ask niggas who the best is, you'll hear 5-9 in every area
Crushing your head, hunting you dead
You ain't nice
I battled you before, I don't remember nothing you said
You was wack, I was gonna quit on it till I thought
My dick is big enough for all of y'all niggas to get on it
Making you high off of the smoke, often you're cold
Making y'all join that big hip-hop nation in the sky
And it's easy believe me, you better have been fronting
When you said you was hot, cause you couldn't please me if you was begging me

[Verse 9: Eminem]
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Who came late to the last show with a different dame
Brain ate from the last O that I sniffed of cane
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turning to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeemish
Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 bursting
You getting spun backwards like every word of obscene cursing
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stopping your short life when you still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each others' name
Run in the ultrasound and snatch you out your mother's frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers Lane, to the night you were thought of
And cock block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'm gonna throw a head-butt so hard, it'll knock us both out

[Verse 1]
No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of Spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday, within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

[Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[Verse 2]
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

[Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[Outro]
Of my heart
Of my heart

[Intro: Fuzzy Jones]

My door's swinging open, a nigga must clown
Hey you sucka nigga you ain't got to screw face me

Mind on the level- no other nigga could touch

And we get back, sip that gin
Pour another glass, gettin' it in
All my niggas in the front, my people in the back
Show me love dog, tell me where you at

[Verse 1]
When I was a young boy
My mama said to me
Your daddy's leaving home today
I think he's gone to stay
We packed up all our bags
And drove out to Winnipeg

[Verse 2]
When we got to Winnipeg
I checked in to school
I wore white bucks on my feet
When I learned the golden rule
The punches came fast and hard
Lying on my back in the school yard

[Chorus]
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied

[Verse 3]
Well pretty soon I met a friend
He played guitar
We used to sit on the steps at school
And dream of being stars
We started a band
We played all night
Oh no

[Chorus]
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied

[Verse 4]
The businessmen crowded around
They came to hear the golden sound
There we were on the Sunset Strip
Playing our songs for the highest bid
We played all night
The price was right

[Chorus]
Don't be denied, no don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied

[Verse 5]
Well, all that glitters isn't gold
I know you heard that story told
And I'm a pauper in a naked disguise
A millionaire through a business man's eyes
Oh friend of mine
Don't be denied

Bitch want a plane ticket, I'm booking it
CMG, that muscle gang; T.I.P., that Hustle Gang
Brand dick all in what's-her-name
Never gonna mention no buster name
Got wordplay like that 'Rosa gang
Make one phone call that get a bus of 'caine
That Forbes list, should've been on it
Niggas talk beef but really don't want it
I doubt it if you batted, I pull up and jump up out it
Burn faith, no mad dome, check your wisecrackin'
Left the tech to see exactly
Lick the shells, try to count it
Last seen in an Audi
Turn a million for a bounty, I'm gone

[Chorus: B.o.B & Yo Gotti]
I'm in my zone, I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz, quit killing it (Quit kiliing it)
So buy another round (If you ain't with that fuck shit, nigga)

"Untitled" coming soon!

[Verse 1]
Morning’s come, you watch the red sun rise
The LED still flickers in your eyes
Oh, you ought to spare your face the razor
Because no one’s gonna spare their time for you
No one’s gonna watch you as you go
From a house you didn’t build and can’t control
Oh, you ought to spare your face the razor
Because no one’s gonna spare their time for you
You ought to spare the world your labor
It’s been twenty years and no one’s told the truth

[Chorus]
So listen, oh
So listen, oh
Don’t wait
Don’t wait
So listen, oh
So listen, oh
Don’t wait
Don’t wait

[Verse 2]
So keep that list of who to thank in mind
And don’t forget the rich ones who were kind
Oh, you ought to spare your face the razor
Because no one’s gonna spare their time for you
Why don’t you spare their world a traitor?
Take your wager back and leave before you lose

[Chorus]
So listen, oh
So listen, oh
Don’t wait
Don’t wait

[Bridge]
So while the sun’s coming out
Cover ground, cover ground
And if you find some love for these clowns
Turn around, turn around
I’ll be half-asleep on the floor of a high school gym
Thinking of you and wondering if anyone else could begin

[Pre-Chorus]
To listen
Listen
Don’t wait
Don’t wait

[Chorus]
So listen, oh
So listen, oh
Don’t wait
Don’t wait

[Verse 1]
A gardener told me some plants move
But I could not believe it
'Til me and Hannah Hunt
Saw crawling vines and weeping willows
As we made our way from Providence to Phoenix

[Verse 2]
A man of faith said hidden eyes
Could see what I was thinking
I just smiled and told him
That was only true of Hannah
And we glided on through Waverly and Lincoln

[Chorus]
Our days were long, our nights no longer
Count the seconds, watching hours
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time

[Verse 3]
In Santa Barbara, Hannah cried
"I miss those freezing beaches"
And I walked into town
To buy some kindling for the fire
Hannah tore the New York Times up into pieces

[Chorus]
If I can't trust you then damn it, Hannah
There's no future, there's no answer
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
If I can't trust you then damn it, Hannah
There's no future, there's no answer
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time

[Verse 1]
One look sent knees to the ground
Young bloods can't be settling down
Young hearts need the pressure to pound
So hold me close, my baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't lie, I want him to know
God's loves die young; is he ready to go?
It's the last time running through snow
Where the vaults are full and the fire is bold

[Chorus]
I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of a ticking clock
There's a lifetime right in front of you
And everyone I know

[Verse 2]
Young turks, young Saturday nights
Young hips shouldn't break on the ice
Old flames, they can't warm you tonight
So keep it cool, my baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't lie, I want him to know
Dial up, three rings and return him his gold
It's the last time running through snow
Where the vaults are full and the fire is bold

[Chorus]
I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of a ticking clock
There's a headstone right in front of you
And everyone I know

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't lie, I want 'em to know
God's love die young, are you ready to go?
It's the last time running through snow
Cause the fire can't last and the winter's cold

[Chorus]
I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of a ticking clock
There's a lifetime right in front of you
And everyone I know

[Trey Songz]

My bitch bad, my bitch cold
Young bitch, wit an old soul
Lesson that she learned cause momma showed her
Probably should of hit it when her momma throwed it
My old bitch, but she look young
Smart bitch, but she look dumb
And yo bitch bored, but she look fun
My white bitch my black one
Gold Chains and my platinum
My skinny girl, lil bitty waist wit her pretty face and that fat one
Slow Songz, Fuck Songz

Addicted to my money and she never go to rehab
It’s full of hundreds if you look up in the bag (up in the bag)
Like damn, my bitch bad, bad!!

[Verse 1]
I took your counsel and came to ruin
Leave me to myself, leave me to myself
I took your counsel and came to ruin
Leave me to myself, lead me to myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I was made to live without you
But I’m never gonna understand, never understand
Oh, I was born to live without you
But I’m never gonna understand, never understand

[Chorus]
Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath a chandelier
That’s going down

[Verse 2]
I thought it over and drew the curtain
Lead me to my cell, lead me to my cell
I hummed the Dies Irae as you played the Hallelujah
Lead me to my cell, don't leave me in my cell

[Pre-Chorus]
If you’d been made to serve a master
You'd be frightened by the open hand, frightened by the hand
Could I have been made to serve a master?
Well, I’m never gonna understand, never understand

[Chorus]
Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath the chandelier
That’s going down
Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath the chandelier
That’s going down
Hold me in your everlasting arms

[Verse 1]
Hudson died in Hudson Bay
The water took its victim's name
Now river's rise told Riverside
To change their names again

[Verse 2]
A stranger walked in through the door
Said, "All apartments are pre-war"
We laughed and asked him for his name
He stayed until the end
We watched the Germans play the Greeks
We marked the 99-year lease
Our fathers signed
Which I declined to try and comprehend

[Chorus]
Over and over again, all these never-ending visions
Over and over again like a prize that's changing hands
The time has come, the clock is such a drag
All you who changed your stripes can wrap me in the flag

[Verse 3]
The legendary wooden gate
The first established real estate
Is lost in time like all the crimes
That won this pleasant land (land, land, land)

[Chorus]
Over and over again, all these never-ending visions
Over and over again like a prize that's changing hands
The time has come, the clock is such a drag
All you who changed your stripes can wrap me in the flag

[Verse 4]
Hudson died on Hudson Bay
But I was born on Sutton Place
The rising tide helped me decide
To change my name again
Some men tend to linger on
And some make haste from Babylon
Some will roam their ruined home
Rejoicing 'til the end

[Chorus]
Over and over again, all these never-ending visions
Over and over again like a prize that's changing hands
The time has come, the clock is such a drag
All you who changed your stripes can wrap me in the flag

[Outro]
The lines are drawn, the map is such a drag
All you who changed your stripes can wrap me in the flag

[Verse]
You take your time, young lion
You take your time, young lion
You take your time, young lion
You take your time, young lion

[Verse 1]
Only in the way You want it
Only on the day You want it
Only with the understanding:
Every single day You want it
Only in the way You want it
Only on the day You want it
Only with the understanding:
Every single day you want it
You, You

[Verse 2]
City with the weight upon it
City in the way you want it
City with the safety
Of a never-ending blessing on it
City with the weight upon it
City in the way you want it
City with the safety
Of a never-ending blessing on it
You, You

[Chorus]
We worshipped You, Your red right hand
Won't we see you once again?
In foreign soil, in foreign land
Who will guide us through the end?

[Verse 3]
Calling on a change, You want it
Calling on the same, You want it
Calling on the misery to always be explained
You want it
Calling on a change, You want it
Calling on the same, You want it
Calling on the misery to always be explained
You want it
You, You

[Verse 4]
Energetic praise You wanted
Any kind of praise You wanted
Little bit of light
To get us through the final days You wanted
Energetic praise You wanted
Any kind of praise You wanted
Little bit of light
To get us through the final days You wanted
You, too

[Chorus]
We worshipped You, Your red right hand
Won't we see You once again?
In foreign soil, in foreign land
Who will guide us through the end?
We worshipped You, Your red right hand
Won't we see You once again?
In foreign soil, in foreign land
Who will guide us through the end?

[Verse 1]
Bend my finger back, snap! Wrap it in a paper towel
Break a twig in half and set it straight
Beat me with a wood bat, hit me with a canister
That's fired while the soldiers drive away
Bend my finger back, snap
On and on and on and on for days
Hit me with a wood bat, hit me like a Yankee
Like a son of freedom, never as a slave

[Chorus]
It's etiquette, you idiot, spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby, you are mine
And baby, you're not anybody's fool

[Verse 2]
Bless me with a heart attack, a real crise cardiaque
And show me where to find the surgeon’s knife
Eviscerate me now, hack! Take me to my punishment
The punishment I needed all my life
Bend my finger back, snap!
On and on and on and on with strife
Listen to my bum rap, listen to the evidence
Exonerating me from being right

[Chorus]
It's etiquette, you idiot, spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby, you are mine
And baby, you're not anybody's fool

[Post-Chorus]
You know that I’ve been wicked and the road to hell is wide
Cursed by curiosity that made us go inside
Everyone was charming but we took 'em for a ride
Baby, you’re not anybody’s fool

[Verse 3]
Bend my finger back, snap! Pack it in a paper towel
Break a twig in half and set it straight
Beat me with a wood bat, hit me with a canister
That's fired while the soldiers drive away
Bend my finger back, snap!
On and on and on and on for days
Hit me with a wood bat, hit me like a Yankee
Like a son of freedom, never as a slave

[Chorus]
It's etiquette, you idiot, spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby, you are mine
And baby, you're not anybody's fool

[Post-Chorus]
The harpsichord is broken and the television's fried
The city's getting hotter like a country in decline
Everyone's a coward when you look them in the eyes
But baby, you're not anybody's fool

[Spoken Interlude]
Sing "Next Year in Jerusalem"
You know, the one at 103rd and Broadway?
'Cause this Orthodox girl fell in love
With the guy at the falafel shop
And why not? Should she have averted her eyes
And just stared at the laminated poster of the Dome of the Rock?

[Bridge]
And then blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood
And then blood, blood, blood
And then blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood
And then blood, blood, blood, blood, blood

[Outro]
Remembrances of holy days in Tarrytown and Rye
I don’t wanna live like this, but I don’t wanna die
Condolences to gentle hearts who couldn’t bear to try
I don’t wanna live like this, but I don’t wanna die
Remembrances of holy days in Tarrytown and Rye
I don’t wanna live like this, but I don’t wanna die

[Intro]
Gimme the poison
I love the poison
Hooked on the poison

[Chorus]
I can't believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head, again
So I run... (so long ago, and so far away)
I can't believe all those things that you said
You are the poison, I drank the poison

[Verse]
Get out my head, get out my bed
I don't believe those three words that you said
Pocket of lies, crystal blue eyes
Hit the ground hard when I dropped from the skies
You're coming up when I'm going down
Never in sync, so we just sank and drowned
Press restart and reboot my heart
But I'm not a robot, so I fell apart
Before the moment we met, we were chatting on the internet
Getting kinda close through the posts that we were looking at
I was pretty confident, you were pretty into that
I linked you to my music just to see if you'd be into it
So fuck the prologue, read the internet blogs
Gonna love this style and I came from the clubs
I wasn't looking for a thug, I was looking for a bad boy
Bad boy, motherfucker, destroy

[Chorus]
I can't believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head, again
So I run... (so long ago, and so far away)
I can't believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head, again
So I run... (so long ago, and so far away)
I can't believe all those things that you said
You are the poison, I drank the poison
I want the poison, I need the poison
Gimme the poison, I love the poison
Hooked on the poison

[Interlude]
(So far away...
So long ago, and so far away
So far away...
So long ago, and so far away)

[Bridge]
Now I know for sure that we've got to end this
You don't get no last kiss
'Cause you're so damn crazy, and I'm so damn helpless
So don't text my number
And don't call my mother
I can't see your face now
'Cause this is over

[Chorus]
I can't believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head, again
So I run... (so long ago, and so far away)
I can't believe all those things that you said
You are the poison, I drank the poison
(So long ago, and so far away)

[Hook] 

[Mike Posner]:
Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'mma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn my music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive

[Verse One] 

[Big Sean]:
All black car (car)
Three percent tint
I can clearly see out
But you can barely see in
The end and only end
We blowing Indo-nesia
And I'm a let it hit til I get amnesia
I'm crazy the haze got me hazy I'm lazy
Tell Ben that it Something About Mary and clearly (what)
I'm so outta here you can say a nigga spacey (damn)
Pocket full of papers so I'm finnin to get some papers (yeah)
Bout to inhale like I'm finnin to see Satan (what)
Bout to exhale like I'm finnin to see my savior
So get the leaves and trees like it's autumn
Have them windows all rolled up rolled em and told em man

[Hook]

[Verse Two] 

[Donnis]:
First of all til you ball like this
You don't put this type of piff in your swish
Get it?
We smoking on that Poison call it Michael Bivins
So if you selling to me then you gotta lucrative business
Apprentice what you blow while I'm smoking on that CEO
Top notch I got fruit by the foot in my fruit roll up
No cuts no stems no seeds straight THC indeed
I'm tryna get stoned like I stared into Medusa eyes
You ain't got green, well somebody tell me who supply
So I can buy wholesale for the low
Like Costco or Sams
You got some? Well damn!

[Hook]

[Verse Three] 

[Jackie Chain]:
I don't smoke phillies pass me a swisher
Bumping Pimp C pouring out a little liquor
Trunk full of kicker blunt full of OG
Ride behind tint cause these jack boys know me
Smokin' sour diesel out of NYC
Keisha Cole in ATL Obama kush in DC
Which one's better? Roll up I need a tie breaker
Take a ride downtown man I'm higher than these skyscapers
Roll the windows up tryna get my smoke on
Two in the morning still riding with my locs on
Fuck the police what these pigs gon' tell me?
Smoking bud at lights like X off of Belly

[Hook]

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Now as I seen more money, there's more problems
Every time I look around
They say I'm not hungry and I lost it
But you're never gonna, ever gonna, ever gonna bring me down
Bring me down, you not gon' bring me down
Bring me down, you not gon' bring me

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Look, I need the best drinks, I love the best hoes
I roll the best weed and blow the best smoke
Mama, they love me from NY head back to Fresno
But they tryna bring your son down like the West Coast
Still instrumental on top of these instrumentals
I can say that we the same, but it's too hard to pretend to
You ain't been through what I been through bitch
(Been through what I been through)
Man, I charge it to the game/It's cool I got my incidentals
Bitch! I'm doin' everything I planned to
I'm with a girl that's just too much for you to handle
My mans will squeeze the handle and put you on a mantel
Respect a nigga doin everything that you can't do, bitch

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Now as I seen more money, there's more problems
Every time I look around
They say I'm not hungry and I lost it
But you're never gonna, ever gonna, ever gonna bring me down
Bring me down, you not gon' bring me down
Bring me down, you not gon' bring me

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
D-d-down, yeah clown, another one of them gangsta verses
Woulda put it down sooner but I was out of town
Lookin' fo a couple thangs to purchase
Needed the money for the shopping malls
So I was robbin' dawg, had to snatch chains and purses
Comin' off too thug for the radio cause really though
I just can't restrain from cursin'
Clip for the tips, and a blunt for the skunk
25 to life charged in my trunk
Gotta keep a strap in my city to straight dump
The fo ten turn grown men to straight punks
Turn kings to straight fiends, good girls; straight hoes
Took it to the street wit dope and straight flows
Told 'em that the game is sold and not told
Bag it up and then I'm servin' rocks
Kept my grandma's house so hot
Mo' money, mo' problems dawg
But I'd rather deal with the problems that Puffy got
Don't wanna be strugglin' like my dad
Take a look back at this life I had
The hood I threw up so when I grew up
I knew I'd be Jordan, Michael, Brad

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Now as I seen more money, there's more problems
Every time I look around
They say I'm not hungry and I lost it
But you're never gonna, ever gonna, ever gonna bring me down
Bring me down, you not gon' bring me down
Bring me down, you not gon' bring me

[Verse One]:

[Verse]:

Everybody seems so sure

As if they were the ones to put the keys in the lock
But I can't smile no more
I can't feel my face
I'm a keep walking forward
'Till the day I turn around
And walk back the same way as I did when I came before
Oh Lord
Cause you know I've got one foot out the door

One foot out the door
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh, yeah, alright

[Hook]:
Hey Cupid (Hey Cupid)
Do I look stupid? (Do I look stupid?)
I'm not going to fall for none of your tricks no more
Your arrow won't pierce my skin no more

[x2]

[Verse One]:
Do you remember Mary?
The one you made me wanna marry
I tried to get into her sex life
But she said I was the friend type
Do you remember Katie?
Cause you made her drive me crazy
I gave her all of my affection
Then she left me for my best friend

Now you keep shooting your arrow
You keep givin' my love away
But I don't see why you don't let me be
I don't want to play your game

[Hook]

[Verse Two]:
Do you remember Rachel?
You made her look like such an angel
She told me I would be her first ride
That was just her first lie
Do you remember Ashley?
The one that only dated athletes
I tried to kiss her in my back seat
She turned away and slapped me

Now you keep shooting your arrow
You keep givin' my love away
But I don't see why you don't let me be
I don't want to play your game

I wonder if you even remember how you gave away my love
Super glued my heart back together now, back the way it was
I wonder if you even remember how you gave away my love
Super glued my heart back together now...

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I am just crushed in the velvet
My heart is locked in a box
I am still sinking in black skylines
But now I want it to stop

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m sailing high but I can't see
I’ve been pushed around, up and down in a cloud
And I can't breathe
I’m falling down, down to my knees
You've gotta let me go, you've gotta help me out
You've gotta set me free

[Chorus]
You've gotta set me free
Yeah, you devoured my soul
‘Cause I can taste your lips on my lips
Your kisses make me out of control
And I can feel my blood
It’s crawling through my veins
And you close your eyes and you twist your smile
‘Cause you can feel my pain

[Post-Chorus]
You can feel my pain
You can feel my pain

[Verse 2]
I have been dancing with shadows
I have been calling your name (calling your name)
I feel the skin dripping from my bones
Your touch, it makes me insane

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m sailing high but I can't see
I’ve been pushed around, up and down in a cloud
And I can't breathe
I’m falling down, down to my knees
You've gotta let me go, you've gotta help me out
You've gotta set me free

[Chorus]
You've gotta set me free
Yeah, you devoured my soul
‘Cause I can taste your lips on my lips
Your kisses make me out of control
And I can feel my blood
It’s crawling through my veins
And you close your eyes and you twist your smile
‘Cause you can feel my pain

[Bridge]
I can’t do this no more
You’re tearing me apart
So give me one last kiss
And then I have to let you know

[Chorus]
You've gotta set me free
Yeah, you devoured my soul
‘Cause I can taste your lips on my lips
Your kisses make me out of control
And I can feel my blood
It’s crawling through my veins
And you close your eyes and you twist your smile
‘Cause you can feel my pain

[Post-Chorus]
You can feel my pain
You can feel my pain
You can feel my pain
You can feel my pain

[Verse]
Wish you could see me when I’m lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red
(Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
Arrows of roses shoot me dead again
Wish you could see me when I’m lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red
(Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
Arrows of roses shoot me dead again

[Pre-Chorus]
(Let my car run out) Let my car run out
(I won't scream or shout) I won't scream or shout
(Let's die together, no one lives forever)
'Cause I feel like I’m in heaven, dancing with an angel
(Let my car run out, I won't scream or shout)
Cars burn out, lost my breath now
(Let's die together, no one lives forever)
'Cause I feel like I am falling through the clouds

[Chorus]
(Let my car run out, I won't scream or shout)
Hope we’re on the same wavelength
Hope you don’t think that I’m crazy
(Let's die together, no one lives forever)
Beaches and oceans for my baby
Hurry up, and come and save me
(Let my car run out, I won't scream or shout)
I can’t quite hear what you’re saying
Because my body started shaking
(Let's die together, no one lives forever)
Beaches and oceans, earth is quaking
That’s my heart that you were breaking

[Verse]
Wish you could see me when I’m lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red
(Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
Arrows of roses shoot me dead again
Wish you could see me when I’m lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red
(Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
Arrows of roses shoot me dead again

[Pre-Chorus]
(Let my car run out) Let my car run out
(I won't scream or shout) I won't scream or shout
(Let's die together, no one lives forever)
'Cause I feel like I’m in heaven, dancing with an angel
(Let my car run out, I won't scream or shout)
Cars burn out, lost my breath now
(Let's die together, no one lives forever)
'Cause I feel like I am falling through the clouds

[Chorus]
Hope we’re on the same wavelength
Hope you don’t think that I’m crazy
Beaches and oceans for my baby
Hurry up, and come and save me
I can’t quite hear what you’re saying
Because my body started shaking
Beaches and oceans, earth is quaking
That’s my heart that you were breaking

[Outro]
(No one lives forever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever)
(No one lives forever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever)
(No one lives forever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever)
(No one lives forever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever)
(No one lives forever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever)

[Verse 1]
My hands are frozen into chains behind my back
So please, don’t swallow down the key
Let me out now
Yeah, I’m in trouble
Can’t stop what’s coming
Can’t blame this one on bad luck

[Pre-Chorus]
How can I? How can I?

[Chorus]
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I? How can I?
How can I fix what I fucked up?

[Verse 2]
Iced out, got hot, bit the dust hardcore
But I’m at the same place I was before
Yeah, I’m in trouble
Can’t stop what’s coming
Can’t blame this one on bad love

[Pre-Chorus]
How can I? How can I?

[Chorus]
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I? How can I?
How can I fix what I fucked up?

[Bridge]
It was boys and girls, and girls, and boys
The Southern Comfort from your comforter got destroyed
It was shady eyes with the violent noise
We on the graveyard digging where the love is void
We had a meltdown underground
Just a cemetery chick, but it's over now
But I still taste your bones when I’m all alone
You’re the best I ever had, but now you’ve got to go
And now I’m on my own
I said, “Please don’t go.”
Please don’t go

[Final Chorus]
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I? How can I?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
I miss your touch and my skin on yours
I want a taste of what I adore
How can I? How can I?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I? How can I?
How can I fix what I fucked up?

[Verse 1]
It’s a long way home, but I’m making my way
With so many things still left to say
I try to think about the one I need the most
When my mind goes black
And then it hits me like a ton of bricks
I want you, no, nothing else
I want to lock you up inside my heart

[Chorus 1]
I always wanted you
But sometimes it’s hard
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I wanted you from the start
I want to lock you up inside my heart

[Verse 2]
Nothing says tomorrow is a guarantee
There’s no way of knowing that you’ll be with me
As I walk upon the edge of no escape in a world so flat
And then it hits me like a bolt of faith
I love you, not-nothing else
I want to lock you up inside my heart

[Chorus 2]
I always wanted you
But sometimes it’s hard
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I wanted you from the start
I want to lock you up inside my heart
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I want to lock you up

[Bridge]
We won’t stay, we run
Love like melting sun
Please don’t leave, don’t run
Won’t you stay in tonight?
Taste my lips, don’t let go
I’m in your hand
I’m in your hand
I’m in your hand

[Chorus 2]
I always wanted you
But sometimes it’s hard
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I wanted you from the start
I want to lock you up inside my heart
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I want to lock you up inside my heart
What do I do to lock up inside my heart?
I want to lock you up
I want to lock you up inside my heart

[Verse 1]
Friends we've been for so long
Now true colors are showing
Makes me wanna cry
Oh, yes, it does
'Cause I had to say goodbye

[Chorus]
By now, I should know
That, in time, things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad?

[Verse 2]
How can I adjust
To the way that things are going?
It's killing me slowly
Oh, I just want it to be how it used to be, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I wish that I could stay
But, in time, things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad? (Uh)

[Bridge]
You cannot hide the way you feel inside
I realize
Your actions speak much louder than words
So tell me why, oh

[Chorus]
By now, I should know that (Should know)
That, in time, things must change (Things must change)
So it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be so bad (Be so bad)
So why do I feel so sad?
By now, I should know (I should know)
That, in time, things must change (Things must change)
So it shouldn't be so bad (Be so bad)
So why do I feel so sad?

[Bridge]
By now, by now, I should know (I should know)
That in time things must grow
And I had to leave you behind (Things must change)
So why do I feel so sad (Be so sad)
If it couldn't be that bad?
Tell me why (Why do I feel so sad?)

[Chorus]
By now, I should know (I should know)
That, in time, things must change (Things must change)
So it shouldn't be so bad (Be so bad)
So why do I feel so sad? (So sad)

[Outro]
Why do I feel so sad? (Why do I feel so sad?)
When I know that it must change (Why do I feel so sad?)
It must change, I don't mind
Just be real with me, just be truthful (Truthful)
And the rest, I'm leaving up to this one, yeah
Why does it feel so bad inside (Ah-ah-ah)
When I realize that you got to be left behind? (I feel so sad)

[Intro]
Mm-mm
Bye-bye

[Verse 1]
How do you love someone
That hurts you oh so bad?
With intentions good
Was all he ever had

[Pre-Chorus]
But how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long, and I've
Given him all that I could?
Maybe love is a hopeless crime
Givin' up what seems your lifetime
What went wrong with somethin' once so good?

[Chorus]
How do you find the words to say (To say, to say)
To say goodbye (Goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say (To say, to say)
To say goodbye? (Goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)

[Verse 2]
I know now I was naïve
Never knew where this would lead (Yeah, yeah)
And I'm not tryna take away, oh no
From the good man that he is

[Pre-Chorus]
But how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long, and I've
Given him all that I could?
Was it somethin' wrong that we did
Or 'cause others infiltrated? (Infiltrated)
What went wrong with somethin' once so good?

[Chorus]
How do you find the words to say (To say, to say)
To say goodbye (Goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say (No, my heart don't have the heart)
To say goodbye? (Goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)

[Bridge]
Is this the end? (End)
Are you sure? (Are you sure?)
How should you know when you've never been here before? (Never been here before)
It's so hard to just let go (Hard, just let go)
When this is the one and only love I've ever known (Only)

[Chorus]
So, how do you find the words to say (Man, it's been so long)
To say goodbye (To say goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say (Mm-mm-mm, yeah)
To say goodbye? (To say, to say goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)
How do you find the words to say (To say, to say goodbye)
To say goodbye (To say, to say goodbye, my love; find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say (No, my heart don't have the heart)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Baby, does he do it for you?
When he's finished, does he step back and adore you?
I just gotta know, cause your time is money
And I won't let him waste it, ooh no no
Baby, just go with it
Cause when you're with me, I can't explain it, it's just different
We can take it slow or act like you're my girl let's skip the basics, woah oh

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
He's so replaceable
You're worth the chase, you put it on

[Hook: Chris Brown]
It's alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine, I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable
A collectible, just like fine china

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Favorite, you're my favorite
It's like all the girls around me don't have faces
And the saying goes
Life is just a game but I'm not playing, woah oh

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
He's so replaceable
You're worth the chase, you put it on

[Hook: Chris Brown]
It's alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine, I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable
A collectible, just like fine china

[Verse 3: Common]
Defined by your fineness
From behind I watch you, you timeless
Come sit next to your highness
Get your nails done in different climates
Indian hair, that's from China
Stay open all night, you my diner
You a definition of a rider
Our sex is on house arrest, I stay inside ya
We could be best friends, me, you and diamonds
Climax and keep climbing, I hand you refinement
Like an assignment and watch you work that shit
We spend time and money cause you worth that shit
You could be dirty or Princess Diana
Cause you know the streets of Paris to Atlanta
Glamour with a panoramic view for me to scan her
I love this sister like I'm Tony Montana
School her with grammar
Get her mind in a golden state like Hammer
Shine bright like a gamma, ray with the things that I say
Make her want to love, honor and obey
I could be your Thriller, you could be my Ola Ray
You my fine china girl, I never throw away

[Hook: Chris Brown]
It's alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine, I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable
A collectible, just like fine china

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
Took me awhile to find, your love
Ain't no amount of time, in this world
Save me a lot of time, and just love me
Dearly baby, feel it in your soul
Are you ready?
I know your heart been telling you, you belong to me

[Hook: Chris Brown]
It's alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine, I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable
A collectible, just like fine china

[Verse 1]
He looks as if he hasn't slept
His hair is purposely unkept
In many doorways, people wept
When you crafted your plan
Shadows underneath the eyes
And everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of proof is your disguise
You won't remember me

[Pre-Chorus]
There's nothing really I can say
But "Sorry, mate" and walk away
I could be wrong on this, you play your game
This world is full of most unkind
And horrible is redefined
I can't imagine that you'd mind at all

[Chorus]
You're lying again, your conscience isn't your friend
And the only thing you're sobbing at is your imagination
Lying again, your conscience isn't your friend
And the only thing you're sobbing at is your imagination

[Verse 3]
Is he really on the street?
Desperation or deceit?
And what he's wearing on his feet
Won't solve our mystery
And I am baffled by how you stand there, soaking it in
And do you hide your identity where you hide your grin?
You'd better hide your grin

[Verse 4]
Shadows underneath the eyes
And everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of proof is your disguise
You won't remember me

[Pre-Chorus]
There's nothing really I can say
But "sorry, mate" and walk away
I could be wrong on this, you play your game
This world is full of most unkind
And horrible is redefined
I can't imagine that you'd mind at all

[Chorus]
You're lying again, your conscience isn't your friend
And the only thing you're sobbing at is your imagination
Lying again, your conscience isn't your friend
And the only thing you're sobbing at is your imagination

[Intro]
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven!

[Verse 1]
Well, I wrote my number down
I never wrote it down before
Were gonna bring it over like something from a film
But I didn't have the bottle at all
Well, I were looking and you kept staring
Your thoughts pairing up with mine
And when you're so pretty and I'm so shy
You properly did give me the eye, though, I'm sure you did

[Verse 2]
Well, I went outside
Couldn't say I tried and I felt regret
Because you haven't bashed me and dashed back in
'Cause the ship hasn't sailed yet
But when I did I couldn't see your face
I could see your mates but that wouldn't do
Well, I dashed around, tried to find you
But you were nowhere to be seen, oh no, no

[Bridge]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la

[Verse 3]
Well, she moved in ways that kept her there
In our minds for days and weeks and months
I was that amazed and there she stayed
Surrounded by the "What if?"s and the "Maybe"s

[Verse 1]
The leaves are falling all around, time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

[Chorus]
Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[Verse 2]
Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though "Our health" we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

[Chorus]
Ramble on, and now the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on, I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[Bridge]
I tell you no lie

[Verse 3]
Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her
Her, her, yeah
Ah, there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on

[Outro]
Ramblin', I'm gonna shake (Sing my song)
I gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song
Gonna work my way, going 'round the world
Baby, baby (Ramble on)
Do do do do do do do do, my baby
I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my baby I think, "We gots to part"
Gotta keep on searching for my baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I gotta keep on searching for my baby
My, my, my, my, my, my, baby
I can't find my bluebird!
I listened to what my bluebird said, but I, I can't find my bluebird!
I keep rambling, baby

Nicole,

Hopefully you doing well and you realized you need to quit fuckin wit Sedale and come home to your Doctor. I will take care of you baby girl.

I'm in nevada with Hype lookin at spots for this new video we are shooting for that single I told you pac is going to be on once he is out, called California Love. We met a bunch of crazy, naked motherfuckers in the desert today, they were putting up some type of giant wood man. I guess they have a big party out here for a bunch of days. I asked them how much they pay, they said "nothing", I was like no money? Someone should get behind this shit and make some loot of these fools cause they said there will at least be 5,000 people. I think I will have my office look into it, just to see if there is easy money to be had here. I'm bout to pass out girl, wish I was up in that ass. See you back in LA.

Dre

[Intro: Akiva Schaffer]
Alright, spring breakers, you know what time it is
I'm gonna need all the hot girls to come onto the stage right now
Fellas, let me hear you make some noise
Spring break, y'all

[Chorus 1]
Kings of the bar scene, pounding on brewskies
Banging chicks right there in the sand
Bros before hoes and chicks with no clothes and
Slamming shots and marry a man

[Verse 1: Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer, & Andy Samberg (All)]
Who wanna do a shot? (We do)
I'm gonna get fucked up (Me, too)
We came for a week, we the kings of the beach
Sprayed water on the girls (T-shirt, see-through)
(Cancún) Party down
(Lauderdale) Another round
(Havasu) Crack a brew
(Marry a man)

[Chorus 2]
Pranks when you're passed out, jokes about roofies
Making girls kiss, marry a man
Giant sombreros, show us your titties
Creatine shakes, marry a man

[Break: Jorma Taccone]
Spring break, y'all

[Verse 2: Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer, & Andy Samberg (All)]
(Oh shit) I'm too fucked up
(Puke and rally) That's what's up
Booze cruise (Raise your glass)
Snort that coke (Off her ass)
Two chicks at the dance hall, take it to the damn stalls
Trade these beads for their bra
So-Co in my canteen, got girls jumpin' on a trampoline
Two men bound by the law

[Chorus 3]
Trashing hotel rooms, clogging up toilets
Beer goggles if she's a hag
Planning the menu, picking out flowers
Nailing sluts and writing our vows

[Bridge]
Down here, it's our time! Spring breakers, let's get fucked up
Then find Mr. Right and get monogamous

[Chorus 4]
Picking our invite font as a twosome
Something tasteful, but not too bland
Seating arrangements, charming the in-laws
Ripping beer bongs, sex with a man
We'll be so happy, true love forever
Two kings walking hand in hand
Promise to cherish, trust and respect him
Crushing pussy, marry a man

[Outro]
Spring

Bright lights and cameras flash like it's the police
She spilled her drink on my Polo fleece
She's speedin', and she all on me
Came to the party with a bunch of OGs
Ladies wearin' Crown Holders and a bunch of Coogi
Now they lookin' and the fellas know what I got
Can't nobody get her but me
Flyest thing in this spot
Prettiest thing that you ever seen
Hold up, wait, stop
Wanna take her picture, you ain't gon' get it for free
Do you got what it takes to get down?
Lil' mama, the way she workin', she breakin' it to the ground
She twerkin' and workin' her body, hypnotic just to the sound
Can't nobody get her but me

[Outro: Chris Brown, Bow Wow]
Can't nobody get her but me

It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die
I be murderin' 'em, murderin' 'em just for fun (Hey)
I be murderin' 'em, murderin' 'em one by one (Hey)
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die

[Outro]
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die
(Die, die, die)

[Intro]
I'ma be paid forever
I look up, Finally Famous, nigga

[Chorus]
I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

[Verse 1]
All this bread can’t be too good for my cholesterol
Don’t come round talking loudly, fucking up my repertoire, dawg
I can’t lie bruh, lately I’ve been stressing heavily
I'm sipping, popping, smoking on whatever take the pressure off
You bitch you, FF Imperial
'Til my burial, dodging every bullet and venereal
Anti-fuckboy material, 'til I’m dead, I’m living proof
If you focus on what’s in front of ya and not what’s in the peripheral
It’s gone, word? Boy I seen drama on drama
Drama on drama, over comma on comma
I’m bringing home dead prez, my house done feel like it's haunted
I put the city on my back, right along with my garments
Went to sleep, snoring

[Chorus]
I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

[Verse 2]
I got three jobs like I'm Jamaican though
I need three wives like I was Haitian though
One cook, one clean, the other PMS’ing
No hablo inglés if police ask questions
We don’t know what that mean, nigga
They say Detroit going through the Great Depression
Still it’s been depressed so long, I can’t even tell depression here
My homeboy still gon’ pull up on them rims big as a Ferris wheel
So many rides up on the curb, my lil cuz thought the fair was here
Like oh, I'm primo, top spot redeemed ho
For who? My team
And we might take a trip to Jamaica, Montego
Pussy and flamingos
Got me thinking fuck I need to sleep for? Huh

[Chorus]
I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

[Outro]
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline
Ayy, lemme get the, uh, lil bitch

[Verse 1]
I will stop, I will stop at nothing
Say the right things when electioneering
I trust I can rely on your vote

[Chorus]
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet

[Laughing]

[Verse 2]
Riot shields, voodoo economics, your turn, your turn
It's just business, cattle prods and the I.M.F
I trust I can rely on your vote

[Chorus]
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet

[Verse 1]
It barks at no one else but me
Like it's seen a ghost
I guess it's seen the sparks a-flowin
No one else would know

[Chorus]
Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I get overcharged
That's when you see sparks
They ask me where the hell I'm going
At a thousand feet per second

[Chorus]
Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down

[Verse 1: Akon]
Come on, baby, and drop it
Scrub the floor and just mop it
Show these gangsters how you pop lock it
Don't care what you got in your pocket
I get the way that you rocking
Flip that thang thang don't stop it
When I just bang bang and pop it
While the club crowded just watch you (Work it out)

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
Got a gang of cash and it's going all on the bar (Now work it out)
And it's going fast cause I feel like a superstar (Now work it out)
And you may not have it, I might just broke the law (Now work it out)
It's your time to grab it, now make this whole thing yours
(Now work it out)

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Hey, said a hustler's work is never through

[Verse 2: Akon]
Yes, I'm fresh-to-death lookin' plush
Ladies can't get enough
Got my fitness, I'm looking buff
And all my people with me, I trust
Holding down for my city
If they asking you, I'm not guilty
Only thing that I'm guilty of is making you rock with me
(Work it out)

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
Got a gang of cash and it's going all on the bar (Now work it out)
And it's going fast cause I feel like a superstar (Now work it out)

Winter time, the Beamer color Danny Glovers neck
Better be careful who you runnin' with
I'm at the top of the food chain there's blood inside the water
I had to grow up fast because I had to feed my daughter, right
Make this right at the light
Pop a Uie lite the ooey
Now I'm higher than some Ewing's
Breezing on the belt
Rocking sheep skin sheeps at bay
Damn Bronson why you be that way
Bitch I'm still that same motherfucker that you know from youth
From goof troop
Now you sticking drugs inside your poop shoot
New Coupe on the duce felxin' heavy
Perfect plex her pussy at the Getty
I'm alpha feddie
Pull the limo on the lawn
Jump out I'm just hallucinating, acid and a Knicks hat
Burner in her dress pants
Knife inside my left hand
Now theres just a dead lamb
Tryin' to feed my fam
Ooh yeah, ten golden grams
No bears
Fold paper like chairs
Pulled off capers by the stairs
Capers on the veal piccata
Lost paper 'cause Prince Fielder couldn't field a fucking pop up
Fucking bastard, it's me

[Verse 1]
Flying high in the friendly sky
Without leaving the ground
The rest of the folks are tired and weary
And have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger waits
And it's bound to forsake me

[Chorus]
So stupid minded
But I go crazy, when I can't find it

In the morning I'll be alright my friends
Soon the night will bring the pains again

[Verse 2]
Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
That does seen nothing but trouble baby
Paraphernalia is my name
There's a place where the feeling awaits me
Self destruction's in my hands

[Chorus]

I know I'm hooked my friends
To the boy who makes slaves out of men

[Bridge] 

[Marvin Gaye w/ The Originals]

[Verse 1]
I come up hard, baby, but now I'm cool

Then start all over and win again

'Cause Trouble Man don't get in my way, hey, hey

[Bridge]
I know some places
And I see some faces

They dig my directions
What people say, that's okay
They don't bother me, no

Don't care what the weather
Don't care 'bout no trouble
Got myself together

That's all around me

[Post-Verse 2]

[Intro]
Yo, all your bitches got the green boat

[Verse 1]
People worship these idols 'til they come in contact with Gods
Hoes is all my disciples, you get mind fucked with these broads (Goddamn)
Life is just a recital, better 'member all that you practiced (Whoa)
When I die, throw a couple bad bitches in my casket, whoa
Think it's time for a revolution, me and my dogs 'bout to start a riot
Still they sleeping but I'm eating, you and your people are on a diet
Tim Allen off Home Improvement, 'telligent but we going stupid
This the new shit, hit the strip club, see some hoes that I went to school with
Out in London like Lennox Lewis (Whoa,) bitch looking like Farrah Fawcett (Whoa)
I'm just tryna make better music, get this money, share the profits (Let's go)
Now this class gettin' led by students, smoke some weed, get head while I do it
Started out under the ground, they didn't fuck with me, now they all coming around
Money, I'm hunting it down, planting the seeds, working and watching it grow
I got so many ways I can make money, I'll always be straight, I just thought you should know

[Refrain]
Been on my grind, taking what's mine, I got my eyes on the throne
I'ma be fine, no matter the time, we all go along with the show, yo

[Chorus]
That girl beautiful, somebody introduce me
She ain't your girl tonight, nah, that bitch a groupie
There's some money in the building, better give it to me (Let's go, let's go)
I see you starin' at me like you in the movies
(Whoa, whoa) Yeah, now you watching movies
L—l—lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies
Lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies
L—l—lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies

[Verse 2]
People worship these idols 'til they come in contact with Gods
Hoes is all my disciples, you get mind fucked with these broads (Goddamn)
Life is just a recital, better 'member all that you practiced (Whoa)
When I die, throw a couple bad bitches in my casket, whoa
Fuck a day job, fuck a day job, got ya bitch here in just a tank top
Getting paid, roll my face off, bitch you're bank fraud: Bernie Madoff
Educate y'all then erase y'all, LL Cool J without the Kangol
I don't see the need to stunt, wish you the best, I'ma just light up this blunt
This bitch love me long time, don't know why she wouldn't
Say my D could win the Heisman, yeah, I'm Charles Woodson
Couple million off a tour, thats a lot of bookings (Money)
My bitches gorgeous looking, imported from the shore to Brooklyn
Coming from out of the 'Burgh, bitch, I'm absurd, fuck you, I hope you insured
Hating? I'll give you just what you deserve, that's my word, put it on all that I'm worth

[Refrain]
Been on my grind, taking what's mine, I got my eyes on the throne
I'ma be fine, no matter the time, we all go along with the show, yo

[Intro: Delusional Thomas]
*Coughs*
I think I'm gettin' sick
Been in this room
Like I was hidin' from somethin'
Look, ugh

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Posin' a question: how many been empty and holdin' aggression?
Close to depression, open your eyes and just focus a second
Fuck a recession, my brother my mind is my weapon
I'm lettin' it go, loaded and pointed at negative energy
Tellin' me stop, they tellin' me, "No" (Don't)
Your aura is somethin' you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, whores got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feelin' come after the shock
Praise me, I'd rather you not, 'cause
It's drivin' me crazy, the fact that you pay me amaze me
That's somethin' I love
You come to the club searchin' for drugs, drunk, fuckin' these sluts
God loves me, what if he does? What does it mean?
You wastin' away doin' nothin', you frontin'
Why aren't you chasin' your dreams, ugh?
We wonder 'bout life, but none of us willin' to learn
The money we earn is somethin' to burn
Why won't they give me a turn? I'll
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?
When them high-rollers homes in Vegas raided with some home invasion
Contaminatin' the place with plague, we just saved the day

[Refrain 1: Mac Miller]
I waste away in a room spittin' these raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm givin' it back, yep

[Chorus: Niki Randa]
It's a gift
(Our) Our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
(Our) Our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Forfeitin' the war, he lays his sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store, begins to contemplate
Dealin' with death like he work in the morgue, absorbin' souls forgotten
He lost his way, starin' down that barrel, thinkin', "Not today"
Life's so precious, Lord knows that life is so precious
Fight to the death 'til there's nobody left
And you holdin' your breath 'cause you might get infected
I'm animalistic, instinctively thinkin' of gettin' ballistic
Be specific, to those in control we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined
My trigger finger itchin', all I kill is time—*Bang*
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shootin' lasers
'Cept I'm cool with Vader and blowin' up rooms that's full of strangers
A news anchor the youth can relate to, it's nature
You a hater? I'll deal with you later, no, thank ya
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors
Really Doe, come on, homie, we major

[Refrain 2: Mac Miller]
I waste away in this room spittin' out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm givin' it back

[Chorus: Niki Randa]
It's a gift
(Our) Our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
(Our) Our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive

[Beat Switch]

[Outro: Ab-Soul & Mac Miller]
It's just a different time, man
It's just a different time
There was a time
When we showed love
Da, da-da, da-da, da-da
You know like how we (Da, da-da, da-da, da-da)
Approach a young lady (Oh-whoa)
You see a beautiful young lady, you like (Oh-whoa)

See all these bitches and... (Oh-whoa)
Hoes and... (La, da-da, da-da, da-da)
Thots? I just don't understand it  (Da, da-da, da-da, da-da-da-da)
I don't know what's to come of you, young man (Dum, la-da-da, dum)
