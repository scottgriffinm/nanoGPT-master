 Dogg]
We came from a place where our hearts are pure
People wanna know what we're marchin' for
Grouped up, scooped up all my pals
Flavor for days, so much style
They can't even put it in a box now (Wow)
Stepped out, gator smile, wait a while
"Excuse me, Snoopy, can we get a flick?"
I ain't really trippin', go on, take that shit

[Pre-Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
What? It's really gon' be 'bout gettin' love
And that's only 'cause I give love
I stand up for it, I manned up for it like a brother 'posed to
Went through, go through, goin' through, knowin' you
Showin' you, flowin' to and the mental to grow into
Let bygones be bygones
So you can be an icon like I've done

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Every time I turn around, every time they hear my sound
They get me all up underground, still inside the box
Fuck what they say, just be, the Black folk like it, it's a hit
How can this true gangster shit be still outside the box?

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Own it like I want it, that's 24/7
Me and my dawgs on the highway to Heaven
Just put a Funko in 7-Eleven
It's a trifecta, me, Jasmine, and Kevin
Built a massive team that's passion themed
Do it for the love, on top there's the cream
I do it 'til I did that, get enough
Run it up, rake enough, make enough to give back

[Pre-Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
What? It's really gon' be 'bout gettin' love
And that's only 'cause I give love
I stand up for it, I manned up for it like a brother 'posed to
Went through, go through, goin' through, knowin' you
Showin' you, flowin' to and the mental to grow into
Let bygones be bygones
So you can be an icon like I've done

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Every time I turn around, every time they hear my sound
They get me all up underground, still inside the box
Fuck what they say, just be, the Black folk like it, it's a hit
How can this true gangster shit be still outside the box?

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
(Blackberry molasses)
(One of the things that never change)
(You gotta keep pushing on)
(The sun don't rain all the time)
(There's gonna be some heartache and pain)
You gotta keep pushing on
Just sitting here reminiscing, man
Pushing on
Gotta keep pushing on
Mm
You gotta keep push—

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Who remember growing up eating Corn Flakes?
Spend the night at granny house 'cause momma on a date
So you ate what you ate and you ate it quick
'Cause you knew your grandma, she ain't play that shit
Paw Paw, he stayed in another house
With another woman, she a brick house
Growing up fast was a shit show
It's a fеw things I learned from the gеt go
A few folks in my fam fell down
Then they got they feet back on solid ground
And came back around and showed me how to fail
See there's a lesson every time a nigga take a L
Dead or in jail, that's the fairytale
What I know about it? I know it very well
That's why I don't stop, won't stop, can't quit
Keep pushing making that dope shit

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & T.I.]
You gotta keep push—
Through the good and the bad
Whether happy or sad
Tryna stand as a man
You gotta keep pushing on
We will see what they do
Keep your head up and move
Love will always come through (Yeah, a'ight Snoop)
You gotta keep push—

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Through hell or high water, keep my confidence on the level
Let my family support me, it could be me against whoever
Say I'm cancelled, I say even better
Man, who gon' tell 'em?
Your opinion doesn't validate me, I been the shit
In my hood, can't get no better, could never intimidate me
Trap music say we geniuses, politics say we crazy (Shit)
Man, I was selling Ye when Brenda had a baby
When nothing but hip-hop could come and save me
And I just sat there on the pavement
Tryna find a way to make some payment
Had first dibs when they came in
Selling pounds of reefer was strange then (What?)
For eight thousand they gave me ten of 'em
Drove to make it make twenty off the same ten
All our lives we were taught to just hold the pain in (For real)
Imitate Neanderthals and copy cavemen
Can't teach a man how to make it with a handout
Fuck fitting in, keep pushing until you standout

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
You gotta keep push—
Through the good and the bad
Whether happy or sad
Tryna stand as a man
You gotta keep pushing on
We will see what they do
Keep your head up and move
Love will always come through
You gotta keep pushing on
Through the good and the bad
Whether happy or sad
Tryna stand as a man
You gotta keep pushing on
We will see what they do
Keep your head up and move
Love will always come through
You gotta keep pushing on

[Outro]
Blackberry molasses
One of the things that never change
You gotta keep pushing on

[Chorus]
Another episode of a Doggy Dogg tale, you know me well
You know I'm coming by the smell
I’m here when you see the weed smoke in the air
Party people, wave your hands like you just don't care
Crip your enthusiasm

[Verse 1]
Mm, pen and paper, money maker, let the beat ride
Let me put you up on this nigga from the east side
This nigga born ready, serve a nigga ether
With the pen or off the heady, this nigga flow is dеadly (Where he at?)
Right hеre, Snoop Dogg, I'm with the G Child
Play something, let me fuck you up just with this freestyle (That’s dope)
For sure, but let's make a real record with real effort
'Cause my pen game is lethal cyanide mixed with ether
Spittin' nothin' but them hits out
The Chronic put the world up on this shit Snoopy been about
I wrote it down, needed backup, called the hounds
I'm worldwide, you know the voice, you know the sound (Ha-ha)
Paint it like Picasso, my spot on top of the charts
You ain't fuckin' with the Dogg, I do this shit every day
I don’t play with this here, just look at my resume
I’m probably Pimp of the Year, that's what all the players say
My smooth tone, reppin’ for the blue zone
Crip shit, for niggas to get they groove on (Hey)
I tell my street life glory in a east side story
I got that Hall of Fame pen game, nigga, ain't shit changed
Still leave you niggas assed out like Ving Rhames
Ever since I started, I've been all about big things
Crip it, curve it, flip it and serve it
I'm at your service so don’t get nervous

[Bridge]
These are words coming from the Dogg
And everything I do is lit (Yes, sir)
Hoppin' right along, tryna get my party on
Call my nigga (Leon Black), let's go bust a bitch (Mm)

[Verse 2]
La-di-da-di, Snoopy's in the party
Smokin' that yessir, the best served, that's good for everybody
It's some players in the house, if you see 'em, point 'em out
Pulled up in that Bentley with my nigga Leon Black with me
That's simply two layers of mackin' on you bitches
Like true players (But I'm here with my baby daddy), bitch, who cares?
We came to make the party crack, no games
I'm in the party strapped, Snoop Dogg and Black, now, where the party at?
Pop that champagne bottle, we goin' up full throttle
Don't matter, wherever Snoopy go, these hoes gon' follow
Glasses up, we toastin', Backwoods I'm smokin'
V.I.P., I'm posted, eeny-meeny-miney
You know where to find me
With a cute-faced bitch, big ass and waist tiny
I got 'em lined up like tic-tac-toe, that's three in a row
An exotic bitch, a snow bunny and me and your ho
We all up in the club livin' our best life
Black gave a nigga thumbs, nigga like, "That's right"
Hit the dance floor with some twins, they was close friends
Back that ass up, she said, "Grab it with both hands"
Now players do what players do
You know the Dogg, no sugar-coatin', I speak the truth
I make the rules, grip it, curve it, flip it and serve it
I'm at your service, now, don't get nervous

[Chorus]
Another episode of a Doggy Dogg tale, you know me well
You know I'm coming by the smell
I'm here when you see the weed smoke in the air
Party people, wave your hands like you just don't care

Yeah, say what?
Crip your enthusiasm
Okay, like that?
Say what, say what?

All blue Chucks, blue bandana hangin' (Hangin')
Eastside Long Beach, 20 Crip gangin' (Sup, cuh?)
Tell them niggas as I put the weed to the flame (Yeah)
Nigga droppin' Doggystyle, 'bout to change the game

Funky worm, funky bassline
Get your bang on and party at the same time (Say what?)
I'm 'bout to show 'em how I put it down (Yeah)
You niggas never heard this raw sound (Yeah)
Killers on my team, I got all hounds (All hounds)
Spittin' rounds with the motherfuckin' Dogg Pound (Motherfuckin' Dogg Pound)
Put in work, stood my ground (Yes, uh-huh)
Murder case? Beat the trial (Say what?)

While I fuck this world doggy style (Ooh-wee)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I got my mind on my money and my 9 on me
Don't try it, homie, last nigga tried, nigga died on me
Slide homie the MAC for niggas tryna ride on me
Five shots to the back of your hat (Homicide on me)
Doggy all about the money, platinum hits, classic shit
You have to admit this nigga don't quit
Grab the clicky, it's lookin' iffy, all my Eastsiders ridin' with me
Real niggas keep it a buck fifty
A hundred fifty deep on the ground
Ghetto bird spotlight makin' rounds
Chillin' with a thick bitch, she like, "Daddy, how?"
Turn around, bitch, you know I like it doggy style

[Chorus]
Doggy on that Eastside shit (Eastside)
C-walkin', throwin' up Crip (Crip)

[Chorus: Emo Trap]
Scoot up Lamborghini with lil' shawty, she the baddest

Scoot up Lamborghini with lil' shawty, she the baddest

She put up with my shit, so if she want it, I'ma grab it
Ice all on your neck, I put them horses in the carriage

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Break laws, big kahunas, and big balls
Bad bitches, I break 'em off, the big boss is back at you, pissed off
She ain't got no direction, she a bit lost
I kick it off at my penthouse loft downtown 'cross the city
She saditty, but we don't really fall in that category
She go silly for Daddy
Cincinnati bread, she do what Daddy said
From gourmet meal cookin' to givin' Daddy some head
All her bottoms is red, niggas draped in blue
Never broke a stare, she make it do what it do
Welcome to my family, from me to you
I ain't your father, I'm your daddy, bitch
Keep Daddy rich
Hold it down and don't let Daddy slip
I'm out of town, I'll be back, daddy trip
I'm gone, sit back and watch Daddy dip (Yeah)

[Chorus: Emo Trap]
Scoot up Lamborghini with lil' shawty, she the baddest
She gon' roll the weed, shoot the gun, she a savage

Scoot up Lamborghini with lil' shawty, she the baddest
She gon' roll the weed, shoot the gun, she a savage

Ice all on your neck, I put them horses in the carriage

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Ooh, I ain't your father, I'm your—
Yeah, I ain't your father, I'm your—
Yeah, I ain't your father, I'm your—
I'm a big time nigga, not a bitch-flyin' nigga
Zip tie, nigga, don't try, nigga
Low patience, no fakin', I slip by, nigga
Get up in her ear, now your bitch mines, nigga
Quit lyin', nigga, your bitch for the streets
Gettin' closer to Daddy, I put her on a leash before that bitch get loose
Now we on the roof
Bitch brought the liquor, big Daddy got the juice
Five, four, three, two, one, I see her run
Captivate her mind, hop off that gun
I proceed to put the game up in her
Don't worry 'bout it, nigga, she's with a winner (Ooh-wee)
I drop the top, she light the weed up
Cruise control, I don't speed up (Ah)
Super Crip with a bitch up in the caddy
I'm not your father, bitch, I'm your daddy

[Bridge: Emo Trap]
She call me daddy like she don't know who her daddy is
I go up in her 'til she know I'm like a sedative
Cuttin' up like Jimmy Bones
When they pull up to my house, she gon' let 'em in
Homie like to let 'em in
Casamigo' in my body tryna settle in
I just put back on my clothes, now she wet again
She ain't trippin' 'bout no bitch that she look better than
Gotta buy my bitch a body, she my medicine

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Wiz Khalifa]
They don't know what we saw (You saw), the pain we come from (Oh)
But we ain't gotta worry no more (Woah)
They don't know what we saw (We saw), the pain we come from (From)
But we ain't gotta worry no more

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
From residing in Long Beach to
Havin' the president at our arms reach to
My compound being so damn profound
They told me all of this shit was beyond me (Ooh-wee)
I seen homicides by way of drive-bys
Hoppin' on jets, funny how time flies
I got big shoes to fill, they Laurents, I
Shed a tear as I stare in my mom's eyes
Yeah, I prophesied it and I manifested
Yeah, my pockets were skinny, yeah, they was anorexic
Yeah, I beat a murder case and made your favorite records (Records)
Yeah, let me say this message

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Wiz Khalifa]
They don't know what we saw (You saw), the pain we come from (Oh)
But we ain't gotta worry no more (Woah)
They don't know what we saw (We saw), the pain we come from (From)
But we ain't gotta worry no more

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa & Snoop Dogg and Snoop Dogg]
Uh, neighborhoods, the gentrified
Our efforts, they wanna minimize
But a nigga serve a living God
But sometimes, we still ask, "Why?"
'Cause they don't know my pain and struggle
All the shit I seen
'Cause they just see the flashin' lights, the car
The shit was a dream
Cousins is doin' life sentence
All of my bitches light-skinned
History in the making and we right in it
Grand slam on yo' ass in the 9th inning

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Wiz Khalifa]
They don't know what we saw (You saw), the pain we come from (Oh)
But we ain't gotta worry no more (Woah)
They don't know what we saw (We saw), the pain we come from (From)
But we ain't gotta worry no more

[Outro]
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, uh-huh, oh-oh
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, ayy (Yeah)
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it, I know you're a star

[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Uncle Murda]
Yeah
I need somethin' from David Ruffin right now
Where you at, David?
Kick some shit for me, cuh
It's in the air
Yeah
It's everywhere
Haha
Yeah
Uncle Murda
I know you with me, nigga
It's in the air
It's in the air
It's everywhere
I smell you, nigga
Haha
Snoop, I feel it in the air
West Coast, East Coast, you know the vibes

[Verse 1: Uncle Murda]
I used to be a soldier, nigga, I did what I was told
Bossed up, got niggas under me now that I control
Got interrogated for homicides, I ain't never fold
Sold drugs, sold pussy, ain't never sell my soul
Got shot, shot niggas, I been through all that shit
Wanted Jordans back when my mama couldn't afford them shits
Watching her struggle made me not wanna be a civilian
Acquired the finer things in life by being a villain
If you ain't played the field, you wouldn't understand my story
All them robberies we committed back then was mandatory (They was)
All your niggas might not be there for you when you need them
You gon' find out who is who when you fighting for your freedom
You in a gang, you'd be a fool to think everyone loyal
My kids don't know nothing 'bout struggling, all of them spoiled
That's why I do this shit, thought y'all niggas knew this shit
If I can't put food on they table, I'ma start shooting shit

[Interlude: Jane Handcock & Snoop Dogg]
It's in the air
It's everywhere
Said, it's in the air
It's in the air
It's everywhere
Ooh
Let me in this motherfucker, Murda

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
When yo-yonder, we ponder, slip raindrops
Shit don't stop, we be rocking 'til the pain stops
Meditate, take a hit and levitate
Sit your ass down, boy, let me get your head straight
Look into my eyes 'til your pupils dilate
And if you really want that smoke, then I must annihilate
Fly away with no one
'Pon my return, I'm on one
Which leads me to plead the fifth
On the sixth and the seventh, I was blowing an eighth
On the ninth and the tenth, I was back in LA
On the eleventh and the twelfth, I was in the UK
Ask anybody, regulate it
Separate it
A tall glass of orange juice, concentrate it
Spraying niggas down with the sucker repellant
So you can smell what I'm smoking and you can see what I'm selling, nigga

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
It's in the air
It's everywhere
It's in the air
It's everywhere
Ooh
Yeah, it's in the air
And I'm talking 'bout love, love is in the air
See, love is a deadly word though
It's a thin line between love and hate, my nigga
See, 'cause a nigga could hate you so much, right?
But he really love you
Don't you know that stuff comes off
You're not so tough

I'll meet you at the backdoor with the baggie and a light
It'll keep it off your mind

Don't talk to me and pretend you care
He's not here, he's not there, he's not anywhere

Miss you already
Now we miss you already
Now we miss you already

You forgot the place you knew
The figure carved into your arm is fading by the day
Soon it will go away

Don't talk to me and pretend you care
You're not here, you're not there, you're not anywhere

[Part I]

[Intro Sample: Interviewer and Princess Diana]
"What effect did the depression have on your marriage?"
"Well, it gave everybody a wonderful new label, 'Diana's unstable and Diana's mentally imbalanced', and unfortunately, that seems to have stuck on over the years."
"Are you saying that label stuck within your marriage?"
"I think people used it. And it stuck."
"According to press reports, it was suggested that it was around this time things became so difficult, that you actually tried to injure yourself. Is that true?"
"Mhm. When no one's listening to you, or you feel like no one's listening to you, all sorts of things start to happen . For instance, you have so much pain inside yourself, that you try and hurt yourself on the outside, because you want help, but it's the wrong help you're asking for. People see it as crying wolf or attention seeking, and they think because you're in the media all the time, you've got enough attention, inverted commas, but I was actually crying because I wanted to get better."

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood, Matt Champion, & Dom McLennon]
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, now
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me now, give it to me now, now, now
Give it to me now, give it to me now, now, now
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, now, now
Give it to me now, now, now
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract & Merlyn Wood]
Sometimes I be mad that I ain't sexy
Sometimes I be shy to show my blessings
Poppin' like a carbonated beverage
The cops poppin' niggas Orville Redenbacher
Ian, you sexy!

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Most times I give friends more time than family
You remember when I used to feel like I don't understand me
Now we speakin' the same language
I don't listen like I can be
But I'm learnin'
But I'm learnin'
But I'm learnin'

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Sometimes I feel like I'm way too sexy
Most the singers found me in the desert
Minimi-, minimi-
Handle my business, don't talk to me directly
No one above me actin' like they all so lovely
Recogni-, Recogni-
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Heels switchin', finger clicking
Kick on me like I’m James Bond on a role
They want the boot of my car
Pussy boy like booty call
Money quick like auctioneer
You need a neutral career
Look what we did in a year
Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 4: Joba]
Oh, I'm lonesome, and hopeless
But hopeful, but hopeful
What's a boy to do lost in the world trying to find a balance
Sippin' out his chalice with its jewels dancing
Fluid like the potion
That pours when I get down some
Just trying to find a port in the sky where
The sun can shine down some
Jesus is lord, I put that on god
What more do you want from me?
He's in the dark, he's just a child
They turned their backs on me
Nevermind what it was
I see enemies
Don't want what's best for me
Best believe

[Bridge: Joba]
I'm lonesome
But hopeful, But hopeful
I'm lonesome
But hopeful, But hopeful

[Verse 5: Kevin Abstract]
'Times, it be so spot on it hurts
Like when auntie couldn't decide between going to work or church
I been in my feelings on that island in the dirt
I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
I said I tried vacation, I tried to run away
I deleted Facebook, I'd trade fame any day
For a quiet texas place, and a BBQ plate
I'll switch my place if that's good for ya

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Is that good for ya?
Good for ya
Is that good for ya?
Good for ya
Is that good for ya?

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Give it to me, Give it to me
Give it to me now, Give it to me now
Give it to me now, now
Give it to me now, Give it to me now, now, now

[Verse 2: bearface]
Over eighteen with the windows fogged
Her brown skin with our fingers locked
Feel the air like it's sunny out
But I don't want you to go girl cause I'm tired of the waiting
Tired of waiting (ay, ay, yeah)
Tired of waiting, but you gotta be free

[Chorus: bearface]
(Freak ah, ah) Oh, your love
Won't you come this close to me?

[Chorus: L.M.A. Rubbi]
I'm makin' all these bankrolls (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2: Vadar]
She's a bitch, uh-huh, fuck her (No cap)
Hit 'em with a silencer (Yeah, bitch)
I swear life is a bitch, more like a bitch is the wife, huh
I guess it's too late, she died, now who gonna get the knife? (Bitch)
Sadness fillin' my veins, I think I'm in pain
Stab me in the back while I'm walkin' in the rain
It's like 12 o'clock, late time (Yeah, yeah)
She'll never be mine, yeah, bitch

[Chorus: L.M.A. Rubbi]
I'm makin' all these bankrolls (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'm fallin' down in my hole (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I told all my stories at fourteen years old
All my rhymes are bold
I'm makin' all these bankrolls (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'm fallin' down in my hole (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I told all my stories at fourteen years old
All my rhymes are bold
Yeah, oh shit, yeah, yeah, I’ll say this
Here’s a journey
A future presentation
Yeah, Kid Mesc
They say im shiesty, most of them they don’t like me
I’m in a movie, but i’m not moving
I’m trying to keep it real, im trynna cop a deal, but i’m in a movie and im not moving
I’m in a movie doing photos on the real, the way i feel i can make a mill spend it all with my dawgie
See clearly nigga, even when it’s foggy, when i spit this shit man it’s mind boggling, (nigga) what’s next, walk into your complex, have a private jet land on the roof, and i better stay truth in the booth, i guеss that’s me, amd dawg im as guilty as charge, living averagе to living at large, druglords and cocaine pushers that wasn't my life, white tees and white nikes is what i like, and i didn't care that my life was trife, but still i sat and write, every night and day, had to get my money up, had to get paid, i hope i do this before the credits roll, and imma get my money and watch it fold
They say im shiesty, most of them they don’t like me
I’m in a movie, but i’m not moving
I’m trying to keep it real, im trynna cop a deal, but i’m in a movie and im not moving
The plot is.. learning to survive inside a
World with
Hatred in me and in me I see Gold just like momma told me but the truth is no more, skys greyer than ever, cemented, five percent of my life is happily spent, the rest of my free time i getting bent, and his film is a riddle, having yet solve all the hints, and my thoughts are complex, but im strong with common sense, the climax is intense, involving sin and gin, battling to make it happen I feel my life will end, but the acts are so many, and the scenes never end, i feel that im in the matrix, while i watch is ? In. The screen play was written by jesus christ himself, i ain't playing with cards but i fuck with the ones i was dealt, when i move precence Is felt, beyond the drama under my belt, since the earths on its axis, that puts my beam on a tilt
They say im shiesty, most of them they don’t like me
I’m in a movie, but i’m not moving
I’m trying to keep it real, im trynna cop a deal, but i’m in a movie and im not moving

[Verse 1]
My my, hey hey
Rock and roll is here to stay
It's better to burn out than to fade away
My my, hey hey

[Verse 2]
Out of the blue and into the black
They give you this, but you pay for that
And once you're gone you can't come back
When you're out of the blue and into the black

[Verse 3]
The king is gone but he's not forgotten
This is the story of Johnny Rotten
It's better to burn out than it is to rust
The king is gone but he's not forgotten

[Verse 4]
My my, hey hey
Rock and roll is here to stay
Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can nevеr die

Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die

[Verse 1]
I caught you knockin' at my cellar door
I love you, baby, can I have some more?
Oh, oh, the damage done

[Verse 2]
I hit the city and I lost my band
I watched the needle take another man
Gone, gone, the damage done

[Verse 3]
I sing the song because I love the man
I know that some of you don't understand
Milk blood to keep from running out

[Verse 4]
I've seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
But every junkie's like a setting sun

[Verse 4]
I've seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
Every junkie's like a setting sun
When it comes to Lu, there really isn't anything that she doesn't do. She's a singer, songwriter, rapper, producer, plays multiple instruments, and is the owner and founder of my own label ROAM SOSHAL If that's not enough of a well-rounded background, she is also a soldier in the U.S Air Force and is a student who just received a full-ride scholarship for a Global Security and Intelligence degree and she is of Latina and Native American descent
 
Needless to say, Lu is an impressivе person and an artist. In three short years, she has built thе base of her music career and has already amassed 3,000 monthly average listeners on Spotify. She has crafted a sound all her own, her songs are clever, catchy, and cool, and she has her eyes on a big future
 
She has a new single out titled "Dirty, Dirty" so we took some time to catch up with her and learn more about her music, story, and future. We'll certainly get to her music, but first, let's learn a bit about her background and how she got started in music
 
Here's what the blossoming star told us about her beginning in music
 
“I got started in music through school funded projects. Some folks came to our hood and essentially "adopted" me and some other kids - we were given free music lessons and taught everything about music theory. Looking back on it, I think about how lucky I was. The kids who could afford to pay were probably paying thousands of dollars. That's how I learned piano. Our schools also taught latin music and since we're right on the border, they made the effort to teach us about our culture and I think that's why I view music the way I do now; with that sense of responsibility. I learned violin, classical guitar, and some more Latin instruments. We mainly learned Spanish and Mexican music and we also had teachers from the Dominican Republic come and teach us Bachata, Salsa, etc. Then one day this older kid from the high school came to visit and I remember he started playing one of my favorite rap songs on the piano and my mind was blown. I'd only played classical songs on the piano at that point, so I went home and started teaching myself all my favorite songs and that eventually led to me learning how to produce my own songs. But I consider my REAL start in music happening in about 2018 when I went to Seoul. I didn't know anything about the country or the culture, I didn't speak the language at the time. I had just gotten a real job and money for the first time and I wanted to go somewhere I'd never been before so I booked the flight. The whole time I was there I didn't know what was going on but I remember the one thing that was familiar was music and that really touched me because I thought it was so poetic. I remember thinking "music really does tie us all together". So as soon as I got off the plane I decided I was gonna go all out on music. That trip led to me starting my label, it even led to me talking to you right now. The first time I was ever in a recording studio was in Seoul.”
 
On her major influences, she had this to say
 
"Anything that's different, new, innovative! That's what my major music influences tend to be in general. Something that makes me feel that fire, that passion. Something that makes me remember why I love music. Anything that stands out automatically inspires me. Like, "How come I didn't think of that" or "Man, this is such a good idea, I see what they did there... I get what they were going for". Because it makes me want to do something too, it's like the feeling of a relay race I guess. Passing the baton. To me, that's the whole point of all of this
 
In our years of working with artists, this almost spiritual tie to music is one we've seen before and we love. This in-depth love and care for her music are reflected in the songs that she makes. That makes it a good time to turn our attention to her latest single, "Dirty, Dirty"
 
"Dirty, Dirty"
 
First, here is the track for you to check out
 
With her growing fan base and an incredible new single, it's clear this is just the start for Lu. We asked her about what her overall goals were
 
"I wanna be one of the biggest, most influential, and respected artists, but it's not for myself. I just feel like if I can innovate, if I can create something new, and I can be on the world stage then that's my way of saving my dying culture; Native Americans... Indigenous people. If I can use my ability to speak a lot of languages and relate directly to more people and make them feel loved and appreciated then it'll go both ways. I guess that's a lot of pressure to put on myself but it's how I feel and the scary thing is, I know I'm gonna succeed at it."
 
A ton of musicians feel a larger calling and that is clearly the case here. Lu's mission drives her and it helps make her music really stand out. Before we let her go we gave her the chance to tell you why you should check out her music
 
"You should check out my music because it's FOR YOU. Wherever you are and whoever you are it was made with you in mind."
 
Lu is an artist that is focused on delivering for her fans and living a higher purpose

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Walkin' through The Sandbox with flip-flops on
This reminds me of a hip-hop song (Right on)
No Instagrams, no TikToks on
You run up on the Dogg and get bip-bopped on (Bip-bopped on?)
Back in the days, yeah, they took my songs
But if I get back, then I could live like that (Facts)
See, we don't cry over spilled milk
I'm Snoop Dogg, baby, and I'm smooth as silk
Every beat I rapped on, that bitch was killed
Every brim I wore, that ho was tilt
I'm standin' tall like I'm walkin' on stilts
Aftermath on blast from the house I built, uh (Haha)
And that's east to the west, right?
The niggas on my team, they say they livin' they best life
A drug dealer turned CEO
And I'ma show you how to get this dough

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Livin' what I call the way I did it
Doin' it my way, that's how I get it
Reppin' the east side, Long Beach city
Keepin' it gangsta is all I know, know
We gon' throw our set up (Set up)
And we gon' get our bread up
While I roll my weed up
In my Sandbox with my feet up (Feet up)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
We keep blowin' trees, all these emergencies
A hundred-million-dollar deals with this cryptocurrency
Spitter, hitter, did her, get her, man, I got a lotta moves
Used to spend a lotta bread on a whole lotta jewels
Fools learn fast, so I must be the fastest
Took all my classes, learned it by the masses
Surpassed all the masters, now I'm the master
Last thing out there is my Doggystyle masters
Yeah, I gotta have it like a bad habit
'Cause Doggystyle, nigga, was a motherfuckin' classic (Ooh-wee)
Am I lyin'? No, you not
It was hot, so motherfucker, gimme what you got
Now we can get off into some gangsta shit
We can laugh, toast or blast (What up, cuz?)
Or you can be a gentleman
And handle this shit like you got some class

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Livin' what I call the way I did it
Doin' it my way, that's how I get it
Reppin' the east side, Long Beach city
Keepin' it gangsta is all I know, know
We gon' throw our set up (Set up)
And we gon' get our bread up
While I roll my weed up
In my Sandbox with my feet up (Feet up)

[Verse 1]
Oh, make me over
I'm all I wanna be
A walking fire
You can't get rid of me

[Chorus]
Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you really made it
Hey, so glad you could make it now

[Verse 2]
Oh, look at my face
My name is "Might-Have-Been"
My name is "Never Was"
My name's forgotten

[Chorus]
Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you really made it
Hey, there's only us left now

[Post-Chorus]
When I wake up in my makeup
It's too early for that dress
Wilted and faded somewhere in Hollywood
I'm glad I came hеre with your pound of flesh
No second billing 'causе you're a star now
Cinderella, they aren't trash like you
Beautiful garbage, beautiful dresses
Can you stand up or will you just fall down?

[Verse 3]
You better watch out
What you wish for
Better be worth it
So much to die for

[Chorus]
Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you really made it
Hey, there's only us left now

[Post-Chorus]
When I wake up in my makeup
Have you ever felt so used up as this?
It's all so sugarless, useless waitress
Model, actress, oh, just go nameless
Honeysuckle, she's full of poison
She obliterated everything she kissed
And now she's fading somewhere in Hollywood
I'm glad I came here with your pound of flesh

[Outro]
You want a part of me?
Well, I'm not selling cheap
No, I'm not selling cheap

[Verse 1]
I caught you knockin' at my cellar door
I love you, baby, can I have some more?
Oh, oh, the damage done

[Verse 2]
I hit the city and I lost my band
I watched the needle take another man
Gone, gone, the damage done

[Verse 3]
I sing the song because I love the man
I know that some of you don't understand
Milk-blood to keep from runnin' out

[Verse 4]
I've seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
But every junkie's like a setting sun

[Verse 4]
I've seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
Every junkie's like a setting sun

[Outro]
Seen the needle and the damage done

[Verse 1]
Bad fog of loneliness
Put a cloud on my single-mindedness
I dream of sweet caress from you

[Verse 2]
What makes tomorrow guess
What makes me take from me and put aside the rest
I dream of sweet caress from you

[Bridge]
So long woman I am gone
So much pain to go through
Come back, maybe I was wrong

[Verse 1]
Bad fog of loneliness
Put a cloud on my single-mindedness
I dream of sweet caress from you

[Verse 1]
Over my head
It's looking like a stalemate has happened again
You were dreaming of saying it was my fault
Had it 'til the very end
If I'm alone, would you spare me?
Take it upon myself for blessings
'Cause I think that I'm facing this problem from the stern
Like before

[Pre-Chorus]
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me

[Chorus]
You don't love me like you used to
You don't even seem to care
Time to mend away these bruises
You don't even seem to care

[Post-Chorus]
We fight fires of pain
For saving face
Dreaming of a yesterday
Oh, to the edge of fate
No celebration
Dreaming of a yesterday
Oh, I wish I could've said
Wish could've said something
Dreaming of a yesterday
Feel it slip away
Slip away, slip away, slip away, slip away

[Verse 2]
Over my head
I'm veering far more frequently
No surprises
I'm praying for a miracle
So when I said I'm not myself
You get caught in between
All I'd ever need

[Pre-Chorus]
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me

[Chorus]
You don't love me like you used to
You don't even seem to care
Time to mend away these bruises
You don't even seem to care

[Post-Chorus]
We fight fires of pain
For saving face
Dreaming of a yesterday
Oh, to the edge of fate
No celebration
Dreaming of a yesterday
Oh, wish could've said
Wish I could've said something
Dreaming of a yesterday
Feel it slip away
Slip away, slip away, slip away, slip away

[Verse 1]
Gold survives the fire
You curse it with your charm
I keep you underneath my arm
I owe ya peace of mind
I'll keep you safe from harm
No reason to sound the alarms

[Verse 2]
The blessing of the saint
He cursed you with his soul
And now it seems you've lost control
And though a different age
It still lies in the soil
In time to quantify

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, the wheel, it keeps on turning
While the world around us keeps on burning

[Chorus]
You see the moon and the stars
Though we heavily fall apart
I was hoping to leave this for a brighter start
But now with you as my witness
Let's set off to the stars
Hope that we find the special placе within our hearts

[Verse 3]
Gold survives the rain
Undеr the oath I swear
It's taken time for me to care
But blessed is the name
Of yours I take to bear
I watch your soul slowly appear

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, the wheel it keeps on turning
While the world around us keeps on burning

[Chorus]
You see the moon and the stars
Though we heavily fall apart
I was hoping to leave this for a brighter start
But now with you as my witness
Let's set off to the stars
Hope that we find the special place within our hearts
Within our hearts

[Bridge]
Ooh, the wheel, it keeps on turning
While the world, it keeps on burning
Ooh, the wheel it keeps on turning
While the world, it keeps on burning

[Chorus]
You see the moon and the stars
Though we heavily fall apart
I was hoping to leave this for a brighter start
But now with you as my witness
Let's set off to the stars
Hope that we find the special place within our hearts

[Verse 1]
You laughed at me, you made me cry
You made a joke, then wonder why
I was a loser, I was a loser
I say hello, you say good-bye
I reach to you, you don't even try
I was a loser, I was a loser

[Refrain]
If losin' you makes me happy
Then why does it makes me cry
Losin' you makes you a winner
Then how did our love ever die?

[Verse 2]
I'm born to lose, you know it's true
And here I stand (Ooh-ooh), I'm losin' you
I was a loser, I was a loser
You are the one to let me know
You needed mе, now I have to go
I was a loser (Alright), I was a loser

[Refrain]
If losin' you makеs you happy
Then why does it makes me cry?
If losin' you makes you a winner
Then how did our love ever die? Ever die?

[Verse 3]
I am a fool, you know it's true
I believed in you (Ooh-ooh), now you don't even try
I was a loser (Alri-), I was a loser (Wh-what?)
What foolish kind of guy am I?
You break my heart, I wonder why
I was a loser (Alright), I was a loser (Ooh-ooh, alright)

[Chorus]
I was a loser (Baby), I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, alright)
I was a loser (Baby), I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, alright)
I was a loser, I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, alright! Alright!)
I was a loser (One more time, alright)
I was a loser (Ooh-ohh, let me win one time, alright)
I was a loser (I gotta win, gotta win, I can't lose)
I was a loser (Ooh-ooh, on my beggin' knees, on my beggin' knees)
I was a loser (Oh-ohh, alright), I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, hee, hee)
I was a loser (I am a loser, baby)
I was a loser (Ooh-ooh, I am a loser, baby)
I was a loser (I am a loser, uh)
I was a loser (Ooh-ooh, I am a loser, baby)
I was a loser (I am a loser, baby)
I was a loser (Ooh-ooh,I am a loser)
I was a loser (Let me win one time, let me win one time)
I was a loser (Ooh-ooh, Alright, hee)
I was a loser
I was a loser (Ooh-ooh, goodbye to you, goodbye to thee)
I was a loser (Goodbye to you, hello world)
I was a loser (Ooh-ooh, meet me tomorrow, meet me today)
I was a loser (Who knows who will win?)

You made a joke, then wonder why I was a loser, I was was a loser
I was a loser I say hello

[Verse 1]
Round of applause because that body needs a hand
(Clap it up for that body, clap it up for that body)
Shots at the bar no chasers baby I’m a man
(Take a shot of Bacardi, take a shot of Bacardi)

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't drive home 'cause I’m way too drunk, so bailaré
If it is on, got drink in my cup, so bailaré
So up, and I don’t give fuck, so bailaré
Tore-tore up and I don’t give a fuck
Tore-tore tore up and I don’t give a fuck

I pull up in a matte black truck, like a
Rock star feeling like a million bucks
Shades on, drink in my hand
The only thing I need is Rum and Raybans
Rum and Raybans
Rum and Raybans

[Verse 2]

Can't drive home 'cause I’m way too drunk, so bailaré

[?]
Turn it on to nine
I must say I have a temperature
A hundred degrees
There was Frank James and Jesse James
Billy the Kid and all the rest
Supposed to have been some bad cats
Way out in the West

Those cats would have of dug me
And my gangster ways
They would have hung up their guns child
And dug into their graves

Coz I'm a gangster of love don't you know
That I'm a gangster  of love
Well now when I walk in a bar
Girls from near and far
Say there's the gangster of love

Well I jumped my mother's Cadillac
I rode across the border line
I roped 55 girls
And kissed them all at the same time
Took 25 or 30 put 'em all on a freight
And there was a million dollar reward for me
In each and every state
Sheriff said "Is your name Johnny "Guitar" Watson?"
In a very deep voice
And I said "Yes, sir brother sheriff
And that's your wife on the back of my horse"

'Cause I'm a gangster of love, don't you know
That I'm a gangster of love
Well now when I walk in the bar
Girls from near and far
Say there's the gangster of love

Well I'm a gangster of love
Dont' you know
That I'm a gangster of love
I declare

Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

And if you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin' winds

And will you see that her hair is hangin' long
That it rolls and flows on down her breast
Yes will you see her hair's hangin' long
That's the way I remember her best

I wonder if she remembers me at all
Well many's a time I hope and pray
Mmmm in the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day

So if you're travelin' the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favourite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart

Don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine stay
Each day is Valentine's Day

Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart
Don't you change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine stay
Each day is Valentine's Day
Drifting...
Dreaming...
In an azure mood

Stardust...
Gleaming...
Through my solitude

Here in my seclusion
You're a blue illusion

While I'm...
In this...
Azure interlude

But though I'm tormented
I must be contented

Drifting...
Dreaming...
In an azure mood
Mmm Hmm
Mmm Mmm
Mmm hmm mmm mmm mmm

Drifting...
Dreaming...
In an azure mood
Where has the time all gone to
Haven't done half the things we want to
Oh well
We'll catch up some other time

This day was just a token
Too many words are still unspoken
Oh well
We'll catch up some other time

Just when the fun is starting
Comes the time for parting
But lets be glad for what we've had
And what's to come

There's so much more embracing
Still to be done but time is racing
Oh well
We'll catch up some other time

Outside the rain beings
And it may never end
So cry no more
On the shore a dream
Will take us out to sea
Forever more, forever more
Close your eyes Ami
And you can be with me
Beneath the waves
Through the caves of hours
Long forgotten now
We're all alone, we're all alone

Close the window calm the light
And it will be alright
No need to bother now
Let it out let it all begin
Learn how to pretend

There's so much more embracing
Still to be done but time is racing
Oh well
We'll catch up some other time
Well, the blues went to town on the back of a mule
He looked around and went to school
Well, it didn't take long and he turned back around
Said Lord, please save me from an educated clown
Educated fool, educated fool
Educated fool, educated fool

So the blues left the country in a Cadillac
Said I'm leavin' this town and I won't be back
All this readin' and writin' and arithmetic
And all this learnin' 'bout to make me sick
Educated fool, educated fool
Educated fool, educated fool

Wеll, the blues went up thе river on the back of a fish
Said if I could I'd have one wish
Don't want no silver, diamonds and jewels
Said Lord, please me from an educated fool
Educated fool, educated fool
Educated fool, educated fool
Well, the blues jumped a rabbit and run him a mile
The rabbit sat down and he cried like a child
The blues said son you got to learn one rule
Don't place no trust in a educated fool
Educated fool, educated fool
Educated fool, educated fool

[Intro Ne-Yo with Mary J. Blige]
Is it crazy that I wanna get caught?
No. But I don't think you're ready

{Verse 1: Ne-Yo}
Lost and terrified
Can't find my way back to what I knew
Living the single life
It was catch me if you think you can
Until you hit from my blind side
So caught by surprise
Never thought I would feel this way
And now i find I'm running for my life
But she's making me want to change
I never mean it but damn I fell in love with you

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
So I'm runnin' from you
Got me changing what I do
Oo ooo
So I'm runnin' from you
I'm runnin' from you
Said I'm runnin' from you

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I see in your eyes
That your heart is fighting with your head
And though I want to try I'm not sure if the player in you is truly dead
I see the do right in you but you might
Make some stupid mistakes
On your way to love
And though I want to
Take a chance on you
Not surе if you're ready for us
I nevеr mean it but damn I fell in love with you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
So I'm runnin' from you
Got me changin' what I do
So I'm runnin from you
Chase me I want you to

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige with Ne-Yo]
Am I so scared of this
Cause of how bad I want it
Am I going crazy
Out of my mind
Am I so terrified
Cause I want you in my life
Am I going crazy, crazy hey
I never mean it but damn I fell in love with you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige with Ne-Yo]
So I'm running to you
Got me changing what I do
So I'm running to you

So I'm running to you
Got me changing what I do
So I'm running to you

I'm running to you

[Verse 1]
Back at the London dairy
We drank it all too soon
We drank to dysentery
Numb to the pain, everybody rain

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Got high on pink flamingos
Santo will take a charge
A list of long Domingos
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Come kiss that circuit breaker
An image to enlarge
Let's celebrate the quaker
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Chorus]
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
It's just a nerve flip to switch when it's time for the grind
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
It's just a nerve flip to switch when it's time for the grind
Nerve flip

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
The pain of growing younger
Big balding of a tirе
The blitz and all its hunger
Electrical firе, standing on a wire
Song 5 for Curtis Mayfield
This dancing's so alive
The onion never stays peeled
Everybody move, everybody glide

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Stab me with colored pencils
Backseat and butterflies
A song for flesh utensils
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I've been adjudicated
The court of social flaws
Some other dude she dated
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Chorus]
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
It's just a nerve flip to switch when it's time for the grind
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
It's just a nerve flip to switch when it's time for the grind

[Outro]
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
Nerve flip

[Verse 1]
We are runaways, so we misbehave
And your mama warned you to stay away
I don't wanna leave your humanity
But we were fallin' in water and then we found the sea
There's just two of us, and it's true of me
And the lost by the society
Had to sacrifice, had to roll the dice
Had to make our way through hell to get to paradise

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm not afraid of standing out
Not with us or against us, no, no, no

[Chorus]
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
Every night we come alive (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wickеd and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the firе, we're fueled by desire tonight
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We are the children of the sky (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight

(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh boy, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Then, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
From nowhere through the caravan
Around the campfire light
A lovely woman in motion
From nowhere through the caravan

Around the campfire light
A lovely woman in motion
With hair as dark as night
Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark
That hypnotized me with love

She was a gypsy woman
Was a gypsy woman

She danced around and round
To a guitar melody
Through the fire her face was all aglow
How she enchanted me
Oh, how I'd like to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear
I love you gypsy woman
Love you gypsy woman

All through the caravan
She was dancing with all the men
Waiting for the rising sun
Everyone was having fun

Hate to see the lady go
Knowing that she’ll never know
That I love her
I love her

Gypsy woman
Gypsy woman
She was a gypsy woman
Was a gypsy woman

I love you gypsy woman
Gypsy woman

All through the caravan
She was dancing with all the men
Waiting for the rising sun
Everyone was having fun
Hate to see the lady go
'Cause I love her
I love her
Gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman
I love the gypsy woman
Gypsy woman

I love you gypsy woman
Love you gypsy woman
Talk to me, talk to me
Hold me close, whisper love
Talk to me, baby can't you see
Darlin I, I love you so

Let me hear, stay with me dear
Tell me who loves me so
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk me sweet and gentle ways

Many ways to speak of love
I’ve heard before
And it sounds so good every time
Please say the part
I love just once more
Darling I'm so glad you're mine

Talk to me, talk to me
Hold me closе, whisper love
Talk to me, darling can’t you see
Darling I, I lovе you so
Many ways to speak of love
I've heard before
And it sounds so good every time
Please say the words
I love just once more
Darling I'm so glad you're mine

Talk to me, talk to me
Hold me close, whisper love
Talk to me, baby can't you see
Darling I, I love you so

Talk to me, talk talk to me
Hold me close, whisper love
Talk to me, mmm
Tell me, stay with me
Tell me who loves you so

[Verse 1]
I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

[Chorus]
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't mess this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

[Post-Chorus]
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you'vе had
I guess you're diggin' the show
Opеn the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

[Chorus]
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't mess this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

[Post-Chorus]
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

[Breakdown]
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah, hey!
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me

Mwah!

[Chorus]
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine

[Intro: Dolly Parton]
You got a voice Miley, use it

Signal's always slowin'
When you walk out the door
You got big dreams of 5G
Faster than before
We all just need connection

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus, Choir]
Let's do it for the phones
They do so much for you
When they're out there all alone
There's something we can do
So don't settle for less
They deserve the best
More coverage coast-to-coast
T-Mobile

Let's do it for the phones
They do so much for you
When they're out there all alone

[Verse 1]
You, you turn gold to dust now
What was trust is lost now
What is all this darkness you have inside?
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

[Chorus]
Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

[Verse 2]
Boom, barrel, love, a gun, pow
I'll be on the run now
Can't take no more bullets through my wounds
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Causе this hurt I can no longer hide

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, it's the last timе
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

[Chorus]
Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles

[Bridge]
So watch it blow when I let it go
When I cut this rope and run, run
By the time you wake, it'll be too late
Now the bullet's left the gun, yeah

[Chorus]
Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?

Ridin’ by myself, late night, left arm on the steering wheel, red light
Lookin’ through the rear view
Hoping I don't see the thirsty thief nor the cop
You in the next lane hatin’ cause you couldn't afford the drop
Switch gears, feet clutch, keep up, eat dust, try me, he busts
I don't give a sister, brother, father, mother-fuck, fuck -
There goes the lawyers more bucks, but

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna be cool, but I'm a be me and I'm a be real, y’all
See I'm from the south and down here, dawg
We don't fear y’all, we don't fear y’all
But
I'm just tryna be cool, but I'm a be me and I'm a be real, y’all
See I'm from the south and down here, dawg
We don't fear y’all, we don't fear y’all

[Verse 2:]
So when you see me in the streets don't speak, ‘cause I ain't even tryna holla if it's not about a dollar
See me straightening my collar, lookin' good for the women
Putting good in them Phillies, blowin’ good on you bitches
I go - wherever the money take me
I'm there, baby, I'm faithfully on my job
No lady cause she don't understand the way I gotta shine
Thinking a nigga crazy, but the streets, they thinking I'm getting paid like Baby
Who am I, to tell ‘em anything different, I'm a make it
I get it just how I say it, gotta pay it how I weigh it
I'm only 145, soaking wet, butt naked and the scale don't lie
The food must be going to my mind, food for thought, I hope you eat 3 times
I'm a be here for a while, if you don't like daddy cooking then you better eat out
Young Money we out
If you here leave out
If you coming, re-route, but

[Chorus:]
I'm just tryna be cool, but I'm a be me and I'm a be real, y’all
See I'm from the south and down here, dawg
We don't fear y’all, we don't fear y’all
But
I'm just tryna be cool, but I'm a be me and I'm a be real, y’all
See I'm from the south and down here, dawg
We don't fear y’all, we don't fear y’all

[Verse 3:]
Pops is no sucker, moms a bit tougher
September 27th is when heaven dropped a bundle
I rose to my feet and stumbled
If I ain't come to get money, then I can go back to where I come from
And leave without a gun is a joke, if I ever heard one
And scary niggas don't deserve one, I heard once
A fool and his money soon part ways, so, I'm a stay smart and stay paid like that, but

[Chorus:]
I'm just tryna be cool, but I'm a be me and I'm a be real, y’all
See I'm from the south and down here, dawg
We don't fear y’all, we don't fear y’all
But
I'm just tryna be cool, but I'm a be me and I'm a be real, y’all
See I'm from the south and down here, dawg
We don't fear y’all, we don't fear y’all
But
I'm just tryna be cool, but I'm a be me and I'm a be real, y’all
See I'm from the south and down here, dawg
We don't fear y’all, we don't fear y’all
But I'm just tryna be cool, but I'm a be me and I'm a be real, y’all
See I'm from the south and down here, dawg
We don't fear y’all, we don't fear y’all

[Verse 1]

Yeah, I'm so bad

Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me

Just in, live from Harlem world
Looks like the winds are picking up at about 80 miles per hour
Looks like we went from scattered storms to what we’ve classified now as a, a flood
We are now, um, this is a state of emergency
This is a flood warning
Apparently Jae Millz and his Young Money crew have initiated a flood warning
Over Harlem world, Miami, London, Paris
Jae Millz? Jae Millz, can you hear me?
Jae Millz, come in, can you hear me?

[Verse 1]
He the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a do-rag, keep the wave on swim
W-w-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
"S" on my chest 'cause I'm ready to save him
‘Cause I’m the one like i’m Tracy McGrady
And I think I love him like Eminems callin’ Shady
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby

[Chorus]
Shorty, I'ma only tell you this once, you the illest
(Ba, ba-da, da, doh)
And for your loving, I'ma die hard like Bruce Willis

[Verse 2]
He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band
Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lamb'
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway, I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha, he was a Samurai
Somehow, I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
"S" on my chest, let me get my cape on
With a certificate that I change my name on
N-n-n-n-name on, with a certificate that I change my name on

[Chorus]
Shorty, I'ma only tell you this once, you the illest
(Ba, ba-da, da, doh)
And for your loving, I'ma die hard like Bruce Willis

Girl, you know I run a love game, never play Uno
You wanna leave, follow me to the two-door
Rock your culo, love it when you call me your papi chulo
I got a thing for you, you got a thing for me
Heard she kiss the Milky Way and bring to life your fantasies
You're sweeter than Mama's homemade Kool-Aid
Touch it, then make the seas split two ways
You love it, I do too, girl, don't play
I'm just waitin' to hear you say

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Let's hit the sweet spot, oh, I, I, I, I
I'm ready to go, I want candy toni-i-i-ight

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Yeah, I wanna hit the spot that gets you hot
And makes you feel like everybody need to have it this sweet
Baby, just a hit, just speak, I got your candy, shawty
Come around, give it to you that deep
Ooh, don't you get me started, hit the afterparty all night
You done ran into a freak that'll take you home
Make you moan, watch the throne
Yeah, lil mama, I'm the king of these sheets, gotta love it
Girl, you want it, you can have it, no question
Been a whole lot of rubbin' and touchin'
What you know about the candy I'm hustlin', musclin'?
Talkin' that Russian
Bring it back like, baby, who you rushin'?
I been ready, never talkin' sweet nothings
I'll be the first to give your body sweet justice
So pack a luggage and let's, let's

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Let's hit the sweet spot, oh, I, I, I, I
I'm ready to go, I want candy toni-i-i-ight
I got a taste and I'm hooked on you for life
My, oh my, hit the sweet spot tonight

I never killed anybody (body)
But I got somethin' to do with that body (somethin’, just shh)
I got the streets on my back (on my back)
Carry it like I'm movin' a body (huh)
I told them to shoot a hundred rounds (do-do)
Like he tryna movie the body (movie)
It was like 11 in the mornin’
Skippin' school, that's a truancy body
I made me some racks in the mornin'
I had me a pack by the mornin'
I had me some racks by the mornin'
I had a six-pack by the mornin'
I got on a mink, no pneumonia
The racks keep me up, don't need Folgers
I had a pack in my shoulder
You gotta picture me rollin’

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
You gotta picture me rollin’, packin' a semi, no colon
Ready for war like Korеa, headlining shows out in Poland
You should be cleanin’ my mansion, my placе is disgustin'
Why don't you act like a Hoffman, and go get to dustin'?
Yeah, latex on my drawers, bitch, go clean my crown
Can’t hear my haters from way up here, they don't make a sound
Body goals on these hoes, white paint on my toes
When I send that new bae alert, niggas gon' be mad
Jumpin' in the Bent', then I switched to the Ghost like, "Who's you?"
Remember this face 'cause I'm that bitch you gon' lose to
Drippin' in the ice, fuck you lookin' at? Screw you
It's squad goals when all your bitches pretty like New New

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I never killed anybody (body)
But I got somethin' to do with that body (somethin', just shh)
I got the streets on my back (on my back)
Carry it like I'm movin' a body (huh)
I told them to shoot a hundred rounds (do-do)

It was like 11 in the mornin'
Skippin' school, that's a truancy body

Lyrics from snippet:

[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
It’s The Carter 5, TCV
We birthing these rappers, get the EPT
And when you see us it’s hats off
It’s me and Weezy, like a bad cough

[Intro: Snoop Dogg + Dr. Dre + Ja Rule]
Yeah, what up, Detroit?
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh, no, he didn't
They didn't do it again (What-what, you what?)
You shitted on these niggas two times, Dr. Dre?
Oh, fo' sho'
Uh-uh, naw, you smell that?
This is special right here (What-what, what-what-what?)
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie, baby, uh
(Murder INC shit...)
To the boogie-oogie-oogie
Yeah, ya know, what's crackin', Dre?

[Verse 1: DMX (from "Ruffest Ryders")]
It's my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how a lover slaughter
Flood your daughter, full of more holes than spurges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough keys from the Cuban, to build a fuckin fort
Caught up in somethin that I can't control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, let's role
Catch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it
Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Wasted, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass under the earth quick
I love money, but the scrambles hot
So I snatch up my man and the gamblin spot
Twenty grand is got, when niggas shot
One nigga less what used to be his chest is now a mess under his fuckin vest

[Chorus: Nate Dogg + Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the façade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a 12 gauge about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough, I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, come on

[Chorus: Nate Dogg + Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Verse 3: Ja Rule (from "Get Da Money")]
E-dub, get a nigga involved, let me spit a few bars of murderous material
Niggas venirial are diseases to me
And it's startin' to burn when I piss on emcees
Niggas want it with me, who I be?
The one that got you ready to run
The one with rhyme or reason to bust my gun, what's the outcome?
Another nigga gettin' smoked?
Another nigga found slain with a tongue out his throat? Son it's no joke
I pump lead like bad dope
And leave niggas nodding out, with no hope
I'ma spit various flows, and fuck various hoes
Rule, E-Dub, and Short Dog it shows
That the niggas with the money get the bitches bitches
Rolled up on dubs, deep dishes dishes
Niggas don't want it with me
J to A to R-U-L-E

[Verse 4: 2Pac (from "Homeboyz")]
Now, everytime I see you cats is rollin' in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep
But when you on that solo creep
Out on the streets you don't hear a peep
Nigga, it's a goddamn shame, somebody explain
Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game?
Tear that ass out the frame, how long will it last?
Nigga, don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash, tryin' to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggas aimin' at my head, but I still wear my vest

[Chorus: Nate Dogg + Snoop Dogg (x2)]
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Aw, naw, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls (What?), dick six-inch long (Mm)
Back up in the heezy, baby (Baby!)
He's Shady (He's so crazy!), hahaha
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right to say what I like
And walk around flippin' the bird?
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That, somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the "fag" word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now? Look here...
I start some trouble everywhere that I go (That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know ('Cause they know)
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door (The back door)
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44 (A .44)

[Chorus: Nate Dogg + Snoop Dogg (x2)]
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Ending: Xzibit + (Ja Rule)]
2001 and forever
Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, X to the Z, Nate Dogg
C'mon, yeah!!
(Murder INC shit...)
Give me a title on this, Brian
Uh, You're with me tonight, take one
One, two, one two three

...Beautiful
Here you go, this is you're with me, take four
(Wordless Vocals)
You're with me tonight, I know you're with me tonight
You're with me tonight, I know you're with me tonight
For sure you're with me tonight, I know you're with me tonight
(Wordless Vocals)
You're with me tonight, I know you're with me tonight
You're with me tonight, I know you're with me tonight
For sure you're with me tonight, I know you're with mе tonight
It's like...
When our mother sends a child off to war, they dont know they're ever going to come back, you know. How can we look at such things happening and not you know, want to do something? I can return my head and pretend if we dont see it, you know? I cant sense people with pain, and pretend that this is not there.
Uh, getcho ass back in this house girl
We ain’t gotta let all of the neighbors up in our world, cool it
It’s cool ‘cause you sexy when you mad though
And if we weather the storm, I bet that rain make the grass grow
And I heard the grass is greener on the other side
We gotta give love a chance to change into a butterfly
Talking to myself like, “Wayne you can’t fuck up another time”
Give it CPR, watch the relationship come alive
B-B-Before you go, baby
We, are romantic, shit, get back here, yeah
C-C-Can you just chill, f-for a while, and stand down
And just try to hear me out, yeah
And I-I know that we, should be, d-deep in -
L-love so why hate? yeah
And I-I know you’re tied, for me, i-i-if you reach
It’s just h-how I be
Look, chicks leavin’ broken hearted
Now the love is dead, you can smell the rigor mortis

[Verse 1]
I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Funny but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love

[Verse 2]
Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh, is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love

[Bridge]
Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid

[Verse 3]
If there's a cloud above
And it must rain, we'll let it
But for tonight, forgеt it
I'm in the mood for love
Well I’m walking just past midnight
I’m alone all alone
Ah just me and the moon
And I’ve got quite an appetite
Should I stay alone
Or should I call you up call you up
Maybe I’ll have a little drink and a little smoke
Mull it over think it out
‘fore I just call you up after midnight
On such an empty night
Could I enjoy it for myself
Or do I need some company
Is it that easy to call someone up
And tell them to wrap their arms around me
It’s easy when the world’s asleep
And it’s so easy when it’s all at my feet
So I decide not to go home
Not to go anywhere in particular
I’ll just follow my feet
Meet myself on an unfamiliar street
Until I finally find nothing
Maybe nothing’s what I need
Ah just me and the moon
Ah just me and the moon

[Verse]
Let's go be alone
Where no one can see us, honey
The scum in every room
Forget about the cameras when they stop to stare at you
Both grew up so soon
Now summer's never ending
There and then, I knew
Never been in love, but I think I was made for you
And trouble don't stay
No, my mother taught me better
Make a fool out of me
Better do it quickly, while you still can
While you still can
But trouble looks so good
I'm only scared that this is heaven
She spends the night
And I still think of God under bowery bathroom lights
Then when life slows down
We'll raise some kids to have our style
No backing out now
Once you pinky promise, you're bound
Mia, are you down?
Sing it in my mouth
Not even scared of getting old now
Long as it's us two
Fuck being remembered, honey
I adore you
I adore you
I adore you
Shake it off baby
You’ve got it all figured out you’re doing just fine
You never done nothing
But try to feel alright
Pick your fights and try to be kind
Say how you feel even when it gets real oh
We’re getting harder on the outside and softer on the inside
Do it yourself that’s the only time it’s done right
I’ve tried a million times but I never really got it just right
But that’s the beauty of the game
It’s a game and you don’t need to win
It’s child’s play honey
The way you shake it all up
It’s child’s play honey
Thе way you make me feel like I was just born
Shakе it off baby
You’ve got it all figured out you’re doing just fine
You never done nothing
But try to feel alright
We’re getting harder on the outside and softer on the inside

[Verse 1]
Do you think of me when you lay with her?
Do you wonder who we’d be or even who we were?
Does she know where you sleep when you’re holding me?
In the heart of the city is it really what it seems to be?

[Pre-Chorus]
You’re not just another love
I get sick and tired of
Spinning in your circles always brings me back to you
Make me feel like growing up
I can’t ever get enough
Of spinning in your circles

[Chorus]
You’re not another love (Another, oh, anothеr)
Not another love (Another, oh, anothеr)
Not another love (Another, oh, another)
Not another love (Another, oh, another)

[Verse 2]
Do you think of me when you lay with her?
Do you wonder who we’d be or even who we were?
Does she know where you sleep when you’re holding me?
In the heart of the city is it really what it seems to be?

[Pre-Chorus]
You’re not just another love
I get sick and tired of
Spinning in your circles always brings me back to you
Make me feel like growing up
I can’t ever get enough
Of spinning in your circles

[Chorus]
You’re not another love (Another, oh, another)
You’re not another love (Another, oh, another)
You’re not another love (Another, oh, another)
You’re not another love (Another, oh, another)
You’re not another love (Another, oh, another)
Not another love (Another, oh, another)
Not another love (Another, oh, another)
Not another love (Another, oh, another)

[Chorus]
You’re not another love (Another, oh, another)
You’re not another love (Another, oh, another)
You’re not another love (Another, oh, another)
You’re not another love (Another, oh, another)
You’re not another love (Another, oh, another)
Not another love (Another, oh, another)
Not another love (Another, oh, another)
Not another love (Another, oh, another)
You’re not another love (Another, oh, another)
You’re not another love (Another, oh, another)
You’re not another love (Another, oh, another)
You’re not another love (Another, oh, another)
You’re not another love (Another, oh, another)
Not another love (Another, oh, another)
Not another love (Another, oh, another)
Not another love (Another, oh, another)

[Verse 1]
Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin' and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now, I'm takin' my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, "Yes, I suppose"

[Pre-Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

[Chorus]
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know, we know)
Said, "Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end"
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 2]
I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask? Or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties broken before me
Niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me
Yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I'll pop a pill and remember
The look in his eyes the last day he saw me

[Pre-Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

[Chorus]
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know, we know)
Said, "Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end"
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 3]
Lemme make this clear: I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college just to say, "We did it"
My child with Aaron woulda been sixteen any minute
So in some ways, I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel lookin' over him
And I know Jelani will always love me and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writin', this is The Pinkprint
(Pinktprint, Pinkprink, Pinkprint…)

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart

[Chorus]
Even though I said I didn’t love you (Love you, love you)
I lied, I lied
Even though I said I didn’t need you
I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said, "Don’t touch me" (Touch me, touch me)
I lied, I lied

[Verse 1]
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
Can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me, you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said, "Let’s see"
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fuckin' proof
'Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose?
You just a heartbreaker, won’t let you break mine
'Cause I’ll be smashin' windows and cuttin' them brake lines

[Chorus]
I lied
'Cause who knew that if I just let myself go with you
Who knows? Who knows? So, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said, "Fuck you" (Fuck you, fuck you)
I lied, I lied

[Verse 2]
I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D, yo
Man, it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real, it was magic
If it was a record, it woulda been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic (Orgasmic)

[Bridge]
I guess this what I gotta do to keep me from fallin', stallin' the truth
Who knew what you’d do if I let you in?
My mama ain't raised no fool, I
I'm not your usual, typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Fallin' so fast, I'm afraid of you
So I lied

[Chorus]
I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh, whoa

[Outro]
I lied, ooh, baby
Ooh
'Cause who knew that if I let myself go with you (Ooh)
It’s over now, goodbye, love (Ah, oh)
You’ll stay, you’ll stay in my heart (You'll stay in my heart) forever

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade in your face and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just plannin' a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three, three words that you're missing?

[Chorus: Jessie Ware]
Where'd you go? Couldn't see, I was too busy
Could've just said no, where would you go? I think I know
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We're back to playing the crying game

[Post-Chorus: Jessie Ware]
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing the crying game

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Welcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no E-Z Pass, you gotta use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it? All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and be loved (To love and be loved)

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm comin' undone
'Cause the tears don't end

[Chorus: Jessie Ware]
Where'd you go? Couldn't see, I was too busy
Could've just said no, where would you go? I think I know
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We're back to playing the crying game

[Post-Chorus: Jessie Ware]
I could've given everything (Everything)
Don't wanna let the tears begin (Everything)
We're back to playing the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing the crying game

[Outro: Jessie Ware]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em
And let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate
I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup
For a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried 'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons
Jo-Jon & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight
I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5
Is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitchеs where the top is
Ri-ring fingеr where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens
Unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in
Like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me
Lance Stephenson

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, "Goddamn, this is the perfect time"
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt, but I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you, oh
That's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it
Pinkprint

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Drake]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky (Ayy)
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the "b" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean "pop-pop-pop," then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Lil Wayne]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Young Mula, baby!
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Intro: Jeremih]
I don't want no drama
I just wanna be your diamond, babe
Guaranteed to be a problem
Every time I get around you, babe
I just want you to need me
You might really wanna try me, babe
All I know I want a rider
All I know I want a rider babe
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe, ah yeah

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I just wanna be ya rider, you should pull up in that Spyder
You should let me hit the mic, and I ain't talking about the fighter
Get it lit without a lighter, let's pull an all-nighter
Tell me-tell me what you need, got the weed, I'm a bad lil' bitch and I never indict her
Gеt locked, I'ma write ya, you on the road? I'ma Skypе ya
I-I-I-I-I don't wanna hype ya, but you a lucky nigga if my mean ass like ya
You ain't never have a bitch understand you, most of them wanna use you when they ran through
I just wanna be somebody that can add to, your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too
I just wanna listen, when you leave I say, "Damn, I fucking miss him"
I just wanna be your vixen, give you something real wet to put your lips in
I wanna be the only one that can check you, and still respect you
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
Won't you let me be your favorite?

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, I just wanna be your first go-to, do you like a real one supposed to, livin' bi-coastal
Scoop me in the truck, late-night on a humble
Meet me out in Queens, where the city want a sundown
You could put your gun down, you could have fun now
You could tell your niggas that you won now, one down
Run through the clubs with the baddest, bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters (Matters)
And they say, Birkin where the bag is, got a lot of bags, but we never got baggage
Winter Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance
I'ma have you coming in my palace
London, Tokyo, Paris, let me update your status
'Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
Won't you let me be your favorite?

[Outro: Nicki Minaj, Jeremih]
You should already know
You should already know
You should already know
You should already know
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe, ah yeah
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
You should already know, you should already know
I just wanna be your favorite
You should already know, you should already know
Won't you let me be your favorite? (Oh, baby)
You know that you need a rider, rider, rider, rider, rider, rider
Oh, oh, oh
You know that you need a rider, rider, rider, ri-i-ider
Won't you let me be your favorite?
You know that you need a rider, rider, rider, rider, rider, rider
Oh, oh, oh

[Intro (Throughout): Alicia Keys]
You should say it right now

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Cause I don't use the shit anyway
But okay, I guess it's my fault
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say "love"
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy
The heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Nicki Minaj]
Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Rihmeek, I'ma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?
But you waited

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Nicki Minaj]
Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?

[Intro: Skylar Grey]
Oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said, "This nigga buggin'"
'Cause I was doin' it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplatin' overdosin'
No more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears rolled down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hopin' that you would show it some
What the fuck you really tellin' me? What you tellin' me?
I could tell you lyin', get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
So does she know I've been in that bed before? (Bed before)
A thousand count and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl (Another girl)
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy
Just thinkin' of yourself (Thinkin' of yourself)

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine

[Intro: Meek Mill]
You hear that right there?
That sound like, but that 300 thousand nigga
I'm triple OG in my hood
These hoes call me big daddy

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Your bitch call me big daddy
Tell that bitch that I'm big daddy
When I hit the lot I don't get the little bitch
Nigga I go and get the big daddy
Pick a bitch up in the big daddy
Big face Rollie that's a big daddy
Got your bitch calling me big daddy
When I pull up all the hoes like big daddy
Nigga I'm big daddy

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Standin' on the corner in some shit that look like I payed like a million for
Blowin' the money I heard that they askin' around town what he really worth
Most of these niggas be really broke
I went the Hardaway boy had a penny first
Now these bitches gon' get this work
I tell her keep on them heels and that mini skirt
She Google my net worth, lookin' like "what is his neck worth?"
My shooters, they shoot at your head, like the rim just to see if the net work
I land in Miami then fly out to Cali with some of my best work
You niggas so lame that my bitches won't fuck unless you cut a check first

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Your bitch call me big daddy
Tell that bitch that I'm big daddy
When I hit the lot I don't get the little bitch
Nigga I go and get the big daddy
Pick a bitch up in the big daddy
Big face Rollie that's a big daddy
Got your bitch calling me big daddy
When I pull up all the hoes like big daddy
Nigga I'm big daddy

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Pulled up in something that look like a million nigga put me up on
Ain't gotta sell it, but he say the pussy a drug that he re-up on
Spur of the moment, I ball like Ginóbili, you bitches get D'ed up on
You mad at me? Go get mad at your nigga 'fore I put my sneakers on
He copped me this wrist game, now it's just us at the Knicks game
I might have to take him on tour just to fuck in Australia, Brisbane
Your time is ticking, you bitches will be around shorter than Vine vids
You watch your mouth or my niggas will shoot up the club like what Shyne did

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Your bitch call me big daddy
Tell that bitch that I'm big daddy
When I hit the lot I don't get the little bitch
Nigga I go and get the big daddy
Pick a bitch up in the big daddy
Big face Rollie that's a big daddy
Got your bitch calling me big daddy
When I pull up all the hoes like big daddy
Nigga I'm big daddy

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Bitches ain't stupid, you bitches ain't stupid
You bitches ain't stupid, is you?
Front like she tough but that bitch keep on crying
Get this bitch a tissue
For what it's worth when I took him I could tell he would never miss you
I ain't even wanna diss you, but tell me what is this bitch issue?

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Still on top, pretty bitch gang
Pussy still tight, pistol still bang
Yo nigga call me big mama
Let him eat the pussy then I dip on him, kyuh

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Your bitch call me big daddy
Tell that bitch that I'm big daddy
When I hit the lot I don't get the little bitch
Nigga I go and get the big daddy
Pick a bitch up in the big daddy
Big face Rollie that's a big daddy
Got your bitch calling me big daddy
When I pull up all the hoes like big daddy
Nigga I'm big daddy

DJ motherfucking Rell
You are now rockin’ with Metro Beats, man
Trapaholics, biatch

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Came out of the two-door turbo coupe
Shih tzu under my arm, I keep my pooch all cute
And my rim-rim-rims just be a-spinnin’ and spinnin’
In the limited edition with Dominican women
And I’m colder than a cough, bitch pat your back
Got that kushy in the car with the hat to match
I be all around town yelling, “I am she
The b-baddest yellow bitch in the NYC!”
Listen, I don’t wanna fight, I’m too pretty and little
Boo, I only fuck with rings with a rock in the middle
Got killers on Rockaway and 1-4-6
That act like the sanitation and dump all clips
Get a mani and pedi while I’m watching Hancock
I keep a bad bitch from Queens to Bangkok (Haha)
So fuck a hater, fuck a hater, leave it there
Long hair, don’t even care

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
You know they say who, who is Nicki Minaj?
And, you know I'm like a multiple personality bitch

Admit it, -mit it, -mit it, -mit it
Is there nothing for me here
Did I read it wrong
Could you not make your mind up dear
Did I just lead it on

You stared at me
All silly and sweet
Then I turned away
Turned back
You had blown the candles out
And I was left in the dark
I tried to think light
But what I wanted was sweet surrender
Sweetest surrender

You could have it right now
And wouldn’t have to choose
Take it up in your arms
What do you have to lose

And when you find me
On my knees
I am eager to please
Everything that you are
Anything that you need
Your body makes me feel
Shiny and gold like hidden treasure
Oh what a pleasure
You think that I’m kinda silly
I know I know I know I know
You think that I’m lookin pretty
I see the way you look at me

I’ve thought of so many ways to try to take you home
Take you home take you home
I’ve thought of a million ways to tell you
I think you’re cool and I think I want you

Did I wake up in the wrong world
Or am I in some kind of paradise
I'm all that I’ve got
Can't be all you've got too
There’s not enough room in here for all of you
I'll give you more whenever I'm ready
I didn't ask to give up my privacy
I'm just one girl
Don't wanna rule the world
I just wanna make make my own
Won't you let me
Let me

I've given my time and love to so many
But I don’t have enough to give what you expect me
I’m going out alone
Alone feels just right
Let me

My shoulders are tired from holding such weight
I'm putting it all down
Taking it off
Lеtting it drip down
I will not be around
I will be somewhеre that I can only reach
Not open to the public
Not open to anyone
Not open not open
Let me
If you were here
We’d have a ball
I’d take your hand and we’d fall
But in the wake of what you left
I will forever remain

If you were here
I’d touch your skin
I’d bury everything
I’d kiss your forehead
And make a wish
And we’d be all embracing

I’d run a bath for us to sit in
Light some candles your face would flicker in
And I’d crumble at the thought of what we could be
And I’d crumble at the beauty of what might be
You've got something I want always
Never quite enough
Never coming down
I’ve got something
I wanna give you for nothing
I'll be forever there
Whether you care
Whether you care

Take me seriously and take me up in your arms
Give me nothing and everything in between

You make me scream
You make me feel it all
You make me wanna shine
And you'll be on your knees honey
And it’ll nеver be the samе

We've got ourselves
But maybe we could have each other too
Treat me like you feel me
I've got so much love
Don't know how to get it all out
You're blocking it from
Finding its way to meet you halfway
I wanna meet you halfway

I'm there standing all still
And then shaking moving levitating
Love enough to fill a thousand hearts
I'll wait until it gets all dark
We've got ourselves
But maybe we could have each other too
Now everybody do the shake
Let’s shake it out let’s take a break
Shake with me until there’s nothing left
Just let it all hang out
It’s not the end it’s the start

Well I’ve got things I wanna scream and shout
And I’ve got things that really freak me out
But even when I’m on the edge of my cliff
Well I can shout your name into the abyss

Well I’ve got things I wanna say out loud
And I don’t always get the words right out
But I don’t wanna wait till we grow old
I wanna kiss you like our lives depеnd on it

Well I saw hearts all up in your eyеs
Don’t worry I won’t tell anyone
Let’s just try to have a good old time
You know we all deserve to feel that some time
Well I’ve got stars coming out of my mouth
I seem to throw them up on everyone
It’s so good to have a little hope
I watched the world go wild and so can I

Now everybody do the shake
Let’s shake it out let’s take a break
Shake with me until there’s nothing left
Just let it all hang out it’s not the end it’s the start
I put my hands on my body
Take myself up in my arms
I take out the stones from my pockets
And balance them like my brother does
And it feels like enough
It feels like enough

And even though I’ll never see the end of the road
I know it’s there and that’s enough
And even though I might see the end of your love
I know it’s there and that’s enough

Am I playing a role
Is this all just a part
Am I saying some lines
That don’t come from the heart
Am I saying yes
When I really mean no
Am I putting it on
Is it all part of the show
Am I selling a dream
That doesn’t even exist
Am I doing enough
To rebel to resist
And even though I’ll never see the end of the road
I know it’s there and that’s enough
And even though I might see the end of your love
I know it’s there and that’s enough

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
St-st-step up in the party like my name was that, that
All these haters mad because I'm so established
They know I'm a beast, yeah, I'm a sav-savage
Haters, you could kill yourself (Ah)
In my space shuttle and I'm not comin' down
I'm a stereo and she's just so monotone
Sometimes, it's just me and all my bottles all alone
I ain't comin' back this time

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am & Nicki Minaj, will.i.am & Nicki Minaj]

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
St-st-step up in the party like my name is Mr. T
All these hating naggers ain't got nat'in' on me
Honestly, I gotta stay as fly as I can be
If you Wiki Willy, you get super OG
Honeys always rush me 'cause I'm fly, fly, fly
Dummies, they can't touch me 'cause I'm floatin' sky high
I stay swagger-ific, you don't needa ask why
You just gotta see with your eyes

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am & Nicki Minaj, will.i.am & Nicki Minaj]

Oh, oh

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Da-dun-dun
The sun done, yep, the sun done
Came up, but we still up in dungeon
Da-dun-dun, yep, in London
Competition? Why, yes, I would love some
How they get mad 'cause their run done?
Mad 'cause I'm gettin' money in abundance?
Man, I can't even count all of these hundreds
Duffel bag every time I go to SunTrust
I leave the rest just to collect interest
I mean interest, (Oh!) my nemesis
Exclamation, just for emphasis
And I don't sympathize 'cause you a simple, simple
I just pop up on these hoes on some pimple, pimple
And put the iron to your face, you old wrinkle, wrinkled shhh

[Interlude: will.i.am]
This is mega-mega, u-u-ultra enigmatic
-Matic, -matic, -matic, -ma-ma-matic

[Verse 4: will.i.am]
Oh, we just had to kill it
We on the radio, hotter than a skillet
We in the club, makin' party people holla
Money in the bank, we be gettin' top dollar
I'm a big baller, you a lil' smaller
Step up to my level, need to grow a lil' taller
I'm a shot caller, get up off my collar
You a Chihuahua, I'm a Rottweiler

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am & Nicki Minaj, will.i.am & Nicki Minaj]
I can't believe it, it's so amazin' (Yeah)
I can't believe it, this beat is bangin' (Yeah)

[Intro: Nicki Minaj & T-Pain]
(And we go by The Runners)
Yo, SB, haha (Go hard)
I think it's my time, you know why? (Go hard)
My tears have dried, and I know that no weapon formed against me will prosper (Go hard)
And I truly believe that my haters are my motivators
Young Money

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the chokehold
Now they screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
(Hard) I am (Hard), I'm still (Hard) the one to beat (Go hard)
Ain't in a rush for mainstream, I am the streets (Go hard)
I am getting it in until the end
I gotta go (Go), go (Go), go (Oh)
Go hard

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Gotta go, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquee, everything sparkly (Man down)
Hit him on the walkie-talkie
Hit 'em, hit em, knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
My name ring bells, bitch, buzz me in (Bzzz)
And I only stop for pedestrians (Oh)
Or a real, real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the MAC, hit 'em with the TEC-nine
Hit 'em with the Ruger, by the intersect sign
Hit 'em with a Tommy, so my niggas call me Pammy
And I always keep the jammy
In the trunk or in the Lamby
Put my whole borough on my back and I'm good
I don't wanna hear what you woulda, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up (Uh)
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar (Oh)
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups (One, two)
Doing the scissor-leg, on the mat, with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma (Uh)
These birds all fly south in the winter (Uh)
Fuck I look like? Chomping on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle? (C'yeah)
I'ma be the queen, no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle (Yeah), Louis on the duffle (Yeah)
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Hahahahahaha, no muzzle)
What you wanna do, do, do? (C'yeah)
Bitches is softer than Al Dente
Cut from a different kente
Tell 'em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my Sensei
So I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have these rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups, and khakis
This is for my nigga, Seven Up, in Castaki
This is for my niggas wheelie-in' them Kawasakis
Shout out to the Vackee's, saltfish ackees
Kisses to my fans unless I'm feelin', kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kind of rocky
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinski
Pump's on the clutch, right hand, on the 6-speed
Write my own raps, I gotta go, I gotta get me (Gotta get me)
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah), ohh

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the chokehold on
Now they screamin', "Nicki, leave me alone!"
(Hard) I am (Hard), I will (Hard), I gots to win (Go hard)
I'm still lookin' around for my competition (Go hard)
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go (Go), go (Go), go (Oh)
Go hard

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
From slap-and-cry you start to die
So I must go harder
Gotta make these bitches know me
Just like Bobby know water
Better yet, like Bubba know shrimp
But he don't say shit when the gun on his lip
And I don't say shit, put the gun on my hip
So I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown, don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm still nasty as a son of a bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
If you ain't got money, don't come on my strip
And if you got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic
But I can still make you tumble and flip
You fuckin' with me if you fuckin' with Nic'
They ain't fuckin' with me, they ain't fuckin' with Nic'
Your girlfriend her decision is split
'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nic
They wonder if he be fuckin' Nic, as long as she be fuckin' rich
That's why I keep my luggage 'cause I swear y'all a fuckin' trip
Young Money dungeon, bitch, my swagger just punchin' bitch
And I shoot like I'm from overseas, so call my gun "Gunović"
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for a bunch of shit
Red drank, blue pill, white dust, yes, I love my country, bitch
Hahaha, yeah, guitar

[Guitar Solo: Lil Wayne]

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ohh

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Wish you could get rid of Young Money
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the chokehold on
Now they screamin', "Nicki leave me alone"
(Hard) I am (Hard), I will (Hard), I gots to win (Go hard)
I'm still lookin' around for my competition (Go hard)
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go (Go), go (Go), go (Oh)
Go hard

Holiday Season, ay
Holiday Season
Trapaholics
Uh huh, yeah, yeah, listen, ok

[Verse]
I'm a dime, you a nickel-ette, light skinned-ed pigment
Write my own shit, y'all copyrighting infringement
I eat these rap bitches, somebody get me a dinner mint
Pussy make him tattoo my name upon his ligament
Fuck wrong with them, my nerves they keep tweakin’
Tell them I'm the chief, I'm runnin' with Mohikans
Tell them this is church, and tell them I am the deacon
Tell thеm that I'm Black, Chinese, and Butter Pеcan
Pull up in the Range, I'm givin' them more reasons
Hit up Lil Wayne, while I'm in the 4 Seasons
Tell Gudda, Mack, and Kidd Kidd I'm here
I'm colder than a cough, I'm wetter than swimwear
Got all these little bitches, g-gettin' p-pink hair
I'm pretty and I'm fly, I'm up in the pink Lear
I needed an assistant, I got me a pink queer
Decorated his office, with flowers and pink chairs (C'yeah)

The person you're calling is on another line
Just leave your message after the tone
And when you're done, press hash, or just hang up

[Chorus]
You're my everything
Make me feel alright
You're the only thing
Makes me feel alright
You're my everything
You make me feel alright
And you're the only thing
I never feel alright

[Verse 1]
I guess I have to go
And in my silence
It's so menacing
And when I'm left alone
It's so damaging
And in this violеnce
The walls cave in
I'm not ablе
To escape it all
'Cause you're my everything, I have no words
And you're the only thing that makes life work
Thought I had everything, but it's not worth
Thought I had everything

Another lonely night
Another lonely night
Another lonely night

[Chorus]
And you're my everything
You make me feel alright
You're the only thing
That makes me feel just fine
You're my everything
You make me feel alright
And you're the only thing
Girl

[Outro]
I guess I have to go
I guess I have to go, girl
I guess I have to go, girl
I guess I have to go, girl
I guess I have to go, girl

We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize, I really want to put you on
I’ve been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won’t you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love

[Verse 2]
Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for mе, you said I’m not the one
So I slowly came to see all of thе things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I got to have a real love

[Bridge]
Love so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true
I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong, maybe I’ll find
A real love

[Verse 3]
So I’ve tried my best and prayed to God he’ll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
Ill give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love (Real love, real love)
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love

[Bridge]
See, I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go
(Real love, I’m searching for a real love)
Been around the world and high and low and still I never know
(Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love)
How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way 'cause it seems he can't be found

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love

[Intro: Mary J. Blige]
Yeah, let's take 'em back

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
'91, I stepped in this game
After "What's the 411?" things ain't been the same
And I can't complain
But with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain, but
I'm so glad to be here and my music's still sincere
Let's get back to the story of all of this pain and glory
And '94 was my life and my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you and told you what I've been through

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent, Both]
(Hate it or love it) Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
(Hate it or love it) Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Then I came with "Share My World"
But at that point I was just a foolish girl trying to find my way
Then I dropped the Mary album
And people were saying that it's just not gonna work
And my feelings, they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love
And I owe it all to them
Then I came with "No More Drama", I remember that week
Yeah, it was when Aaliyah died, I couldn't hardly sleep
Thought about it every day and it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now because of all of these days

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent, Both]
(Hate it or love it) Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
(Oh) Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
(Hate it or love it) Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen (Oh)
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
You remind me of a real love (You don't have to worry)
Real love
All night long, I'm goin' down
Reminisce on the love we have
You are everything, love without a limit
What you gonna do without my life, my life, my life, my life?

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent, Both]
(Hate it or love it) Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen (Oh)
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me (Hey, hey)
(Hate it or love it) Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
(Hate it or love it)
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
(I'm gon' shine right now)
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen (It's my time)
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me (Baby, hate it or love it)
Hate it or love it (I'm gon', I'm gon' shine)
I'm gon' shine (I'm gon', I'm gon' shine)
Go 'head, envy me (Hey, hey), I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
Right now I wanna thank
Each and every person out there that's ever done anything for Mary J. Blige
I wanna thank TV, radio, talk shows, friends, family
But most of all I wanna thank my fans
For hanging in there with me during the bad times
And now you're here
To see me at a point in my life where I can actually call myself a queen
And for those of you that don't like it
This is what you can do
You can do this
You can hate it or love it
Hate it or love it
Hate it or love it (Hate it)
Hate it or love it (Love it)
Hate it or love it (Hey, yeah)
Hate it or love it (No)
Hate it or love it (Love it)

[Spoken Intro]
You know. This song means a lot to me. There was a time in my life where I couldn't love myself enough to love anybody. And now I'm in love. And for Mary J. Blige, that's rare. You know, relationships are really hard to keep together. Well, let me explain to ya'll what happened

[Verse 1]
Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothin' overnight
'Cause a love like this takes some time
Peoplе swore it off as a phase, said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom, thеy see that we did that
(Yes) It's so true that
(Yes) We been through it
(Yes) But got real
(Yes) Baby

[Chorus]
We've been too strong for too long
And I can't be without you, baby
And I'll be waitin' up until you get home
'Cause I can't sleep without you, baby (Oh)
If anybody who's ever loved you know just what I feel (I know)
Too hard to fake it, nothin' can replace it (How I feel, baby)
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
I got a question for ya (See, I already know the answer)
But still I wanna ask you, would you lie? (No)
Make me cry? (No)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is on the up and up (On the up and up)
(Yes) I'll be faithful
(Yes) I'm for real
(Yes) And with us you'll always know the deal

[Chorus]
We've been too strong for too long
And I can't be without you, baby (Oh)
And I'll be waitin' up until you get home
'Cause I can't sleep without you, baby (Oh, oh)
If anybody who's ever loved you know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothin' can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby, yeah

[Bridge]
See, this is real talk, I'ma always stay (No matter what)
Good or bad (Thick and thin)
Right or wrong (All day, every day, hey)
Now if you're down on love or don't believe this ain't for you
(No, this ain't for you)
And if you got it deep in your heart
Deep down you know that it's true
(Come on, come on, come on)
Well, let me see you put your hands up (Hands up)
Fellas, tell your lady she's the one
Fellas, tell your lady she's the one
Oh, put your hands up (Hands up)
Ladies, let him know he's got you locked (Ladies, let him know he's got you locked)

[Outro]
Stay with me baby, uh
Stay with me baby
Stay with me baby
Remember
You said I was the one for you
Remember
I believe that what you said was true
Remember, remember, I'm tellin' you, tellin' you, oh, oh
Oh, yeah
Stay with me baby, yeah
Oh, stay with me baby, yeah
Stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
See, I can't be without you
Hey, hey

[Verse 1]
You call me every night
And tell me that you feel like shit
I say "I'm sorry, is there any way I can help with it?"
I listen to you scream
The world is simply your enemy
"With death and taxes, what's the point of trying to be happy?"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've had bad days, bad years
Bad boys and bad careers
But I'm still standing here
I understand you darling but at the end of the day
You just won't help your help yourself
Rather give someone else, a glimpse into your hell
Pour all your problems on 'em just so you could walk away

[Chorus]
Boy, I'm too young to be your mother
Not smart enough to be your therapist either
And I'm always here when you need a talk
But maybe first you should take a walk
'Cause I'm not gonna make you change
That's above my paygrade babe
So call me when your sober
Call me when it's over
Call me slurring over your words from a payphone

[Intro]
Yeah!
You motherfuckin' right
Taylor Gang, star year

[Hook]
I'm all out with it, I ain't low key

Everywhere I go, all the hoes know me
Heard me on the radio, see me on the TV
Plus they know I got cheese
So I pop one model, pop two models, pop three
Stеp up in the club, couple grand on deck
It's likе a light show, hundred grand on my neck
Tell the waitress I'm tryna get sky
So I drop one thousand, drop two thousand, drop three
Interest in my blunt, know I'm smoking that ray
Got a good green plug, I get high all day
Screamin' fuck security

[Hook]
I'm all out with it, I ain't low key
In the club, all drinks on me

A young star, everybody know me
'Cause I pop one bottle, pop two bottles, pop three

[Verse 2]

I'm a fool with the women, I'm a dog at the mall
All black chuck tees

Fresher than a mug, there's some 501 jeans
Twelves in my chuck got my trunk on B

Then I switch one lane, I switch two lanes, now that's three
Niggas goin' nuts, paper sluts everyday
Now wizzle hoes fucking for free
And I don't play with no E
Niggas pop one, then they pop two, dawg but not me

And the star life's really all that it seems
And when I drop my CD
I'mma sell one million, sell two, then I'mma sell three

[Hook]
I'm all out with it, I ain't low key
In the club, all drinks on me
Shorty in the club with her eyes on me

[Verse]
Young guy come to write beats I'm the baddest

She cooks she cleans for me
Stays with the strap, so a nigga act up, playin games it's a wrap
My pockets gordo you ain't saying nothin
Like a nigga with no back you lames stay frontin, stay frontin
Thought you were shining but what happened?
That shit ain't georias niggas only just rappin
Where the cash at, where the stash at?
You babysittin that blunt nigga pass that
Shorty got a cute face and her ass fat
If she rides good dick call her nasdaq
Ya the boy got bankroll, Taylors on the feet smoke
Sweets buy the caseload
Bankroll, bankroll the boy got bankrolled
Pockets on swolе like the BM's ankle
And I look young but my monеy is way grown
And my blunt is thick like I'm eating an eggroll
Niggas sound hard when they be on a song but under
Pressure yall fold like a knee or an elbow
Hear yall talking, ain't saying nothing
See yall shopping, ya ain't buying nothing
I'm sicker than anyone I've been compared with
Cause y'all ain't coming close I'm in the air, bitch!

[Chorus: Ludacris & Trina]
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But you gotta let me kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy

[Verse 1: Trina]
You know what I need
Somebody that who can come li-li-lick the clit (Alright)
And a nigga who ain't thinking 'bout a Trina LP
And I'll make him go and get my shit
We can go from a fly ass jetta to a Coupe De Ville
Hotel tally ho or the Beverly Hill
A real nigga not the run of the mill
Come and spank me and make me shoot to kill
From the kitchen then you can move me
To the jacuzzi and out the booty
Come and do your duty
Me and fat dick Ludacris making us a movie
Bare naked in a bed of cash
Make st-st-sttutter when I bare my ass
Tell your baby momma bye, she a thing of the past
Cause I'm a bad bitch and I'm off the glass (Okay)
Having sex in lil' jets menagé tois
Getting buck wild no matter where we are
Indie 500 in the back of the car
In a dark ass club or on the back of a bar
Never want, never ever wanna leave
Work for me like league overseas
I want a man to fulfill my needs
To keep my body trembling and buckle my knees

[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawnna]
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But you gotta let me kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy

[Verse 2: Shawnna]
I wanna do it on the canopy
I wanna do it where your girl gon' see, and get mad at me
I want a nigga that'll grab the weave
And turn my eyes Chinese
Tell me baby can you handle me?
I wanna do it all in your mouth
Then I'll pull the ass out
Make it bounce 'til you pass out
Or we can cut up in the grass
And give the neighbors a flash
Can you tell me who the bad motherfucker now?
Said I wanna take-ta-take-take a nigga back to the crib
And I wanna do all the things, do all the things that I never did
Like up on the top-to-top-top of the projects getting head
Or you can find me in a dro-drop-drop-drop on dubs in the candy red
I like a nigga when he face down, mouth wide
Polo down with them blades on the ride
Keepin' the pound with them K's on the side
But it's okay I'm gon break something tonight
Oh see get on your knees
And I'll show you what's my fantasy
Like up in the coupe, coupe
Tell your bitch she ain't gotta be mad at me

[Chorus: Ludacris & Foxy Brown]
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy
You gotta li li li lick me from my ass to my clit
Then you gotta su-suck the pussy while I sit on your dick
And I wanna talk some shit while I feel it get stiff
And then ruba-dub on my tits while I nut on your lips nigga

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]
I'm a BK bitch, love to ride dick
Ass in his face, cock spread out
Nigga uptown, nigga down south
Same ol' shit, bust in his mouth
F-O-X call me rough sex
Especially when a bitch get right on the X
Get it, right on X
Fuck him, check
Right to the next
Bitches go right, Fox right to the left
Nigga can't fuck, burner his chest
36 D's, Prada on the breasts
Baddest, send him home, na na on his breath
How you think a bitch got my rep?
3 Mills, still BK to the death
Still don't give a fuck
Still pose naked
Still specialize in sittin' niggas faces
Pop magnum's by the cases
X5, bitch, still spend big faces
Big frown, brown, hold first places
You know what you can do nigga?
You can li li li lick me from my ass to my clit
And ruba-dub up on my tits while I nu-nut on your lips, fucka

[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawnna]
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But you gotta let me kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy

[Verse 4: Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the bedroom, all alone
While your boyfriend is on the phone

[?] he can hear you moan
Tell your man that his girl is grown
Kitchen counter, neighbors look
This the way she like to cook
	Blindfold, hot sauce
I'm gonna knock them socks off
College dorms, sneak in
Fly 'em out for the weekend
College Park, after dark
It's a whole lotta freakin
Elevater, man stop that shit
Range Rover, man drop that shit
Dressing room, man 

[?] that shit
Headboard, man knock that shit
Me and Trina in a Bimmer
We got the camasutra

[?]
It's not what they used to
And Shawnna, Shawnna make it wet
Ludacris, and I make 'em sweat
Then I pass you a cigarette

[Chorus: Ludacris, Shawnna & Trina]
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
(Remix, remix)
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave (Remix, remix)
But you gotta let me kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy

But u gotta let me kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy
But I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
You know I go insane every time you have to catch a flight
Well, can I take you to the airport?
Make out under the bathroom lights

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Put your lips on my lips
I'll remember your kiss on the nights when I miss you
Somethin' I can't forget when I'm restless in bed
Yeah, you got me obsessed (Mm)

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?
You know I need you to stay
Don't make me beg for you
Oh, don’t you leave me, leave me

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX & Rina Sawayama]
This way, this way
Don’t leave me this way, don’t leave me this way
This way, this way
Don’t leave me this way
This way, this way
Don’t leave me, don’t leave me this way
This way, this way
My lips, i’ll remember your kiss
My lips, i’ll remember your kiss

[Verse 2: Rina Sawayama & Charli XCX]
You're like an ocean breeze, comin' and goin' just as you please
Separated by a degree, hesitate and I lose you
So far out of reach

[Pre-Chorus: Rina Sawayama]
Oh, put your lips on my lips
I'll remember your kiss on the nights when I miss you now
Somethin' I can't forget when I'm restless in bed
Yeah, you got me obsessin' now

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?
You know I need you to stay
Don't make me beg for you
Oh, don’t you leave me, leave me

[Bridge: Charli XCX]
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way
This way, this way
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way
This way, this way
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way (Don't you leave me)
This way (Don't you leave me this way), this way (Don't you leave me)
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way (Don't you leave me)
This way (Don't you leave me this way), this way (Don't you leave me) (Yeah)
Don't you leave me

[Outro: Charli XCX]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room
'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies
Wish I didn't care

[Pre-Chorus]
I know their beauty's not my lack
But it feels like that weight is on my back
And I can't let it go

[Chorus]
Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
And I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy started followin' me (Oh-oh-oh, oh)
Started followin' me (Oh-oh-oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want
And I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not
Just cool vintage clothеs and vacation photos
I can't stand it
God, I sound crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Their win is not my loss
Yeah, I know it's true, but
I can't hеlp getting caught up in it all

[Chorus]
Yeah, com-comparison, killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
And I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy

[Bridge]
All your friends are so cool, you go out every night
In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're livin' the life
Got a pretty face, a pretty boyfriend, too
I wanna be you so bad and I don't even know you
All I see is what I should be
Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy
All I see is what I should be
I'm losin' it, all I get's jealousy, jealousy

[Chorus]
Comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
And I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
Jealousy, jealousy
Oh, I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
Jealousy, jealousy started followin' me
Marry me, marry me
Say yes
Marry me, marry me
Say yes
Marry me, marry me
Say yes for the rest, the rest

I've never seen forever (Oh, yeah)
I've never seen forever in the wild
But now I'm looking, now I'm looking in its eyes
Baby, you're my shelter
Shelter from a broken paradise
I couldn't dream it any better if I tried

True love got a ring, ring, ring
Church bells let 'еm ring, ring, ring
This queen need a king, king, king
For life, for life, for life
Truе love got a ring, ring, ring (Ring, ring)
Church bells let 'em ring, ring, ring (Ring, ring)
Angel's gonna sing, sing, sing
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Baby, marry me, marry me
Say yes
Marry me, marry me
Say yes
Marry me, marry me
Say yes for the rest, the rest of your life
Marry me, marry me
Say yes
Marry me, marry me
Say yes
Marry me, marry me
Say yes for the rest, the rest of your life

Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma-marry me
Won't you love me, baby?
Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma-marry me

I'ma fly you out to Vegas (Vegas)
We could tie it up tonight, no patience
Take my last name, put it where your name is
Have they ever seen a love this famous?
They never, no, they never
This forever, ever, ever, ever, ever
Ain't nobody do it better, better, better
And it's only getting better
True love got a ring, ring, ring (Ooh, we gotta)
Church bells let 'em ring, ring, ring (Ooh, they gotta)
You're the queen, I'll be the king, king, king
For life, for life, for life (For life)

True love got a ring, ring, ring (Ring, ring)
Church bells let 'em ring, ring, ring (Ring, ring)
Angels gonna sing, sing, sing
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Baby, marry me, marry me

Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma-marry me
I want you in my life so bad
Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma-marry me (Oh)
Won't you love me, baby?
Marry me, marry me
Say yes for the rest, the rest of your life

[Verse 1]
I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my **** teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more

[Chorus]
All I did was try my bеst
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelеntlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

[Verse 2]
I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park

[Chorus]
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Got a broken ego, broken heart
And God, I don't even know where to start

[Intro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse]
Brown guilty eyes and
Little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
Ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

[Chorus]
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you, oh
And when she's sleepin' in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way

[Chorus]
You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
You gave me your word, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still, you're still a traitor
Yeah, you're still a traitor

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you

[Chorus]
'Cause it’s always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don’t understand
No, I don't understand

[Verse]
And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like, which lover will I get today? Yeah
Will you walk me to the door or send me home cryin'?

[Chorus]
It's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want mе, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand

[Bridge]
No, it's back and forth, did I say somеthin’ wrong?
It’s back and forth, goin' over everything I said
It’s back and forth, did I do somethin' wrong?
It's back and forth, maybe this is all your fault instead

[Chorus]
It's one step forward and three steps back
And I’d leave you, but the rollercoaster's all I've ever had
It's one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand

[Verse 1]
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin' 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watchin' reruns of Glee
Bein' annoyin', singin' in harmony
Well, I'll bet she's braggin' to all her friends, saying you're so unique

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? Oh
Do you get déjà vu? Oh

[Verse 2]
Do you call her and almost say my name?
'Cause let's be honest, wе kinda do sound the same
Another actrеss
Well, I hate to think that I was just your type
And I'll bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (I love you)

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singin' now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? Oh
Do you get déjà vu? Oh

[Bridge]
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel
It's a different girl now, but there's nothin' new

[Outro]
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu

[Verse 1]
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
You're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Oh

[Verse 2]
And good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the **** is up with that?
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
You're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
You're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Outro]
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily

[Verse 1]
Know that I loved you so bad
I let you treat me like that
I was your willing accomplice, honey
And I watched as you fled the scene
Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody

[Chorus]
Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

[Verse 2]
You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends
And now every time a siren sounds
I wonder if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again

[Chorus]
Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

[Bridge]
And it's bittersweet to think about the damage that we'd do
'Cause I was goin' down, but I was doin' it with you
Yeah, everything we broke and all the trouble that we made
But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face
Oh, look what we became

[Chorus]
Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you mine, oh
Oh, the things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

[Outro]
Your favorite crime
Your favorite crime
'Cause, baby, you were mine

[Verse 1]
I wore makeup when we dated
'Cause I thought you'd like me more
If I looked like the other prom queens
I know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you liked
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type

[Verse 2]
I knew how you took your coffee
And your favorite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books
So you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave

[Chorus]
You found someonе more exciting
The nеxt second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
Yeah, all I ever wanted was to be enough for you

[Verse 3]
And maybe I'm just not as interesting
As the girls you had before
But God, you couldn't have cared less
About someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now I don't want your sympathy
I just want myself back

[Chorus]
Before you found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough

[Bridge]
And don't you think I loved you too much
To be used and discarded?
Don't you think I loved you too much
To think I deserve nothing?
But don't tell me you're sorry, boy
Feel sorry for yourself
'Cause someday, I'll be everything to somebody else
And they'll think that I am so exciting
And then you'll be the one who's cryin'

[Outro]
Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
You say I'm never satisfied
But that's not me, it's you
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
But I don't think anything could ever be enough for you
Enough for you, oh
No, nothing's enough for you

[Verse 1]
We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

[Chorus]
Oh, I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't bе happier

[Verse 2]
And do you tell her shе's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

[Chorus]
I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best, really
Say you love her, baby
Not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, just don't be happier

[Verse 1]
I knew a boy once when I was small
A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
His parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad
And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're okay

[Verse 2]
My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on her own
Her parents hated who she loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?
And we don't talk much, but I just gotta say
I miss you and I hope that you're okay

[Bridge]
Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing's as good as it seems
And when the clouds don't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

[Outro]
Well, I hope you know how proud I am you were created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
But, God, I hope that you're happier today
'Cause I love you
And I hope that you're okay
I hope that you're okay

[Intro: Travis Scott]
Oh my god, what did I do? Yeah
Rollin', rollin', rollin' 'till the sun set
The feeling's way to numb just to come, yeah

[Intro: JAY-Z]
You already know what it is, right? Woo!

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Rocka Fella, fellas, umbrellas
Eh, changin’ the weather
And G5 the better
My tunes is monsoons
It’s like a tsunami when I come out my mommy womb
Hey, eh, eh, get your trench coats
When I flow over instrumentals, I drench hoes, HOV
Hey— Rain Man is back
With lil miss sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me therе
With you, I'll always share
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Whеn the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

[Bridge: Rihanna]
You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So gon' and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

[Outro: Rihanna]
It's rainin', rainin'
Ooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'
Baby, come here to me
Come into me
It's rainin', rainin'
Ooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'
You can always come into me
Come into me
It's pourin' rain
It's pourin' rain
Come here to me
Come into me
It's pourin' rain
It's pourin' rain

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tеll me now, tell me now, tеll me now, now you know

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Outro: Rihanna]
Stay
I want you to stay
Ooh

At least that's what they say
Well, I know that for myself now
(You know I love you)
You said you loved me babe (To my heart)
And then you played your game (Me?)
A game that I know all too well now (Easy girl, you know I'm sorry)

Gimme the keys to ya chest
Ya chest will rise neva rest
As ya chest you got me feelin' like I'm climbin' on Mount Everest
Hey Rihanna, your lovin' really put me to the test

Soon the answer will yes
Yes to this yes, yes to that yes, to whateva you suggest
So please say yes

[Verse 3: Rihanna & Vybz Kartel]
No, no, no
Haters gonna hate (Let them hate)
I found out much too late
I think I know we're a little hot now (Feel mature with my pride)
The truth leads to the lies
The heart ain't always right (I know that)
And I see that love is blind now (I can show you)
Boy, you used to have my trust
Without trust, there ain't no us, boy

[Chorus: Rihanna & Vybz Kartel]
No, no, no (No-n-n-no-no, oh)

[Verse 1]
If you try and fail, get up again
Destiny will choose you in the end
If you don't make the choice, and you don't use your voice
Someone else will speak for you instead

[Verse 2]
What you want is just within' your reach (Yeah)
But you gotta practice what you preach
You pay with sweat and tears to overcome your fears
Never let the fire inside you leave

[Chorus]
"I-can't", "icon" - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are, who you are
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby, don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be

[Drop: Madonna]
Iconic
Iconic
Ironic
Iconic

[Verse 3]
Tell me I'm no good and I'll be great
Say I have to fight and I can't wait
Standing in the wings, a butterfly that stings
I will rise above 'cause it's my fate

[Chorus]
"I-can't", "icon" - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are who you are
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby, don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be

I’m moving through circles
Been bouncing around
Meeting new people
All over town

[Chorus]
I’m used to the circles that we move through
And it’s cool
But we don’t kick it like we used to
I’ve lost a few good ones along the way
But I’ll be right here for you
Someday
I’m moving through circles

[Verse 2]
I’m out with the in crowd
But that’s just right now
That fire will smolder
Will you be around?
Everything’s changing
I’m still the same
So come right on over
I’m calling your name

[Chorus]
I’m used to the circles that we moved through
And it’s cool
But we don’t kick it like we used to
I’vе lost a few good ones along the way
But I’ll bе right here for you
Someday
I’m moving through circles

[Bridge]
I haven’t seen you in a while
But I know what you’re up to
And it’s making me smile
Just to be thinking of you

Haven’t seen you in a while
But I know what you’re up to
And it’s making me smile
Just to be thinking of you

[Chorus]
I’m used to the circles that we moved through
And it’s cool
But we don’t kick it like we used to
I’ve lost a few good ones along the way
But I’ll be right here for you
Someday
I’m moving through circles

[Outro]
I’m moving through circles
I’m moving through circles

I'ma come and kick it in the Balenciagi'
Don't text me in the mornin', bae, I'm groggy
Text me, no FaceTime, I'm too groggy

[Post-Chorus: Future & Kanye West]
Yeah-yeah, if I dig in my bag, it's an M (Yeah, yeah)
'Bout to put a lil' bitch on a film (Yeah, yeah)
I done took off in air, I can't see him (Yeah, yeah)
Bound to geeking before the codeine (Yeah, yeah)
Know the chief, I'm ahead of my time (Yeah, yeah)
Got Chanel coat and then bought a nine (Yeah, yeah)
Ah, run it up 'fore I do
In the morning making moves

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Hey miss, I'm your Mr. Miyagi
I'ma come and kick it in the Balenciagi'
Don't text me in the mornin', bae, I'm groggy
Text me, no FaceTime, I'm too groggy

[Chorus: Kanye West]
(We did it, we did it, Joe!)
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I'm in the Louis store with a Gucci mask
I'm in the Louis store with a Gucci mask
I'm in the Louis store with a Gucci mask
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If we ain't doin' business, it won't be no business
If we ain't doin' business, it won't be no business
If we ain't doin' business, it won't be no business
If we ain't doin' business, it won't be no business
Pick 

[?] I'll take it, mmh
Pick another one and let it, mmh
Find another one and let it, mmh
Fine life and I could've—, mmh
I'm not gonna lie, I couldn't move
Couldn't even if I wanted to
Couldn't scare me if it haunted you
I'ma do what I wanna do
What you look like in that nasty Louis bag?
Remember I examined 

[?], too
What you look like in that nasty Louis bag?
We stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
What you look like in that nasty Louis bag?
We stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
What you look like in that nasty Louis bag?
We stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
(We did it, we did it, Joe!) Ayy

[Verse 2: Jack Harlow]
I'm my lil' cousin's favorite cousin
I gave 'em all my number in my phone, they stopped buzzin'
They listen to my songs and say their parents hate the cussin'
They asked if I was nervous on TV or if I wasn't
They asked me if it's true that I don't go to church
"My daddy said you don't," well, then I guess you know
I been thinkin' about goin', though, I might let you know
One day, I'll bring you to my concert if they let you go
Pumpin' gas alone in Texaco
Hopin' I don't get approached
Don't know if it's clear until I check the coast
All these rappers dyin', I don't wan' be one that's next to go
Paranoia tickin' in my head just like a metronome
I can't walk around like Jack that wore the spectacles
I shook the hands, took the pictures, made myself accessible
Threw the parties, showed love, kept it all respectable
Tried to give you something you ain't had before but
It's all over, they got the drop on my life, it's all over
All this pressure on me, they'd wish I'd fall over
Too bad I'm a winner like fall over
I dropped, uh, heat in February
Cocky tweets in February
All-Star weekend with the court-side seats in February
I'm the champ', you come second like the E in February
All that humble **** was fake, now, can we keep it legendary?
Please

[Spoken Word]
I still get lost in night
Lost in my dreaming time
Memories back from fine
Back to get all my time
I still get lost when trying
Memory back from time
All my thoughts on at night
All my life's on the line
I still get lost in night
Memory back from mine
'Member we had one night?
'Member we had the night?
I still get lost sometimes
Memories haunting mind
'Member we had the mind?
'Member we had the mind?
I'm gon' get lost sometimes
'Mеmber we cry sometimеs
I went through final fight
While you was mine, all mine
Somehow, we got to meet
Now you stay off the streets
Walked out without the love
Soccer without the cleats
Fucked up and on repeat
'Bove all the night, I beat
I know I'm back to sleep
What a new sight to see, what do you write for me?
What will feel right for me?
I did what's right for me
I fought from fighting me
Well, I would like to see
I still get lost sometimes
Far from my state of mind
Stay on the vibes alright
When do I cross your mind?
When do you see my pride?
I've got a Pablo shine
Pride is the number line
Okay, well, never mind
Okay, then, never mind
Do I still cross your mind?
If not, then, never mind
If not, then, never mind

[Intro: Future]
This gonna make shit alright
Get in first line let it take off
You made it brine then I take off
Made it out the year
Last time, yeah, yeah
I got ya (ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Hmm, I'm on the realest
Bought a new house down the street if I miss you
Lovin' on the edge but your mouth is the issue
Livin' on the time when your spouse s'posed to be with you
Come up on a thou' soon as I'll come and get you
Bump and praise my, I might buy a missile
Must own the base that tha fam wanna hit through
Lightning and thunder can't tell me what I've been through
Need to do somethin' for the Sunday, gettin' over
Line for somethin', for somethin' we gettin' into
Hide 'fore our fam but we're fine with the fame
Takin' on lines, on the lines, to the mean
That was all fine, on the time for the money

[Interlude: Future]
Yeah, Pluto (Burning down the house)
Yeah, extra (Burning down the house)
Cookin' out the Pyrex
Never had a doubt on the shit but I told you  (Burning down the house)
Nigga, I'ma bring it, I'ma, ah, ah (Burning down the house)

[Verse 2: Future]
Cookin' out the bowl, tryna scrape out the paint
One day I was high, had to pour the whole pint
Woke up in the sky, same money from the bank
I'll take it wrapped in plastic, accept anything
Cut up the dark with the fetti, nine times
Doped up today like I got ninety-nine lives
Blood on my money, see the blood in my eyes
LaFerrari, bando, two at a time
Every time I fuck, you gotta tell me it's mine
Sinnin' again, I've been winnin' again
Telling that shawty to spin it again
Ridin' with the fire, bitch ain't never gon' see
Walkin' in the day one in the head is a must
Dark in my flesh, say it run in my cup (Burning down the house)
Rose gold like a band-aid over my cut
Tailored in plush and colored the scrush (Burning down the house)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Had the full maze and I got lost again
They had the maid in the main room I'm in (Burning down the house)
I got the main ones, they fading away
I hold the manner, can't see till the end (Burning down the house)
Came up here to die, this the home of the drillers
Got a home across your home only reason 'cause I miss you
Fumbled with it, now says your mouth is the issue
If I run for twenty-four, I bet my spouse gon' be with me
Turn up on the town when it's out, when we in it
Gotta love the town, want it now, need it with me
Last time in town, yeah, you seen where they sit me
Last time in town, entire team they were with me
Running out of time for the time for the fiend
When it's only time that I really need
I don't need to find it and I don't need it for the minute

[Verse 4: Future]
Bando, count money with a MAC
Seen too much violence, done seen too much death
Bodies on bodies, got a gang full of them
Raised by gangsters, prostitutes and pimps
Visit my grandmother in prison on Sunday
Talk in third person, won't admit it if I done it
Money like Sage in my house, keep it burnin'
(Burning down the house)
Money like Sage in my house, keep it burnin'
(Burning down the house)
Money like Sage in my house, keep it burnin'
(Burning down the house)
(Burning down the house)

[Verse 1]
I came to you when I needed a rest
You took my love and put it to the test
I saw some things that I never would have guessed
Well I've been down but I'm comin' back up again

[Chorus]
And I'm rolling down the open road
Where my true love, she lies waitin'
Right now I'm thinkin' 'bout these things I know
But the daylight will soon be breaking

[Verse 2]
You were my raft and I let you slide
It seemed like such a long easy ride
I was adrift on a river of pride
Feels like a railroad, I pull a whole load behind

[Chorus]
That old white line is a friend of mine
And its good time that we've been makin'
Right now I'm rollin' down the open road
But the daylight will soon be breaking

[Intro]
How I got over (how I got over)
How I got over (how I got over)
My soul looks back in wonder how I got over
How I got over (how I got over)
How I got over (how I got over)
My soul looks back in wonder how I got over

I'm going to thank Jesus for all He's done for me

[Chorus]
How I got over, over
My soul looks back in wonder how I got over
How I got over, over
My soul looks back in wonder how I got over

[Verse 2]
I want to wear a diadem (oh yes)
In the new Jerusalem (oh yes, oh yes)
I want to walk the streets of gold (oh yes, oh yes, oh yes)
In the homeland of the soul (oh yes)

I'm going to view the Host in white (oh yes)
Who travels both day and night (oh yes, oh yes)
Coming up from every nation (oh yes, oh yes, oh yes)
On the way to the great coronation (oh yes)

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to sing (hallelujah)
I might shout this evening (troubles over)
I'm going to thank Jesus for all He's done for me

[Chorus]
How I got over, over
My soul looks back and wonder how I got over
How I got over, over
My soul looks back and wonder how I got over
How I got over, over
My soul looks back and wonder
My soul looks back and wonder
My soul looks back and wonder how I got over

[Bridge]

How I got over how I got over
How I got over how I got over
My soul look back and wonder how I got over

[Chorus]
It's an evil wind
That blows no good air
It’s a sad heart
That won't love like I know it could
Oh, how lonesome (Oh, how lonesome)
You must be, yeah (You must be)
It would be a shame (Shame)
Shame if you don't share
Some of your love with me
Would you do that?
Would you do that?

It’s a heartache, yes (It's a heartache)
Oh, yes, it is
When love is gone (Baby, it's a heartache)
But it's bad (Bad)
And even sadder (Sad)
Oh, 

[? 1:35]

And there's no one blinder
Than you won't see, oh yeah
I tell you, it'll be a shame (Shame)
Shame if you don't share
Some of your love with me
Yes, it would
I can’t help it, oh no
He’s gone
I must try to forget
Because I got to live on
Hey

It's a sweet thing (It’s a sweet thing)
It's a terribly sweet thing
To love someone (Such a sweet thing)
Yes, it is
But it's bad (Bad)
And even sad (Sad)
Oh, when it's not returned

Yeah, oh, how lonesome, baby (How lonesome)
How lonesome, baby
You must be, oh yeah (You must be)

I tell you, it would be a shame (Shame)
Shame if you don’t share
Some of your love with me
Would you do that?
Come on, baby, come on, baby

[Intro]
You're waking me up
You're waking me up

[Verse 1]
It's like I'm trapped in time every night
Cause I'm tossing back and forth trying to make sense of it all
And though I cry, I’m just alright
This goes on in just to my thought that I won't get to where I want to
Suddenly I'm reeling 'cause I will never get to where you are
I got this feeling, it's unattainable to get to where you
To stop my reeling, I'll stop reeling where you are
But my reasons overhealing, at least I'm tryna figure out
How to get where you are
I'm trying hard to stay away (make it let go)
Please hold my hands, I'm hard to break (I can't let go)

[Outro]
And suddenly I'm reeling cause I will never get to where you are
I got this feeling it's unattainable to get to where you (make it let go)
To stop my reeling I'll stop reeling where you are
At least I'm tryna figure out (I can't let go)

[Chorus]
Just tell me what you wanting
Boy anything you want, bet I'm on it (For sure)
Just tell me what you wanting
Boy anything you want, bet I'm on it (For sure)
Just tell me what you wanting
Boy anything you want, bet I'm on it (For sure)
Just tell me what you wanting
Boy anything you want, bet I'm on it (For sure)
Tell me what you wanting
Boy anything you want, bet I'm on it (For sure)
Just tell me what you wanting
Boy anything you want, bet I'm on it

[Verse 1]
Boy, why you?

Got you fuckin' up my pussy, credit, and my wallet
Bought the yacht, put you first and then my bandits on it (Ayy)

[Verse 1]
The lonely man I make myself to be
Is not as bad as some things I have seen
The picture painted here is not a dream
But only reality, the way it seems

[Chorus]
The happier you fly, the sadder you crawl
The laughter in your eye is never all
Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's gone

[Verse 2]
I'm riding down Swett Road in my old car
The moon is almost full except for stars
The party endеd long before the night
Shе made me feel alive and that's all right

[Chorus]
The happier you fly, the sadder you crawl
The laughter in your eye is never all
Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's gone

[Harmonica Break]

[Chorus]
The happier you fly, the sadder you crawl
The laughter in your eye is never all
Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's gone

[Verse 1]
Bad news has come to town
And is walking three feet off the ground
He's ordering one more round
Bound by his own ideas
Lost, doesn't know where she is found

[Verse 2]
Bad news is fightin' mad
He went and lost the biggest prize he had
But a prizefighter can't be sad
When he smiles under golden lights
And laughs, taking big life bites again

[Verse 3]
Bad news has come to town
Bound by his own ideas
Lost, doesn't know where she is found

[Outro]
Bad news has come to town

[Verse 1]
Look out, Mama, there's a white boat coming up the river
With a big red beacon and a flag and a man on the rail
I think you better call John
'Cause it don't look like they're here to deliver the mail
And it's less than a mile away
I hope they didn't come to stay
It's got numbers on the side and a gun
And it's making big waves

[Verse 2]
Daddy's gone, and my brother's out huntin' in the mountains
Big John's been drinkin' since the river took Emmy Lou
So the powers that be left me here to do the thinkin'
And I just turnеd twenty-two
I was wonderin' what to do
And the closеr they got
The more those feelin's grew

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Daddy's rifle in my hand felt reassurin'
He told me "Red meant run, and numbers add up to nothing"
When the first shot hit the dock I saw it comin'
Raised my rifle to my eye
Never stopped to wonder why
Then I saw black and my face
Splashed in the sky

[Verse 4]
Silence me from the powder and the finger
And cover me with the thought that pulled the trigger
Just think of me as one you never figured
Would fade away so young
With so much left undone
Remember me to my love
I know I'll miss her

[Verse]
I have heard of a land on the far away strand
'Tis a beautiful home of the soul
Built by Jesus on high
And we never shall die
'Tis a land, we never grow old

[Chorus]
We'll never grow old
Never, never grow old
It's a land where we never grow old
Never (Never, never) grow old, old, old
Never, never grow old
Hey, it's a land where we never grow old

[Intro]
(Yo, Nick Papz, make it slap)
Yeah, huh

[Verse 1]
It was a type of day I felt like I ain't deserve to smile
When you waking up getting news, like you heard Virgil died
Ain’t had no homie like that, but I feel hurt inside
Knowing we grew up trying to kill niggas since I was a murder child
Jealous I ain't had no daddy, I just couldn't verbalize it
So I ran to the corner with all the gangsters, I’m trying certified
As my mom, ever since 13 She never heard me cry
Cause I've been strapping evеr since I heard my homie
My first hеard He died
Cause We didn't got so used to death that
It don't even burn inside it
Everything got internalized when everything start to eternalize
I turn my eyes, act like I don't see it and you wonder why
Knowing they were sins before they told us how to underline
I was praying to make it to 25
So I've never counted my money before my blessings
Cause ain't no telling what's going happen
My young boy don’t be hearing me, when I be telling about trapping going
Do it in the county rocking trucks are really scrappy
Eating shit you can’t imagine, attorney to a savage
Do you really know where the trap is locked in the box to go in the casket
Cause you ain't had no floor, no jump shot to go in the basket
So you got a Glock shoot a black man
Constantly you are blocking on your ass just like this pac man
Nobody told us cops robbers
It really happened till we got out here in this traffic

[Interlude]
I want to thank God for all my blessings
Everyday I wake up, Everyday I pray before
Before like it came to life all my dreams that I chase
I feel like they came true so, I just wanna, you kno
Make sure I thank God first for my blessings

[Verse 2]
I’m taking the profit in bitcoin
Because I know that man on a dollar really a mess
And I'm not dumb I'm moving faster
I told my younger don't never be no hitter that’s really dumb
Cause if you done these niggas to crash
When I was young I couldn't grasp it
Cause I grew up in the jungle
At the very bottom of the barrel you make It out
They tryna grab, y'all tell them lost to me and crabby
I had beef with niggas before I had to play the state
I went to jail and commissary had my favorite plate
Been eating oodles and noodles ever since like 88
The menu look like it's made to stay

[Verse 3]
Blessings
And if I'm with you then I'm with you until I fade away
Don't take the lead I made a way
I ain't heard them kids ain't get no christmas
You know say the day I took my blessings
I'm putting on for the treatments and it made your way
Blessings
You ain't got to like me, you're gonna respect it
When I was like clear that's when I check it out
I was right there with all these steppers that's why
No I gotta be special cause Lord
Knows my heart and grass about being real with myself
And paying my people back in

[Outro]
Blessings
Yeah

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Yeah, something I don't understand
I know some guys from the roots of this shit
Who ain't congratulate me on Grammy
Nigga I thought we was family

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
You could do this too, if you ask me like I do
I never care what niggas did cause they ain't fucking with my crew
I stayed down for all them nights, that's too hard cause I knew
Any moment I could blow up and the prices gotta go up
California nicest motorcades when I roll up
This the type of shit that make a hate, nigga throw up
This the type of shit that make a good girl turn up
Sitting in the hills, counting up a mill

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Dirty nose nigga now I'm rich like Uncle Phil
Fresh Prince of Philly and arenas like I'm guilty (Yeah)
My dog always at me since you made it how it feels
I can't even explain it, I'm just not complaining (Aight)
I just made so much money that I cannot contain it
I need another accounting (for what?)
To watch my other accounting (for what?)
The way that money coming in, that time don't even count it
I barely even check it, I stay humble count my blessings (Yeah)
Went to jail so niggas turn they back, I learned my lesson
Been in the game like 10 years and I still ain't get restless
Last nigga asleep and the first nigga woke
Cause the first nigga asleep would be the first nigga broke
No bet

[Verse 1]
Nabokov is sun-licked now
Upon the beach at Grunewald
Brilliant and naked just
The way that authors look
Clare and Lady Manners drink
Until the other cows go home
Gossip till their lips are bleeding
Politics and all

[Chorus]
I’d rather be high
I’d rather be flying
I’d rather be dead
Or out of my head
Than training these guns on those men in the sand
I’d rather be high

[Verse 2]
The Thames was black, the tower dark
I flew to Cairo, find my regiment
City’s full of generals
And generals full of shit
I stumble to the graveyard and I
Lay down by my parents, whisper
Just remember duckies
Everybody gets got

[Chorus]
I’d rather be high
I’d rather be flying
I’d rather be dead
Or out of my head
Than training these guns on those men in the sand
I’d rather be high

[Bridge]
I’m seventeen my looks can prove it
I’m so afraid that I will lose it
I’d rather smoke and phone my ex
Be pleading for some teenage sex
Yeah

[Chorus]
I’d rather be high
I’d rather be flying
I’d rather be dead
Or out of my head
Than training these guns on the men in the sand
I’d rather be high

Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last, last

Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through, through

[Chorus]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

And I've got some issues no one else can see
All these emotions pouring out of me
I got some issues no one else can see
All these emotions pouring out of me

He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

[Intro: 50 Cent, The Notorious B.I.G., Malice, JAY-Z, Shyne, Nas, Fat Joe]
That's the sound of a man, Green Lantern
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Move forward, y'all amateurs
Y'all compared to me
All I need in this life of sin
Is a crooked lawyer, big rims, and a MAC-10!
Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty
I pull up in they curb, pull a Desert Bird
All I need in this life of sin
Is a crooked lawyer, big rims, and a MAC-10!
The fifth got a rubber grip and a beam on it

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I got seven Mac-11's, about eight .38's
Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's the shits never end
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lamb spread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give MCs the runs dripping
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable, peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God I'm dropping shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listening, smacking babies at they christening
So you better grab your pistol
'Cause if you sit still, I'm gonna make your fucking shit spill
And I'm talking 'bout buckets, why did I have to do it?
Sadat said fuck it, you got a gun, nigga bust it
'Cause I got mo' shots to pop ya
Big Poppa, breaking you off something proper
Signing off is the hardcore rap singer
AKA crack slinger, bring it any time nigga

[Break: JAY-Z, Shyne, Eminem, Nas]
All I need in this life of sin
Is a crooked lawyer, big rims, and a MAC-10!
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
You know I click-clack — where you and your mens at?

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Any beef marriage it, me and three Arabics, Ali Naseem on point like Pete Maravich

[?]
I miss the era of the BM's, BB's
I was ducking GMDC
Had that scope, aim and I light ya'
Seen all islands, Caymans to Rikers
Contain, complain, detain, maintain, the same reign, the game is for lifers
I don't care I put flame in the fire
Christian, atheist you pray to Elijah
Don't play, okay, just pray I don't snipe ya'
'Cause with the SK, doggy I'm OK
My AK was my a.k.a. before my ABC's had me A-OK

[Refrain]

Lyrics from Snippet

...really tryna keep in touch (Talking)
I hope that you don't take this the wrong way
All I ever wanted was to fuck (What the fuck?)
I got you number saved, your name is "Don't fuckin' pick it up"
But when I get lonely...

[Intro: Doja & Aryius]
Damn, you only good for talking shit
Only talking shit
You still my fan, though
Yuh heard?
Yuh

[Chorus: Doja]
Life can take you higher
Then you're feelin' low-low
That you gon' go up and down
Kinda like a yo-yo (Huh)
Life can take you higher
'Til  you're feelin' low-low
That you gon' go up and down
(Up and down-down, up and down, up and down)
Kinda like a yo-yo
(Up and down-down, up and down, up and down)
(Huh)

[Verse 1: Doja]
One minute I feel shit (Shit)
Next minute I'm the shit (The shit, uh)
It get under my skin (Yeah)
Kinda just like a tick
Some people make me sick (Mm-hmm)
I'ma just bite my fists (My fists)
I'ma just wet my wrist (My wrist, yeah)
Fuck a nigga 'til he limp (Fuck)
This doesn't need a caption (No-no)
I'm a real bitch, you half one (Ah-ah-ah)
Hate all you want, lil' bitch, these bands I got
You won't get a fraction
I'm sorry that you're lost boy (Lost)
I'ma go down like Jackson (Like Jack', like)
Hooks on hooks on hooks likе ayy (Yeah)
You wanna just call me captain, son

[Chorus: Doja]
Life can takе you higher
Then you're feelin' low-low
That you gon' go up and down
Kinda like a yo-yo
Life can take you higher
'Til you're feelin' low-low
That you gon' go up and down
(Up and down-down, up and down, up and down)
Kinda like a yo-yo
(Up and down-down, up and down, up and down)
(Huh)

[Verse 2: Aryius]
I had to flip you off, seen in the rear-view mirror
Took your pics, flash on, I ain't talking Ezra Miller
Come get your bitch before she bite me
It's not my fault that she liked me
Let me get ya thirst quenched, fed em' sugar honey iced-tea
Please continue dick riding
Props to all the opps, they were trying
To end me, no, they couldn't end me
Showin' their colors from the fake love they send me
Return that shit, ship it back with express
The day I’m in my prime, they’ll be jealous of success
Not about that high life, biggin' up my chest
Only hi and bye to them bitches that are pressed
Pressed, Pressed

[Chorus: Doja]
Life can take you higher
Then you're feelin' low-low
That you gon' go up and down
Kinda like a yo-yo (Huh)
Life can take you higher
'Til you're feelin' low-low
That you gon' go up and down
(Up and down-down, up and down, up and down)
Kinda like a yo-yo
(Up and down-down, up and down, up and down)
(Huh)
I M A MC, R U 1 2?
You spell it out as each letter I said to you
I M A MC, R U 1 2?
That's the title of the project that I'm sending to you
It's a message to MCs that whatever you do
Keep your skills tight, the future is depending on you
Never spit for only money or what they're handing to you
Spit for the people, try to predict what your man going to do
Get hungry on them, look at rappers with a cannibal view
I roll with an animal crew and we battled a few
But these days I'm spiting in a party after it's through
Cypher style, keeping it in with a spectacular view
You ain't attacking a crew, in fact we're clapping at you
I wish they would, so I could snap these rappers in two
I be rapping from the sound of the Kalamazoo
Smacking rappers around like the tennis racquets they do
I be spitting what's legitimate, factual, actual and true
Put the mic down for another sound, I am not going to do
I was there in the beginning, I'll be there when it's through
I M A MC, R U 1 2?
I M A MC, R U 1 2?
If you got a chance to spit it, what you gonna do?
I'm too hot to handle, too hot for fans too
When I spit my MC light, they say "we cram to understand you"
I stay hot like the Sudan do
Open your mind, I plan to
With real knowledge, nothing you can't do
Knowledge Reigns Supreme on these fakers I trample
Show up at the spot while they mumble and ramble
Pull out the wax, burn these rappers down like a candle
Watching them scramble, this is just a little example
The street teacher type, at the peak of height, the leader type
The street preacher type, culture keeper, divine speaker type
Truth seeker type, deeper type, seeking freedom type
The eager type, KRS-One, that's what he is like
Making sure the family eating right while we're seeking light
Real skill when I squeeze the mic you're gonna see tonight
146 and Broadway, that's the throwback
Broadway RT 86, that's where the show's at
Jump on the mic with no skill? You get your nose cracked
Me? I was drilling them, killing them, man, you know that
All Across 110 Street, Bobby Womack
Youngins saying "That's the OG, that's the ol' cat"
That's the teacher speaking that new rap and old rap
I'm giving you your heritage back, youngin, hold that
Uh huh
Uh huh

I M A MC, R U 1 2?
I like the sound of it
Only a few heads ever come around and shit
No getting around this shit, I'm pounding it
When I Ad Rock, I get so Beastie Boy I start growling spit
You drowning in it, my flow is like the OG Kush
You loving every ounce that you get
I made it out of the pit, no glam and no glit
This may be Run's House, but I'm the handyman pulling hammers real quick
You can't touch this, with a hand or a grip
Rappers avoiding the smoke like a cigarette after it's lit
I spit the tactical, mathematical, actual shit
After I spit, it's a grip I'm about to go get
Got skills? You a rapper? This the question for you
I M A MC, R U 1 2?
Turn to your friends, if they spit it, ask them too
I M A MC, R U 1 2?
(Intro)

Gather round (oh yeah)
Think bigger
Think bigger
(This is about life)
Life
(Real life)
Real life
Your life
My life
Real life

(Verse 1)

Young and strugglin' out there buggin'
Let me sing a song for you
This song ain't for everybody, this is for the chosen few
Those that's born with purpose never worthless this is all for you
You hearin' me at this moment 'cause the spirit is calling youSomethin' pressing inside revealing it's truth is calling you
But if you don't understand the acronym Simonе brought to you
The media will lead your mind to do things you don't want to do
Likе dissin' your own heritage and the lineage that belongs to you
This is what a colonists about, dissin' all of you
The past, the present, the future, and what you gonna do
It's not just about now, it's about tomorrow too
You are the cultural foundation of those that will follow you
Just like you model the past, the future gonna model you
So what from this era are you tellin' the future it has to do?
When the future looks back, will they really respect or laugh at you?
These are the real questions that real life will be asking you
But if you distracted by the temptations that they flashin' youYou won't see the opportunities that steady passin' you
This is why despite despite their criticisms I bring the class to you
Because culture ain't about now, it's about who comes after you
(Chorus)

Think bigger
Think bigger
Think love

(Verse 2)

Hear me on this second take
KRS is never fake
Go ahead get your dinner plate
But let me now get somethin' straight
Ain't nobody hatin' on you youngins how you do your do
But you too young to see how these corporations are usin' youCulturally abusing you, pickin' and choosin' youProgrammin' your mind through the music lines you cruisin' to
Think about the future you, the higher you, the super you
Or will the future you turn out to only be the stupid you?
Knowledge reigns supreme learn this theme it never goes away
The culture keeper, the teacher, this what I'm supposed to say
There's got to be a better way to hear our music every day
B-boys gettin' blown away but comin' outside anyway
We tried again outside in Cedar Park
Power from a street light made the place dark
But yo we didn't care, we turned it out
I don't know if you understand what I'm talkin' about
Remember Bronx River pullin' triggers countin' figures pourin' liquorLyric spitter shake and shiver glam and glitter
The mic mixer
I'm just a party ripper
OJ vodka sipper
Here's a little advice: think bigger
(Chorus)

Think bigger
Think bigger
Think bigger
Think love
Think peace
Think life
Think free
Think bigger

When you're near, something in me reacts and there's no defense
I don't mind if everybody's saying that this ain't real
All that matters is how this feels

I'm falling deeper, so fill up my cup
Nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
I know I should, but it's so good, I'm nevеr gonna give it up
'Cause nothing tastes sweetеr than mad love
Oh

A velvet rush is running through mad veins
Like adrenaline, a kiss from you and I'm going so insane
I don't mind if everybody's saying that this ain't real
All that matters is how this feels
I'm falling deeper, so fill up my cup
Nothing tastes sweeter than my love
I know I should, but it's so good, I'm never gonna give it up
'Cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love

I'm falling deeper, so fill up my cup
Nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
I know I should, but it's so good, I'm never gonna give it up
'Cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love

Evita, Evita, Evita, Evita, Evita, Evita, Evita

[Verse 1]
It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

[Verse 2]
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance (Don't keep your distance)

[Verse 3]
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I shall not leave you
Though it may get harder for you to see me
I'm Argentina (I'm Argentina)
And always will be

[Bridge]
Oh-oh, so I chose freedom
Oh, Argentina
Oh, don't cry for me
Evita, Evita, Evita, Evita, Evita, Evita, Evita

[Verse 4]
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I shall not leave you
Though it may get harder for you to see me
I'm Argentina (I'm Argentina)
I'm Argentina
Don't cry for me

[Post-Chorus]
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know that every word is true

[Outro]
I'm Argentina (I'm Argentina)
I'm Argentina

[Intro]
You won't believe me (You won't believe me)
I had to let it happen (I had to let it happen)
So I chose freedom (So I chose freedom)

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

[Post-Chorus]
I love you and hope you love me

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I shall not leave you
Though it may get harder for you to see me
I'm Argentina (I'm Argentina)
And always will be (Be)

[Post-Chorus]
So I chose freedom
I'm Argentina
Don't cry for me

Niggas they really be cappin', they ain't 'bout that action
That cash in the envelope
Me and my niggas be ballin' like Spartan

Big Draco, I blow that Glock like a whistle

Big Draco, he rose outta concrete

I catch me an opp and I turn on the lunch meat
I'm in the studio, tell 'em to punch me

Brought that .57 on me, you know I came bared down
Bitchin' on opps, better share my bag 'round
If you drop on an opp, know I'm spinnin', I'm spinnin' back 'round
Try to spin on the game, why bother?
Bustin' that Glock since a toddler
I got that aim from my father
Big Draco, he put his wrist in the water (No cap)
Fifty-five thousand, I spend it on Carti'
I catch an opp in the club, we gon' shoot
Big Draco,

Young nigga

Lyrics from snippet

Keep it up
I ain't strong enough
I was so boo'd up, got me so screwed up
Why wish you all of the best?
Even though he with the bitch now
I get emotional, inside I shut it off

...

...done for you
See, last night, he called on accident
Heard you fuckin' on the other end
It's too late, we'll never be the same again
Too late, never be the same again

[Chorus]
There's a black crow flying up the river
It's a long way back downhill
Will the silence be forgiver?
Maybe time will tell

[Verse 1]
Your daddy wants you to love him
Wants you to love a man
If you keep your arms around me
It could ruin the plan
So you draw a line between us
When to stop and when to start
We come together
And then you pull us apart

[Chorus]
There's a black crow flying up the river
It's a long way back downhill
Will the silence be forgiver?
Maybe time will tell

[Verse 2]
Chicago couldn't hold you
New York City, your childhood home
California
You found a place to live alone
And your mamma wants you to hold hеr
She wants you to take her hand
Talk to hеr
She'll come to understand

But because of fear, because of fear you draw the line between us
You say when to stop and when to start
We come together
And then you take us apart
And your daddy, your daddy he wants you to love him
By loving a man
And if you, if you keep your arms around me
It could ruin the plan

[Chorus]
There's a black crow flying up the river
It's a long way back downhill
Will the silence be forgiver?
Maybe time will tell

[Instrumental bridge]

[Outro]
There's a black crow flying up the river
It's a long way back downhill

[Verse 1]
I told, I told, ayy-ayy, I told you
Up in the thump thump, morning uh
Let you see
*Harmonizing*
Round and out, down and back
Down and back
For a step, for a stack
For a pack, for that black
Get them back, all is black
All is dead, all is good
All this name, all is good
Honestly, all this 

[?], all this money
All the clothes, autographed
Autographed, all of that, all the stacks
I'm on that, I'll be back
I'll be taking all the stacks oh

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
Who can I make that them better right now?
Who, oh I know that'll make it better right now?
Who do I know that'll make 'em better right now?
Who do you know?

[Chorus: Kanye West]

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
Oooh, who can I run to?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just wanna feel liberated I, I, I
I just wanna feel liberated I, yeah
If I ever instigated I, I
Tell me who will never related, I

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Fuck it though, here's a FYI
Fuck you this evening, at Southside
Wait a minute, don't leave
By, the way, how your family, forgot
I don't give a fuck about your family or not
Back it up, back it up, oh oh
Back it up, back it up, oh oh
Back it up, back it up, oh oh
Back it up, I'm, I'm
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my my, my life

[Outro: Caroline Shaw]
How can I find you?
Who do you turn to?
Why do I blind you?

[Intro: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and-

[Verse 1]
Take the jab, take the vax, take a vote
Just- just do it, just do it
You'll be fine, just do it, take a jab, just do it
Just- just do it
Imma Lemmon Pepper Lou it
Imma-
This ain't even in the constitution
They keep you from your bread like ya allergic to the gluten
"Everybody do it", fuck what everybody doing
They couldn't take me out
Shadow-ban, they tried to mute it
Now it's pimpin' won't he will
Pimpin' won't he do it
Taking drugs to work sound like legal prostitution
And they say it's simulation
First, they said it's evolution
Science switch it up soon as n***as catch up to it
I do it

[Chorus]
Are you sure?
Are you sure?

[Bridge]
Yeah
It's five in the morning and I'm up microdosing on shrooms, shrooms
Yeah, I thought that I was outside
But I'm still here inside my room, room

[Verse 2]
I'll trust a bitch, 'fore I mm-, 'fore I ever mm-
'Fore I ever trust a congressman, a senator, the POTUS
Take your pick
I'll never trust the same motherfucker gave you crack, gave you projects, gave you smallpox
Can you read the room, n***a
I can hear these walls talk
It’s a farm, big pharma locked the barn off
When I use my sixth-sense
This is not a coin toss
Controlled opposition
Get you scared, unsure, that's the lure
Start a virus, sell the cure, reassure
It's a zoo, Sun Tzu, Art Of War

[Chorus]
Are you sure?
Police State, already here
Are you sure?
Metaverse, already here
Are you sure?
Man, what the fuck we talking about?
Are you sure?
FEMA camps 'cept you locked in your house
Are you sure?

[Outro]
Why you? trust science, don't be stupid, just, well
Make music, make music
Why you? trust science don't be stupid, don't be stupid
Make music, make- make music

[Verse 1]
I found a reason to wake up
Coffee in my cup, start a new day
Wish we could do this forever
And never remember mistakes that we made

[Pre-Chorus]
I told you I loved you when we were just friends
You kept me waiting and I hated you then
Gave it a few a years, you settled your debts
But I never got over the secrets I kept

[Chorus]
It all works out in the end
Wherever you go, that's whеre I am
Boulders turn into sand
Wherеver you go, that's where I am

[Verse 2]
Now when I wait in your doorway
Covered in flowers, I think of her
The woman that you once dated
I couldn't relate to her glitter and furs

[Pre-Chorus]
Who were you then and who is she now?
Did she know that we were together somehow?
You never touched me, but I felt you everywhere

[Chorus]
It all works out in the end
Wherever you go, that's where I am
Even boulders turn into sand
Wherever you go, that's where I am

[Post-Chorus]
That's where I am
That's where I am

[Bridge]
No, I'll never find another, no one else can do it better
When we're together it feels like heaven
You're the only one I ever wanted
All I ever really wanted was you
No, I'll never find another, no one else can do it better
When we're together it feels like heaven
You're the only one I ever wanted
All I ever really wanted was you

[Chorus]
It all works out in the end
Wherever you go, that's where I am
Even boulders turn into sand
Wherever you go, that's where I am

[Post-Chorus]
That's where I am
(You're the only one I ever wanted)
(All I ever really wanted was you)
That's where I am
(You're the only one I ever wanted)
(All I ever really wanted was you, was you)
That's where I am
(You're the only one I ever wanted)
(All I ever really wanted was you)
That's where I am
(You're the only one I ever wanted)
(All I ever really wanted was you)
That's where I am

[Outro]
Ooh

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
True love shouldn't be this complicated
Thought I'd die in your arms
I thought I'd die in your—
True love shouldn't be this complicated
Thought I'd die in your arms
I thought I'd die in your—
True love shouldn't be this complicated
Thought I'd die in your arms
I thought I'd die in your—
True love shouldn't be this complicated
Thought I'd die in your arms
I thought I'd die in your—

[Verse: Kanye West]
No hard feelings, but these feelings harder
When I think about it, my eyes fill up with water
Don't have our daughters butterfly while they larvae
Wait, when you see the kids? I'll see y'all tomorrow
Wait, when the sun set? I see y'all tomorrow
Wait, when I pick 'em up, I feel like they borrowed
When I gotta return them, scan 'em like a bar code
Wait, no hard feelings, but these feelings hard though
Wait, who got the kids in those "What are those?"
Wait, why they can't wear Yeezys with the cargos?
Y’all know Nike don't like me, y'all take it too far, though
At least have 'em in some Mike's, he played for Chicago
I only see three kids, who watchin' Chicago?
And you know all the nannies said, "Daddy in Nebrasko"
Let the kids dig a tunnel to my house like Chapo
Only neighbor in the hood with a door they can knock on
I leave the light on

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Kanye West]
True love (Daddy's not gone) shouldn't be this complicated
(You see the light on)
Thought I'd die in your arms (Daddy's at home)
I thought I'd die in your— (Tell Gekyume)
True love (Daddy's not gone) shouldn't be this complicated (Tell Gekyume)
Thought I'd die in your arms (Daddy's at home)
I thought I'd die in your—

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, woah
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, woah (Love)
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, woah
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, woah

[Verse 1]
My eyes are burning from all the smoke in L.A
And I wanna kiss you all the time but I pushed you away
Now I'm feeling homesick for a boy that I never meant to fall for
I'm so sorry that it played out this way

Mmh

[Verse 2]
There's something coming, I can feel it in the win
And I wanna pin it down before I see you so I know what it is
But I think that that's impossible, I know that I'm a control freak
So I'll have to live with it

[Chorus]
And I'm running out of fires to set
I miss you, it's getting bad again
Ooh

[Verse 3]
My eyes are burning, but I've been crying all night
Can't blame the smoke, there's no use, 'cause tired excuses don't hold up in a fight
And it's so exhausting, but it's fine
'Causе I'm sorry I wanna make you right

[Chorus]
And I'm running out of fires to set
I miss you, it's gеtting bad again

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, oh

What's gonna happen if I stay?
Who else could make me feel this way?

[Outro]
My eyes are burning from all the smoke in L.A
And I wanna kiss you all the time but I pushed you away
Assuming it's day and night
We're running out of time, won't you take my hand?
Into my skyline
So it's just a rebirth
But I soar through those fears when you take my hand
The passenger side

[Intro]
There is no escaping (Yo)
There's no place to hide (Ayo)
You scream, "Someone save me!" (Yo)
But they don't pay no mind (Ayo)
Goodnight, goodbye!

[Verse 1]
You're walkin' down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the mornin' and you're in a
Nightmare, it's horrible, right there's the coroner
Waiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya
You're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea, he just saw ya run
All you want is to rest 'cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit, while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowin' a Klonopin while I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn, holding onto the pill bottle, then
Lick my finger and swirl it 'round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at McDonald's with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must've just blacked out again—not again!

[Chorus]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em

[Verse 2]
Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube, maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana then
I reach for the aloe and lanolin, bust all over the wall panellin'
Dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantel and
Grab my flannel and my bandana, then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causin' illusions again, brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin, razors, scissors, and pins
Jesus, when does it end? Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who gave these molecules to
Me, what am I gon' do?
Hey, the prodigal son, the diabolical one
Very methodical when I slaughter them

[Chorus]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em

[Bridge]
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

[Verse 3]
I cut and I slash, slice and gash, last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half-pint of the Jack, my last Vic and-a-half
A flashlight up Kim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December, I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin' tub, cut him up into pieces
And just when I went to drink his blood
I thought, "I oughta drink his bathwater, that oughta be fun"
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery, son
Your blood-curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here, man, there's got to be one
Oh no, there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs
But ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up, 'cause…

[Chorus]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em

[Outro]
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil… rise)
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil… rise)
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil… rise)
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil… rise)
(Evil… rise)
(Evil… rise)

[Intro]
What should I sing about?
I don't know what to sing about

[Verse 1]
I'm confused about life
I went to the therapist and she turned into my wife
(I don't know what I'm doing)
And everyone is singing
Why am I bringing my baggage
Into the party?
Is it because I fell in love with a...
Horse? (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I fell in love with the horse
I fell in love with the horse

[Verse 2]
It stomped on me
It's bestiality
It's a weird thing to do
But it's something that I couldn't help but do

[Chorus]
I fell in love with the horse

[Outro]
That's all
Ahh
Eh

[Intro: Kanye West with Stalone]
The author of "Raising Kanye" and a world traveler with her son, please welcome Dr. Donda West
Forever, yeah
Can you hear me? Yeah
Forever, yeah
Forever, forever, no
Gloria, glory, glory, glory
Glory, glory, glory, glory

[Spoken Word: Donda West, Kanye West, Kanye West & Stalone]
It feels good to be home
And to all of you, I thank you so much for your support
For your support of me for so many years
And more importantly, for the work you continue to do
What do you want me to talk about?
Well, he said something that was a little bit dangerous
He told me I could talk about anything I wanted to
And you know, I am my son's mother
The man I describе in the introduction as being so decidеdly different
My son (When you're runnin' outta time and you're not outta time)
And what made the project extra special to me is
I got a chance to share not only what he has meant to me
But what he has meant to a generation (Change the time)
As one writer said, we came from somewhere
Not just from the wombs of our mothers and the seeds of our fathers
But from a long line of generations who came before us

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)

[Refrain: Kanye West with Stalone & Donda West]
Forever, yeah
Forever, yeah
Forever, forever, no
Gloria, glory, glory, glory
What did I teach him? (Glory)
And why Kanye ain't scared?

[Verse: Kanye West and Pusha T]
I'd rather deal with the shame than take the weight of the lie
Every time we talk, I just wait for the lies
Every time I get the food, I just wait for the flies
Send my prayers up, I'm just waitin' on the skies
My, my, my, Miss American Pie
Was a hero after Katrina but that levee went dry
Mom met my dad back in '75
Two years later, the chosen has arrived
Holy, Holy, Holy Father
Hold me in an ocean worth of Holy Water
Hold my gemstones, this is my mancala
Fire and brimstone, now they got manginas
When the world built on lies, the truth is a threat
Faith over the fortune, it got me outta debt
It's snakes in money pits that I ain't found yet
Crooks behind the scene like, "He ain't drown yet?"
Rain bills from the ranch 'til the whole town wet
God's grace rains down, that's the holy fountain
Got twelve thousand acres full of holy mountains
See, I almost didn't make it, who am I without Him?
Holy, Holy, Holy Father, hold me in a ocean the size of Holy Water
If plan A worked, I wouldn't know my daughters
Man, every tear I cried in South Carolina

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)
Everybody told me I was falling in love
I said, you would fall too
If you knew what I was dreaming of
Everybody told me I was stupid, because
You were bad, you were wrong and I knew it

Cause you were there for me to love and care for me

Mama, mama, you know I love you
Oh you know I love you, mama
Mama, you're the queen of my heart
Lovin' you is like food to my soul

Yes it is, yes it is

[Chorus]
Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it, heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it, all in it, all in it

[Verse 1]
If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times, the times you got back up, woah
You'd be a billionaire in a year
That's what you gotta think ‘til you're there, on the regular

[Pre-Chorus]
If you got a diamond for all of your passion
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion
Gotta go hard, yeah
That's all I'm condoning, love is a component
You're the only opponent, gotta seize the moment

[Chorus]
And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it, heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you'rе all in it, all in it, all in it
Gonna give each time
‘Til thе water runs dry
Oh, don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it, all in it, all in it
Oh, woah
All in it, all in it

[Verse 2]
If I had a guitar missing five strings?
A guitar with only one string, I can only play one song, ooh
A simple melody, simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing, you know what I mean

[Pre-Chorus]
If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion
Gotta go hard, yeah
That's all I'm condoning, love is a component
You're the only opponent, gotta seize the moment (Gotta seize the moment)

[Chorus]
And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it, heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it (In), all in it (In), all in it (In)
Gonna give each time

‘Til the water runs dry
Oh, don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it, all in it, all in it
I would love a man, if my genes were just a little different
I would love a man, and not think twice at all
When I loved that man, like any woman loves her lover
I would love a man, now if I could just love you

I would wed a girl, if I was just a little less married
I would wed a girl, if I could ever be anywhere on time
I would wed a girl, but there’d be a mistress at the altar
I would wed a girl, now if I could just wed you

If everything I’ve sung ‘til now is false, pleasе let this one be truе
If everything I’ve sung 'til now is false, you can tell 'em
“This one’s true”

I would wed a horse, if I was just a little more lonely
I would love that horse, if I’d been exiled from mankind
I would love that horse, and I would take comfort in its presence
I would love a horse, now do you still love me?

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I wanna be a billionaire so, so bad

I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Next to Oprah and the Queen

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh, every time I close my eyes (every time baby)

Lyrics from snippet:

Strong shoulders
Cold waters
Tryna bring me down
Yeah they wanna
Be noticed and I saw it
That's why I don't acknowledge
And they've reached a wall
'Cause they've got nothing nice to say
I'm crazy, yeah that's just what this game made me
I may need to replace these dumb faces
And maybe I need to refrain from the people who won't let me remain me
But I'm gonna still remain me

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda with Mark Wakefield]
My third eye sees pain
My mind finds blackness
And this' the box of liars
Thieves and those of slackness
Wish for vision
Aggression, my decision
Collision, step-child of continents division (Division)
And then the prison gave way beneath my feet
Down I fall into, all my eyes and skies meet
‘Til I stop (Stop)
Locked out the rusty gates of heaven
Recorded sins one out of seven

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield with Mike Shinoda]
I had my doubts ever since the first day
(And you can’t find help at the bottom)
I had my doubts since the very first day

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
My third eye cr-

[Verse 1]
She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing
I’m from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

[Verse 2]
I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories

[Chorus]
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

[Bridge]
Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me

[Instrumental]
(One time)

[Chorus]
Don’t you know?
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

[Outro]
I lost my heart (Lost my heart)
I lost (On the carousel)
I lost my girl (To a circus girl)
Who left my heart in pieces
(Lost my heart) Lost my heart
(On the carousel) Lost my girl (To a circus girl)
Who ran away
I lost (Lost my heart)
I lost my girl (On the carousel)
Ooh, oh, lost, oh, lost (To a circus girl)
I lost
I lost my heart (Lost my heart)
I lost (On the carousel)
I lost my girl (To a circus girl)
And on my mind
Take it slow, girl
Cause ‘til you know, girl
'Cause things get crazy upon that road girl

Hey, you are the one thing
It would be that I just

I, I, I, I want you, you, you now
Now I, I, I, I want you, you, you now
Now I, I, I, I want you, you, you now

Ain't no 

[?]
And ain't no promise
And all that drama, girl
Don't let it get in our way
Let's take it easy, oh
Lyrics from snippet:

Nothing's making me feel right
Feeling so lost in sight
And I can't see now
We now don't belong

Oh, but I'm stuck up in the moment and I
Cannot seem to break it
Cause I'm lost and I'm confused and I'm alone
Snippet #1:

[Chorus]
Love it when we're lovey dovey

Snippet #2:

The crazy kinda love that you can’t buy
So glad that I decided to give love a try
Come with me, run with me
Heart was locked and you know that I had the key
Lyrics from snippets:

Oh, oh-oh, oh whoa, oh-oh
Just see you naked
Oh, oh-oh, oh whoa, oh-oh
Just see you naked

Pull me, I can’t get enough
And when she do that dance
I’m a hell of a fan
Gotta give me the chance
To show you all of me
Open the door I got to
Lyrics from snippet:

— friends
But you ain't gotta say no more
I can't do this no more
You know you can't believe it
You know I want you to be there for a reason
I love you darling
I just can't get you off my mind
I…

Lyrics from what Justin sung w/ Forbes:

So I'm asking you to put your hand in mine
Start this whole thing off right now no wasting time
So gotta let you know
You're the one
You're the one
When it's all said and done
You're the one
You're the one
So gotta let you know
I remember when I ain't want it
I play harder, they hooked on the phonics
Call me like Lauryn, in the 90s the Laurent is on me
You gon' die on the hill of your choice
I still hear the voices
I'm a Pisces, part of me still in a void
Fishy, annoyed, my inhibitions destroyed
Tapped in, locked in with my little boy
I would lead you to the river, I can't sip it for you
Never lead with indecision, never leave the homies
Unless it's time to leave the homies
It's all pressure, god-level, cause that's what they wanted
I'm secreting something different, the bitches get on me
Pick up sticks, we got next to whichever opponent
We on next, blessed, don't get beheaded this summer
Cross the line, double back then put everything on it
It's all in the road
The family focused, my wingspan is the globe
I'm glad to be home
I had to get over, I had to get low
I'm in the house, I keep a bag packed by the door
Like Batman, I get the signal then I'm adios
The last laugh is for the niggas always in the know
The fast cash was for the bitches & expensive clothes
The fat sack is for the chill i had to bring it home

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, they think that I’m afraid to fall
But you know that I ain’t afraid at all
Yeah, they think that I’m afraid to fall
But you know that I ain’t afraid at all

[Chorus]
I ain’t afraid at all, oh
I ain’t afraid at all, oh
I ain’t afraid at all, oh
I ain’t afraid at all, oh

And the way that you move, I just cannot resist you

Just do that thing that drives me crazy, that drives me crazy
Bad girl, bad girl, drop it down low right now girl
Just do that thing that drives me crazy, that drives me crazy

I think it’s hard tryna figure out who we wanna be
It’s so true, I’m so weak
‘Cause I know what’s meant to be is going to be, oh

[Chorus]
Like places we are headed
Well I believe it’s heaven

And love don’t make sense when it’s empty, oh no

[Verse 2]
Focus ain’t the same
If the picture ain’t got you in it
In every line my
Emotions ain’t the same
If it ain’t about you, I don’t get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you
I mean that so literally
Don’t nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, whoa

[Chorus]
It don’t make sense, no

If I believe in love

Then we gotta learn to trust right now

[Verse 1]
Don’t let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don’t wanna be left with the question, why?
Let’s be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes the heart can see
What’s invisiblе to the eye
All you gotta do is listеn to your deepest feelings
They don’t ever lie
Giving up is immature
Got so much more to live for
They don’t wanna see us together now
‘Cause we’re strong enough to endure, whoa

If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we could be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us

Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer
Some people separate, yeah
Don’t think we should separate
And we both adore one another
You’re a dream come true
We could start over brand new
That’s what we ought to do, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes the heart can see
What’s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don’t ever lie
Giving up is immature, oh
Got so much more to live for, oh
They don’t wanna see us together now, oh
‘Cause we’re strong enough to endure, whoa

Feel the adrenaline moving under my skin

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: "Home is where the heart is."
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand this
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remain
‘Causе all the rest dead; is thеre a spot for us to roll?
If you find it, I'll be right behind it, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm runnin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream "Peace!" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, uh

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place that’s right for me
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Uh
Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang

[?] there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place at thug's mansion

[...]
Asked the best MILF what she had for lunch
Better put her breast milk in my Cap'n Crunch

[Verse 1]
The sky is blue with star-shine
Nothing to do that won't hurt to ease my mind
Just thinking of you in the sunshine
Do you think of me too? Does it hurt, or are you feeling fine?

[Chorus]
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary

[Verse 2]
In my dream last night I was dying
Only one part could come to life again
The portal door opened
I chose my heart, though it was broken

[Chorus]
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary

[Verse 3]
On a day as bright as velvet
High in the deep, a ghost with a matchstick
Told me a secret
I tell you now that I swore to keep it

[Chorus]
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary

[Verse 4]
The sky is blue with star-shine
Nothing to do that won't hurt to ease my mind
Just thinking of you in the sunshine
Do you think of me too? Does it hurt, or are you feeling fine?

[Intro]
Hey- Hey, man, check this out, mane
It's Big Snoop coming at you live and direct, and Imma speak on some real issues right now, mane
'Cuz motherfuckers be hatin' on a real nigga like me, and I don't do nuthin' but do what I'm supposed to be doin', you know what I'm sayin'?
But I don't crack a plank and say "nigga, why you hatin' on me?" or try to, you know, make friends with motherfuckers who don't wanna be my friends
Motherfuck you ain't, you bitch ass nigga!

[Verse 1]
I guess it's the thing
Now, they used to hate on us
Pull out your cannon, come through, and spray on us
Laying the cut, but Dogg can see a mutt
You know, that's just how I used to fuck with the big old butt
You think I ain't know? You ain't had to tell me, cuz
I appreaciate the love, but you know how it was
Man, I really couldn't, even though I probably should do it
Slap the bitch and put some hot cap into it
She didn't know I knew it
She used to fuck with that bitch nigga Suge in '96 and '97
My young homeboy from the LPT
You know I'm high and connected with some niggas from the CPT
So when the hate is on, I get the message faster than y'all
Step into my reppin' I keep my weapon revolved
I keep the problems resolved
I've been finessing these broads
I love breaking Suge Knight and his bros (Ha ha)
Just like breaking the laws
I used to have his baby momma like taking it off
I'm taking it all
Lil' nasty bitch was licking my balls
She's taking it all
And you can't do nothin' 'bout it 'cuz she breaking me off
Keep the bitch nuttin', so it really was nothin'
I said, fuckin' it up
You's a hater, bitch nigga!
Remember! I'm the one that make you rich, nigga

[Verse 2]
And I started from scratch, and put you back on the map
And I ain't lookin' back, but I keep hearing shit from your staff
I giggle and laugh (ha ha ha ha ha), cuz you said you can't stand me
Your whole rap label is a disfunctional family (family)
And then you try to hate on me
'Cuz I'm straight blowing up
I'm banging on your bitch ass and two O's is what I'm throwing up
I seen you at BET, with the homies from the LBC (Whaddup!)
You broke down 'cuz you didn't want to see me (Huh? What's happenin'?)
It's so easy
To crack you
'Cuz I keep some people with you around, you at you (at you)
I had to pimp slap you
I'm a legend in this town, they gone make me a statue

All this bullshit, I feel like Michael Jordan
But I ain't trippin, I'm just soarin'
Open up the door and
Doing big touring
Fuck champagne, I'm back to 40 oz pouring
Are you adoring the shit that I'm doing?
'Cuz if you ain't, fuck you and your motherfucking crew, nigga

[Chorus]
Hatin' on me? I hate you (Hate you, too!)
(This is for the hater in you, nigga!) (Sycamore)
(If you keep on talking shit you gone make me gang bang)
(This is for the hater in you, nigga!)
(But Imma let you slide, so get your shit together!)

Niggas! Stop hatin' on us
Bitches! (haters) Stop hatin' on us
Death Row! (haters) Stop hatin' on us
Suge Knight! (haters) Stop hatin' on us
All you, (haters) stop hatin' on us

[Outro]
Look here, mane!
I'm sick of you motherfuckers hatin' the game, mane!
You're s'pposed to hate the player, not the game
Y'all hating the game, mane
You know what I'm talkin' about?
It was so cold, mane
Is that, you know, a motherfucker can't stop seeing me
They turn to BET, I'm on BET
I'm on MTV, I'm on the E! Channel, with the girls goin' wild
I'm on the radio station, I'm on the movie screen
I'm selling tennis shoes, I'm selling donuts
Policies, 

[?] and everything up!
You know what I'm talkin' about?
You can't avoid me, nigga!
I'm the motherfucking Magic Johnson of rap!
Motherfucker, I got things sold up while y'all in 

[?] up
You bitch ass niggas! Y'all hatin' on a real nigga like me
You even seen my billboard over there by your record label, huh?
You see me up there, real big, yeah! In a real flamboyant way!
You see the 'Beautiful' single blowin' up! All in your motherfucking mouth
A nigga flew to Brazil, cracked some brand new hoes and kept it real, and showed you how to flip the game
While you, niggas, still ain't put out no music since I left
I mean, what the fuck is going on, mane?
You so busy hatin' on me, you ain't put out a hit record
Then I see you on the front of a motherfucking magazine, yeah, on the front of a cover
And you was talking shit about Puff back in the days, about being on covers and shit
Nigga, now you doing the same thing!
You hypocrite-ass, bitch-ass, snitch-ass nigga!
You's a bitch, nigga, and Imma take it to your face, nigga!
You's a hoe!
And, by the way, your baby mamma sucks some good dick, Suge
And on some real shit, cuz, you know what's happenin'
I'm just gonna crip on
Yeah

[Chorus]
(This is for the hater in you, nigga!) Yeah
Yeah, stop hatin' on us
(If you keep on talking shit you gone make me gang bang)
Stop hatin' on us
(This is for the hater in you, nigga!)
Some exclusive shit! Welcome to tha Chuuch volume 1
Told you I was gonna take over this motherfucker
(But Imma let you slide, so get your shit together!)

The world is mine, mane!
And everything in it! (Everything, everything)
It's mine! (It's mine! It's mine!)
Wanna play rough? (Wanna play rough? Wanna play rough?)
I didn't think so! (Think so! Think so!)

Fucking hater!
Forgive yesterday
I chewed today uh huh
No stories , no fever, yeah
I chew today uh huh

We built
Castle up by castle up by castle up
On air
Ah yeah

Forgive yesterday oo hoo
I chew today uh huh
I chew

We built
Castle up by castle up by castle up
On air
Ah yeah
I broke the whole world down
Too late to slow down now
I'm not the man you've been listening
I was trained to stick to the mission
I was trained to keep it on track

I was asleep like a child
I walked the idiot mile
I flinched at the switchblade switchin' in
I did good, I stayed out of the kitchen
I did good, I kept it on track

Hey, look in the mirror
Ain't gonna write your wrongs with a stupid love song

I lived my whole damn life
I kept my mission tight
Send my message to the chief, say:
I did good, I stayed out of the heat
I did good, I kept it on track
I was trained to stick to the mission
I was trained, I kept it on track
Hey, look in the mirror
Ain't gonna write your wrongs
With a stupid love song
1, 2, 3, 4, can I just have a little more
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, I love you
A, B, C, D, can I bring my friends to tea
E, F, G, H, I, J, I love you

Yeah, yeah, sail the ship
Aha, chop the tree
Whoa, skip the row
Yeah, look at me

All together, now together...

Black, white, green, red
Can I take my friend to bed
Pink, brown, yellow, orange and blue
I love you

All together, now together...

Sail the ship
Chop that tree
Skip that row
Everybody look at me, look at me
All together, now together...

[Verse 1]
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus]
So put your rose-colorеd glasses on
And party on

[Chorus]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dancе, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Verse 2]
Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Bridge]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song (Oh-oh-oh)
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
(Like a wasted zombie)
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm (Chained to the rhythm)

[Outro]
It goes on, and on, and on (It goes)
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on, and on
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm

[Verse 1]
Search for what'll set you free
It's not 2017 anymore
So you trust in a guy like me
To give you everything in store

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll be ridin' 'round drop-top when it gets hot
Doin' donuts in an empty lot like "Woah"
I'll give you the finer things
Suddenly there's nothing worth comparin' to your soul

[Chorus]
Where do we go? Where do we stand?
In between a quick romance, somethin' that'll last long
Where do we go? Will you take my hand?
Meet me for a final dance, somethin' like a last call

[Verse 2]
If this is worth it, I'm guessin' that we'll both find out in the end
You show me purpose and give me presence that I've never met
In this world full of hatred, somehow I feel your innocence
I'll be patient, impatient, and I'll be patient, impatient

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll be ridin' 'round drop-top when it gets hot
Doin' donuts in an empty lot like "Woah"
I'll give you the finer things
Suddenly there's nothing worth comparin' to your soul

[Chorus]
Tell me where do we go
Where do we go? Where do we stand?
In between a quick romance, somethin' that'll last long
('Cause it don't last long, no)
Where do we go? Will you take my hand?
Meet me for a final dance, somethin' like a last call

[Bridge]
Where do we start? Where do we start?
Where do we start? Where do we start?
Where do we start? Where do we start?

[Chorus]
Tell me where do we go
Where do we go? Where do we stand?
In between a quick romance, somethin' that'll last long
Where do we go? Will you take my hand?
Meet me for a final dance, somethin' like a last call
Would you just listen to my body
Not the jumble of words coming out of my mouth
I can tell you the whole story
With just my moves as we shake through the night
Don’t you worry about nothing
We'll take good care of each other
I’m not afraid of nothing
That's just how I’m feeling

Would you be ready for it if I just said it like it is
Could you trust my vision
Would you just take a little risk
It could be bliss

And I don’t wanna fool around
Waiting for you to call me
Call me
I just wanna sit you down
And tell you what you mean to me

Would you be ready for it if I just said it like it is
Could you trust my vision
Would you just take a little risk
It could be bliss
Like some kind of heaven
And I don’t want to fool around
I just wanna do it all to you right now
And you’re quite something
It’s quite a magical thing
And I am running until the morning when you pick me up
Spin me all around
I didn’t journey for nothing
You’ve got it all in your hands
It’s me, I know you’ve been calling

And I don’t wanna fool around
Waiting for you to call me
Call me
I just wanna sit you down
And tell you what you mean to me

Would you be ready for it if I just said it like it is
Could you trust my vision
Would you just take a little risk
It could be bliss
Like some kind of heaven
And I don't wanna fool around
I just wanna do it all to you right now

Stacked up

And set it
Set it all on fire, set it all 'cause I just can't stand anymore

Parked by street lights

How can you tell you're living, not me?
How can you tell it's only a dream?
Suddenly, there's a boy in the rain alone
Suddenly, there's a girl in the ran alone

[Verse 2]
Yeah, how can you tell you're living, not me?
How can you tell it's only a dream?
Suddenly, there's a boy in the rain alone

How can you tell it's only a dream?
Suddenly, there's a boy in your heart, oh boy

First they dropped Covid, then they dropped Kobe
Ever lost a loved one? I send my condolence
Curve won’t flatten, it got osteoporosis
I see the thru the bogus, then I roll a (Then I roll a)
Roll a stogie, tighter than ya Clothes is
All I see is red flags, I feel like a postman
All the right actors in all the right poses
If I ask for hookah, tell me where the hoes is
They told me I grow up being entrepreneur hey
Who woulda thought that meant sitting in front of computers hey
I’m bout my bread and my cheese like a charcuterie tray
Came from the future, should've been born sooner, ah

[Chorus]
Stay inside where it’s safe (Return to your homes)
In the hood niggas die every whichaway
They just tell when to come when to stay
Ya dirty ass shudda washed ya hands anyway

[Post Chorus]
Wife the bitch that y'all thought that I was gonna fuck over anyway
And she still fuck you anyway

(Apologies there appears to be data corruption)

[Verse 2]
Fools, foolish, foolio
Is it sacred geometry, or is it computer code
Either ya own master or slave to this future hope
Is really progress or slavery 2.0?
Ice wall cube to keep the computer cool
Processors over heated had to stop do a full reboot
Technology do the same thing your body do
They drop some VR goggles motherfuckers like Oooooo

Stay inside where it’s safe
In the hood niggas die every whichaway
They just tell when to come when to stay
Ya dirty ass should've washed ya hands anyway

[Chorus]
What you do before you enter the game? Create a player, hold on (Hold on, hold on, hold on...)
What you do when you forget it's a game? Hate the creator, hold on (Hold on, hold on, hold on...)
And what they say you gotta do in this world? Make some paper, hold on (Hold on, hold on, hold on...)
And what's the mothafucking city you wrote? Decatur (Huh, yah, tuh)

[Verse 1]
So who are you? Found my brain a paradox, grew my locks, who are you?
They predicted nine eleven forty years 'fore they dropped
Tell me how it's a prediction if they wrote a whole plot
Don't know who bеhind the curtain, could be bots at the top
Thе invasion been happened, the bodies already swapped
Like how we breed dogs, cities could just all be crops
A million of the same person with identical drops
Could be on someone's hard drive on top of a desk
Either way, shh, shh, never really know 'till you're dead
How come what you make a year's never more than your debt
It's like a carrot hanging over your head
Niggas said it's in the air, huh? Call 

[?] I'll be like Aha, uh
See a doctor he like "I can see you nigga you ain't got no insurance", yeah
They paying folks to sit in line for a free test
Ain't gotta decode my lines, this a cheat test, this a cheat test
Take a deep breath, buckle up the seat belt

[Chorus]
What you do before you enter the game? Create a player, hold on (Hold on, hold on, hold on...)
What you do when you forget it's a game? Hate the creator, hold on (Hold on, hold on, hold on...)
And what they say you gotta do in this world? Make some paper, hold on (Hold on, hold on, hold on...)

Uh, is it just me? Or is artificial intelligence mimicking melanin
What if melanated people was somebody's experiment?
They hid the ancient temples, then just blamed it on aliens
Nasa stole they symbols from a african tribe
And acted like it was some shit that they just seen up in the sky
Knew my school wasn't shit, had us reading them lies
And had our asses drinking milk for lunch at 10:45 AM
EMF through your body, iron in your body
Silicone in your body, similar to robotics
I put the, I put the qi in Fibonacci
Artificial work at a artificial job, paying artificial taxes to a artificial god
If they clone me they fucked around and made a iller Bob
Came a long way from bumping Crime Mob
Computers resemble humans, and humans resemble niggas
Niggas resemble god, my ex just got a new nigga, he kinda resemble Bob
I guess we copies of a copy of a copy of a copy in the circle
I serve a different purpose
If this is a game then I'm from a different server
Consider this the merger, I put it in her cervix, then put it in her cervix
Parallel universes, OK

[Verse 1]
Woke up after a session, drugged my self out depression
Fuck it, go get some hookah, no bodyguards, no protection
Met a fan at the valley listening since '07
Said I changed his whole life, changed a nigga perception
Flicked it up, I gave him all the cash that I could've left him
Too much shots to recall, not much food in my belly
Belly of the beast, nothing more, nothing lesser
DMX, Makaveli, now I'm speeding riding heavy
With two ladies riding with me, so you know the vibes
Blink of an eye, 

[?]
Spun hеr with right there on 85
Retainеr wall to my left, somehow the coupe realign
How I run it 'cause this endangering lives
In my show I say "don't drink and drive, just smoke and fly"
I'm just saying it's hypocritical, that's the same word I despise
Not above or beneath you, just look for me when you need proof
Learned the most from women in my life, my mom, my sister and my wife
The girls you 

[?], the loudest be having it the least
To be honest they the biggest freaks, can't miss

[Interlude]
Can't miss, can't miss, can't miss
They know when the shot, pow, pow, can't miss
Two shot, can't miss, two shot can't miss

[Verse 2]
I really find it ironic that time's best wasted on shit that we love
That's why it's still money, hoes and drugs
Connection

Look at twin with the plug (Look at twin with the plug)
Look at twin with the plug, look at twin with the plug
All I wait for is death, I ain't scared to go to hell
At least my friends'll be there, all my friends know me well
Can't miss you anymore, toss it to the core
Now we kicking doors, ain't no 13th floor
Love struck, lust have me locked, I'm Houdini with the cuffs

Two shot, can't miss, two shot can't miss, can't miss

Pocket full of doctor Manhattans, light that gas like I'm fracking

Basic bitches be capping and capping niggas keep rapping
On B.o.B the feds got a dossier, I ain't repping Courvoisier
Got these beats think I'm Dr. Dre, keep the glee like a holiday, yeah
And I ain't hoopin' I got a big ass tech
Like Amare better study Mayan and Toltec
I said I'm solitary ain't no jokers in my deck
Hollywood had them in dresses like these niggas lost a bet
Question? Why my neighborhood oppressed
If I move into your street I make your house a price for less, yeah
My shades on 'cause I'm tearing they ass up
Fifth bottle of the 

[?] like I swear it's my last cup
I'm from Atlanta you get scammed out your last buck
But these exotic elements my pain is a abstract
Hit her from the back, she like "oh"
I thought I died and went to heaven, she like "no"
Before I hit she gotta fresh shave, potato peel
Head down 'tween her knees, it's a tornado drill

Drill, drill, drill, yeah, yeah, yeah, drill, yeah
Head down 'tween her knees shit, it's a tornado drill

Chaos niggas on my team it's triple black, black, black
Black ain't even black enough a word describe that, that, that
Yeah I'm a dog, I'm in a chain, and ain't no leash, still I'm on that tree, yah
They generate algorithms, they got all your statistics shit
While you talk it be listening and pop up ad start appearing
Similar to how your spirit show you symbols through intuition
My spirit hindred not kindred your third eye dim it look squinted
I been smoking all type of Os, the Jangos, tarantinos, call me Quentin
Religion is pulp fiction, shit you wouldn't know the difference between a
A MK ultra or a inflamed ulcer
You can't walk in my house my nigga this ain't for ya
I swear I'm with great whites deep enough to drill oil
The closest that you ever got was sea food boil
What's the most gangster shit to do in this era
Go to war with your brothers or go against your oppressors
But niggas, they ain't tryna hear that woke shit, woke shit
'Cause see it's, 'cause see it's cool to not know shit (Know shit)
And all the, the hoteps going wild, wild
Nowadays they just doing shit for more clicks (Ayy)
But sh-, but sh-, but shit is cool
I done turned down more checks you'll ever get a chance to (Ever get a chance to)
I- I bucked the system more than any nigga did this far
Niggas don't support niggas until they need at least a car
All these pro black folks discriminate the most
These favors for free, and all I got was a ghost
I said I'm full of adrenaline
Faces is grim

Guess I'm too generous
Too real a nigga, I'm just way too genuine
Fucking did it man, elements two niggas (Woooooo)

In this game we call a dream
How much longer must we sleep
I'm beginning to grow numb
Tell me how long must I wonder in this maze
If it's all inside my brain
I have no thoughts in this place
Tell me how long must I wonder through this maze
(Here in our home of planet Earth, there could be billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions stars. Billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions.)
In this game we call a dream
How much longer must we sleep
I'm beginning to grow numb
Tell me how long must I wonder in this maze
If it's all inside my brain
I have no thoughts in this place
Tell me how long must I wonder through this maze
(We could all be in a simulation, in a simulation, in a simulation, in a simulation, in a simulation, in a simulation, in a simulation, in a simulation, in a simulation, in a simulation, in a simulation, in a simulation...)
The hang dynasty

[Verse]
In this maze Stevie Wonder, in this maybe inconscious
Being this honest ain't as conducive to making commas
All the minutiae of everyday it is beginning to feel like a prison
I can't help but feeling there isn't a finish, this 

[?]
Just to circle round back to the beginning
And time is circular, I'd rather be at the center than to roam the parameter
Way too articulate, way too particular
All these meticulous details got a roll up a cylinder
Got me a barber she on a barbiturate

[Interlude]
Where are we? What the hell, is going on?

...this maze

[Chorus]
In this game we call a dream
How much longer must we sleep
I'm beginning to grow numb

Tell me how long must I wonder in this maze

Jack, I can't help but notice your respiration and heart rate have increased
I'm just excited to finally meet you Sally
There's been a pattern of insubordinate behavior recently
Yeah, I feel bad about that

Less you can shoot a three or run a route
Just don't take a knee or run your mouth
Nun but clock 'round town hеre, 'round here I got bandwidth light yеars
Buzz hard like bud light beer, disgusting bars right here
I don't even know what a planet to smoke on this plant up but I don't even know if it's canabis
They fucking up with humanity, where the fuck is the janitor, who the fuck is the management?
I say I ain't got no management, I got all of these questions and I don't know how to channel it
They call a mental insanity how I look at an object and can't tell it's inanimate
The truth, you don't know how to handle it
The whole world's a stage, to get backstage you need a laminate
Why I'm stoned it's why I stone, that's why I'm stoned to the ground
'Cause I huff, and I puff and I blow your house down, big wolf

Bad, big bad wolf, bad, bad, oooh
Bad, bad, bad, bad wolf

They say "Hey, Bob, you illuminati?"
I say "I don't know, I guess they kicked me out"

Send the smoke signals, can you see the clouds

It's not like government ask to comply and present it as a choice. It's not like the government looks at us as property and divides a population into two political parties

Peace, that's a sign of success
Sickness, that's a sign of some stress
Sleep inside of a dream, but if I ain't have a name then what would you call me?
Living free it's called sleep
It's a scheme but what does it all mean
The illusion, the technologies involving
I was buried in lost seas
Got whole airports under the ocean, they just like "don't look at me, we don't know shit"
I call that hocus pocus, this ain't the first time that the matrix got reloaded, bands

One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small

If my thoughts offend you, you scared or sum
Shit, I don't know, say a prayer or sum

Let you get hot then hit you with a gun charge
You don't see the pattern on the chess board
Same old shit, just another rat they test it on
Wanna be from somewhere so bad
What if you ain't from no where?
What if when you die..?
What if when you die you don't go there?
But don't ever mess it up
We've seen the enemy, the enemy is us

One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small
One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small
Well, as the 675th president of the United States I think we should take it easy on the minorities. I think we should ease up a bit, just ease up a bit. I'm definitely not gonna make it financially hard for you to succeed in life. Definitely not gonna increase the mandatory prison sentence. Huh, why would I do that? That'd be evil, Hahahahaaa. When you go to those polls on 4th on November just remember, I'm your guy. Take-it-easy-on-minorities Tim, that's my name. Alright, have a good one

I know I don't say, "You're beautiful" enough
But that don't mean it ain't on my mind
And I know sometimes we have differences and fight
But I hate when I see you cry

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're ever worried I got one foot out that door
I can promise you right now, baby

[Chorus]
My love won't leave you alone
Just so you know
When I say forever, girl
I mean I'm never, ever gonna do you wrong
And I won't let you go
Talkin' us growin' old
Here's dusk 'til dawn
We'll be goin' on and on
Baby, my love won't leave you alone
No-oh

[Verse 2]
Just like that red winе stain on the carpet
Yeah, girl, I ain't goin' no whеre (Hell nah)
And kinda like your favorite jeans with the hole in the pocket
Wherever you go, I'll be there

'Cause my love won't leave you alone
Just so you know

Leave you alone (Won't leave you)
Leave you alone
Leave you alone (No, I won't)
Leave you alone (Won't leave you)
Leave you alone

[Bridge]
And I don't know what life will look like fifty years down the road
But you can count on me bein' right here

[Chorus]
'Cause my love won't leave you alone
Just so you know
When I say forever, girl
I mean I'm never, ever gonna do you wrong
And I won't let you go
Talkin' us growing old
Here's dusk 'til dawn
We'll be goin' on and on
'Cause my love won't leave you alone

[Post-Chorus]
Leave you alone
Leave you alone (I won't leave you alone)
Leave you alone
Leave you alone (Oh, no, I won't)
Leave you alone
No, I won't leave you alone
Come on, come here, come on, come here
You've been here before

Come on, come here, come on, come here
You've been here before
Like a beacon that shows the way
To a ship that's lost at sea
Your love was just a light
That had to shine on me

If I hurry too much when I kiss you
It's because I'm happy to be near you
So please be patient with me and we'll get by
And I will learn to love you forever
And we'll be together
The Sunday morning gospel goes good with the soul
There's blues, folk, and country, and rock like a rolling stone
The world could come together as one
If everybody under the sun
Add some music to your day

You'll hear it while you're walking by a neighbor's home
You'll hear it faintly in the distance when you're on the phone
You're sitting in a dentist's chair
And they've got music for you there
To add some music to your day

Add some music, music everywherе (add some music)
Add some, add some, add somе, add some music
Your doctor knows it keeps you calm
Your preacher adds it to his psalms
So add some music to your day

Music
(Add some music, add some music)
When you're alone
(Add some music, add some music)
Is like a companion
(Add some music, add some music)
For your lonely soul
Oo oo oo woo oo woo oo oo oo oooo
When day is over
I close my tired eyes
Music is in my soul

At a movie you can hear it touching your heart
And on every day of the summertime you'll hear children chasing ice cream carts
They'll play it on your wedding day
There must be about a million ways
To add some music to your day

Add some music to your day
Add some music to your day
Add some music to your day
Add some music

[Intro: Charli XCX]
Don't you leave me this way (Uh, yeah)

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
You know I go insane every time you have to catch a flight (Ah, ah-ah-ah, yeah, yeah)
Well, can I take you to the airport?
Make out under the bathroom lights (Ah, ah-ah-ah, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Put your lips on my lips
I'll remember your kiss on the nights when I miss you (yeah)
Somethin' I can't forget when I'm restless in bed
Yeah, you got me obsessed (Mm, yeah)

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?
You know I need you to stay
Don't make me bеg for you 'cause I'll beg for you

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX & Rina Sawayama]
Yeah, yеah, yeah, uh, yeah
Beg for you, beg for you (Yeah)
Beg for you, beg for you, mmm (Yeah)
Beg for you, beg for you (Yeah; Rina Sawayama)
So don't you leave me this way (Uh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Rina Sawayama & Charli XCX]
You're like an ocean breeze, comin' and goin' just as you please (Ah, ah-ah-ah)
Separated by a degree, hesitate and I lose you
So far out of reach
(Ah, ah-ah-ah)

[Pre-Chorus: Rina Sawayama]
Oh, put your lips on my lips
I'll remember your kiss on the nights when I miss you
Somethin' I can't forget when I'm restless in bed
Yeah, you got me obsessin' now

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?
You know I need you to stay
Don't make me beg for you 'cause I'll beg for you
My heart is achin', my breath you've taken
Oh, babe, I just want a taste
Don't you leave me this way
Don't make me beg for you

[Bridge: Charli XCX]
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way
This way, this way
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way
This way, this way
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way (Don't you leave me)
This way (Don't you leave me this way), this way (Don't you leave me)
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way (Don't you leave me)
This way (Don't you leave me this way), this way (Don't you leave me) (Yeah)
Don't you leave me

[Outro: Charli XCX]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
The lonely man I make myself to be
Is not as bad as some things I have seen
The picture painted here is not a dream
But only reality, the way it seems

[Chorus]
The happier you fly, the sadder you fall
The laughter in your eye is never all
Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's gone

[Verse 2]
I'm riding down Swett Road in my old car
The moon is almost full except for stars
The party endеd long before the night
But shе made me feel alive and that's all right

[Chorus]
The happier you fly, the sadder you fall
The laughter in your eye is never all
Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's gone

[Harmonica Break]

[Chorus]
The happier you fly, the sadder you fall
The laughter in your eye is never all
Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to move along

[Intro: Pooh Shiesty]
1017 (Blrrrd)

[Chorus]
He tryna pull a publicity stunt (Damn)
These rappers be pussy, they bleed once a month
Don't speak on my name, don't get put in a blunt
You can diss all you want, still won't get a response (Nah)
It's still free the gang 'til they get out the joint (Slam)
Stop beatin' 'round the bush and just get to the point (Slam)
You wanna be me, I know what you want
But you ain't gotta pull no publicity stunt (Nah)
Live by the gun then you die by the gun (Baow)
Ain't gotta cap 'bout the shit that I done
My nigga got bond and he went on the run (Go)
Got my roof in the trunk and my trunk in the front (Dump)
Droppin' the ceilin', I'm thinkin' of Dolph (Dolph)
Kill for a livin' and murder for fun (Graow)
We ain't 'bout to pull no publicity stunt (No)
Nah, we ain't 'bout to pull no publicity stunt (Go)

[Verse 1]
Why you diss me for publicity nigga? (Huh?)
Is you in the streets or a industry nigga? (Well damn)
Is you my fan or my enemy, nigga?
My money too grown to be kiddin' with niggas (It's long)
I beat it with niggas, play tunk on the bunk
One nigga didn't pay, he got stabbed and runned up (Huh, uh)
Say he my opp but try dappin' me up (Graow)
Give a round of applause 'cause we clappin' him up (Clap)
Trappers "R" Us, come in traffic with us
Gon' finesse on your bitch, spend her taxes with us (Mwah)
Say we the reason the prices went up
I ran off on the plug and I doubled it up (Ew)
These old niggas just don't know when to shut up (Shh)
Better call yourself lucky if you walk on a crutch
I got long arms, I can reach out and touch you
We got the same guns they send off to Russia
Ain't no disputin', I kill like I'm Putin
Got a truck full of shooters, I move like I'm Trump
Soldiers stand guard for me like I'm Obama
Try go get some gas and got killed at the pump
Say you got hits, but, look, you in a slump
Say that you rich but you live in a dump
My jit go retarded, a switch on the pump (Yeah)
Tell him shoot when he open, he say he wanna dunk (Shoot, baow)

[Chorus]
He tryna pull a publicity stunt (Damn)
These rappers be pussy, they bleed once a month (Yeah)
Don't speak on my name, don't get put in a blunt (Shh)
You can diss all you want, still won't get a response (Ha)
It's still free the gang 'til they get out the joint (Slam)
Stop beatin' 'round the bush and just get to the point (Slam)
You wanna be me, I know what you want (I know)
But you ain't gotta pull no publicity stunt (No)
Live by the gun then you die by the gun (Graow)
Ain't gotta cap 'bout the shit that I done (No)
My nigga got bond and he went on the run (Go, go, go, go)
Got my roof in the trunk and my trunk in the front (Trunk)
Droppin' the ceilin', I'm thinkin' of Dolph (Dolph)
Kill for a livin' and murder for fun
We ain't 'bout to pull no publicity stunt (Nah)
Nah, we ain't 'bout to pull no publicity stunt (Go)

[Verse 2]
It's free Pooh and Foo 'til it's backwards, you bastards (Foo)
"Why you sign goons?" I don't fuck with these rappers (Foo)
Claim that they real, but they know they some cappers
I take a trapper and I make 'em go platinum (Platinum)
Fuck makin' excuses, I'm makin' it happen
I put that shit on, it’s spectacular fashion (I do)
Trick on the bitch like I'm Robert Kardashian (I do)
Makin' more money than you can imagine (I will)
When you caught lackin', that's when they attackin'
Thought I was splurgin', didn't know I was stackin' (Didn't know)
White and gold jewelry, they said I was tacky (Brr)
She gave me head and I gave her a rack (Woo)
It came out his mouth, now he can't take it back
Watch what you say, who you callin' a rat (Rat)
These niggas spread gossip then call it a fact
'Fore we give a statement, we'll lay on the mat (Wow)
Free all the soldiers who never roll over
Who fight for their life, gotta sleep with a knife
Dawg went to trial and they gave him a life
But he won his appeal, now he covered in ice (Brr)
Young nigga mixin' codeine with the Sprite (Lean)
He gon' bust you on site and get three hundred likes (Graow)
Shouts to Adidas, he steppin' for stripes
And give back to the hood, I bought three hundred bikes (It's Gucci)

[Chorus]
He tryna pull a publicity stunt (Stunt)
These rappers be pussy, they bleed once a month (Damn)
Don't speak on my name, don't get put in a blunt (Shh)
You can diss all you want, still won't get a response (Huh)
It's still free the gang 'til they get out the joint (Slam)
Stop beatin' 'round the bush and just get to the point (Slam)
You wanna be me, I know what you want (I know)
But you ain't gotta pull no publicity stunt (Damn)
Live by the gun then you die by the gun
Ain't gotta cap 'bout the shit that I done
My nigga got bond and he went on the run (Pew)
Got my roof in the trunk and my trunk in the front (Dump)
Droppin' the ceilin', I'm thinkin' of Dolph (Dolph)
Kill for a livin' and murder for fun (Fun)
We ain't 'bout to pull no publicity stunt
Nah, we ain't 'bout to pull no publicity stunt

[Outro]

(I thought you felt like Gucci Mane in 2006)
(I thought you felt like Gucci Mane in 2006)
(I thought you felt like Gucci Mane in 2006)

Alright, it's a little cooler this way, you know

Susie Cincinnati got a groovy little motor car
She lives for the night and her husband's a security guard
Her looks aren't exactly a plus
But it doesn't matter to us
'Cause she knows where it's at and she gets you there in seconds flat

She knows all the honkies and the kids are all home in bed
(Oooh, ride, Susie Cincinnati, ride)
She'd rather do this than anything else instead
(Oooh, ride, Susie Cincinnati)
She got the nicotine fit
And before she discovered it
Everybody in the back seat suffocated

Susie Cincinnati, we thought you were a winner
But Susie Cincinnati city's number one sinner
Susie Cincinnati, we thought you were a winner
But Susie Cincinnati city's number one sinner
She'll always pick you up when the others go and let you down
(Do ride, do ride, Susie Cincinnati, ride)
In her little red cab she's scootin' all over town
(Do ride, do ride, Susie Cincinnati)
She got a runnin' meter too
All polished up and shines for you
But it's just for looks 'cause she'll give the ride free to you

Divorce feels like full blown Covid
Divorce feels like your doctor don't know shit
Divorce feels like your walking on glass
Divorce feels like you're running through a glass wall
Divorce feels like you're being bullied in a class hall
Divorce feels like you're getting beat up in the mall
Divorce feels like your hand was burned on the stove
Divorce feels like your soul was dragged over coals
Divorce feels like grandma never got over that cold
Divorce feels like the first play of the super bowl and your ankle rolls
Divorce feels like your kids were snatched from your control
Divorce feels like you've been shot and traffic is slow
Divorce feels like heavy breathing
Divorce feels like suffocating
Barely breathing
Divorce feels like you're receiving a spiritual beating every evening
Divorce feels like you worked overtime all week and you ain't allowed off for the weekend
Divorce feels like you got broken into
Divorce feels like you got broken in a thousand pieces
Divorce feels like you've been set on fire
For your truth
Then labeled a liar
Divorce feels like Michael Myers
Divorce feels like your teeth being pulled with pliers
Divorce feels like slower than paint and dryer
Divorce feels like nails in your hand
Divorce feels walking in on your bride and your best man
Divorce feels like feels like you can't sit or stand
Divorce feels like you can't breathe
Divorce feels like you can't stay or leave
Divorce feels like a funeral a miscarriage a broken leg
Divorce feels like you gave everyone away and you don't have the right to have anything to say
Who are you to have an opinion on your own life
You are not you anymore
You're whats left of you
Michael Jackson said it best
You're a vegetable
You're a vegetable
You're the real Cosby
Not a Huxtable
Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
When I wake up, look over at him
He's still so fucked up, I'm always afraid of what I'll find
I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand
I give up
I just wanna get out alive, it's fucked up
At least I can say that I tried
I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand
Did I say thousand? I meant million

[Verse]
I was lookin' for what I found in you
Then the thought I found is no longer true
Sometimes...

[Verse 1]
I am a lonely visitor
I came too late to cause a stir
Though I campaigned all my life
Towards that goal
I hardly slept the night you wept
Our secret's safe and still well kept
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got it
Soul

[Verse 2]
Hospitals have made him cry
But there’s always a freeway in his eye
His beach just got too crowded for a stroll
Roads stretch out like healthy veins
And wild gift horses strain the reins
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got it
Soul

[Verse 3]
The podium rocks in the crowded waves
And the speaker talks of the beautiful saves
That went down long before he played this role
For the hotel queens and the magazines
Test tube genes and slot machines
Where even Richard Nixon has got it
Even Richard Nixon has got soul

[Outro]
I am a lonely visitor
I came too late to cause a stir
Though I campaigned all my life
Towards that goal

[Verse 1]
Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away (Rock, right)

[Verse 2]
Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go

[Pre-Chorus]
When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogiе
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dancе you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away

[Bridge]
And when the groove is dead and gone (Yeah)
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever, on
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you

[Chorus]
I wanna rock (All night)
With you girl (Sunlight)
Rock with you, rock with you girl (Yeah)
(All night)
Dance the night away
I wanna rock with you (Yeah)
(All night)
Rock you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Rock the night away

[Outro]
Feel the heat, feel the beat (All night)
Rock you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock (All night)
Rock the night away
Rock with you (All night)
I wanna dance you in the day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (ooh) (All night)
Gonna rock the night away
I wanna ro-ock (All night)
Yeah girl ooh yeah (Sunlight)
Feel The heat, feel the beat (All night)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I am a lonely visitor
I came too late to cause a stir
Though I campaigned all my life
Towards that goal
I hardly slept the night you wept
Our secret's safe and still well kept
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got soul

[Verse 2]
The podium rocks in the crowded waves
The speaker talks of the beautiful saves
That went down long before he played this role

Test tube genеs and slot machines
Where еven Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got it
Soul

[Verse 3]
Hospitals have made him cry
But there's always a freeway in his eye
Though his beach just got too crowded for a stroll

Our secret's safe and still well kept
Where even Richard Nixon had soul
Even Richard Nixon had it
Soul, soul

[Verse 2]
The podium rocks in the crowded waves

[Outro]
I am a lonely visitor
I came too late to cause a stir
Though I campaigned all my life
Towards that goal

[Verse 1]
When I woke up you were gone
And the sun was on the lawn
Empty pillow with perfume on
I smelled it
We met in my favorite bar
And we rode in my favorite car
But I don't know how we made it home

[Interlude - Spoken]
I tell you one thing
We turned off the radio and it sounded like that, ha ha
We were just cruising down the road and we couldn’t hear anything at all
As I drove off the road for the eighth time in a row
I looked over at her into her beautiful eyes
And I said

[Chorus]
Am I too far gone?
Too far gone
Too far gone for you
Am I too far gone?
Too far gone
Too far gone for you

[Interlude - Spoken]
It was a little noisy at the bar that night
But we had a great time anyway

[Verse 2]
We had drugs and we had booze
But we still had somethin' to lose
And by dawn I wanted to marry you
With our attitudes by day
And our secret dreams by night
Can we really live the life that way?

[Chorus]
Am I too far gone?
Too far gone
Too far gone for you
Am I too far gone?
Too far gone
Too far gone for you

[Snippets]
I got a secret
Dirty
Little secret
I’ll be
Your best friend
Your sex friend
Your captain

I’ll be
Your best friend
Your sex friend
Your captain
You’ll be my boy toy
My spoil toy

[Verse 1]
I want to live, I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I try to give
That keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

[Verse 2:]
I've been to Hollywood, I went to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line
That keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold

[Outro]
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
You keep me searchin' and I'm growing old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
I've been a miner for a heart of gold

[Verse 1]
Love is a rose but you better not pick it
It only grows when it's on the vine
A handful of thorns and you’ll know you've missed it
You lose your love when you say the word mine
Mine

[Bridge]
I want to see what's never been seen
I want to live that age old dream
Come on, girl, we can go together
Let’s take the best right now
Take the best right now

[Verse 2]
I wanna go to an old hoedown
Long ago in a western town
Pick me up but my feet are draggin'
Give me a lift and I'll hay your wagon

[Verse 1]
Love is a rose but you better not pick it
It only grows whеn it's on the vine
A handful of thorns and you'll know you've missеd it
You lose your love when you say the word mine
You lose your love when you say the word mine

[Outro]
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose

[Intro]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, somebody say hey
Say hey, say hey, ho, hey, hey

[Chorus]
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put thе mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now

[Chorus]
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybе go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bu and all marvelous, them rollin'
Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D
Hittin' no less than three
Block wheel style like whee
Girl, I can tell you want me, 'cause lately

[Chorus]
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo? (Like Tae Bo?)
And possibly bend you over? (Ayy)
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)
'Cause we gon' fight, oh, yes, we gon' fight (We gon' fight)
Believe we gon' fight (We gon' fight)
Fight for our right to love, yeah (Right to love, yeah)
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)

[Verse 1]
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody thought we'd last forever
I feel I'm hopin' and prayin'
Things between us gon' get better
Men steady comin' after you
Women steady comin' after me
Seems like everybody wanna go for self
And don't wanna respect boundaries
Tellin' you all those lies
Just to get on yo' side
But I must admit there was a couple secrets I held inside
Just know that I try to always apologize
But I'ma have you first, always in my heart to keep you satisfied

[Chorus]
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)
'Cause we gon' fight, oh, yes, we gon' fight (We gon' fight)
Believe we gon' fight (We gon' fight)
Fight for our right to love, yeah (Right to love, yeah)
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)

[Verse 2]
Got every right to wanna leave
Got every right to wanna go
Got every right to hit the road
And never talk to me no mo'
You don't even have to call
Even check for me at all
'Cause the way I've been actin' lately has been off the wall
Especially towards you, puttin' girls before you
And they watchin' everything I been doin' just to hurt you
Most of it just ain't true and they won't show you
How much of a queen you are to me and why I love you, baby

[Chorus]
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)
'Cause we gon' fight, oh, yes, we gon' fight (We gon' fight)
Believe we gon' fight (We gon' fight)
Fight for our right to love, yeah (Right to love, yeah)
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)

[Outro]

I'm really digging your performance
You're absolutely gorgeous
And your ego is enormous

You got my hands up in the air
Your girl's watching me g go crazy but I don't care
I welcome her to stare
Cuz I've been noticing you checking me out from way up there

Somebody ring the alarm
And make some room on the stage
Cuz I'm 'bout to perform

For My Favorite DJ (3X)

You make those sexy faces
And you scratch all the right places
Your energy is so contagious
You push my buttons and you turn all of my pages
I'm bout to comes out of my clothes
I'm soaking wet and I don't carе if everybody knows
A little tipsy I supposе
You've got a private invitation to see me exposed

Somebody ring the alarm
And make some room on the stage
Cuz I'm about to perform

For My Favorite DJ (3x)

Cuz when the beat comes down
I just can't get down
I have to get up off the wall

Cuz the way you put it down
Makes me wanna get down
I've never felt this way before

Somebody ring the alarm
And make some room on the stage
Cuz I'm about to perform

For My Favorite DJ (3x)

[Verse 1]
My dog just ran away and I am feeling pretty bad
I've been sneaking out at night and my parents are real mad
I’ve been taking lots of drugs 'cause they teach me not to care
Yeah, I guess that’s how you cheat because life doesn’t play fair

[Bridge]
Mmm-mm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm

[Verse 2]
My brother told me that he's gonna kill himself tonight
With a whole bottle of Prozac or a shiny kitchen knife
He said that when he is dead I'll have his Nintendo 64
And I can play it all night long, sitting on the basement floor

[Bridge]
Mmm-mm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm

[Verse 3]
My girlfriend told me that she doesn't love me anymore
And I wish I didn't care but I thought she was really cool
So I drank a ton of liquor then I threw up in her sink
She said next time use the toilet then she offered me a drink

[Bridge]
Mmm-mm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm

[Outro]
Mmm-mm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm

The dripping tap won't be turned off by the
Suits in charge of the world and our
Futures hanging on by a thread
With our heads in the sand
The dripping tap won't be turned off by the
Gods up above us, Big Sky Country
That we never hear from in these
Times of our dying needs

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1: All]
A familiar sound ignored
The compartmentalized thoughts
In that back corner of the drawer
That drip, drip on the floor
Don't get drowned
Hee hee hee, woo!
Heed that sound
Hee hee hee, woo!

Gods up above us, Big Sky Country
That we never hear from in these
Times of our dying needs
Go on then, blame it on the weather
Go on then, blame it on the weather
Go on then, blame it on the weather

Gloomy days make you see the downside
Like an arrow straight through the bullseye
K-hole, spiral through space and time
Stimuli, numb your mind

Go on then, blame it on the weather
Go on then, blame it on the weather
Go on then, blame it on the weather

Even if you like pain, lifе ain't a sadists game
The devil ain't your friеnd- he's savage
That man on the corner of the street pulled the rug from under your feet
You're flying so you'd better stick the landing otherwise you ain't got a leg to stay standing
Standing on

Stay standing
Standing on
Stay standing
Standing on
All alone
Oh no
Go on then, blame it on the weather
Go on then, blame it on the weather
Go on then, blame it on the weather
Go on then, blame it on the weather
Go on then, blame it on the weather

[Verse 1]
Look past the dying trees, beyond waterless seas
Atop the horizon
Adjacent to the sun
I give my word that it’s there- Magenta Mountain

What do you mean, you can't see it?
My life must be a dream- a living fantasy
Disappeared in hot air- Magenta Mountain

[Bridge 1]
I don’t believe you
Your eyes deceive you
Better check yourself in
The mirage is creeping outwards from your dream
Can’t you see you’ve gone insane?

[verse 2]
I packed my bags and my swag for the road
Followed the bows of the anciеnt railroads
Need to rendezvous wherе clouds can’t misconstrue
I’m certain it’s real- Magenta Mountain
You will say I’m crazy
I will go on my way because it’s what I need
I’d cross a thousand seas just to prove I’m not mad
Magenta Mountain
Magenta Mountain

[Bridge 2]
It’s you again
Yeah!
I thought I saw a statue blink and a bird with no head
Land on a golden thread
I rub my eyes
What am I saying?
There’s nothing there

[Chorus]
Magenta mountain
Magenta mountain
It's my sanctuary that I wanna be chasing every chance I get
Don't wanna be left
Never not making it there

[Verse 3]
What was confusing is now seducing
Imagination is a powerful thing
I see a flash of purple stone closing in

[Chorus]
Magenta mountain
Magenta mountain
It's my sanctuary that I wanna be chasing every chance I get
Don't wanna be left
Never not making it there

[Verse 4]
I am tectonic
I am megalithic
My spirit runs mauve
I am the mountain of which you dream
I see you now behind the lens looking back at me

We fell through a dream across clouds of glue
Anamnesis crashing through

[Outro]
Magenta mountain
Magenta mountain
Magenta mountain
Magenta mountain
Nerdy kid at school with astral thoughts
Wanted to be an astronaut so I could be alone in space
Get away
Dreamt of Kepler-22b
That's the place for me

Didn't get the grades to be a NASA astronaut
Couldn't knuckle down or focus on my schoolwork
I became a ghetto engineer making shit out of glass to refract the light from distant stars
Then I built a telescope
So big
Pointed it at Kepler-22b
That's the place for me

Good for ya
Obsession is good for ya
Good for ya
Obsession is good for ya

Can you guess the first thing I seen on Kepler-22b?
A telescope pointing back at me
On Kepler-22b
A telescope pointing back at me
On Kepler-22b
A telescope pointing back at me
Good for ya
Obsession is good for ya
Good for ya
Obsession is good for ya
Good for ya
Obsession is good for ya
Good for ya
Obsession is good for ya
Breathing heavy candles
Cut a face from the smile
Preserve the torch; its imperative
So douse some fuel on the fire

Some dogs get whale eye
Got a nose for that sea spice
I wish that I had strength like that
Dominion over my chemistry

Didn't you know?
The camel's out of water
The dog sweat on the seat
Had me slippin' like a creep

Haven't you heard?
They worked out double standards
Apply only to me
Finally, it's working
Ambergris
Sculpting confidence with chimney smoke
Record my weight in kidney stones
CFC's gnaw at my intellect
Colour coding my lymph nodes

Anthropomorphise everything
Use my blowhole like a microphone
Every night I dream that you will see
The harpoon that I've grown to need

Apropos
The camel's out of water
The dog sweat on the seat
Had me slippin' like a creep

Ergo
They worked out double standards
Apply only to me
Finally, it's working
Ambergris
Who's this Sadie Sorceress?

Let me tell you 'bout this 80's lady named Sadie
She's wild like a witch
She's more fly than quidditch
Smoking winnies and drinking tinnies and glenfiddich
She's a roller blade skating
Masquerading
Squabble and Gobble
Eats blood and trouble
Meddles in the metal in it
She flies a handbag freak flag
Dragon scale knapsack
Fur a pelt of mastodon
Brings it on as carry on
Sharp like parmesan
Living non-partisan
Leviathan cardigan
Elegant artisan
Concealing her identity as an evil entity
Nightshade bringing death commander
Have a gander - oleaner
Poisonous like buttercups
She's dressing up to fuck shit up
Hello love
How are ya?

Sadie Sorceress
Sadie Sorceress
Sadie Sorceress
Snapping necks with her broomstick getting torturous

The pagan shaman sorceress
Cackling
Bat shit
Non-conformist
Moles on her nose so enormous
The public they can't ignore it
Pitchforks banging on her door
They wanna throw her overboard to see if she floats or sinks into the floor
There she goes bobbing on the surface as the peasants and the servants start to yell
'Hooray! Sell her to the circus!'
She's had enough of playing it down and playing it dumb
She's dropping bombs on this human scum
Ain't no thing as collateral damage in this supernatural planet with a habit of getting savage
Making sacrifices for the paradise of perdition, the trials and tribulations for the forbidden religion

Sadie Sorceress
Sadie Sorceress
Sadie Sorceress
Snapping necks with her broomstick getting torturous
The most dangerous, debaucherous
Sadier Sorceress
Evilest man

I had no choice but to ignore the voices in the newspaper
I feel sad from what I see
Misinformation around me

I have no faith in what I need
The tabloids and the TV screen
I see it just as clear as the high definition images

Don't wanna scare inaction into you, but what you read you will turn into
Pull up your socks or become a fox
Do you wanna be just like the evilest man?
Mundochian

How very long must his arms be to span the distance he can reach?
To make all our four corners square
We're in his conservative lair
I wonder if he knows this song...
Probably read before it was done
He probably hacked my phone
I'll change the locks when I get home
Don't wanna scare inaction into you, but what you read you will turn into
Pull up your socks or become a fox
Do you wanna be just like the evilest man?
Mundochian

I had no choice but to ignore the voices in the newspaper
I feel sad from what I see
Misinformation around me
I have no faith in what I need

How very long must his arms be to span the distance he can reach?
To make all our four corners square
We're in his conservative lair
I wonder if he knows this song...
Probably read before it was done
He probably hacked my phone
I'll change the locks when I get home

Evilest Man. Evilest Man. Evilest Man...
The garden goblin

Isn't this the place for you
Here in the garden we're safe for now
Behind the tree, the garden goblin's looking at me
At me
At me

What's that expression upon his face
Doesn't it look like contempt
Doesn't he want to let the garden grow like me and you

Grow

What does he want to comprehend
This garden was never his place
Doesn't he want to let thе garden grow like me and you

Grow

Thе garden goblin
What doesn't he want the world to know?
The garden goblin
Why doesn't he want to let it grow?
The garden goblin
What doesn't he want the world to know?
The garden goblin
Why doesn't he want to let it grow?
The garden goblin
Grow
Grow
Grow
The garden goblin
Grow
Grow
Grow
Couldn't he be friendly like the gnome
Wipe that smirk right off his face
Doesn't he want the garden to grow like me and you

Isn't this the place for you
Here in the garden we're safe for now
Behind the tree, the garden goblin's looking at me
At me
At me
At me
At me
Oh baby I got persistence
Keep pushing like the Ford motor pistons
Oh baby I got persistence
I'm an automatic transmission
Oh baby I got persistence
I hold the pole position
Oh baby I got persistence
Yeah I go the distance

No want for gas - I run on love
So cut the brakes
There's no end of the road
Unfading highway
Pass no cars on the way
So set to cruise
Let's getaway

Lets drive
Drive, drive drive
Lets drive
Drive, drive drive
Oh baby I got persistеnce
Keep pushing like the Ford motor pistons
Oh baby I got pеrsistence
I'm an automatic transmission
Oh baby I got persistence
I hold the pole position
Oh baby I got persistence
Yeah I go the distance
Oh baby I got persistence
Yeah I go the distance
Oh baby I got persistence
Yeah I go the distance

Yeah I go the distance
Yeah I go the distance
Yeah I go the distance

I think I went too fast
(You did)
I think the car might crash
(It will)
I'll have to pull out the wings and feel the lift underfoot
I'm shaking with fear
Such a crazy idea
Better give it a try
See if this car can fly
Let's fly
Fly, fly, fly
Let's fly
Fly, fly, fly

I'm flying
I'm floating
I'm flying
I'm floating

Oh baby I got persistence
Keep pushing like the Ford motor pistons
Oh baby I got persistence
I'm an automatic transmission
Oh baby I got persistence
I hold the pole position
Oh baby I got persistence
Yeah I go the distance
Oh baby I got persistence
Yeah I go the distance
Oh baby I got persistence
Yeah I go the distance
I'm the grim reaper
Chimney sweeper
Gate keeper
Running faster than a cheetah preying on the weaker
Got you in my point blank range as I take aim
I'm coming at ya like a hurricane
You're a scavenger scratching around for scraps
Sipping on cactus
Lighting matches
Unburied hatchets
Waiting for the ultimatum to be handed down from above
Never moved a muscle
Never gave a fuck

If it's bad for business and the visits from the hellhounds sniffing out stitches for the snitches

Then therе's gotta be more than justice in discussion for thе ones causing the corruption
Are you having an existential crisis
Time is priceless
Can't advise us
Analyze it
Break down into small increments to repent
Rotting flesh odorous
The grim reaper cashes the cheque
Rotting flesh odorous
The grim reaper cashes the cheque

Heaven sent the silhouette of many wicked men
Fearless
Reckoning thinking they're the most powerful they've ever been
I can't begin to comprehend the arrogance dwindling inside the kranium
Grotesquely tortured by the wretchedness
Whiplash in the fortress between ya legs
Body bags hanging on the hills hoist with a peg as the stench orbits the homestead

Rotting flesh odorous
The grim reaper cashes the cheque
Rotting flesh odorous
The grim reaper cashes the cheque
Rotting flesh odorous
The grim reaper cashes the cheque
Rotting flesh odorous
The grim reaper came to collect his debt
So presumptuous
With tongue in cheek
So presumptuous
Belittle me
So presumptuous
Falling at your feet
So presumptuous
Don't agree with your negativity

Eggshell landmine stepping stones
Kindred spirits at a crossroads
The world we built is on a tilt
Bottled up inside and filled with guilt
Maybe you've got a god complex
Missing in action, didn't even notice
Sounds like negligence
Featherless, shaking in defiance

So presumptuous
With tongue in cheek
So presumptuous
Belittle me
Sitting duck light bulb revelation
We're losing momentum
Blasé, naïve sheepishly brazen
You're doing the bare minimum

So presumptuous
With tongue in cheek
So presumptuous
Belittle me
So presumptuous
Falling at your feet
So presumptuous
Letting go unwillingly

So presumptuous
With tongue in cheek
So presumptuous
Belittle me
So presumptuous
Falling at your feet
So presumptuous
What's it gonna take for you to see that

Shrug your shoulders
No response
It's become a known nuisance
You took for granted all our trust
And threw it all away
So presumptuous
With tongue in cheek
So presumptuous
Belittle me
So presumptuous
Falling at your feet
So presumptuous

It ain't some passing storm we can't hide from

Red smoke

You're business is my business
Don't ask for forgiveness
Because time is a vessel and our little boat is leaking

This little man is too hot to handle
Set the funeral on fire with the candles

I know your sword is sharp so I wanna chop, chop, chop, chop

Luck here, matters when walking under ladders
Because time is an arrow and our little bow has no strings

This little man is too hot to handle
Set the funeral on fire with the candles
Candles

My little heart is cold as a morgue
Let the weight of it drop like an iceberg
Candles

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
I was in debt and the car that broke
The same shit I've been saying for years they called it "loc"
Successful man, a man that 

[?] the 

[?]
The most successful man the one's who can afford the most mistakes
And play with them

[Intro]
What the fuck is that?
Ayy, everybody has their own drink
Told the beef was over, that was, ayy

[Chorus]
Said the beef was over, that was motherfuckin' cap
Don't need no fuckin' handouts, let alone a dap, yeah
6 And 8 And Fours and two you know I played it crap, yeah
Taboo in Miami, I'm too rich for boobytrap, yeah
Ayy, it's some niggas I don't like
So I'm throwin' signs in the street, I'm on strike, yeah
It's on sight, so I said it's on sight, uh
Bitches tryna end me, so I can not be polite, uh

[Verse]
Millionaire, I ain't stoppin' at no lights
But shit replay inside my head enough and I'm a fight, yeah
Promise that I buy that bitch a Birkin, mm, sike, uh
Promise that I buy that bitch a Birkin, uh, sike
Threw that pussy and I caught it, J. Rice
Know that bitch is mine, but I might now own her rights
Yeah, that bitch said she went skydivin' twicе
Jumped up on his dick and said that bit' was scared of heights
Yеah, I'm too lit for boobytrap, uh
I can't go to Louis closets like a Louis rag, uh
Swarmin' with the scammers, can't do Niemans with no Giffy, uh
You keep it a hundred, shit, I rather keep a fifty
Lil' bitch, fives on the fours
Walked into Amiri and they told me "Strike a pose"
Like a fat bitch, you know I show up with the rolls
Ken just got them two best friends to fuck, I said "goals"
He a bird, he probably in the X4
Plus the only party that we know is next door
You know these niggas talkin', know these pussy boys a joke
You got a Goyard on your birthday 'cause that nigga broke, uh
Yeah, I'm too rich for boobytrap
Just bought a pharmacy with Doctor T, we off the map
The casa, the migo, that shit right where I'm at
He would say somethin' back, but he need Cardi B for that
My wrists cost a nigga whole career, nigga
Eighteen-point-seven in a year, nigga

[Chorus]
Said the beef was over, that was motherfuckin' cap
Don't need no fuckin' handouts, let alone a dap, yeah
6 And 8 And Fours and two you know I played it crap
Taboo in Miami, I'm too rich for boobytrap, yeah
Ayy, it's some niggas I don't like
So I'm throwin' signs in the street, I'm on strike, yeah
It's on sight, so I said it's on sight, uh
Bitches tryna end me, so I can not be polite

[Outro]
Ayy, everybody has their own drink
Lyrics from Snippets

[Chorus]
I just signed a deal, now I'm on my way
What a 

[?], no more sleepin' on the coach
I got my own home
Fifteen, richer than you grown folks
Mix it up, while you've been working on the low, low

[Verse]
Momma sellin' 

[?], that's cool
I done...
Lyrics From Snippet:

[Verse]
It sort of sounded like you had something to say
But the child inside you had pushed it away
I don't wanna stay, I don't wanna leave
And the father in you is lured to the sea
Could you come forgive me, naked angry and high
Oh as long as

[Chorus]
I was young when I left home
And I've been out rambling 'round
And I never wrote a letter to my home
To my home, Lord, to my home
And I never wrote a letter to my home

[Verse 1]
It was just the other day
I was bringing home my pay
When I met an old friend I used to know
Said your mother’s dead and gone
Little sister’s all gone wrong
And your daddy needs you home right away
Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny on my name
Well I can’t go home this way
This way, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Well I can’t go home thisaway

[Verse 2]
If you miss the train I’m on
Count the days I’m gone
You will hear that whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, honey baby. Lord, Lord, Lord
You will hear that whistle blow a hundred miles

[Verse 3]
I’m playing on a track
Ma would come and whoop me back
On the trestles down by old Jim McKay’s
When I pay the debt I owe
To the commissary store
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home
Used to tell Ma sometimes
When I see them riding blinds
Gonna make me a home out in the wind
In the wind, Lord, Lord in the wind
Gonna make me a home out in the wind
I don't, well I don’t like it in the wind
I want to come back home again
But I can’t go home thisaway
Thisaway, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
No I can’t go home thisaway

[Chorus]
I was young when I left home
And I've been out rambling 'round
And I never wrote a letter to my home
Lyrics From Snippet:

Day by day
The moon just sails away
The moon and sun are the keepers of the weather

I don't know what I'd do
Don't know what I'd do with you
Don't know where I'd go


Lighter than a feather
Lyrics from Snippet

[Bridge]
...today, today, yeah (What you tell me?)

[Chorus]
Work, work, work for me
Learn, learn, learn, from me
You face, army
...

[Verse 1]
I can see through this game
And how it's ripping away
You love to play
But it don't pay
Looks like you're 

[?]

You're changing my tune
Because I'm overwhelmed
You know I'm broke as hell
But in actuality
One hit will set you free

[Chorus]
Now I'm back on the music
I keep trying to kick this bad habit
I swear this is the last time

[?] I let 

[?] pass me by
I'm so used to it
I keep trying to kick this bad habit
I haven't sung my last line
I guess this music is a friend of mine

[Verse 2]
I've given up
Way too much
It's a young man's game
I'm out of touch

I'm tapping out
Because this society
Is really trying me

There is no guarantee
One hit will set you free

[Chorus]
But I'm back on the music
I keep trying to kick this bad habit
I swear this is the last time

[?] I let 

[?] pass me by
I'm so used to it
I keep trying to kick this bad habit
I haven't sung my last line
I guess this music is a friend of mine

[Intro: The Kid LAROI]
This from the heart, I said, I'm on top, on top
Yeah
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
They tryna bring me down, gotta stay focused
When I get sad, I get the Hennessy and pour up
Fuck dirty Sprite, I get the liquor and the cola
And fuck my ex bitch, she did me dirty, I got no trust
I was only young, but I learned that these hoes ain't shit
I gave you my all, and this the thanks I get?
I still can't believe all of the things I did
I still can't believe that you would leave like this
Traumatized from the shit I've seen in my life
Everything you see right now is the highlight
And no matter how hard I try
Memories still living deep in my mind
I've seen my best friends change colors like a tie-dye
But shout out to the ones that still with me, those are my guys
And fuck everybody else that's just talking from the sidelines
Seeing it and living it, bitch, there is a fine line
And R.I.P. my brother, never got to say bye-bye
It gets hard, I know, believe it
I hope you find the help you're seeking
I was down in Hell, believe me
Packed up my bags and told the Devil, "I'm leaving"

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober

[Verse 2: Stunna Gambino]
I get lost up in my feelings in this Wraith, so I just look at the stars
Like, "Goddamn, we done made it this far"
This shit a blessing, nigga
'Cause I remember we was broke, they weren't messin' with us
I had to make my own way, I manifested, nigga
I dropped two-fifty on a Urus, ain't no Tesla, nigga
And it's still fuck the opps, I just don't be addressin' niggas
The feds screamin' out indictments, they collectin' niggas, mmm
Heartbreaks, heartbreaks they drive me crazy
Lil' girl, look what you made me do
Said hold me down, cuz' baby girl I would do the same for you
I'm heartless, and I put the blame on you
Left me heartless, but I'm glad that it's over
No more cryin' on my shoulder
Pour up the Hennessy 'cause I hate bein' sober, mmm

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober

[Outro: Stunna Gambino]
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I ain't sober

[Verse]
No one wanted to tell me I was DEAD
And only people that would walk to me were in my head
No one wanted to tell me I was DEAD
Only people who loved me would visit in their dreams instead
They would come to my grave and sprinkle some bread
So on my tombstone the birds would be fed
I would give new requests but nothing was said
Cause no one wanted to tell me I was DEAD
My kids would dance for me in a homе I once led
But kids see ghosts and didn't know I was DEAD
Every thing was wrong in thе press that I read
Cause nobody would tell me that I was DEAD
I realized when people spoke to me was only when they pread
Cause nobody would just tell me
Bro you been DEAD
Won't anyone listen to one word I said
Of course not sir
You know how long you been DEAD
Funny it's been a long long time since I bled
You think someone who prides being as smart as me would have known that he's DEAD
So now every idea only exists in my head
I guess that's how people treat people who are DEAD
I found out one day at the newsstand in pergatory there was a front page article of my murderers story
I was so surprised at what it said
This info is for the living
And surprise... You're DEAD

Cup of henny, bloody hoe

Watch the money, change people that you came with (What)
Life then changed, but I'm still on the same shit (Okay)
Just be careful what you wish for, young boy
You seem dumber ain't shit, no dumb boy
Watch the money, change people that you came with (What)
Life then changed, but I'm still on the same shit (Okay)
Just be careful
Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Okay, okay (Uh)
Okay, okay

Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, ayy, woah
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Usually I don't say nothing, but today I feel like saying something
Question me about my story, the best groups just say nothing
Just stay humble, every time they speak, it's like you say something
My family, they pray for them
'Cause a lot of people prey on them (Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

[Verse]
Kenny paying on the new whip, whole team into that crew shit
Yeah, momma used to sell purple pills
Went and turned thеm into those blue strips, that's true shit
Might takе her out for the crew shit
Like, thank you momma for everything that you do (Shit)
I'm sorry for being a nuisance
But look, it's 2019 where they gon' judge you off the internet
And if you ain't you talking gang shit
They judge you on some pussy shit
Pussy please, make these pussies crumble to they pussy knees
Dick up in they bitch I say, 'cause that what that bitch pussy need
Pussy cream, after I hit that bitch, make her pussy leak
I tell you once if you don't...

[Intro: M.I.A.]
When I'm, when I'm, when-when-when I'm
Banging on the radio
B-b-b-banging on the radio
When I'm banging on the radio

Chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the radio

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Bad girls do it well, bad girls do it well
Bad girls—well, bad

Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang

[Verse 1: M.I.A]
Ah, Suki, suki
I'm coming in the Cherokee gasoline
There's steam on the window screen take it, take it
Wheels bouncing like a trampoline
Whеn I get to where I'm going, gonna havе you trembling

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Bad girls—well, bad girls do it well

Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Bad girls—well, bad girls do it well
Bad girls—well, bad girls do it well

[Verse 2: Missy Eliott]
Okay, okay
They call me, Missy Miss, bad bitch
No I'm not like the average
Don't you ever try to come for Miss
You get smashed like ham sandwiches
Scandalous, vandalous
M.I.A. they can't handle this
We on fire like candlestick
And get the crowd pumped up like asses
Money in my pocket
And I'm bouncing like a hydraulic
And the beat be so retarded
Bass be kicking like karate
Woah, got that flow
Make that freaks wanna get down low
Get down low, make 'em touch them toes
I got them flows you ain’t heard before
Grab your dick, grab your tits
DJ's, play the hit
Classical, epicness
Me and M.I.A., we too legit

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Bad girls—well, bad girls do it well
Bad girls—well, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Bad girls—well, bad girls do it well
Bad girls—well, bad girls do it well

He hid a million cash on the statement
Pacin' up and down the stairs in the basement
Caseless, basically, I raped you and got away with it
Ape nigga, hoo, hah, smash your medulla, ooh, ahh
Try not to holler, speaking of holla, hollow tips
Right inside your mama, your father, your sisters, and daughters
I keep that carbon, it's equipt'd with drums and silencers
It's time to polish 'em, it's time to demolish 'em
I'll kill 'em dead then go home and sleep like a baby in my bed
I told her, "Move over, ain't got time for mind sex"
Tell me, do you mind that?
Baby, do you?
Ooh, I'ma take these boys to drip school
Ooh, ...

[Intro]
Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get me off your mind, off your mind
Lord knows you tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

[Verse 1]
Strung out on a feeling, your hands are tied
My face on your ceiling, you fantasize
Oh, you can't control it, you can't control it (You can't control it)
You try to replace it with city lights
You’ll never escape it, you need the high
Oh, you can't control it, you can't control it (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
You said that it was harder to stay
But you still can't run away
I gotta know why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

[Chorus]
Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get me off your mind, off your mind
Lord knows you tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Prisoner, prisoner
Caught up in what you left behind, left behind
Lord knows you tried a million timеs, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

[Verse 2]
You tastеd Heaven, now you can't live without it
I can't forget me where my love is the loudest
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it (Can't control it)

[Pre-Chorus]
You said that it was harder to stay (Hard)
But you still can't run away
I gotta know why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

[Chorus]
Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get me off your mind, off your mind
Lord knows you tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Prisoner, prisoner
Caught up in what you left behind, left behind
Lord knows you tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

[Outro]
(Prisoner)
Can't get me off your mind
(Off your mind)
Why can't you just let me go?
(Million times)
Million times
I wanna know why can't you, why can't you
I wanna know why can't you, why can't you
I gotta know why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

[Verse 1]
I've been running around in circles
Pretending to be myself
Why would somebody do this on purpose
When they could do something else?
Drowning out the morning birds
With the same three songs over and over
I wish I wrote it, but I didn't so I learn the words
Hum along 'til the feeling's gone forever

[Chorus]
Took a tour to see the stars
But they weren't out tonight
So I wished hard on a Chinese satellite
I want to believe
Instead, I look at the sky and I feel nothing
You know I hate to be alone
I want to bе wrong

[Verse 2]
You were screamin' at thе Evangelicals
They were screamin' right back from what I remember
When you said I will never be your vegetable
Because I think when you're gone, it's forever
But you know I'd stand on the corner
Embarrassed with a picket sign
If it meant I would see you when I die

[Chorus]
Sometimes, when I can't sleep
It's just a matter of time before I'm hearing things
Swore I could feel you through the walls
But that's impossible
I want to believe
That if I go outside I'll see a tractor beam
Coming to take me to where I'm from
I want to go home

[Verse 1]
I want you to know, that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me?
Would she go down on you in a theatre?
Does she speak eloquently?
And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me
You'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died, but you're still alive

[Chorus]
And I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

[Verse 2]
You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
And are you thinkin' of me when you fuck her?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me
You'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died, but you're still alive

[Chorus]
And I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

[Bridge]
'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
And I'm not gonna fade, as soon as you close your eyes
And you know it
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back
I hope you feel it
Well, can you feel it?

[Chorus]
Well, I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
Why I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

[Intro: Kanye West]
I'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-century schizoid man)

[Verse: Kanye West]
The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, everybody, we rolling
Huh? everybody, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)

[Verse 1]
Not supposed to feel this way
I'm such a hypocrite
I always frown on love
It’s giving me a tummy ache (All these butterflies make me sick)
Make me fly away (It's some hocus pocus shit, I'm bewitched)
Fly away

[Pre-Chorus]
Calling too much, you’re breaking my phone
Man when you do, except when you don't
Chivalry, ooh, you're taking my coat
Too cute, know this ain't me, no
Candlelight out on the starry night
You brush my hair to the side (Uh-uh-uh-uh)
And you tell me I'm pretty

[Chorus]
Yuck, now you got me blushing
Cheeks so red when the blood starts rushing
Yuck, that boy so mushy
Sending me flowers, I'm just tryna get lucky
Yuck, looking at me all sucky
Yuck, quit acting likе a puppy
Fuck, going all lovey dovey on me (Uh)

[Verse 2]
You got your hopеs high
Thinkin' bout it most nights
Put me on a pedestal
Cause my love's incredible
Don’t wait up for me
I can’t make those plans
Catch me if you can (Come catch me)
Just flew into Japan, come catch me
(Don't you catch feels, let’s go)

[Chorus]
Yuck, now you got me blushing
Cheeks so red when the blood starts rushing
Yuck, that boy so mushy
Sending me flowers, I'm just tryna get lucky
Yuck, looking at me all sucky
Yuck, quit acting like a puppy
Fuck, going all lovey dovey on me (Oh-oh)
Lovey dovey on

[Outro]
Yuck
Uh, Lovey dovey on me
Why you do, why you do (Uh, Lovey dovey on me)
Uh, Lovey dovey on me
Going all lovey dovey on me (Uh, Lovey dovey on)
Yuck
Uh, Lovey dovey on me
Why you do, why you do this to me? (Uh, Lovey dovey on me)
Uh, Lovey dovey on me
Why you do that, why you do that, why you do that?
Yuck (Why you do that, why you do that?)
Yuck, yuck

If I'd only known, there was a love like this
I wouldn’t have gone and mistreated myself
Now it's taking its' toll, I need the Lord and forgiveness
Please restore my soul and my mental health
If I’d only known, there was a love like this
I wouldn't have gone and mistreated myself
Now it's taking its' toll, I need the Lord and forgiveness

The lights and the music
All feel so, alluring
Seem to move right through you
Your best friends, they usе you
And tell me you should use it
Wеll if you do it, you can't undo it
Feel so, confusing
The lights and the music
All feel so, alluring
Seem to move right through you
Your best friends, they use you
And tell me you should use it
Well if you do it, you can't undo it

[Hook]
Well if you do it, you can't undo it

If I’d only known, there was a love like this
I wouldn't have gone and mistreated myself
Now it's taking its' toll, I need the Lord and forgiveness
Please restore my soul and my mental health

[Chorus]
Feel so, confusing
The lights and the music
All feel so, alluring
Seem to move right through you
Your best friends, they use you
And tell me you should use it
Well if you do it, you can’t undo it
Feel so, confusing
The lights and the music
All feel so, alluring
Seem to move right through you
Your best friends, they use you
And tell me you should use it
Well if you do it, you can't undo it

[Outro]
I don't know how much more I can take
Lost my mind somewhere along the way
All I have, life throws so far and away
Lord come down, please take this pain away

She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you

Misery, I know you need company
But tell me exactly what you want from me

And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

[Chorus]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on

[Verse 2]
Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store (Chu chu chu)
Buys a twenty carat golden ring (Ring)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her, she begins to sing (Sing)

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how their lifе goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how thеir life goes on
Yeah

[Bridge]
In a couple of years, they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)

[Verse 3]
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand (Arm, leg)
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening, she still sings it with the band
Yes!

[Chorus]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah

I don't want to say to say goodbye
But I have to say goodbye

Ba da da da da da
Ba da da da da da

[Verse 1]
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Kind of mood that you wish you could sell

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore

[Verse 2]
Hands, hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
Anymore

[Intro: apl.de.ap, (Fergie) & Both]
(Let's get it started in here)

And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'
And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin, and runnin', runnin'
And

[Verse 1: will.i.am with Fergie]
In this context, there's no disrespect
So when I bust my rhyme, you break ya necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect, collect the rhythm effect
To lose your inhibition follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
'Cause when we be out, girlies pull they weave out
You wouldn't believe how, we wow shit out
Burn it 'til it's burned out, turn it 'til it's turned out
Act up from north, wеst, east, south

[Pre-Chorus: The Black Eyed Peas]
Everybody (Yeah), еverybody (Yeah)

Lose control, of body and soul
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Y'all hear about it, the Peas will do it
Get started, get stupid
Don't worry about it, people will walk you through it
Step by step like an infant new kid
Inch by inch with the new solution

Oh baby yeah
Let's do it

Give me all, give me all, give me all your attention baby
I got to tell you a little something about yourself
You're wonderful, flawless, ooh you're a sexy lady
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else

Y'all sing

I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine
(Mine, oh mine)
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you

Ahh look at here, look at here

Well look at here, look at here
Ah what do we have?
Another pretty thang ready for me to grab
But little does she know
That I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night
It is her I'll be holding

I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me
Baby, baby, please don't go away
But when I play, I never stay

To every girl that I meet
This is what I say
Run run runaway, runaway baby
Before I put my spell on you

'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run run runaway, runaway baby

Give me something now

See I ain't try to hurt you baby
No, no, I just wanna work you baby
Yup yup

If you scared you better run (You better run)
You better run (You better run)
You better run (You better run)
You better, you better, you better
Give it away give it away give it away now

What I've got you've got to give it to your mamma
What I've got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I've got you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water

What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling don't stop continue

Realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide wisely you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody
Wanna keep it like the kaiser

Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a king pin or a pauper

Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free love me say hell yes

I'm a low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now

Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it

Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Ooh... Ooh yeah

Yes, give it away now, give it away now

Oh her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying

She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah I know, I know
When I compliment her
She won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see

But every time she asks me do I look okay
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

Oh oh oh oh

[Intro]
Do do do do
Uh uh

[Verse 1]
Bouncing off the bottom
And this pattern is the problem
But it seems like every time
I hit the top
I feel it drop

Suddenly I can see
The first of every month
When the rent and bills hit at once
Only 30 days ’til it repeats

[Chorus]
Don’t let the weight
Don’t let the weight of the world
Get you down
So much to worry about
Don’t let the weight
Don’t let the weight of the world
Get you down
So much to worry about
So much to try and figure out

[Verse 2]
I keep trying to climb
This mountain
That is not mine
But it seems like every time
I reach nеw heights
It’s cold and it bites

Finally I reach thе peak
I’m clocking out of my shift
Yet they tell you life is a gift
But tomorrow brings the same defeat

[Chorus]
Don’t let the weight
Don’t let the weight of the world
Get you down
So much to worry about
Don’t tolerate all of this hate
That the world pushes out
Been tying to silence you know
Don’t let them try and 

[?] you out

[Outro]
Mmm mm
Mmm mm

[Snippet]

Took the last train to New York City
Meant to make change, but I still have this fifty
Found myself leaving just as sad as then

I see you in New York City
Meant to have fun, but you weren't with me
Every time I leave I'm just as sad as then

[Intro: Kanye West]
Hold myself my bands, count up all my bands
She my only fan
I was in my hovercraft, have another laugh
Go on, do the math, spotlight in the man

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Got this on remote control
Got this on remote control
Got it on remote control, like they used to know
I thought you should know, ooh-woah-ooh-woah

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeah, He got the plan, you can't force my hand
Bitch, why you so mad?

[Interlude: Kanye West]
He got this

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
He got this on remote control, like a sink in gold
He got it, spotlight in the man, spotlight in the man
He got it on my hovercraft, have another laugh
Go on, do the math, spotlight in the man

[Chorus: Kanye West with Young Thug]
He got it on remote control
He got it on remote control

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I just, oh, I owe you a load
I live on thе Titanic (Oh), I can rock your boat (Spider)
Hoppin' out the brand new Rolls (Skrrt, skrrt)
Hoppin' out thе brand new Rolls (Skrrt, skrrt)
Jesus sent me brand new clothes (Skrrt, skrrt)
Wrist still thirty-two below (Yeah)
I want my mob ties to shine (Hah)
I could caress your mind with the right time (Time)
Don't you give your love up, this is the right sign (Sign), sign (Yeah, yeah)
I treat you lovely and righteous and kind (Hah)
And we'll be lastin' with another 'til we die (Yeah)
I'd give you kids at the drop of a dime (Dime)
Oh-woah, told the bitch fold my clothes (Fold my clothes)
Take it to the light like a strobe (Yeah)
Taking me to court like O (Taking me to court like OJ)
Paparazzi sleep at my door
I just thought that you should know (Sleep at my door)
Pockets frozen like the North Pole
Don't you freeze up on a pole

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
He got this on remote control like a sink in gold
He got it, no fight, no more meds, twilight in the game
He got it on my hover craft, have another laugh
Pop on a handstand, twilight in the man

[Chorus: Young Thug & Kanye West]
He got it on remote control
He got it on remote control
He got it on remote control, like that's to know
Should know

[Verse 1]
Baby mellow my mind
Make me feel like a schoolboy on good time
Jugglin' nickels and dimes
Satisfied with a fish on the line

[Bridge]
I've been down the road and I come back
Lonesome whistle on the railroad track
Ain't got nothin' on those feelings that I had

[Verse 2]
Somethin' so hard to find
A situation that can casualize your mind

[Harmonica Break]

[Verse 1]
Baby mellow my mind
Make me feel like a schoolboy on good time
Jugglin' nickels and dimes
Satisfied with a fish on the line

[Verse 1]
My life is changing in so many ways
I don't know who to trust anymore
There's a shadow running through my days
Like a beggar goin' from door to door
I was thinkin' that maybe I'd get a maid
Find a place nearby for her to stay
Just someone to keep my house clean
Fix my meals and go away

[Chorus]
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid
A man needs a maid

[Bridge]
It's hard to make that change
When life and love turns strange
And cold
To live a love
You gotta give a love
To give a love
You gotta be part of
When will I see you again?

[Verse 3]
A while ago somewhere I don't know when
I was watchin' a movie with a friend
I fell in love with the actress
She was playin' a part that I could undеrstand

[Chorus]
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid
A man needs a maid

[Outro]
When will I see you again?

[Verse 1]
It's too dark to put the keys in my ignition
And the morning sun is yet to climb my hood ornament
But before too long I might see those flashing red lights
Look out mama, 'cause I'm coming home tonight

[Chorus]
Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I've been standin' on this sound
Of some open hearted people going down

[Verse 2]
I'm not going back to Woodstock for a while
Though I long to see that lonesome hippie smile
I'm a million miles away from that helicopter day
No, I don't believe I'm be going back that way

[Chorus]
Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load

[Verse 1]
When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will you think of me and wonder if I'm fine?
Will your restless heart come back to mine
On a journey through the past?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?

[Verse 2]
Now I'm going back to Canada
On a journey through the past
And I won't be back 'til February comes
I will stay with you if you'll stay with me
Said the fiddler to the drum
And we'll keep good time on a journey through the past

[Outro]
When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?

[Verse 1]
Did I see you down in a young girl's town
With your mother in so much pain?
I was almost there at the top of the stairs
With her screamin' in the rain

[Chorus]
Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man

[Verse 2]
Did I see you walking with the boys?
Though it was not hand in hand
And was some black face in a lonely place
When you could understand?

[Chorus]
Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Will I see you give more than I can take?
Will I only harvest some?
As the days fly past, will we lose our grasp?
Or fuse it in the sun?

[Chorus]
Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man

[Verse 1]
I already know I'm letting go of something sacred
Drive us off the road, I take a good thing and I break it
Think it's in my soul the way I run from something real, no, I ain't changing
Wish I could surrender, give you everything I got and let you know

[Pre-Chorus]
Something 'bout the way you move me, yeah, yeah
Something 'bout the way you saved my life

[Chorus]
Something 'bout the way you hold my body tight even on my lowest nights
Locked down by my side even when I'm borderline
Yeah, I don't even know why I push you away
Something 'bout the way you

[Verse 2]
Call it what you want, I got a habit for destruction
Take all of your trust and then betray it like it's nothing
Yeah I think it's in my soul the way I run from something real and leave you wondering (Wondering)
Why I can't surrender, give you everything I got and let you know

[Pre-Chorus]
Something 'bout the way you move me, yeah, yeah
Something 'bout the way you saved my life

[Chorus]
Something 'bout the way you hold my body tight, even on my lowest nights
Locked down by my side even when I'm borderline
Yeah, I don't even know why I push you away
Something 'bout the way you hold my body tight, even on my lowest nights
Locked down by my side even when I'm borderline
Yeah, I don't even know why I push you away
Something 'bout the way you

[Outro]
The way you, way you move me
Way you move me
Yeah, yeah (Move me)
Yeah

[Intro: Kanye West]
I been waiting
For a minute
Pour out, ayy
Pour out, everyday, you know

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
I don't care, but I'm closer now
When I'm on, an' we gon' light the light up
Lift me up when I'm goin' down

[Verse: Kanye West]
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Had more than another episode
Last time I was down in Mexico
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times just to say don't test me, ho
Told you four times don't test me, ho
Now we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called "check-a-ho"
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called "check-a-ho"
And I...

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Kanye West]
I wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
Saturday night, I just might have to pipe up
You gon' have to get used to me
I wish I would let a hater fuck my life up (Ahh, ahh)
Can't let them get to me (Ahh, ahh)
Sunday night, I just might have to pipe up (Ahh, ahh)
You gon' have to get used to me (Ayy)

[Outro: Kanye West & Section 25]

[?] through the veil
And forget all of your cares
Throw them
Throw them away
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No, not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
Don't now, don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you (You can see through the veil)
They don't wanna see me love you (And forget all your cares)
They don't wanna see me love you (Throw them)
Throw them away
Ooh, life's a feeling, yeah
Ooh, the body is a feeling, yeah
The future is uncertain for us all, just know
Why make things worse?
Why make things worse?

[Verse 1]
Hello!
Would you care to come with me?
I got something that you 'gon like
I'm 'gon take you far away
Show you to the other side
We on that next level shit
Yeah I'm bout to blow yo mind

[Verse 2]
Don't be scared to come with me
I got something that you 'gon like
I'm 'gon take you far away
Show you to the other side
We on that next level shit
Yeah I'm bout to blow yo mind
Lights brighter then they ever been
Shine till the end of time

[Chorus]
Let's roll, oh oh
Until we lose control, oh oh
Let's roll, oh oh
Until we lose control, oh oh

[Bridge]
I feel free
I can see everything and beyond
I feel free
I can see more than I ever thought
I feel free
I can see everything and beyond
I feel free
I can see more than I ever
More than I ever thought

[Drop]

Let's roll, oh oh
Until we lose control, oh oh

[Outro]
Yeah!

[?]
Raise our tune!
Uh!

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs (can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole nеighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it bеfore you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (you're right)
Not over this shit (stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

[Hook: Eminem]
These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow
These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow
These v-

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog, then bail

[Hook: Eminem]
These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow
These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow
All these-

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker
Uh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?

[Verse 1]
Things were disappearing in my neighborhood
Once again somebody was up to no good
I saw that you were wanted, but not like I wanted you
And that's when I knew I had to be with you
And that's when I knew if I didn't, I'd be through
To end my grief I'd have to catch a thief
Your love was my relief, my love is your release

[Chorus]
Come into my window
It's open every night
That's where I'll be waiting
I'll keep off all the lights
I'm lying on my bed
Crown jewels on my head

[Verse 2]
I'd never give you up
So come in from the cold, let your guard down
I'd hide you from the cops
Don't be frightened now my love
I'll take the life of crime, all to make you mine

[Chorus]
Come in off that roof top
You're so handsome dressed in black
See you in the shadows
I'd like to see you on your back
Take this precious treasure
And I will treasure you

[Verse 3]
We'll run away my dear
Some place special have no fear
We'll even change our names
We'll be kinky, we'll be strange
I'll take a life of crime all to make you mine
All to catch a thief
Your love is my relief, my love is your release
Your love is my relief, my love is your release
All to catch a thief

[Verse: Eminem]
I sat back in the chair rasping
Barely able to breathe gasping at air grasping the bare aspirin
Saying a prayer askin' the lord to forgive while I'm tumbling down the stairs crashing
When a bunch of people stand around starin' laughing
Thinkin' I'm joking, dawg I'm choking
All of y'all can kiss my bare 

[...]
I'm staggering to a near trash bin
When I'm watching everything I ate in the last friggin' year passing
God I swear if you let me live I'll stop smoking weed immediately after this and prepare fasting
Woke up in the morning with the bear passing for life and named him the same since nightmarе happened
Gotchu lookin' scared rappin'
Whеn I step in the club like a two 

[???] and a ladies Nike air fashion

[Intro]

(You got me in love again and again and again and again)
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said "hello"
I knew that was the end of it all

[Chapter 1: Shattered Heart - Dua Lipa, Angèle, DaBaby, & Normani]

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy and I could take you for a ride
Usually, usually, usually
I don't pay no mind
And when it came down
Glitter in the sky
Glitter in my eyes
Shinin' just the way I like
Et je sais que j'essaye, que je perds du temps dans tes bras
I'm not really thinkin' clear
Too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left mе here
And I fill the floor with my sеquin tears?
Let's go, left foot, right foot, levitating (C'mon)
Pop stars, Dua Lipa with DaBaby
I had to lace my shoes for all the blessings I was chasin' (Go)
If I ever slip, I'll fall into a better situation
(I got new rules, I count 'em) (Break my heart)
(I gotta tell 'em to myself) (Break my heart)
(I got new rules, I count 'em)
Am I fallin' in love with the one that could break my heart?
I got new rules, I count 'em
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again (I'm levitating)
You, moonlight
You're my starlight
I need you all night (Tell me what you wanna do right now 'Cause I don't really wanna cool it down) (I'm levitating)
(Yeux, oui ça se voit)
La fièvre dans les yeux, oui ça se voit
(I've got a fever) I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco (Disco)
If it ain't me
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I fallin' in love with the one that could break my heart

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: Tyla Yaweh]

[…]
So numb
Need a heart to fill
Your scars, are so hard to heal

[Chorus: Post Malone]
You can keep the bullshit to yourself
I know you wanna keep me on the shelf

[…]

[Verse 1]
I'm a baby puppy dog
I can tell that my days are almost done
What am I trying to do?
Just know that I'm loving you

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you go

[Verse 2]
In the night, I feel it in her eyes
Love a bird, then you love to see it fly
Without them right by your side

[Refrain]
You don't gotta take control

[Chorus]
Said I want you to want me, oh
(And I want you to stay here)
But I'm feeling it in my bones
(You don't want it for later)
Can't choose to be like that, be like that
I can't choose to be like that, be like that

[Refrain]
Til my days are up and done

[Verse 3]
They don't owe, they don't owe, they don't owe a bit
They don't owe, they don't owe a thing to us
If you think that you're ever taking place of it
Let them go, let them do what they must

[Refrain]
People gotta find their way

[Chorus]
Said I want you to want me, oh
(And I want you to stay here)
But I'm feeling it in my bones
(You don't want it for later)
Can't choose to be like that, be like that
I can't choose to be like that, be like that

[Refrain]
Til my days are up and done

[Instrumental outro]
A capacitor can be defined as a primary storage device used for storing electric charges in an electric field, and capacitors tend to release them whenever required. Every electronic device that we use in our day-to-day life needs a capacitor for functioning, as it serves many applications

Applications of Capacitors

Capacitors are used in different ways to perform different functions according to the circuit of the device. There are many types of capacitors available, which have different values, large value range or maybe small value range. There is another variety of capacitors that may have different current capabilities, different stability levels, and maybe higher temperature coefficient states. For any electrical circuit, an appropriate capacitor is chosen for better functioning. These are the following applications of capacitors-


Energy Storage-  Storage of electrical energy is the first and the main application of a capacitor. It is performed when the capacitor is connected to an electric circuit. If suddenly the circuit gets disconnected from the capacitor, even then, the capacitor has the tendency to consume that stored amount of energy and work as a temporary battery. In case when batteries are changed in an electronic device, capacitors are used to control the power supply. It helps in the prevention of the loss of data

Pulsed power and weapons-  The construction of capacitors are made with low inductance and high voltage functions to complete electric current levels for pulsed powered devices. Pulsed powered devices are those, which usually hold electromagnetic gadgets, generators, pulsed lasers, and particle accelerators

Power conditioner-  Capacitors perform the functions of power conditioning, which is used for supplying power to ease the outcome of a complete or halfway rectifier. Capacitors also perform the functions of charging pump circles, as they generate high voltage. In any electronic device, a DC power circuit is connected with the capacitor in parallel to produce smooth current fluctuation for the signal

Correction of power factors- In any electronic device, power supply distribution is done through capacitor power factor correction. The capacitor units are measured as reactive power in the VAr unit. It is done to prevent inductive loading in appliances

Safety of capacitors-  Capacitors hold a large amount of energy, which must be controlled with all the precautionary measures; otherwise, it could be dangerous. The high energy level can build electrical shocks, and even the equipment can be destroyed if the capacitor gets disengaged

RF coupling and decoupling-  The RF coupling and decoupling is done in the same way as the capacitors, regular coupling and decoupling. But for RF applications, capacitors should have appropriate RF performance. For low-frequency capacitors, operations may be different

Smoothing capacitors applications- They are just like decoupling capacitors, and they are used usually in conjunction with a power supply. When the line signal is received from a transformer and a rectifier, the received waveform is not always smooth. It can range from zero to peak(endpoint)

[Verse 1]
I'm a lunatic, and a hypocrite
A lone star gone lost in vain
I'm a Kerouac, and a gunnysack
A fringe mad lad pre-ordained

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You don't have to pretend, friend
Darlin', what you feel
A message that we want to send
Along the glockenspiel

[Verse 2]
I'm a soft-tooth, and the cold truth
A heart slap through your wet man brain
I'm a biker's boot, and a nudist suit
A dirty member of the Golden Chain

[Chorus]
But on the bright side, there's a reason that we all must come to lose
On the bright side, I've got you
Well, on the bright side, there's a rеason that we all must come to bleed
On the bright sidе, you've got me

[Verse 3]
I'm a black fish, how to speak your wish
A mad tax that we all pay
I'm a medical, so theoretical
A lover's bed with another stain

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You don't have to pretend, friend
Darlin', what you feel
A message that we recommend
No matter what we steal

[Chorus]
But on the bright side, there's a reason that we all must come to lose
On the bright side, I've got you
Hit me, faker
Well, on the bright side, there's a reason that we all must come to bleed
On the bright side, you've got me

[Bridge]
Hold in your words
The things I've heard are so absurd, can we go far beyond the curve
The sight that we choose
We don't ever want to be afraid to win, afraid to lose

[Chorus]
But on the bright side, there's a reason that we all must come to lose
On the bright side, I've got you
But on the bright side, there's a reason that we all must come to bleed
On the bright side, you've got me
Listen to me, love

[Outro]
On the bright side, there's a day you come to find me in your hands
On the bright side, I'm your man

[Verse 1]
When I come to you, split this love in two
Overcome with fear but overdue
I set it free to let it move on

[Verse 2]
The crashing of your star, a fallen avatar
Goodbye wreckage now that we discard
Take it all so we can move on

[Verse 3]
And then I lost my grip, another sunken ship
Sinking into black and feeling sick
Now I know it's time to move on, on

[Chorus]
I don't want to go, I don't want to go
I don't want to go to outer space
I don't want to know anything so cold
I don't want to go to outer space again

[Verse 4]
Easy come they say, hard as fuck to stay
Disconnected from my future day
The past is killing me so move on

[Verse 5]
And if it don't make sense, verbal violence
Sitting in your ship and on the fence
I get it's wrong to let it move on, on

[Chorus]
I don't want to go, I don't want to go
I don't want to go to outer space
I don't want to know anything so cold
I don't want to go to outer space

[Outro]
I don't want to know when I lose control
I don't want to go to outer space again

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
All summer we hung 'round
On the streets of your hometown
I dreamed about us getting close
You dressing in your wedding clothes
All summer it went on
We got Kings of Leon on
In my mind, a tripped-out haze
As the hours turned into days, we were

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
Oh-ooh, ooh
Oh-ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I got drunk but fell in love
Love is a lethal drug
I got drunk and took too much
Love is a lethal drug

[Verse 2: SZA with Chris Martin]
All summer we belong
To the way we were addin' on
Feeling slowly sinking in
Lying back, watching Heaven spin
In my mind the patterns are
Biomorphic shooting stars
And I know, I'm lost to it
Just give me one, give me one more hit

[Pre-Chorus: SZA & Chris Martin]
Oh-ooh, ooh
Oh-ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Chris Martin with SZA]
I got drunk but fell in love
Love is a lethal drug
Fell down and picked it up
Love is a needle stuck
I just can't give you up, but you're coursing through my blood
I just can't get enough, love is a lethal drug
Love is a lethal drug

[Bridge: Chris Martin & SZA]
Oh-ooh, ooh
Oh-ooh, ooh
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (Ooh)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (Ooh)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do, you don't know what you do, oh

[Outro: Chris Martin with SZA]
I got drunk and fell in love
I fell down and I can't get up
I soared up, up my body floats
Love in a lethal dose
Love in a lethal dose
Love in a lethal dose

[Intro: T-Pain & (Kanye West)]
Welcome to the good life (Uh)
Welcome to the good life (The wave is over)
Welcome to the good life (And after all the talk all I got to say is)
Welcome to the good life (You're welcome, you're all welcome)

[Chorus: Kanye West & (T-Pain)]

Shit, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like NY, summertime Chi
Ah! (Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry!

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Yo, it's got to be 'cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's
50 told me, "Go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up"
The good life

[Chorus: Kanye West & (T-Pain)]
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine

[Verse 2: Kanye West & (T-Pain)]
Welcome to the good life!

The good life, so keep it comin' with the bottles
'Cause she feel booze like she bombed at Apollo

It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C
It feel like VA or the Bay or Yay
Ayy, this is the good life (Welcome to the good life)
Uh, homie, tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood?
(Welcome to the good life) Like I'm new in the hood
The only thing I wish, I wish a nigga would
(Welcome to the good life!) He probably think he could
But, but, I don't think he should (Uh, welcome to the good life)
50 told me, "Go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up"
The good life

[Chorus: Kanye West & (T-Pain)]

Ay (I'ma get on the TV, momma, I'ma
I'ma put shit down)
(Ayy) ayy (Ayy), ayy
(Ayy) ayy (Ayy), I'm good

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin' some brain?
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen Snakes on a Plane"
Whether you broke or rich, you gotta get this
Havin' money's not everything, not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas (Welcome the good life)
'Cause I always had a passion for flashin'
Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life

[Outro: T-Pain]
Ayy, it's the good life, better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmomma
Ain't the only girl callin' me "baby"
If you feelin' me now, then put yo' hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say
Hey (Hey), hey (Hey), hey, ooh, I'm good!
I never wanted you
To feel like that
Probably the wrong time
To take me back
I’m trying to solve
All of these problems
A in my head
But don’t you act so flawless, yeah
Don’t know what it was
But I made the wrong turn
I’ve been thinking of
Things to say but I can’t
Can’t even make it out
And baby I know the game
I know the play
But I’m faking now, baby
And if you wondering
If I love you, I do
Keep it real G
You ain’t never had
No nigga like me, yeah
Look me in my face
If you run away
We can’t finish what we made
Toxic, I know
But if you’re going to toss it
What’s the cost of it
No, no, no, no, no ,no

[Intro: Big Sean & A$AP Rocky]
Yeah
Two
Man, fuck these bitch ass niggas, man, that’s all I gotta say
Yeah
Flacko Jodye, nigga
Yeah
Ayy
This for all the welfare babies, I hope you well
If life’s fair, fare-, whatever, farewell
Whatever, fuck it, let’s go
Look
Yeah
(Hit-Boy)

[Chorus: Big Sean, MadeinTYO, & A$AP Rocky]
Okay, now, first off
If you not fucking with us, then you worst off
Celine drip, baby, take the purse off
Backstage, had to take the skirt off
Going so hard, I had to take my shirt off
My shirt off, shirt off, shirt off, shirt off, shirt off, shirt off, my shirt off

[Verse 1: Earrly Mac]
Yeah, yeah
Sex machine
Going in, come out clean
Pressure jeans
Extra pressurеd steam
Prince Hakeem, see my blimp from mezzaninе
She looked me in my eye, ate banana, what that mean? (Ayy)
Stupid fresh (Fresh)
Flexing chains and chest, yeah
East to west (West)
Get some rest on jets, yeah (I'm sleeping)
Ripped my verse and shirt
Went from broke to blessings
When we used to hit the stu', we had to use them basement steps

[Chorus: Big Sean, MadeinTYO, A$AP Rocky, & (Earlly Mac)]
Okay, now, first off (Ayy)
If you not fucking with us, then you worst off
Celine drip, baby, take the purse off
Backstage, had to take the skirt off
Going so hard, I had to take my shirt off (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
My shirt off, shirt off, shirt off, shirt off, shirt off, shirt off, my shirt off (Flacko Jodye, nigga, ayy)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, she let me slash in the shower, I had to go psycho
When I hit the stages, you know I need power
I'm 'bout to go Michael with no vitiligo
If I take her out, then this shit goin' viral
My life is a balancing act on a tightrope
With no safety net for my life, just a hearse, dawg

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
First off, gotta thank Sean for letting me get this verse off
Jump in the crowd, threw my shirt on her
She pull on my mic, I rehearse with her
Fuck around, do a whole verse with her
My chain swing like Herschel
Moschino's and a purse for her
Bunch of green books in my Murce' and all
I get chauffeured around like Mahershala
Bitch

[Chorus: Big Sean, MadeinTYO, & A$AP Rocky]
Okay, now, first off (Yeah)
If you not fucking with us, then you worst off
Celine drip, baby, take the purse off
Backstage, had to take the skirt off
Going so hard, I had to take my shirt off
My shirt off, shirt off, shirt off, shirt off, shirt off, shirt off, my shirt off

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
Take that shirt off
Anything to get it turned on (Anything to get it turned on)
Damn, boy, you're such a show off (Damn, boy, you're such a show off)
Skirt off like I drove off (Skirt off like I drove off)

[Verse 1]
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez
And it's Eastertime too
And your gravity fails
And negativity don't pull you through
Don't put on any airs
When you're waking down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some ugly women there
And they really make a mess outta you

[Verse 2]
Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move
My fingers are all in a knot
And I don't have the strength
To get up and take another shot
And my best friend, the doctor
Won't even tell mе what it is I've got

[Verse 3]
Sweet Melinda
The pеasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind and so gentle
Not to go to her too soon
And she steals your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon

[Verse 4]
Up on Housing Project Hill
It's either fortune or fame
You must choose one or the other
Although neither of them are to be what they claim
And if you're lookin' to get lucky
You better go back to from where you came
'Cause the cops don't need you
And, man, they expect the same

[Verse 5]
I started out on burgundy
But soon I hit the harder stuff
Rod's friends all said they'd stand behind me
If the game got rough
But the joke was on me
There was nobody even there to call my bluff
I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough

[Outro]
I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough
I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough

[Interlude]
This song's for you, Bob
Thanks for havin' Bobfest

[Verse 1]
If I was your girlfriend
Would you remember
To tell me all the things you forgot when I was your man?
Hey, hey, when I was your man

[Verse 2]
If I was your best friend
Would you let me take care of you
And do all the things that only a best friend can, oh
Only best friends can

[Refrain]
If I was your girlfriend
If I was your girlfriend

[Verse 3]
If I was your girlfriend
Would you let me dress you?
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
Not that you're helpless
But sometimes, sometimes
Those are the things that bein' in love's about

[Verse 4]
If I was your one and only friend
Would you run to me if somebody hurt you
Even if that somebody was me?
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
Please

[Refrain]
If I was your girlfriend
Uh-ah, ooh-hoo-hoo
If I was your girlfriend

[Breakdown]
Would you let me wash your hair?
Could I make you breakfast sometime?
Or then, could we just hang out, I mean
Could we go to a movie and cry together?
'Cause to me, baby, that would be so fine

[Verse 5]
(If I was your girlfriend)
Baby can I dress you?
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
(If I was your girlfriend)
Listen girl, I ain't sayin you're helpless
But sometimes, sometimes
Those are the things that bein' in love's about
(Sugar)
1, 'u-xx_large_top_margin': $height > 0}" style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block;">

[Breakdown]
Sugar, do you know what I'm saying to you this evening?
(Sugar)
Maybe you think I'm being
A little self-centered
(If I was your girlfriend)
But I, I said I want to be
(Sugar)
All of the things you are to me
(If I was your girlfriend)
Surely, surely you can see

[Spoken Outro]
Is it really necessary for me to go out of the room just because you wanna undress?
(If I was your girlfriend)
I mean, we don't have to make children to make love
And we don't have to make love to have an orgasm
(If I was your girlfriend)
Your body's what I'm all about
(If I was your girlfriend)
Can I see you?
I'll show you
(If I was your girlfriend)
Why not?
You can think it's because I'm your friend I'll do it for you
(If I was your girlfriend)
Of course I'll undress in front of you!
And when I'm naked, what shall I do?
(If I was your girlfriend)
How can I make you see that it's cool?
Can't you just trust me?
If I was your girlfriend you could
(If I was your girlfriend)
Oh, yeah, I think so
Listen, for you naked I would dance a ballet
(If I was your girlfriend)
Would that get you off?
Then tell me what will!
If I was your girlfriend, would you tell me?
(If I was your girlfriend)
Would you let me see you naked then?
Would you let me give you a bath?
(If I was your girlfriend)
Would you let me tickle you so hard you'd laugh and laugh
And would you, would you let me kiss you there
(If I was your girlfriend)
You know down there where it counts
I'll do it so good I swear I'll drink every ounce
And then I'll hold you tight and hold you long
(If I was your girlfriend)
And together we'll stare into silence
And we'll try to imagine what it looks like
Yeah, we'll try to imagine what, what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try to imagine what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try

Girls and boys!

He only knew her for a little while
But he had grown accustomed to her style
She had the cutest ass he'd ever seen
He did too, they were meant to be
They loved to kiss on the steps of Versailles
It looked like rain, mama, birds do fly

I love u baby, I love u so much
Maybe we can stay in touch
Meet me in another world, space and joy
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys

He gave her all the love that anyone can
But she was promised to another man
He tried so hard not to go insane
Birds do fly, looks like rain

I love u baby, I love u so much
Maybe we can stay in touch
Meet me in another world, space and joy
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys
Life is precious baby, love is so rare

[Verse 1]
Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residental
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half
I only call you when it's half
I only call you when it's half

[Verse 2]
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

[Bridge]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies (Hide your lies, oh, baby)
Only you to trust, only you

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half
I only call you when it's half
I only call you when it's half

[Verse 1]
I'm playin' that old country waltz
In this empty hall bouncin' off the wall
Ain't got no excuses, I just want to play
That good old country waltz

[Verse 2]
Well, I loved and I lost and I cried
The day that the two of us died
Ain't got no excuses, I just want to ride
While the band plays the old country waltz

[Harmonica Break]

[Bridge]
Out the window the moonlight shines on the roofs of the cars
While the bar serves tequila and salt
And the band plays the old country waltz

[Verse 3]
This old music has kept me on top
And when you're down it's a hard thing to stop
I don't need no excuses
I just want to play that good old county waltz

[Verse 4]
And I'm playin' it, that old country waltz
In this empty hall echoin' off the wall
Ain't got no excuses
I just want to play that good old county waltz

[Outro]
I ain't got no excuses
I just need to play that good old county waltz

[Verse 2]
Amy told me that she's gonna meet me up

I've seen her once or twice before, she knows my face
But it's hard to see with all the people standing in the way (Oh!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh
Tell me, have you seen her? 'Cause I'm so, oh

I just wanna go to the party she gon' go

Ha-ha-he-he-ha-ha-ho

[Chorus]
Love me, hate me, say what you want about me

Get you a vacuum, bitches is messy

After all of that surgery, you are still ugly
Now that is what gets me

I wish a bitch would upon a shooting star
You thought you witnessed my final coup de grâce
(Brrt), look up, we shootin' stars

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Sitting in the back of the Benz and my feet go up
Bitches don't come outside when the beef go up
But I love the way they mob when we roll up
These bitches bums, when I see them, they make me throw up
I wish a bitch would spin, I'm like, "Please show up"
When you talk to me, please don't bring a cheap ho up
You keep talkin' 'bout a bitch for the streets, grow up
'Cause you the type to say that shit and knock a freak ho up (Ugh)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I'm 'bout to make you regret you chose me as an enemy, bitch

We back on that Ewok
Percocets, gotta detox
Firearms gon' get restocked
Shooters hittin' that G-spot
Bitches imitate, please stop
Suck his dick like a freeze pop
First, he gotta give me top (Brrt)
Louis bag, oh, that Louis bag more colorful than a peacock
Weak niggas gotta get the boot, gotta get the boot with no treetop
He was like, "Who that? She bad," I was like, "Oh, that's bestie"
I could be all the way covered, it's still givin' sexy
I know they sleepin' on me, bitches got epilepsy
I don't do coke, little bitch, I don't even do Pepsi
Let's see
How you don't like me, but tryna do everything like me?
That is what gets me

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Fivio Foreign]
Sitting in the back of the Benz and my feet go up (Get money)
Bitches don't come outside when the beef go up (Take money)

[Pre Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Don't you ever tell me how I'm 'posed to feel now
I pour a cup and smoke my lungs out just to feel something
Nowadays, it's hard to tell the fake from real ones
Shit, all I ever wanted was some real love

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
They asked me why I put the money over everything
'Cause the money never hurt me
They asked me why I'm so closed off, don't say shit
'Cause I don't want no one to hurt me

Breath of fresh air
Wind beneath my wings
The breath of life is in me
I still ask what it does mean
A glimpse of something I can say
I'm n the corner of my eye
A flash of light
Your not human
Perfection means surprise
Happiness is an idea
A feeling I call my own
Fly away to a different place
In some places there exist thrones
Magic a mystery hidden as
Cold tales to chill the meaning as
A question is in the middle to say
What is the cost of different
Angel or demon the idea is the same
Between a vision and a dream
Existence so bland
Echo in the pages of history
Was it the destiny of man
Grow tall and
Say things in the manner of
For I too have stood with giants
Will it ever stop
Have you heard of

There are so many capacitors that one can't even say them all in a single breath. Well, if you want to try, then go ahead, take a shot at it. Once you are done, read further because today, we have one more capacitor to learn about

Oil-filled capacitors!

Falcon Capacitor, and its wide premium and excellent capacitors, there is one that you may don’t know much about, as much as you should. Well, that is going to be changed today. Here is everything you need to know about oil-filled capacitors
What arе Oil Filled Capacitors?

For years, oil-filled capacitors havе powered heavy-duty machines. For decades, they have been used in a variety of many different high-current as well as high-voltage applications. Such applications include ordinary and not so ordinary machines like motor-run, energy storage, and power factor correction

One has to be very precocious during the installation of Oil-filled capacitors. The maximum temperature for oil-filled capacitors is 90℃. They can function for a long time without losing capacitance value

Due to their longevity, oil-filled capacitors play a significant role in maintaining the speed of fans. It makes them a must for many high-end brand fans in the market

Oil filled capacitors from Falcon Capacitors are the epitome of premium quality. Constructed with the help of modern technology and innovative machinery, each capacitor is of the highest quality

History of oil-filled capacitors?

The history of capacitors goes way back to the 1700s when European experimenters found that electric charge can be stored in water filled glass jars. The first of its kind capacitors were known as Leyden jars

Over the years, their application has changed quite swiftly. Today they are used in electronic circuits to block direct current. They are now much lighter in weight and hold much more power as well. They also last longer due to the innovative technology that is used in their construction nowadays
Oil filled capacitors have seen a similar pattern of innovation and upgradation to suit the need of current times. Earlier, high voltage capacitors had things like petroleum oils and waxes. Constructed with mineral oil impregnated paper, oil filled capacitors now use a paper that is a strong fibre, all wood fibre, all wood-pulp type called kraft paper. Befort that linen based paper was used in around the early 1940s, which has a shorter lifespan

With time, oil filled capacitors have become more dependable due to constant advancement in technology over the years

Conclusion

Now that you are fully aware of oil filled capacitors, you can make a more informed choice on choosing the best one. When it comes to finding the most premium quality capacitors, there is only one destination that you need to be. For a long time, falcon capacitors have been exporting high-end premium capacitors

Romance never seems to be roses
Never happy endings, unless someone pretendin'
But sometimes it feels good to be lonely
Call it independence, done with this pretendin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I cut you off, don't call my line
It's not 'cause I'm on guard, but I
Been hurt one too many times
And that's the reason why

[Chorus]
I'm a selfish girl
I've gotta put myself first
'Cause I'm a selfish girl
I only want the whole world, oh, oh, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Can you handle that?
Can you handle that? Can you handle that?
Can you handle that?
No onе really can, no, no
Can you handle that?
Can you handle that? Can you handlе that?
Can you handle that?
No one really can, no, no

[Verse 2]
One hand in the air at the party
Stuck in sound and vision, something like religion, oh
Don't try to light something I've started
Yeah, you might be different, but I told you that we're finished, oh

I cut you off, don't call my line
It's not 'cause I'm on guard, but I
Been hurt one too many times
And that's the reason why

I'm a selfish girl
I've gotta put myself first
'Cause I'm a selfish girl
I only want the whole world, oh, oh, yeah

Can you handle that?
No one really can, no, no

[Bridge]
Hands up if you're selfish (What?)
Put your hands up if you're selfish, selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish (Put 'em up, put 'em up)
Put your hands up if you're selfish, selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish (Put 'em up, put 'em up)
Put your hands up if you're selfish, selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish (Put 'em up, put 'em up)
Put your hands up if you're selfish, selfish

[Chorus]
I'm a selfish girl
I've gotta put myself first
'Cause I'm a selfish girl
I only want the whole world

[Intro]
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I tell good lies when they ask me
But I cried all night in the backseat
No one knows what I feel inside (I used to know what I wanted)
My tears fell down at the party
Like water all on my body
No one knows when I'm really alright

[Pre-Chorus]
I pulled apart my feelings so raw (Oh, yeah)
Voices shout so loud, can't ignore (Every night, every night, yeah)
I used to think I knew what I wanted
I'm high enough from all the high pressure
I just wanna make myself better on—

[Chorus]
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday

[Verse 2]
I broke down in Paris (Yeah)
Tried to hide my emotions (Come home)
All flew out my body (Yeah)
But then I cried hard in the hotel
Did that show in London
And I passed out at the party
It doesn't make me happy
How can I not know what I need right now?

[Pre-Chorus]
Pulled apart my feelings so raw (Yeah, yeah)
Voices shout so loud, can't ignore (Every night, every night, yeah)
I used to think I knew what I wanted (I used to know what I wanted)
But I don't wanna feel the high pressure
I just wanna make myself better on—

[Chorus]
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday

[Outro]
Feel so high on the trampoline
Feel so high on the trampoline
Feel so high on the trampoline
Feel so high on the trampoline
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, Saturday, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, Saturday, yeah, yeah
...Saturday, yeah

[Intro]
I'm sorry if I—, I'm sorry if I—, I—, I—

[Verse]
I talked to you the way I talk to myself
I started taking you for granted and that's not right
Stopped saying "thank you" when I needed your help
But still I'm taking you for granted and that's not right

[Pre-Chorus]
I never really listen
But when you're gone a part of me is missing
I know it's complicated, we both feel the distance
I really hope that you'll forgive me one day

[Chorus]
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I only make it worse
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it hurts

[Bridge]
Floatin' in an atmosphere, hiding from the truth in fear
Slowly we both disappeared, now it seems so crystal clear
So in denial
Oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You never really listen
And when I'm gone a part of you is missing
I know it's complicated letting go of feelings
I really hope that you'll forgive me one day

[Chorus]
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I only make it worse
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it hurts, oh

[Outro]
Ooh
Oh, yeah, oh
I'm sorry if I—, I'm sorry if I—, I—
Oh

[Intro]
Oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no
Oh-woah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I might need a lot, I might need attention
I might wanna fight, I might not let it go
I love you so much, I'm so under pressure
You're choking my neck, you might not let me go

[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights are out and I feel a little low
That's when your noise is cruelest, when I really catch your bullets
Try to breathe it out 'cause I don't want it to hurt
It makes it harder when my name's on your shirt

[Chorus]
But I don't give a fuck what you think about me (Ah)
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do (Yeah)
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me (What?)
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you
I don't give a fuck what you think about me (No)
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do (Huh)
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I don't give a fuck what you think about me
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you (Fuck you)
I don't give a fuck what you think about me (Yeah)
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you (Fuck you)

[Verse 2]
When my blood is falling I can't see the light
I wanna prove a point 'cause it's in my design
We both got some demons to exorcise
Why say you hate me to feel alive? Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights are out and I feel a little low
That's when your noise is cruelest, when I really catch your bullets
Try to breathe it out, but when I talk, it makes it worse
It makes it harder when my name's on your shirt

[Chorus]
But I don't give a fuck what you think about me (Nah)
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do (No)
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you (Fuck you)
I don't give a fuck what you think about me
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do (No)
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I don't give a fuck what you think about me
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you (Fuck you)
I don't give a fuck what you think about me
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do (No)
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you (Fuck you)

[Outro]
Haha, haha
What you think about me
Fuck you
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
What you think about me
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Ah-ah
I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
Oh, I believe I can fly
Oh, fly
See, I believe that I can fly
Yes, I can
Hmmmm, oh
See, I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it it, I can achieve it with Jesus on my side

Yeah-Yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah
Knock knock, knocking on heavens door
Please open up, I can't take these streets no more
I heard of a saviour, who made a sacrifice
So that I may have my name in the book of life

Is anybody here?

Who goes there?

Here before you stands a broken man
And I need someone to take my hand

We don't welcome sinners in this place

But I am ready to surrender all
So please open up and save me from my faults
I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done
So can you please forgive me and deliver me from my ways?
Boy, you're a heartless thug

No

And we don't want you here

But I'm willing to change

Any man that is of that world won't be accepted here, go away

But I was led here by....


Ooooh, I
Open up and let me in

I can't believe it, it's you again
Go away!

No wait! But I was led here by the spirt of God

Only Christians here, go away!

Let me finish
But the spirt said the church was supposed to help me renew my heart
Sinner, go away!

Before you go throw stones at me, please somebody pray for me
Yeah-Yeah-Yeah

Go away!

But there's no where else to go for me but here

Quickly you helpless fool, get away from here

No

Go!

I can't believe it, the church

Robert?

Mama, is that you?

Yes
And I know what you're going through
Now son, tell me do you believe the truth?

Yes!

You're half way there

I've got so much to lose

But what does it profit the man to gain the whole world, then lose his soul?

Yes, I know but I've done all I can

Son, you can't depend on man
Believe in yourself
Those open doors they lie within you

Wait, mama
Don't go, no

Now it's all on me if I just believe
Yes, quit calling on man and call on Jesus
And just maybe
Jesus?

Glory, saviour reach out in heaven
Hallowed be thy name

Behold, it is I the kings of kings, lord of lords
Ruler of heaven and earth and all of the universe

Father, for I have sinned
And I kneel here before you, asking you to forgive me
And take me up out of this storm I'm in, please
Oh, please

Robert, I have heard your cry
Saw you toss and turn, all those sleepless nights

There is so much pain, yeah-oh

I feel your pain, I see your darkness
For you're not alone, nor are you heartless

Please, lead me oh lord until thy righteousness, hey!
And my enemies, make thy way straight before my fait, woah-woah

But first you have to trust in me only, son
With all thy might and only then I can turn your darkness into light

But father, I am weak!

Well, I will be your strength

And in my heart there is no peace!

For you'll find all that in me

I've got the weight of the world, it feels like a million tons

Know my hands are on you, son

But father, I am so confused and I don't know what to do

Be still
Now go down on your hands
Now lift your hands to me
Now all of you out there, lift your hands up with us, please
Now with a lil faith bout the size of a mustard seed
Do you believe that you can fly?

Yeah!

Then stand up and claim victory!

I can fly
(I can fly)
I can fly
(I can fly)
I can fly, hey!
(I can fly)

If I just spread my wings, see I can fly
(I can fly)
(Oh, you can fly, yeah)
I can fly, oooh!
I can fly
(I can fly)
Somebody touch somebody and say ''I can fly)
(I can fly)
Ooooh-Ooooh-Ooooh
(I can fly)
(Oh, you can)

I can flyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
(Oh, if you believe it, you're soar, and you'll see that)
(I can fly)

Listen, with God on my side, I know that I can fly
(Oh, you can fly)
(Oh, yes you can)
Can I put my balls
Way down deep inside your jaw?
Won’t you let me shove my balls
Inside your gaping maw?
In other words, suck my nuts
In other words, slurp these testes

Fill your jaw with my balls
And you will smile forever more
Balls are all you’ll long for
All you’ll worship and adore
In other words, eat my nads
In other words, swallow my sack

[Verse 1]
Fogged up the windows in the back
Coffee and menthol on your breath
Uppers and my heart never meshed
I hated coming down
But this feels the same without the bad things

[Chorus]
So whenever you want me I'll be around
I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound
Whenever you want me I'll be around
I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Cold beer and ice cream is all we keep
The only things we really need
'Cause I like dessert and alcohol
And watching as you get
Drunk and you're stumbling in the hall

[Chorus]
So whenever you want me I'll be around
I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound
Whenever you want me I'll be around
I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound
Oh, yeah

[Verse 3]
Look at your blue eyes like the stars
Stuck in the headlights of a car
You know I'll take you as you are
As long as you do me
So just let me lay here in your arms

[Chorus]
And whenever you want me I'll be around
I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound
Whenever you want me I'll be around
I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound
Whenever you want me I'll be around
I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound
Whenever you want me I'll be around
I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound
Oh, yeah

[Intro]
We started singing
We started singing
We started singing
This'll be the day that I...
We started singing
We started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I...
We started singing
This'll be the day that I...

[Verse 2]
Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tеlls you so? (If the Bible tells you so?)
Now do you bеlieve in Rock 'n' roll?
And can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

[Verse 3]
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

[Verse 4]
I was a lonely teenage bronking buck
With a pink carnation and a pick-up truck
But I knew that I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I...
This'll be the day that I die

[Verse 5]
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
Well, I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

[Verse 6]
Well now, in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire the most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
We started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I...
This'll be the day that I die...

[Post-Chorus]
We started singing
We started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I...
We started singing

[Outro]
This'll be the day that I die

[Intro: J. Cole]
Cole
Cole World
Yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wadn't nuttin' like that
Man, it wadn't nuttin' like that

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
First time, she was in my math class (Uh-huh)
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
Attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, "You ever had sex before?"
Damn…

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I wrote back and said
"Of course I had sex before," knowin' I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one, but
She don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'."
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up, I wrote back like
"Yeah, baby, sound like a plan."
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin
Fuck…

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, you know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'
And most of all I'm prayin', "God, don't let me bust quick"
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
On me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
"I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—"

[Chorus: J. Cole]
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 4: Queezy_the_Gangster]
As if I ain't ever did this before, no
I told her, "Imma love you," my whole hoe
Cole a fucking god to me, some promo
Fucking love this guy, bitch, no homo
Queezy in this bitch fucking in your hoes home
Smart girl, big brains, fucked her in her whole dome
Bitch, text me back saying "let's hit it on V-Day"
'Posed to be home alone, I told her, and what'd she say?
"I just wanna get some baby, please me, okay?"
Told her sure as long as I'm gettin' paid
She pulled up, kept it cool, kept some ships at bay
Talkng shit, threesome, she told me after, she kinda gay
She rode that dick like a horse, feed that bitch some hay
Didn't know I'd be getting bitches that just wanna get laid

[Bridge: Queezy_the_Gangster]
She said, I ain't never did this before, no
I can't say I've never did this before, no
Bitch ain't never did this before, no

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
No, I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
Lyrics from snippet:

Finally understand, really love you so
Love you underground, never let you go
Put me in the dirt and I'll hold your hand
Flowers up above, people looking down
Question my life and I have you in my mind
Deep in the ground when we’re lying side by side
For the rest of my life i'ma have you on my mind
Go so deep, water flow
Finally, love you so
Baby, I understand
Baby, I finally understand
Oh, oh (Understand)
Oh, oh, babyyy
I go hard, I go fast
And I never look back
I go speedin' on the highway
Burn rubber, no crash
Turn the volume up in the party
Put your hands up and dance
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and

Bounce, never sleep
Push it all on repeat
I go speedin' on the highway
Flame burning, tire screech
Turn the volume up in your bedroom
Put your hands up and scream
Bump, bump, lights go out
Go forever and ever and

Drop, body high
Blue and pink like the sky
I go speedin' on the highway
Vroom vroomin', might die
Turn the volume up in your Prius
Windows down and just vibe
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and еver and
Roll wit' your friends, out till 7 AM
Come on, meet mе on the highway
Smoke blowing, let's race
Turn the volume up on the speakers
Got that look on your face
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and

I go hard, I go fast
And I never look back
I go speedin' on the highway
Burn rubber, no crash
Turn the volume up in the party
Put your hands up and dance
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and

Bounce, never sleep
Push it all on repeat
I go speedin' on the highway
Flame burning, tire screech
Turn the volume up in your bedroom
Put your hands up and scream
Bump, bump, lights go out
Go forever and ever and
Drop, body high
Blue and pink like the sky
I go speedin' on the highway
Vroom vroomin', might die
Turn the volume up in your Prius
Windows down and just vibe
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and

Roll wit' your friends, out till 7 AM
Come on, meet me on the highway
Smoke blowing, let's race
Turn the volume up on the speakers
Got that look on your face
Bump, bump, in the rave

I go speedin' on the highway
Burn rubber, no crash

Bump, bump, in the rave (It's Charli, baby)
Go forever and ever and (It's Charli)
Bounce, never sleep

Laying in silence
You were a diamond, bright
Yeah, touching my fingertips
Melting into the night, oh

Prison cell in your mind
Kisses fall on her lips
Kisses that should've been mine, yeah

Who you love, who you love

I know I'm losing you, so come on, tell the truth
Don't you tell me you're sorry, don't pretend you still want me
'Cause I don't wanna know, I already know
What you've donе, what you've done
What you've donе, what you've done, ooh, ooh
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Fighting the tears back
Fighting to make you stay
Screaming at angels
Holding a wall in my brain, yeah
Secrets are locked up
Prison cell in your heart, yeah
Kisses fall on her lips
The memory's left behind

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know

Lavender Lamborghini, roll up in a blue bikini
Bitches on the beaches, lookin' super cute and freaky
All my friends are princesses, we keep it whipped and creamy
Ice cubes on our tongues because we like to keep it freezy, c’mon
Lavender Lamborghini, get out on the right side
Chauffeur stayed at home because my girl wanted to ride
Lookin' luxe and tastin' plush, I'm feelin' so alive
Want to take it to the highway, come on, let's go for a—
Sing it

[Pre-Chorus]
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time

All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, c’mon
So let's ride

[Verse 2]
Bubblegum-pink Ferrari, yeah, I'm so bossy
Speedin' like Alonso just to crash your party
People are goin' loco when I'm pullin' up, takin' your papi
Don't think about consequences 'cause they're never gonna stop me, what?

[Pre-Chorus]
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time
(Let me ride, let me ride)
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time
So let me ride, let me ride

Boom, boom, boom
Hear me comin' through the radio
Watch me go zoom, zoom, zoom
Try to catch me, but you're too slow
Boom, boom, boom
Hear me comin' through the radio
Know they can't catch me
Watch me go zoom, zoom, zoom
Try to catch me, but you're too slow
Too slow, too slow

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
I have to go, I'm so sorry, but it feels so cold in here
I am just now realizing they don't care
I try real hard, but I'm caught up by my insecurities
Pour me one more, yeah, watch the ice melt in my fist (Hey)

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they making me feel lately
They making me weird, baby, lately
I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they making me loathe
They making me loathe, yeah

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Christine and the Queens]
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Don't search me in here, I'm already gone, baby
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love?

[Verse 2: Christine and the Queens & Charli XCX]
I would lay down (Lay down)
But they staring, their eyes like two shining stones
I see myself (Myself), and I look scared and confused (Sing it)
Wait, did they just talk? Why is it too loud? (Is it loud?)
Do they wish to run through me? (Me)
Am I a smoke? Am I the sun? And who decides? (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Christine and the Queens & Charli XCX]
I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they making me feel lately
They making me weird, baby, lately
I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they making me loathe
They making me loathe, oh, mmm (Yeah)

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Christine and the Queens]
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Don't search me in here, I'm already gone, baby (Baby)
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Don't search me in here, I'm already gone, baby

[Bridge: Charli XCX & Christine and the Queens]
(Cruels endroits)
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Ne me cherche pas, je ne suis plus là, baby
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Ne me cherche pas, je ne suis plus là (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why do we? Ah

[Outro: Charli XCX, Christine and the Queens & Both]
Keep, keep, k-keep the water running
Keep, k-keep, k-keep, k-keep the water run
Keep, k-keep, k-keep the
Keep, keep the, keep
Keep
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Keep, keep, keep
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?

Keep, keep, keep
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Keep, keep, keep
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Don't search me in here, I'm already gone, baby

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Built a world all in my mind
All on my own, will I survive? Oh

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Century of tears
Sadness was my only smile, yeah
So I fall apart
But you're gone and I'm doing fine
Sing it to me!
I'm screaming out

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Ooh, ooh

Melt me down one piece at a time
I seal thеse eyes widе shut
I wasn't mesmerized, no

Century of tears
Sadness was another denial, yeah
Thought I'd fall apart
But now you're gone, I'm doing fine
I'm screaming out (C’mon)

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Ooh, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
When you're not around, when you're not around, ooh

I said, “Austin, are you fucking with me?”
Charli

[Song Intro: Charli XCX]
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason (No, no)
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Tell me the reason (Yeah)
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason
Why you won't open up

Tequila on your tongue
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Why, why, why?
Don't you lie, what do you want?
Fall in love, ah, risk it all

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Tell me what you want
'Cause I know that you're lonely on your own
We're out in L.A. for a month
I don't think I can hide my emotions no, no more (Uh-huh)
A late night, say you want me, say you're selfish
Think about my body, then two-time
Say you want her? Do you want her?
Doesn't do it like me, no
So hot, burn the place down
Give you what you need

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
So you gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
(Why we can't fall in love)

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Why, why, why?
Don't you lie, what do you want?
Fall in love, ah, risk it all

[Verse 2: HAIM]
Make me wanna fall in love
Baby, make mistakes
Hit me with a champagne kiss
And now I'm not thinkin' straight
Look at the skyline high
I look up, I wish I saw your face
I wanna fall in love
Jump in the deep end
'Cause deep down, you're d-dying
Tell me you're kinda nervous
Tell me you feel the same
I wish it was more than surface
I wish I could feel nothing
Come give me everything
Burn down and go again

[Chorus: HAIM]
So you gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
And you gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love

[Outro: HAIM & Charli XCX]
Ooh, baby
Why, why, why
Tell me, tell me, tell me the reason
Know you lie, what do you want
Tell me, tell me, tell me the reason
Fall in love, ah, risk it all, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Tell me the reason
Tell me the reason, oh yeah
You gotta tell me the reason
Tell me the reason
Tell me the reason
Tell me the reason

[Live Intro: Charli XCX]
How you guys doin’, you good?
Austin was one of the first tours that sold out for this tour
So I’m so fuckin’ happy to be here
You all look fuckin’ beautiful tonight
I don’t know if you saw this tweet that I did the other day
But I was like, you know what? All the Angels, they got good make up and they got good fuckin’ style and they’re good fuckin’ people
I’m proud that we’re all in it together, you know?
Like, you guys can go hard on the internet sometimes, who can’t?
But I know you’ve got me and I’ve got you too
And I fucking love you forever, I really do
Is anybody here part of the LGBTQ community?
I fuckin’ love you guys and I wouldn’t be herе without you
So, thank you so much for coming to this show
It means everything to mе
Alright, let’s keep this party going
Alright, you ready? I said, “Austin, you ready?”
Hey

[Intro: Charli XCX]
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse: Charli XCX & Clairo]
Know I keep on saying I'm alright
But every single night
When I cut off the lights
I feel like crying
Your picture revolving in my mind
But then it turns to white
I guess I'll go in blind
I feel like crying
Hope you can forgive all of my crimes
You read, but won't reply
I just need your reply
I feel like crying
Baby, all I need's a single night
A sign, a sign, give me a sign

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Sorry I broke you down
Sorry I tore your heart
I ripped it all apart
Your headlights in the dark
Sorry 'bout Grammy night
Was flyin' out my mind
Was in a different place
Tortured and drifting by
Kept dancing in that house
The windows turned to black
My windows turned to black
My eyes were rolling back, yeah
Hope I get one more chance
Hope I get one more call
I only know what's good once I have lost it all
Lost it all, lost it all, lost it all
Lost it all, lost it all, lost it all

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Hope you can forgive the things I've done
(Things I've done, things I've done)
Hope you can forgive the things I've done
(Things I've done, things I've done)
Hope you can forgive the things I've done
(Things I've done, things I've done)
Hope you can forgive the things I've done
(Things I've done, things I've done)
Reply, reply, give me a sign
Yeah

[Outro: Yaeji]
소-소-소심했던 나의
그 한 마디
미안하다고
사과하고 싶어도
너무 늦은 걸까?

[Chorus]
Drivin' 'round in Hollywood, I can only think 'bout you
Everlasting pain and it weighs on my body, it's you
Did I lose it all? Did I fuck it up?
Are my friends really friends now or are they far gone?
On the drugs at a bar, took 'em all
Can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Fucked up, I just wanna break glass
Phone calls, I just wanna talk back
Yeah, big attitude, just like a big stack
Braindead for days, am I gonna relapse? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna talk
I don't wanna smile, no, no
Got a couple problems
I don't wanna compromise, no, no (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I'm drivin' 'round in Hollywood
I can only think 'bout you, you (Think 'bout, think 'bout)
Everlasting pain and it weighs on my brain, like you
Did I lose it all? Did I fuck it up?
Are my friends really friends now or are they far gone?
On the drugs at a bar, took 'em all
Can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 2]
Don't stop, I just wanna go fast
No sleep, I don't wanna relax
10 planes in five days, I been 'round the world and back again
Man I feel insane, I'm numb, can't stop the pain, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna talk
I don't wanna smile, no, no
Got a couple problems
I don't wanna compromise, no, no

[Chorus]
Drivin' 'round in Hollywood, I can only think 'bout you
Everlasting pain and it weighs on my body, it's you
Did I fuck it up?
Are my friends really friends now? Are they all far gone? (Yeah)
On the drugs at a bar, took 'em all
Can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Don't say you love me 'cause I can't say it back
Don't say you're sorry 'cause you've done nothing bad
Swallow my feelings, but won't swallow my pride
You know I've got a suit of armor on, you'll never see me cry
I hate the silence (Ah-ah), that's why the music's always loud
So many problems (Ah-ah), I try to drown 'em out
1000 bottles (Ah-ah), collecting souvenirs
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the only good inside of me is you

[Pre-Chorus]
I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Woah

[Chorus]
Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you

[Verse 2]
You're so forgiving (Ah-ah), my friends think you're the best
From the beginning (Ah-ah), your friends said it wouldn't last
But this connection (Ah-ah), it's something they don't see
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the best damn part of me was always you

[Pre-Chorus]
I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Woah

[Chorus]
Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you

[Bridge]
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
One day I'll pull through and I'll be good enough
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
Oh, your love, yeah
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
One day I'll pull through and I'll be good enough
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
Oh, your love

[Chorus]
Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you
All I know is I don't deserve you
All I know is I don't deserve you
All I know is I don't deserve you

[Intro]
Thank you so much
This song is called Official

[Verse 1]
Hard to read, you could be OCD
You could be bad for me, you could say anything
Sometimes I get a bit TMI, little bit scared of heights
Little afraid to say
You know the things that make me smile
The face I make before my tears fall down
The things that I feel when you're acting suspicious
You know the place I run to hide
I take my problems there to work 'em out

[Chorus]
The things that I say when you don't wanna listen
The things that you say when I make bad decisions
The things that we do by thе sink in my kitchen
I remembеr our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

[Live Interlude]
You guys sound good

[Verse 2]
Look at us, isn't it obvious?
Is it so dangerous? Is it so complicated?
You know the shapes my body makes
Under the sheets at 4 AM with you
The things that we break when we're switchin' positions
You know the words to my mistakes
You understand because you made 'em too

[Chorus]
The things that I say when you don't wanna listen
The things that you say when I make bad decisions
The things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

[Bridge]
All of the things that we sometimes forget
All of the dreams that you put in my head
I'm still asleep, but there's breakfast in bed
These are the things that could make us official
Maybe the sky might not always be blue
All of my wishes will never come true
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm here with you
This stuff could make us official
So tell all your friends 'cause we're goin' official
Hey

[Chorus]
Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official
Sing it back to me, c’mon!
These are the things that could make us official
Let me hear you sing it
These are the things that could make us official
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

Work it
Oh, it's a migraine, make them pupils dilate
Wanna watch it gyrate, ass is on a tirade
Make you pop a Tylenol, split your head and call it off
Got you drinking water when you should be drinking alcohol
Faster than an Adderall, make you shake your Audemars
Shake it, shake it, shake it, make you spray it like an aerosol
(Shake it like a dog)
I don't shake it like that, mm

I don't shake it like that, uh

[Verse 2: CupcakKe]
I shake it like Jamaican
No birthday, but I'm cakin'
I shake it like I'm tryna get the oil off of the bacon
If I need wakin', I'ma alarm that shakin'
This ass 'bout to move like I need the house vacant
It move, move, move, and you know it won't stop
It shakin' like I'm pulled over by a white cop
It shakin' like a virgin, 'bout to give up the box
Told 'em this ass a miracle, like my name Watts
I be purgin' shit, never nervous, bitch
I get on top of that dick, shake it like turbulence
You haven't heard from 'em since, I'm a different expense
And now this pussy need Staples like I'm fuckin' on Vince
Told 'em paddle, paddle, paddle 'cause this pussy in Seattle
I'ma fight my own battles, shake it harder than a rattle
He get in it, then he tackle, wanna bite it like a apple
And this pussy so juicy, when I cum it's made of Snapple, ayy

[Interlude: Brooke Candy]
Brooke muthafuckin' Candy, Charli XCX
Miss CupcakKe is on this muthafuckin' track, oh

[Verse 3: Brooke Candy]
Tell me what you want, tell me what you want, daddy
Little bit of sugar, little bit of Brooke Candy
Cocaine-colored sheets where my ass bouncin' (Bounce)
'Bout to turn your mansion to the pussy palace
And shake it on ya like my ass on the Richter scale
My pussy crucify your body, it's the holy grail
My pussy lean, I got you sippin' from the two cup
I'm 'bout to shake my ass like I'm in a strip club
Hey, my ass is Magic City
Double Ds, all-natural big titties
Shake it like a box-fresh vibrator
Ass first-class, fast like Concorde
Damn, my ass so insane
Put me in a straightjacket, still you ain't safe
You can't handle all the jelly, put it on a plate
I'm 'bout to shake and leave you shook, like Beyoncé

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Pabllo Vittar]
(Shake it, I shake it, I sh- I shake it)

Oh darling, you say you don't know me?

(Pabllo Vittar)

[Verse 4: Pabllo Vittar]
Pra começar direito eu soletro pra você
Rainha se escreve com dois L e dois T
Como estagiário no trabalho, eu tô sem tempo
Se tenho um problema eu resolvo com talento
Dedinho na boca, sou uma tentação
A pista pega fogo derretendo o paredão
Já mostrei que eu sou queen, falo sério pra vocês
A coroa é pesada, mas eu me acostumei
I shake it, I shake it, o meu popozão
I shake it, I shake it, aguentar essa pressão
Do MA, cheguei em LA
É a Pabllo e a Charli mais uma vez

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Pabllo Vittar]
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh

Pull up, pull up to the party

Have you heard her? Have you seen her?)

[Verse 3: CupcakKe]
Got a couple of bitches that want my attention
They actin' real vicious, but I'm not offеnded
They lurkin' like witnеsses, money I'm gettin'
Could drop an ice tray and I still won't be slippin'
(Got) Another check comin' in
(Got) A couple checks I ain't spend
(Got) Fat pockets, need a gym
(I) Made it possible like Kim
Today, I got great times
Square it out like FaceTime
Yellow tape around the body
But not measurin' waistlines (Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!)
Zero fucks, the amount (What?)
Zero bucks in your account (You broke!)
So many offers on the table (What?)
A bitch gotta eat on the couch

Consigo o que eu quero se rebolo assim
Não existe ninguém aqui igual a mim, não, não
Todos querem sim (Todos querem sim)
Me chamam de queen (Me chamam de queen)

Do you feel alright?
Do you need me by your side?
We go out all night
Makes the pain hurt a little less
Do it one more time
'Cause it feels so justified
We go out all night
See you fall, pick you up again

[Pre-Chorus]
If your eyes are sad, it makes me sad too
You got me so overprotective, it's true
Feel like I would jump off buildings for you
It's okay, I'll watch you cry all night
I promise I won't let you go

[Chorus]
I'll pull you close, so close, so close
I'll never let you go, you know
Head on my chest, a silver cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go
I'll pull you close, so close, so close
I'll never let you go, you know
Head on my chest, a silver cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go
Never let you go-o-o

[Interlude]
Austin!

[Verse 2]
Lie awake till dawn (Oh, oh)
We're face to face and palm to palm
Do you feel okay?
All your problems are far away (So far away)
Lying till it's true (Oh, oh)
It's alright, I'm trusting you
Do you feel okay?
Take a breath, make you feel safe

[Pre-Chorus]
If your eyes are sad, it makes me sad too
You got me so overprotective, it's true

I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys (XCX)
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse 1]
I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
That one from work can come over on Monday night
I want 'em all, I want 'em all
And when they finally leave me, I'm all alone but
I'm lookin' down and my girls are blowin' my phone up
Them twenty questions, they askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
I had to trash the hotel lobby

[Chorus]
But I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse 2]
In every city I've got one with differеnt ringtones
Flyin' from L.A. all the way to Puerto Rico
My girls arе callin' me askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like

Don't be mad, don't be mad at me (No, no, no, no)
Darling, I can't stop it even if I wanted
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me (No, no, no, no)
Missed what you were sayin', I was miles away, yeah
Don't be mad, don't be mad
Not like I had a choice
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys

[Chorus]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys

Feelin' cool in my youth, I'm askin'
"Does anyone remember how we did it back then?"

Uh, uh, (Uh, come on)

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G. (Diddy)]
Ha, sicker than your average, Poppa twist cabbage off instinct
Niggas don't think shit stink
Pink gators, my Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn (That’s right)
Dead right, if the head right, Biggie there e'ry night
Poppa been smooth since days of Underoos
Never lose, never choose to, bruise crews who
Do somethin' to us, talk go through us (Come on, do it)
Girls walk to us, wanna do us, screw us
Who, us? Yeah, Poppa and Puff (He, he)
Close like Starsky and Hutch, stick the clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M-3 (Take that, take that, take that, ha ha!)
Bang every MC easily, busily
Rеcently niggas frontin’, ain't sayin' nothin' (Nothin')
So I just speak my piecе, keep my peace (Come on)
Cubans with the Jesus piece, with my peeps (Thank you)
Packin', askin', "Who want it?", you got it, nigga, flaunt it
That Brooklyn bullshit, we on it

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I put hoes in NY onto DKNY (Uh-huh)
Miami, D.C. prefer Versace (That's right)
All Philly hoes go with Moschino (Come on)
Every cutie with a booty bought a Coogi
Now who's the real dookie? Meaning, who’s really the shit?
Them niggas ride dicks, Frank White push the six
Or the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass, tints if I want some ass
Gonna blast, squeeze first, ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin' about blunts and broads
Tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars
I'll still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment (Uh-uh)
At my arraignment, note for the plaintiff
"Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement"
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy (Not Guilty)
Richer than Richie, 'til you niggas come and get me (Come on)

[Chorus: Pamela Long]

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I can fill you with real millionaire shit (I can fill ya)
Escargot, my car go one-sixty, swiftly (Come on)
Wreck it, buy a new one
Your crew run-run-run, your crew run-run
I know you sick of this, name brand nigga with
Flows, girls say he's sweet like licorice
So, get with this nigga, it's easy (Uh-huh)
Girlfriend, here's a pen, call me round ten
Come through, have sex on rugs that's Persian (That's right)
Come up to your job, hit you while you workin'
For certain, Poppa freakin', not speakin'
Leave that ass leakin', like rapper demo
Tell them ho take they clothes off slowly (Slowly)
Hit 'em with the force like Obi (Obi)
Dick black like Toby (Toby)
Watch me roam like Romey (Romey)
Lucky they don't owe me
Where the safe? Show me, homie (Say what, homie)

[Chorus: Pamela Long]
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me

Close like Starsky and Hutch, stick the clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M-3 (Take that, take that, take that, ha ha!)
Bang every MC easily, busily
Rеcently niggas frontin', ain't sayin' nothin' (Nothin')
So I just speak my piecе, keep my peace (Come on)
Cubans with the Jesus piece, with my peeps (Thank you)
Packin', askin', "Who want it?", you got it, nigga, flaunt it
That Brooklyn bullshit, we on it

[Chorus: Pamela Long]
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see? (Uh-huh)
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me (Hypnotize)

All Philly hoes go with Moschino (Come on)
Every cutie with a booty bought a Coogi
Now who's the real dookie? Meaning, who's really the shit?
Them niggas ride dicks, Frank White push the six
Or the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass, tints if I want some ass
Gonna blast, squeeze first, ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin' about blunts and broads
Tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars
I'll still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment (Uh-uh)
At my arraignment, note for the plaintiff
"Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement"
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy (Not Guilty)
Richer than Richie, 'til you niggas come and get me (Come on)

Escargot, my car go one-sixty, swiftly (Come on)
Wreck it, buy a new one
Your crew run-run-run, your crew run-run
I know you sick of this, name brand nigga with
Flows, girls say he's sweet like licorice
So, get with this nigga, it's easy (Uh-huh)
Girlfriend, here's a pen, call me round ten
Come through, have sex on rugs that's Persian (That's right)
Come up to your job, hit you while you workin'
For certain, Poppa freakin', not speakin'
Leave that ass leakin', like rapper demo
Tell them ho take they clothes off slowly (Slowly)
Hit 'em with the force like Obi (Obi)
Dick black like Toby (Toby)
Watch me roam like Romey (Romey)
Lucky they don't owe me
Where the safe? Show me, homie (Say what, homie)

Watch me roam like Romey (Romey)
Lucky they don't owe me
Where the safe? Show me, homie (Say what, homie)

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G. (Diddy)]
Uh, uh, (Uh, come on)

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G. (Diddy)]
Ha, sicker than your average, Poppa twist cabbage off instinct
Niggas don't think shit stink
Pink gators, my Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn (That's right)
Dead right, if the head right, Biggie there e'ry night
Poppa been smooth since days of Underoos
Never lose, never choose to, bruise crews who
Do somethin' to us, talk go through us (Come on, do it)
Girls walk to us, wanna do us, screw us
Who, us? Yeah, Poppa and Puff (He, he)
Close like Starsky and Hutch, stick the clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M-3 (Take that, take that, take that, ha ha!)
Bang every MC easily, busily
Rеcently niggas frontin', ain't sayin' nothin' (Nothin')
So I just speak my piecе, keep my peace (Come on)
Cubans with the Jesus piece, with my peeps (Thank you)
Packin', askin', "Who want it?", you got it, nigga, flaunt it
That Brooklyn bullshit, we on it

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I put hoes in NY onto DKNY (Uh-huh)
Miami, D.C. prefer Versace (That's right)
All Philly hoes go with Moschino (Come on)
Every cutie with a booty bought a Coogi
Now who's the real dookie? Meaning, who's really the shit?
Them niggas ride dicks, Frank White push the six
Or the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass, tints if I want some ass
Gonna blast, squeeze first, ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin' about blunts and broads
Tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars
I'll still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment (Uh-uh)
At my arraignment, note for the plaintiff
"Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement"
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy (Not Guilty)
Richer than Richie, 'til you niggas come and get me (Come on)

[Chorus: Pamela Long]

I can fill you with real millionaire shit (I can fill ya)
Escargot, my car go one-sixty, swiftly (Come on)
Wreck it, buy a new one
Your crew run-run-run, your crew run-run
I know you sick of this, name brand nigga with
Flows, girls say he's sweet like licorice
So, get with this nigga, it's easy (Uh-huh)
Girlfriend, here's a pen, call me round ten
Come through, have sex on rugs that's Persian (That's right)
Come up to your job, hit you while you workin'
For certain, Poppa freakin', not speakin'
Leave that ass leakin', like rapper demo
Tell them ho take they clothes off slowly (Slowly)
Hit 'em with the force like Obi (Obi)
Dick black like Toby (Toby)
Watch me roam like Romey (Romey)
Lucky they don't owe me

[Intro]
Oh
Oh, oh
Baby, lately
Baby, yeah

[Verse 1]
The walls are all gone, did we melt 'em down? (Baby)
Liquid in my hands, liquid in my mouth (Oh)
Footage on my phone, did it with your tongue (Oh)
And now we're sticking close, and I understand

[Chorus]
That baby, I love you bad
'Cause lately, I finally understand
That maybe this feeling that I've found
Might kill me, put me in the ground

[Verse 2]
I finally understand, finally understand
My therapist said I hate myself really bad
You tell me it's fine, let me cry and hug it out

[Chorus]
That baby, I love you bad
'Cause lately, I finally understand
That maybe this feeling that I've found
Might kill me, put me in the ground

Please don't look at my diamonds
Bustdown patek came with some water, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fly as a jet

Pull you close, and then, I'll be gone
Sorry, never say sorry

Switch your faith and leave you so low
Hurt me, know you'll never hurt me
I'm about to detonate
Pull you close, and then, I'll be gone

Why should you trust me?

And I'm waiting for you by the window, yeah
Called your digits, but the phone kept ringin'

In the water, splash around and get you blessed like holy water
I don't know what you were waiting for
You know that I've been waiting for you
I only threw this party for you
If you saw my tears, would you touch me?
Kiss me on the mouth, say you love me?
Leave a message, tell me you're sorry?
Hit me right back, hit me right back
Why you treating me like someone that you never loved?

We took a dive in the blue, scared to lose
All my feelings, feelings, feelings for you
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, now we gotta let this go
Drove the car off the road

Drove the car right off the road
I hope you get some time to grow, yeah

[Verse 1: Shakira]
Who would've thought that you could hurt me?
The way you've done it
So deliberate, so determined
And since you have been gone
I bite my nails for days and hours
And question my own questions on and on

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira]
So tell me now, tell me now
Why you're so far away
When I'm still so close

[Chorus: Shakira]
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry" ("I'm sorry")
You said you would love me until you die
And as far as I know, you're still alive, baby
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry" ("I'm sorry")
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal
DbTo deceive a woman's heart

[Verse 2: Shakira]
I tried so hard to be attentive
To all you wanted
Always supportive, always patient
What did I do wrong?
Been wondering for days and hours
It's clear, it isn't here where you belong

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira]
Anyhow, anyhow
I wish you both all the best
I hope you get along

[Chorus: Shakira]
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry"
You said you would love me until you die
And as far as I know you're still alive, baby
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry"
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal
To deceive a woman's heart

[Guitar Solo: Carlos Santana]

[Chorus: Shakira]
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry" ("I'm sorry")
You said you would love me until you die
And as far as I know you're still alive, baby
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry" ("I'm sorry")
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal
To deceive a woman's heart

[Outro: Shakira]
Open heart, open heart
It should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart
Open heart, open heart
It should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart

And you're all about the chase
But you won't ever let me catch you
And I wish I was the same
But I know I'm gonna let you
In again and when I do
It's gonna hurt like hell
And you don't mean to
That's what I tell myself
But why you gotta be so heartless?

Taking milеs from inches
Leave me in the darkness
Never finish what we started

I been up all night
Waitin' for the right time, I don't wanna go
I'm not ready to go
We could both talk about the past
But why we do that? We don't wanna know
Just we don't wanna know
I woke up an hour before you ordered breakfast
I pack my shit so I'm ready to go
When you're ready to go
It's not that I felt this way
Just I got used to puttin' on a show
But I want you to know

[Chorus]
I don't wanna tell you lies
I know you don't deserve it
My head laying on your heart
I known it from the start
That all the time be worthy
You got me in your arms
We've taken this too far
I'm thinkin' 'bout the good vibes
We're dying with the star
You're making this too hard
'Cause you're givin' me the good vibes

[Verse 2]
We've been up all night
Talkin' 'bout your flight
You kiss me, say, "I'll miss you so"
But I don't want you to go
And you've got me feeling some type of way
And I usually don't let my feelings show
But I want you to know

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve known all my life
So when you’re letting me go

[Chorus]
I don't wanna tell you lies
I know you don't deserve it
My head laying on your heart
I've known it from the start
That all the time be worthy
You got me in your arms
We've taken this too far
I'm thinkin' 'bout the good vibes
We're dying with the star
You're making this too hard
'Cause you're givin' me the good vibes

[Bridge]
I've waited to lie here with you
It's better than I could imagine
It's so much more beautiful than in my dreams
And it seems just the beginning

[Outro]
And I don't want it to wait
Don't wanna let you leave again
I found myself in your reflection
If that’s the way it should be
I'm being honest about my intentions
Don't leave without leaving with me
Goodbyes and vibrations
Goodbyes and vibrations
Goodbyes and vibrations
Goodbyes and vibrations

[Intro: Adam Levine]

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If happy-ever-after's did exist
I would still be holding you like this

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home

[Verse 1]
It's so hard just holding on
And even picking up my phone
It's hard enough to be (Hard enough to sleep)
Hard enough to be alone
I'm just tryna move along (Mhm)
Sometimes I do and then I don't
Tell me what I'm doing wrong
Tell myself that it ain't healthy
Second guessin' it don't help me
I'm so tired of feeling empty
Dry my eyes, it's time to fight
It seems like I'm always against me
Seems like this is never ending
But I refuse to let it end me
Mentally (Mhm), spiritually (Oh), physically
I need my peace, yes (Oh, yеah)
I need my peace (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
I wake up еvery morning and tell myself
Good morning, gorgeous
Sometimes you gotta look in the mirror and say
Good morning, gorgeous
No one else could make me feel this way, yeah
Good morning, gorgeous
Good morning (Gorgeous)
Good morning, gorgeous

[Verse 2]
All the times that I hated myself (Self)
All the times that I wanted to be someone else (Yeah)
All the times that I should've been gentle with me
Times that I should've been careful with me
Why did I hate myself? (Why did I hate?)
So intensely
Lord, help me

[Chorus]
I wake up every morning and tell myself
Good morning, gorgeous
Sometimes you gotta look in the mirror and say (Say, yeah)
Good morning, gorgeous
No one else could make me feel this way
Good morning, gorgeous (Oh, it's the simplest thing I can say)
Gorgeous, good morning, gorgeous (Gorgeous)

[Outro]
I ain't talkin' 'bout getting no hair and make up (No, no, no)
I'm talking about soon as I wake up (Oh, ooh, ah)
I say good morning (Say good morning)
Good morning (Good Morning)
Good morning (Oh, yeah)
Good morning gorgeous (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
I know you're with somebody new
But I can't write a song that's not all about you
It's not fair, baby
How come it's so easy
For you to forget everything you said?
Like how I was the best girl that you'd ever met
Guess you take it back, should've expected that

[Chorus]
When I say I'm fine, I'm lyin' really well
'Cause I can't love anyone else
And I'm so jealous that you can
Scared I'll never feel that again
'Cause I still can't call anyone "Baby"
'Cause "Baby" is still you to me
Don't you think I wanna move on, too?
But I can't love anyone thе way, the way I loved you
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Cryin' in the parkin' lot
You don't know what you want
Gave you everything, I guess everything ain't enough
You say you lost your best friend
How do you think I feel?
You say it's over again, and this time it's real

[Intro: John Legend]
She's so

[Verse: John Legend]
She rolled up, it's automatic
My mood is slowly static
She lightning straight to the bed
She, she beautiful, she magic
She killed the core reactor
I'm burnin' out in her flame

[Chorus: John Legend]
She's so dope
I wanna be her dope fiend
She showed me what dope means, yeah
She's so dope
She can be my dope dream
We can make a dope stream, yeah

[Post-Chorus: John Legend]
She's so-o-o-o-o-o-o-o dope
Givе it, give it, give it to me
Givе it, give it, give it, give it to me, woah

Goodbye, my friend, I won't ever love again
Never again

[Verse 1]
Hello
The sunny place for shady people
A crowded room where nobody goes
You can be whoever you wanna be here
And, oh, I've been livin' at the Chateau
Shouldn't drive, but I should really go home
I don't even know 'em, but they won't leave here

[Pre-Chorus]
Frightened by my own reflection
Desperate for a new connection
Pull you in, but don't you get too close
Love you now, but not tomorrow
Wrong to steal, but not to borrow
Pull you in, but don't you get too close

[Chorus]
I've been California dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleedin'
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night (All night)
Lost in black hole conversation
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night

[Post-Chorus]
I just wanna feel (Feel)
Feel somethin' (Feel somethin' now)
But I keep feeling nothin' all night long

[Bridge]
All night long
All night long
All night long

[Verse 2]
Hello (Hello)
I'll tell you all the people I know (I know)
Sell you somethin' that you already own (You own)
Yeah, I can be whoever you want me to be

[Pre-Chorus]
Love me now, but not tomorrow
Fill me up, but leave me hollow
Pull me in, but don't you get too close

[Chorus]
I've been California dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleedin'
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night (All night)
Lost in black hole conversations
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night

[Post-Chorus]
I just wanna feel (Feel)
Feel somethin' (Feel somethin' now)
But I keep feelin' nothin' all night long

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
All night long
All night long
All night long
All night long

[Chorus]
I've been California dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleedin'
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night (All night)
Lost in black hole conversations
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night

[Outro]
I just wanna feel (Feel)
Feel somethin' (Feel somethin' now)
But I keep feelin' nothin' all night long

[Verse 1]
Red cups, sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
'Cause we came to have so much fun now (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Bet somebody here might get some now
If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a "Hell no?" (Hell no)
We gonna go all night
'Til we see the sunlight, alright (Hey, hey, hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
So la-da-di-da-di, we like to party
Dancing with molly
Doing whatever we wanted
Ooh, this is our house, this is our rules

[Chorus]
And we can't stop (Ooh, woah)
And we won't stop (Ooh, woah)
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?
We can't stop (Ooh, woah)
And we won't stop (Ooh, woah)
We run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody, yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
(This is our party, we can do what we want) How you doing tonight, Los Angeles?
This is our party, we can say what we want
This is our party, we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want, we can screw who we want(Yeah)

[Verse 2]
To my homegirls here with the big butts
Shaking it like we at a strip club
Remember only God can judge ya
Forget the haters, somebody loves ya
Everyone in line in the bathroom
Tryna get a line in the bathroom
We all so turned up here
Getting turned up, yeah (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Let me hear you!

[Pre-Chorus]
So la-da-di-da-di, we like to party
Dancing with molly
Doing whatever we want

It's our song and we'll sing if we want to
It's my mouth and I'll say what I want to
It's our party, we can do what we want to
It's our house and we'll love who we want to
It's our song and I'll sing if we want to
It's my mouth, I'll say what I want to

[Verse 3]
With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse, but there's nothing in it
So you ask yourself

[Chorus]
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

[Verse 4]
Yeah, I was swimmin' in the Caribbean
Animals were hiding behind the rocks, yeah
Except the little fish
Who bumped into me, swear he was trying to talk, he said

[Chorus]
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, I see it swimmin'

[Chorus]
And we can't stop (Ooh, woah)
We won't stop (Ooh, woah)
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?
We can't stop (Ooh, woah)
And we won't stop (Ooh, woah)
We run things, things don't run we
We don't take nothing from nobody, yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Oh, yeah, ah (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
We can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?
We can't stop (Ooh, woah-oh)
And we won't stop (Ooh, yeah-yeah)
We run things, things don't run we
We don't take nothing from nobody
We can't stop (Ooh, woah)
We won't stop (Ooh, woah)
We run things, things don't run we
We don't take nothing from nobody, yeah-yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Ooh, yeah, uh (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
We'll do it what we want (Ooh-ooh), we'll do it what we want to

[Chorus]
Once had a love and it was a gas
It soon turned out, had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind
Once had a love and it was divine
I soon found out that I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing, I was so blind
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind

[Verse 1]
In between
What I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do

[Chorus]
Once had a love, it was a gas
It soon turned out, had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind

[Verse 2]
Lost inside
Adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruising, ooh, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light
Ooh, woah
Ooh, woah
Ooh, woah
Ooh, woah

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I'm a female rebel, can't you tell?
Bang on the dashboard, just chipped a nail
Lean out the window, that's when I yell
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself
Police wanna get him and put him in jail
I'mma do whatever to get him his bail
Hooked on donuts and

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in that passenger seat, flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we plumb out of gas, let's go

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
I'm a female rebel, can't you see?
Riding 'round your backyard, who could it be?
Pulling out the steering wheel right from the seat
Pumping his breaks to the sound of the beat
Pumping his breaks to the sound of the beat
He don't understand what he's doing to me
Deep down inside, like a pitbull in heat
Somebody's coming

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in that passenger seat, flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we plumb out of gas, let's go

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
It's twelve o'clock and I don't wanna party
My big boyfriend's got a big truck hobby
A little bit of dirt never hurt nobody
Now I got dirt all over my body
I might as well lie to L
His big fog lights is bright as hell
He calls it off, he starts to yell
He hits the gas so I grab the rail

[Verse 3: Nelly]
'Round and 'round we go
Don't stop 'til I tell you so

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in that passenger seat, flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we plumb out of gas, let's go

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Outro: Miley Cyrus]
I'm a female rebel, who can't you tell, who can't you tell
Who can't you tell?
I'm a female rebel, who can't you tell, who can't you tell
Who can't you tell?

[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
Bangerz (Bangerz)
Fuckin' bangerz (Bangerz)
Bangerz (Bangerz)
Fuck-fuck-fuckin' bangerz (Bangerz)

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
All the way in the back with a tree on my lap
All the boys like to ask me, "What you doing with that?"
Yeah, yeah
You say you love me, I ain't fooling with that
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack
One day he wants me
One day he wants me not
I don't do chances, 'cause time just ain't what I got
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at
I can't be sittin' 'round here waitin' on a man
To tell me where the fuck my seat be at
Where Mike WiLL at?

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)

[Verse 2: Britney Spears & (Miley Cyrus)]
I'm flying high up on the bird; acrophobiac
I slick, caught her eyeing down my purse
Where the dollars at?
I let her know the rent's due on the first
They can call the hearse
'Cause, if there's any violation, I go off with that
Catwalk, slick talk, flirting with a big dog
(Why I need his millis when I got Billy on the speed dial?)
You know I'm on that "meow", quick to scratch your eyes out
Strutting on the court, make them nervous, call a timeout

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
The plane, boss, the plane
‘Bout to get that big rock
Slip that on my hand
Make that media big talk
The plane, boss, the plane
Psych, that must be the purple
Got up in my brain
Had me a little bit dismal

[Outro: Miley Cyrus]
I (Bangerz)
I (Fucking bangerz)
I (Bangerz)
I (Fucking bangerz)
(Bangerz)
(Bangerz)
(Bangerz)
(Fucking bangerz)

[Intro: Mike WiLL Made-It]
I'm so phresh, man (EarDrummers)
Man, y'all scared to do it how I do it

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in the club high on purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on
In the club high on purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on

[Post-Chorus: Juicy J]

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I be in the club standing on the couch
In them Wolf Grey's like it's my house (I'm on)
Drinking out the bottle, I got no respect
Looking like a model, who just got a check
I back it up, 'cause I don't give a fuck
If you're a lame, that's a shame you can't hang with us
I'm MC Hammer fly, fresh, you can't touch, no
J's so fly, I should work at Flight Club

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Put on my J's and dance the wholе night away
I'm naughty by nature like I'm Hip-Hop Hooray
My hands in the sky, I wavе ‘em from side to side
My feet on the floor, I'm 'bout to turn up now

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in the club high on purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I be rockin' J's or I be rockin' Taylors
I got lots of flavors, my kick game is major
More kicks than the players, call me up I'm scorin'
Hit it like a free throw, tongue out like I'm Jordan
Smiley, Miley, come swing the thing right by me
Got a joint if you wanna get stoned, got choppers if they wanna try me
Pro athlete, I'm not no wannabe
Waitress asked how many bottles? I said 23

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Put on my J's and dance the whole night away
I'm naughty by nature like I'm Hip-Hop Hooray
My hands in the sky, I wave ‘em from side to side
My feet on the floor, I'm 'bout to turn up now

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in the club high on purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
I stay showin' out, my kick game is a beast
I got thirty pairs of J's that ain't never been released
Flu game 12's, Space Jam 11's
All the hype beast sick, they gon' need a paramedic
Turn up, turn up, turn up, I get trippy, I stay live
All this purple in my cup, match them grape 5's
I'm so high, I got three bitches that go bi
I'm so fly, I'm gettin' head like a blow dryer

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Put on my J's and dance the whole night away
I'm naughty by nature like I'm Hip-Hop Hooray
With my hands in the sky, I wave ‘em from side to side
My feet on the floor, I'm 'bout to turn up now

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in the club high on purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on
In the club high on purp with some shades on (Hey!)
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on

[Spoken Outro]
Thank you so much, LA, thank you
Thank you so much
How's everybody doing tonight? Thank you for being here
Thank you to anybody who's really here to see Green Day and showed up a little bit early to see what the fuck I'm doing
Like you, I have no idea
But, uh, if you don't know me, if you don't know my music
Hey, I like your shirt
I'll tell you that one thing you probably do know
Is I think people when they think about me they think of someone who even though that's been a million different things likes to be honest about where I am and every moment of my life that over the last fifteen-plus years has been a lot of different things
A lot of different identities
And all of those identities that I was trying on and seeing if they fit me, like the skin that I'm in right now, you all stood beside me and grew with me and watched me evolve
And I hope that we get to do that over and over and over again
For the rest of my life
One thing that I do now is that even though it scares the shit out of me sometimes, this is what I wanna do for the rest of my life
And over the last two years having that disconnection
And not being able to experience this moment that we're all having right now
Something that used to feel just like breathing
Something that felt like it would happen whether I wanted to or not
I would just somehow end up in these rooms full of twenty thousand people and they would be singin' along to my songs and it was just something that happened
And when that came to a screeching halt just like everybody's else's life over the last two years, this is feeling new to me again
Which is fucking exciting, but is also terrifying
Something that should feel so natural just doesn't anymore
And I just wanted to be honest about standing up here right now, it doesn't feel the same as if you would've come to see me three or four years ago
I'm just finding my feet up on this platform again and I know that all of us are going through that same experience
We're just trying to integrate back into reality
A reality that was moving so fast, so naturally
And now something that should just feel like breathing is suddenly difficult and anxiety-inducing and scary
And I just want you to know that even though I'm up here in front of all of you, I'm just as scared of—, as everybody else
About where the world is going, what the future holds
But the good news is is we're not alone
Even when we're disconnect, we, we are not alone, we're all in this together
And so I just want to be honest about where I'm at
And when I look out here and I see some Green Day t-shirts sprinkled in some Miley shirts
Maybe boyfriends, it's like, "Yeah, I fuck with Green Day," I know how—, and I like the Miley socks
And I see these shirts all around this arena from all different eras, I can tell how long you all have been with me
I saw a shirt down here, I think I'm fucking thirteen years old on your shirt, I'm twenty-two years old on your shirt
That's the mullet era
So I, I can see, hey!
"Miley made me gay"
I heard that's not a good thing, but I think it is
Yeah, a lot of dudes wear that
Um, yeah, some into men with pussies
Are you gonna hold that up for the Green Day show? You should, it's awesome
Uh, so I just want to be honest about where I'm at and I wanna thank you guys for your loyalty over the years and I wanna thank you again for coming to my show tonight
And this song
I feel much better now that I just was honest and I told you that I'm fucking scared up here
This song is called "Never Be Me"
This song is off my newest record called Plastic Hearts
And I've never sang this song before live, so I look forward to doing it for y'all

[Verse 1]
I know I do this every time
I walk the line, I play with fire
And I stop myself before the crime
I walk the line, yeah, I play with fire

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna push you way too much
I don't wanna lean that way too far
I don't wanna ever learn the hard way

[Chorus]
But if you're looking for stable, that'll never be me
If you're looking for faithful, that'll never be me
If you're looking for someone to be all that you need
That'll never be me
(Hard as I try)
That'll never be mе
(I play with fire)

[Verse 2]
Dry your tears now, don't you cry
I'm by your side, at lеast for a while
I know I do this every time
I walk the line, yeah, I play with fire

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna push you way too much
I don't wanna lean that way too far
I don't wanna ever learn the hard way, no
I don't wanna keep you in the dark
I don't wanna gamble with your heart
I don't wanna ever leave you lonely

[Chorus]
But if you're looking for stable, that'll never be me
If you're looking for faithful, that'll never be me
If you're looking for someone to be all that you need
That'll never be me
(Hard as I try)
That'll never be me
(I play with fire)

[Bridge]
Can't get too close to the sun (Fire)
Baby, you're the only one, oh, I
I'd never lie to you, baby, oh (Fire)
You give me a reason to run from the fire
'Cause baby, you're the only one
Oh, I swear I'd never lie

[Chorus]
If you're looking for stable, that'll never be me
But I hope that I'm able to be all that you need
If you think that I'm someone to give up and leave
That'll never be me, no
If you think that I'm someone to give up and leave
That'll never be me
(Hard as I try)
That'll never be me, no
(I play with fire)
That'll never be me

[Intro]
(Sha, sha, sha)

[Verse 1]
I probably shouldn't say this, but, at times, I get so scared
When I think about the previous relationship we shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It’s not possible for me not to care
And now we're standin' in the rain
Nothing’s ever gonna change until you hear, my dear

[Chorus]
The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you, oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you makе me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, thеy're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

[Verse 2]
It's awkward and it's silent as I wait for you to say
What I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I’ll delete it
Let’s be clear (Clear, clear)
Oh, I'm not comin’ back
You're taking seven steps here

[Chorus]
The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don’t know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

[Bridge]
And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention the seven that I like

[Chorus]
The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined, everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you

[Outro]
(Sha, sha)
You do, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Part I: "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"

[Verse 1]
I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

[Chorus]
Bang-bang, he shot me down
Bang-bang, I hit the ground
Bang-bang, that awful sound
Bang-bang, my baby shot me down

Part II: "See You Again"

[Verse 1]
I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
I got a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were somethin' special when you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Verse 2]
I got a way of knowin' when somethin' is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
I felt this deep connection when you looked in my еyes (I can't wait)
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Chorus]
The last time I frеaked out, I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart can't rest 'til then
Oh-woah-woah, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Verse 3]
I got this crazy feelin' deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind-reader, but I'm reading the signs (That you can't wait)
That you can't wait to see me again

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out, I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart can't rest 'til then
Oh-woah-woah, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Bridge]
I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out, I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart can't rest 'til then
Oh-woah-woah, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Outro]
I can't wait to see you again

[Intro: Kanye West & James Blake]
So now, now, so now, so now
So, so now, now, so now, so now
You're too— (Ooh)
So now, now, now, so now, so now, so now (Ooh, woah)
So, so now, now, so now, so now (Stay on 'em, ooh, stay on 'em)
Uh, uh-um, stay on 'em (Ooh, stay on 'em, stay on 'em), na, na, na
Stay on 'em (Stay on 'em, ooh), uh—stay on em
Sta—sta—stay on 'em (Ooh, stay on 'em), sta—sta—
(Doo, doo, doo)
Ooh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Boy, I ain't waitin' 'round
I ain't waitin' 'round for some handouts (Handouts)
I'ma always stand out, always stand out
That's hands down (Hands down, woo)
Better tell them boys, better tell them boys
Tell 'em "Stand down" (Stand down)
And that boy soft as hell, hell
'Till he got his man 'round (Man 'round)

[Verse: Kanye West & Royce Da 5'9]
Boy behave, ayy, Kobe, ayy, ayy
See the reason why they set him up
'Cause he ain't no slave, ayy
Swear the game, cut throat
Cosby, set up, what? Shut up boy, shut up
That ain’t got the bandwidth (Da, da, nah)
I don’t got the bandwidth (Doo, doo, doo)
Y'all flaky as dandruff
I done hеard the new Black Star, it’s a good time to bе a black star
The bravest ones are our children, not these fake leaders that act smart
Everybody wonderin’ when did that start
Biden said, “You ain't black if you ain't vote for me” and I ain't vote for him, so is that basis to cancel my black card?
Y’all really gon’ make me laugh that hard?
I don’t get-get, Gatsby, who I’ve might’ve been in the past life
So when I got enemies, that’s life
Action first, than speech, contract and than preach
Even if you get dark skin, our minds done been reached
Finally in a position that they can't impeach
Finally a transition, I was once chained like tennis piece

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Boy, I ain't waitin' 'round
I ain't waitin' 'round for some handouts (Handouts)
I'ma always stand out, always stand out
That's hands down (Hands down, woo)
Better tell them boys, better tell them boys
Tell 'em "Stand down" (Stand down)
And that boy soft as hell, hell
'Till he got his man 'round (Man 'round)

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get a little too hurt
Got my mind goin' places it ain't wanna go
Sometimes I get a little too low
And I can't see myself through the fire and smoke
And you, like a neon light
Shinin' through a door that I can't keep closed
And you, like a rolling stone
Always buildin' cities on the hearts that you broke

[Chorus]
And in my head, I did my very best saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you, but I think of you and don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I stay up all night
'Cause you don't ever talk to me in my dreams
And I think about eventually you're holdin' me
And dancin' to the record like a movie scene

[Chorus]
And in my head, I did my very best saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you, but I think of you and don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Sometimes I get a little too hurt
Got my mind goin' places it ain't wanna go

[Chorus]
And in my head, I did my very best saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you, but I think of you and don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I still feel high

[Verse 1]
I wanna set off alarms, deal out the cards
Smoke Cuban cigars, get kicked outta bars before two
Only if it's with you
And I wanna drive down to Texas, flip off my exes
Get kind of reckless and have wild, wild, wild sex under the moon
But only if it's with you

[Chorus]
Yeah, I got some baggage, let's do some damage
I am not made for no horsey and carriage
You know I'm savage, you're looking past it
I want that late-night sweet magic, that forever-lasting love
Only if it's with you

[Verse 2]
Let's crash a wedding tonight, get drunk off the lights
Then I'll pick a fight to make up on the floor of your room
But only if it's with you
Yeah, I wanna cut off my hair and kick off my boots
Dance in the wind just to do it again, yeah, it's true
But only if it's with you, oh

[Chorus]
I got some baggage, let's do some damage
I am not made for no horsey and carriage
You know I'm savage, you're looking past it
I want that late-night sweet magic, that forever-lasting—
I'm kind of crazy, that's how you make me
I don't need Jesus, oh, baby, you saved me, I'm done
But only if it's with you, oh

[Outro]
You, only with you, yeah, yeah
You, only with you, yeah, yeah, yeah
You, baby, it's you
You, oh, you, only with you

[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Ooh, I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Oh, please don't take him just because you can

[Verse 1]
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your skin is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

[Chorus]
Jolenе, Jolene, Jolenе, Jolene
Ooh, I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Oh, please don't take him just because you can

[Verse 2]
Now I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene
He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep from crying
When he calls your name, Jolene

[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Ooh, I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Oh, please don't take him just because you can

[Outro]
Jolene (Jolene)
Jolene (Jolene)
Jolene (Jolene)

[Spoken]
Thank you
Thank you all so much
Thank you
Are y'all having a good time so far?
I hope this show is a representation of you never need to choose who you want to be
And you don't need to fit into any boundaries or into any boxes
You can be anything and everything that you've ever wanted to be all at the same time
Everything that contradicts itself can coexist in harmony and I believe that
And sometimes you may look ridiculous
Like you're wearing some sort of, I don't know, 3033 workout attire and a fucking cowboy hat
But you know what, that's how I feel today
I feel like I'd like to time travel into the future where we all have a little bit more understanding
But we never will, we'll never quite understand
It's all evolving right in front of all us
We're evolving in front of ourselves
Somedays even I'm surprised by the shit that I do
But that's what makes each of us so individual
And so this song is called "High"

[Verse 1]
I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
"You'll never reach it"
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels
Lost with no direction
My faith is shaken

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I gotta keep trying
I gotta keep my head held high

[Chorus]
Always gonna be another mountain
Always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side, yeah, ooh, yeah
It's the climb

[Verse 2]
The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Somеtimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But thеse are the moments that
I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going

[Pre-Chorus]
And I, I got to be strong (Let me hear you)
Just keep pushing on, 'cause...

[Chorus]
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

[Instrumental Bridge]
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
Always gonna be another mountain
Always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

[Outro]
Keep on moving
Keep climbing
Keep the faith, baby (Let me hear you)
It's all about, it's all about the climb
Keep your faith
Whoa-ooh-oh
Thank you
Thank you so much
Part I: "Wrecking Ball"

[Verse 1]
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

[Chorus]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

[Verse 2]
I put you high up in the sky
And now you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now we're ashes on the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
(I love that), always want you

[Chorus]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me

Part II: "Nothing Compares 2 U"

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

[Verse]
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and I sleep all day
Since you took your love away
And since you've been gone, I can do whatever I want, yeah
I can see whoever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant, yes, I can
Ooh, and nothing, but nothing can take away these blues

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
Oh, nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

Part III: "Wrecking Ball"

[Bridge]
Never meant to start a war
I wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you win
I never meant to start a war
I wanted you to let me in
I guess I should've let you win

[Interlude]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you

[Chorus]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Woah)
Am I gonna fit in?
I jumped in the cab, I'm here for the first time
Look to my right, I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turning, hey, hey, hey
What's up, mom? Hey
What was on, ya'll?
Come on

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up, they're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like, "Yeah"
Moving my hips like, "Yeah"
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the USA
Yeah, it's a party in the USA

[Verse 2]
Get to the club in my taxi cab
Evеrybody lookin' at me now
"Who's that chick that's rocking kicks?
She gotta be from out of town"
It's so hard with my girls not around mе
It's definitely not a
'Cause all I see are stilettos
(I guess I never got the memo) Those bitches didn't give me the memo

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
It's too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
Hey, who was on? Free Britney!
Let me hear you say, "Free Britney!"

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up, they're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm nodding my head like, "Yeah"
Moving my hips like, "Yeah"
Put my hands up, they're playing my song
I know I'm gonna be okay (Let me hear you!)
Yeah, it's a party in the USA
Yeah, it's a party in the USA

[Bridge]
Feel like hopping on a flight
Back to my hometown tonight
But something stops me every time
The DJ plays my song, I feel alright

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up, they're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like, "Yeah"
Moving my hips like, "Yeah"
Hands up, they're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the USA
So I put my hands up, they're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm nodding my head like, "Yeah"
I'm moving my hips like, "Yeah"
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the USA
Yeah, it's a party in the USA
Yeah, it's a party in the USA

[Pre-Chorus]
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds (Oh, oh)

I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no

Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing

Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Loved by you

[Post-Chorus]
La, la, la-la, la

In the web that is my own, I begin again
I sing to my friend, eh (Everything stopped)
Nothing else mattered (Nothing else mattered)

[Pre-Chorus]
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds (Oh, oh)

I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no

Thank you
Thank you

Let you know how grateful I am for the loyalty from all of you that has provided me
This type of longevity and not a day goes by that I'm not thankful for each and everyone of you
And this next song, I dedicate to everybody that's in this arena tonight that's been here for me since the beginning

[Intro]
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 1]
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, hеlp me

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's likе a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 2]
Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Reprise]
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus]
Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

[Outro]
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me (Mmmm...)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh, oh-oh-oh yeah)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)

Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you

[Verse 1]
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet

Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was

Happy Kwanzaa
To every one of you

Because you are lovely, made from love
Dot, dot

Yeah, when we pull up
Get in bumping
Motorway on the 300
Miles per hour
Doors are open
Trainers smoking up the road
I call up Kim like, "Where you at?"
I call up Chris when I'm in France
I call up Uffie, call up Luka, they know where the party at
I ride with Brooke when I want candy
Cherry Gang, they got that caddy
Umru goes to school on weekdays
On the weekend 4 AM-ing
When we pull up on your party
Damn, you know it's never stop

I hate myself for what I've done

Let's just stay, stay
Alone in this place

[Intro]
Now you just popped into Kanye West
Get Right for the Summer workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
You might be able to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude with a car!
So, first of all, we gonna work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass

[Verse 1]
One, and two, and three, and four, and get them sit ups right, and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son, don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh, she's so excited
Tеll me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
(Ah!) What's scary to mе is
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came, I came, I came

[Chorus]
All them mocha lattes
You gotta do Pilates
After the party
Meet me in the lobby now
And maybe we can work it out

[Post Chorus]
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Now
Maybe we can work it out

[Verse 2]
Ooh, girl, your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said "Get It Wet"
Ooh girl your breath is harsh!
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still, kill a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweating to the oldies, we juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl, if you ain't fit, girl, I'll still hit, girl
One and, you brought two friends, ok, three more now hop in the Benz
Four door: do you know the difference between a five, six, seven, eight?
All the Mocha Lattes, you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballas

[Chorus]
All them mocha lattes
You gotta do Pilates
After the party
Meet me in the lobby now
And maybe we can work it out

[Post Chorus]
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Now
Maybe we can work it out

[Interlude: Jill, Lasandra, Ella-May & Kanye West]
Hi, my name is Jill, I just want to say thanks to Kanye's workout plan. I was able to pull a NBA player. And like now I shop every day on Rodeo Drive. I just want to say, thank you Kanye! Woooo! Woooo!—Woooo!

My name is Lasandra, and I just want to say that since listening to Kanye's workout tape, I was able to get my phone bill paid, I got sounds and 13's put up in my Cavalier and I was able to get a free trip to Cancun.

[Verse 1]
Jim takes me down, he's a fire eater
Before the dawn or the valley shines
Jim takes me down to the river
All the way, past the nuns
Girls in nightgowns hold their hands forever
Girls with pink lips cultivate the sound
They watch, we kiss on a bed of roses
As he lays me down

[Chorus]
He's a fire eater
He's a cult leader
He's a big believer in anything from the 70's
Said that LSD could be good for me
Lay down, lay down

[Verse 2]
Jim takes me down to the village diner
Makes them believe that there's nothing wrong
Parades me 'round like his fucking daughter
All the way, bow down

[Chorus]
He's a fire eater
He's a cult leader
He's a big believer in anything from the 70's
Said that LSD could be good for me
Lay down, lay down

[Bridge]
Oh, all the ways that your story was a let down
Oh-oh-oh, all the ways that your glory was a let down

[Chorus]
He's a fire eater
He's a cult leader
He's a big believer in anything from the 70's
Said that LSD could be good for me
Lay down, lay down
Lay down, lay down

[Verse 1]
Under blue moon I saw you
So soon you'll take me
Up in your arms too late to beg you
Or cancel it though I know it must be
The killing time, unwillingly mine

[Chorus]
Fate up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until
You give yourself to him

[Verse 2]
In starlit nights I saw you
So cruelly you kissed me
Your lips a magic world
Your sky all hung with jewels
The killing moon will come too soon

[Chorus]
Fate up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until
You give yourself to him

[Bridge]
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 1]
Under blue moon I saw you
So soon you'll take me
Up in your arms, too late to beg you
Or cancel it though I know it must be
The killing time, unwillingly mine

[Chorus]
Fate up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until
You give yourself to him
Fate up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until
You give yourself to him

[Outro]
You give yourself to him
You give yourself to him
You give yourself to him
You give yourself to him
You give yourself to him

But when the heat comes, something takes a hold
Can I kick it? Yeah, I can

[Pre-Chorus]
My cheeks in high colour, overripe peaches
No shirt, no shoes, only my features
My boy behind me, he's taking pictures
Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches
Come one, come all, I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus

Forget all of the tеars that you've cried
It's over, ovеr, over
Oh, it's a new state of mind
Are you coming, my baby?

My cheeks in high colour, overripe peaches
No shirt, no shoes, only my features
My boy behind me, he's taking pictures

Blink three times when you feel it kicking in (One, two, three, go)

[Chorus]
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had

[Verse 1]
We kissed in the morning on a summer day
You taste like cigarettes and hurricanes
There's a warning written in the corners of your face
Whiplash and you left me in a vapour trail
Now I know it's safe to say
Nothing's perfect anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you fell in love, but you don't know how
We were good once, but I'm fucked up now
I was dumb, trying to work things out
I built a house and you burned it down

[Chorus]
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had

[Verse 2]
Just a minute now, thеre's something differеnt now
All your morning sounds, how's it all so loud?
Put the flowers down, they look like clowns
Leave me to it then and let your hair grow out
Now I know it's safe to say
Nothing's perfect anyway

[Chorus]
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you fell in love, but you don't know how
We were good once, but I'm fucked up now
I was dumb, trying to work things out
I built a house and you burned it down

[Chorus]
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had

We fell in love, but you don't know how
We were good once, but I'm fucked up now

[Verse 1]
Miss Lonely Hearts
I'm asking, what is love
And how it feels
I never learned its meaning
So I don't know when it's real

[Chorus]
Is this love when you're with someone
And you want them to stay?
Dear Miss Lonely Hearts
Please let me know right away

[Verse 2]
Oh, Miss Lonely Hearts
Please tell me, can there be joy
As well as pain?
When she's by my side, I'm happy
But when she's gone, the tears fall like rain

[Chorus]
Oh, can this bе love that I feel inside
Or is this a game to play?
Dеar Miss Lonely Hearts
Please let me know right away

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Oh, oh, is this love that I feel inside
Or is, is this a game to play?
Dear Miss Lonely Hearts

He been staying inside like quarantine, that's why I don't see him
Hope my label drop, they know it's me soon as them ho's see 'em
I'm swagging up out that hot car, look like I'm Puerto Rican (What?)
From out of the dark, we rockstars, and plus, we holding pieces
You wouldn't even let me get that pussy, why you wanna tease me?
You want your period at 5 A.M, then why you wanna see me? (Lil' bitch)
I'm putting my foot down on these ho's and now they talking easy
Getting ready to dip all on this chick, it look like Polynesian
My flow west-side, my bitch chest out
Got catch me from the left side, cause that's my best side
Got to hop in and ride this dick 'cause ain't no time to test drive
She ain't do shit for your side, but she getting fucked, this side
Twenty thousand dollars in bottles, my tendencies taller
Lie to him, said it was runtz, but I sold him gelato
I know that bitch be calling me daddy, but that bitch ain't my daughter (Nah)
Jay whipping up in that Catty 'cause that Lambo stalling
I done shot dice with everybody in Barcelona
Thirty thousand, well, tell a bitch to call her homie, aye
Rockin' Prada, I'm looking like the God father
Aye, spoil the bitch, you'd think the bitch my God daughter (Aye)
Yuh, we moving the za-za all the way out in Texas

Yeah, I'm a lil' too faded, I might fuck your best friend, woah
I'm topping on za-za, I'm one with the raw-raw
Fucking these bitches, I'm making them top off, ho, til' she cock off
"Want me to take you to dinner, baby?" Mm, nah-uh

Back to these ho's, you know they've gotten so filthy
She hopping up on my dick, she tryna ride it and milk it
She like how the inside of my Rolls-Royce so silky
I like how the inside of that pussy felt when I peeled it (Yeah)
She dropped down, got her eagle on, then I killed it
My auntie tried to tell me "Stop sippin," I still sip
It's propaganda, I drop the Fanta

Like arm and hammer
And I'm a gangster on the scene, but not on camera (Nah)
That fuck nigga be doing my green, so I'ma blam it (Bap, bap)

[Outro]
It's Tory, nigga, ayy
And when you see me swanging on that motherfuckin' 95 and your bitch swanging out that window like "Damn, who the fuck is that, nigga?"
Just know, nigga, it's me shining like a motherfuckin' diamond
If I'm lying, I'm flying, bitch, you know what the hell it is
Man, anytime I go out I'm in there like swimmer
Out there like mouth gettin' bitched

Cash out if I want it (Bitch, for real, though)
The money got blood all on it (Yeah, for real, though)
The money got blood all on it, yeah (Yeah)
The money got blood all on it (For real, though, yeah)
Bad bitch with me on it (For real, though)
Nigga wanna be me, don't it? (Huh, ha)
But the money got blood all on it
Yeah, the money got blood all on it (Yeah, yeah, hey)
My young niggas ready to shoot (Damn)
'Cause they ain't got nothin' to lose (Damn)
He said, it's fuck everybody and fuck everything, he got somethin' to prove (Damn)
In the trenches pullin' moves (Got 'em)
A hundred racks in blues (Franks)
In a shoebox, hell nah, them ain't no motherfuckin' shoes (Racks)
Lyrics from Snippet

...think I'd try, for you
I fell in line, probably would've died, for you
So tell me now, what am I posed to do?

[Chorus]
I feel like...
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1]
I couldn't hide my smile from you
As I stopped to breathe exhaust from the tail pipe
Wearing nothing but my cut-off blues
And gold bikini, chain in the moonlight

[Chorus]
You're a nice man
And I am a na-na-na-nasty girl
You're a nice man
And I am a na-na-na-nasty girl

[Verse 2]
I couldn't hide my smile from you
As I watched you struggle out from under
Little hands that cover up your eyes, you tried to drive
But I kicked the steering wheel with my little feet

[Chorus]
You're a nice man
And I am a na-na-na-nasty girl, yeah
You're a nice man
And I am a na-na-na-nasty girl

[Bridge]
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I can help us make a clean getaway
Prеtty girls can hoist a bank robbery
'Cause I know I got Jesus watching ovеr me
I love you more than I have ever loved anyone
You know I want to show you that life can be so much fucking fun
When you're mine, when you're mine
When you're mine, when you're mine

[Verse 3]
I couldn't hide my smile from you
As I watched us sway in between lanes
You know there's no better sight than a nosedive in the ocean
Triple drains

[Chorus]
You're a nice man
And I am a na-na-na-nasty girl
You're a nice man
And I am a na-na-na-nasty girl

[Verse 1]

[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowin' my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleepin'
Stayin' up playin' back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin' from the passenger's side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowin' my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreamin'
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowin' my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time

[Verse 1]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all so quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenevеr you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Verse 2]
Stood thеre and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Bridge]
I know, I know
I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone, no

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
I can't go back, I'm haunted

[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it

[Verse 1]
I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met, and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter

[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Bridge]
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

[Outro]
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Verse 1]
Time will tell if you break it down, you'll understand
I can't change my yesterday, it's out of my hands
But there's always tomorrow coming down the bend
Don't let up, I got a feeling, I better try again

[Chorus]
(Don't you let up) Don't let up, baby
Ah yeah, I'd like to see
(Don't you let up) Love taking over everywhere
That's how it's gonna be

[Verse 2]
Well, I look inside my crystal, I don't see a thing
You can't say what tomorrow is gonna bring
But I still see the sunlight shining through the rain
Don't let up, I got a feeling, I'm still in the game

[Chorus]
(Don't you let up) Don't let up, baby
Ah yeah, I wanna see
(Don't you let up) Love taking over everywhere

[Verse 1]
I don't really understand myself right now
I don’t really think I'm handling this well
Maybe I should get out of bed
But maybe I don't want to pretend I’m ok
I don't really understand it today
I don't really understand why I still wear your shirt to sleep
I don't really understand why I've been feeling less like me
Maybe I just need some space
From all this noise in this place
Oh, I don't really understand it today and that's ok

[Chorus]
Sometimes, nothing's right
All that I am is not defined by who I am tonight
And all of the things that I don’t understand
I will plant them a garden, watered by hand
And I make sure that no one steals them away
Cause right now I don’t but I will understand them someday
I will understand them someday

[Verse 2]
I don't really understand the changing weather over here
I don’t really get why you text so formal now, it's weird
Maybe I just need its space
From all this noise in that place
Oh, I don't really understand it today and that's ok

[Verse 1]
Go down, Moses
Way down, Moses
Go down to Egypt land
Lay down, soldiers
Lay down those weapons, let peace rush in

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it wash through the valley
Soar to the mountains
Fall in the deepest blue sea
Let it fly 'cross the sky
A banner so high
That even the rockets will see

[Chorus]
That there is a God
And I'm just sayin', Lord
Rain down, freedom
Rain down, 'til we're all
Free
Free
Free

[Verse 2]
Low down, broken
Homeless, floatin'
Lost and thrown to chance
Yeah
Caged birds singing
Break chains so we can
Do our holy dance

[Pre-Chorus]
Let 'em ring through the valley
Soar to the mountain
Pierce to the core of the earth
Let 'em sing cross the sky
A chorus so high
That everyone will know their worth

[Chorus]
And that there is a God
And we're just sayin', Lord
Rain down, freedom
Rain down, 'til we're all
Free
Free
Free

[Vamp]
Free, free, free
'Til we're all

[Chorus]
There is a God
And I'm just prayin', Lord
Rain down, freedom
Rain down, 'til we're all
Free
Free
'Til we're all free

[Intro: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Ooh, hoo, ooh
I wanna know right now
Tell me what in the world am I gonna do without you, baby (Baby)
Baby (Baby)

[Verse 1: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
You can't replaced 'cause I'm crazy about you, baby (Tell me)
Tell me, baby (Baby)
When time will not erase the pain
And the memories are driving me insane, oh

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
(What am I gonna do without you?)
What, what am I gonna do without you, baby?
(Baby, tell me, pretty baby you're mine)
I wanna know right now
Can't you see that I still love you so

[Verse 2: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
How could you swear to love and care then leave me lonely? (Baby)
Baby (Baby)
And why must I be the guy who loves you only, baby? (Tell me)
Tell me, baby (Baby)
Loving you was my reason to live
Losing you leaves me nothing to give
Now what

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
(What am I gonna do without you?)
What am I gonna do without you, baby?
(Baby, tell me pretty baby you're mine)
I wanna know
'Cause my lonely heart still loves you
(Tell me, tell me pretty baby you're mine)

[Bridge: David Ruffin]
Ooh, tell me, baby

[Verse 3: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
For as long I live I know I won't forget you, baby (Baby)
Baby (Baby)
But just as long as I live
I'll wish I never met you, baby (Tell me)
Tell me, baby (Baby)
You started a voice in my heart
That keeps on shouting each day we're apart
It shouts what

[Outro: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
(What am I gonna do without you?)
What, what am I gonna do without you, baby?
(Baby, tell me pretty baby you're mine)
I wanna know right now
'Cause my lonely heart still loves you so
Oh, what
(What am I gonna do without you?)
Although you're gone (Baby)
Lord, still need you, Lord, so what
(What am I gonna do without you?)
Love that's inside me can't be denied, so what
(What am I gonna do without you?)
I still love you, baby (Baby)
It's driving me crazy (Baby), what
(What am I gonna do without you?)
What, what am I gonna do without you (Baby)
Tell me

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
You better beware, my friends all told me
When they saw that I was falling for you
You better beware now, they told me
That girl ain't gonna be true
She'll have you walking with your head in the air
Have you thinking that she really, really care

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
Then-a, then she'll let you down, she'll really let you down
She's a girl with no understanding
And when she's getting tired of you hanging around
She'll let you drop and say have a happy landing
(Have a happy landing)

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
Oh but I fell for you anyway
I didn't care what my friends had to say
'Cause I was so glad that I had found you
I build my whole world right around you
You had me hooked on a line for awhile
Have me thinking you'd be mine for awhile

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
Then-a, then you let me down, you really let me down
'Cause you're a girl with no understanding
And when you're getting tired of me hanging around
You let me drop and said, come on, have a happy landing
(Have a happy landing)

[Interlude: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
*chatter*
Sounding good, baby
Temptations right here
Look... (Hey)

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks]
So now you want me to take you back
Stay away for a long, long time
You broke all the laws of loving
Now you're, you're coming back to the scene of your crime
Gonna keep you in suspense for awhile, yeah
Keep you hanging on the fence for awhile

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
Then-a, then I'll let you down, I really let you down
I ain't gonna have no understanding
And when I get tired of you hanging around
I'll let you drop and say, girl, you've had your happy landing
(Have a happy landing)

[Outro: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
Have a happy landing now
(You better have a happy landing)
I've got to put you down
(You better have a happy landing)
Don't want you hanging around now
(You better have a happy landing)
You know that you better
(You better have a happy landing)
You know that you better
(You better have a happy landing)
So come on and have
(You better have a happy landing)
Don't you know that you ought to
(You better have a happy landing)

[Verse 1: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
An old wise man saw me one day
He said, "Son, let me walk along your way
You look blue, and I'm sure that I'll discover
(Hey hey, hey hey)
That the thing that's making you blue
(The thing that's making you blue)
Is an untrue lover (Is an untrue lover)
Yes it is, is an untrue lover (Is an untrue lover)
Mmm

[Verse 2: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
I told him love was and had made me blue
He said, "Son, let me tell you it just ain't true
You've been hurt, and you don't know how to take it, no, no"
(Hey hey, hey hey)
It ain't nevеr the girl that's bad
(It ain't never thе girl that's bad)

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
It's the way that you make it
(It's the way that you make it)
Love is just what you make it, yes it is
(Just the way that you make it)

[Bridge: David Ruffin]
He said, "Why oh why can't people learn
To treat love like they should
How you can you treat love so bad
And expect for it to be good? It can't be
They fool around, they play around
Like love is just some kind of game
Then when someone's heart gets broken
Love has to take the blame

[Verse 3: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
He said, "You hurt inside and I know that's right
You can't eat all, you can't sleep all night
It's like a spell, and you don't, you don't know how to break it, no, no
(Hey hey, hey hey)
But it's never the love that's bad
It ain't never the love that's bad

[Outro: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
It's the way that you make it
(It's the way that you make it)
Love is just what you make it
(It's the way that you make it)
You know it ain't bad
(It's the way that you make it)
It's just what you make it, baby
(It's the way that you make it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(It's the way that you make it)
Love's just what you make it, baby
(It's the way that you make it)
It ain't no game
(It's the way that you make it)
It ain't no shame
(It's the way that you make it)
Love is just what you make it

[Verse 1: Stevie Wonder, The Temptations]
I don't care where you came from
Oh, no, I don't care where you've been
All I know is that I love you
And I'm gonna love you 'til the end
(Gonna love you until the end)

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder, The Temptations]
'Cause you're my (Dream come true)
You're my (Dream come true)
You're my (Dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before

[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder, The Temptations]
For every hand, there's a glove
For every, every heart, there should be love
Yes, I've been waiting for such a long, long time
Don't hold me, nobody, nobody is gonna change my mind
(Nobody's gonna change my mind)

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder, The Temptations]
'Cause you're my (Dream come true)
You're my (Dream come true)
You're my (Dream come true)
Darling, and I love you better than anyone before

[Bridge: Stevie Wonder]
1962
Year after I met you
Heard this favorite song
And you know that I've been singing with The Temps today

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder, The Temptations]
Yes, you're my (Dream come true)
You're my (Dream come true)
You're my (Dream come true)
Baby, and I love you better than anyone before

[Outro: Stevie Wonder, The Temptations]
(Better than anyone before)
Whoa-ooh-ooh
(Better than anyone before)
I love you
(Better than anyone before)
Better than anyone before
(I love you better than anyone, better than anyone, better than)
Don't you know that I love you
(Better than anyone before)
Sing it, Temptations, sing it
(Better than anyone before)
Oh, oh, I love you
(Better than anyone before)
Better, better
(I love you better than anyone, better than anyone, better than)
Better, girl, meaning I love you
(Better than anyone before)
One of my most favorite Temptations songs
(Better than anyone before)
In memory of Eddie Kendricks
(Better than anyone before)
And Paul Williams, can't forget David Ruffin
(I love you better than anyone, better than anyone, better than)
Better than anyone, better than anyone before
You're ridiculous, going back to fire, you're ridiculous

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
There's a look on your face, my dear
That I haven't seen in quite a while
This look is something I can't explain
But there's a definite change in your smile

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks, The Temptations]
There's something there that I once knew
I wonder have you noticed, too
Looking at me like you used to do
There's a definite change in you (Ooh)
There's a definite change in you

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
I remember when wе used to be togethеr
No one could tell us apart
We were closer than birds of a feather
But then the teardrops had to start

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks, The Temptations]
You made a vow that we were cool
You said our love would never do
But maybe you'll see that my love is true
'Cause there's a definite change in you (Ooh)
A definite change in you

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Eddie Kendricks]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
'Cause there's a definite change in you

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks]
And I can tell by the way you hold my hand
The feeling's coming back I once knew
And it seems that now you understand
How much that I love you

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks, The Temptations]
When you left, it made me blue
My happiness you took with you
But now it seems you've been blue, too
'Cause there's a definite change in you (Ooh)
A definite change in you

[Outro: Eddie Kendricks, The Temptations]
And I'm lonely
(A definite change in you, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
Need you only
(A definite change in you, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
Come on back
(A definite change in you, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
'Cause a change is for the better
(A definite change in you, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
Change is for the better
(A definite change in you)

[Verse 1: The Temptations, Melvin Franklin]
You asked me, do I love you
And you said you just have to know tonight
Oh yeah, I love you
And what you're thinking there sure is right
You mean you love her?
I love her
You mean you really, really, really, really love her?
Oh boy, you're right
You're positively absolutely right

[Verse 2: The Temptations, Melvin Franklin]
Will she believe you Will you abuse her?
Will you ever, ever, ever misuse her?
Oh no, it ain't right, it ain't right
Ah

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: The Temptations, Melvin Franklin]
Because it's known, she's at home
Just sitting and waiting all alone
Hello operator, please
Give me true love seven-eight-three
You say true love seven-eight-three?
Oh boy, you're right
You're positively absolutely right

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4: The Temptations, Melvin Franklin]
Pick up the phone, she's at home
Just sitting and waiting all alone
Hello operator, please
Give me true love seven-eight-three
You say true love seven-eight-three?
Oh boy, you're right
You're positively absolutely right

[Outro: The Temptations, Melvin Franklin]
Did you say you love to hate her? (You're right)
Did you say you love to hate her? (Oh boy)
Did you say you love to hate her? (You're right)
Did you say you love to hate her? (You're right)
Did you say you love to hate her? (Oh boy)

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
You give the time, my love
Of you coming by, my love
There's such a chill, my love
I feel night and day

[Pre-Chorus: Eddie Kendricks]
And the chill won't end
'Til you hold me once again

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks, The Temptations]
So, come back, my love
(Come back, come back)
Come back, my love, to me
(Come back my love)
Mmm

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
So please be fair, my love
It's your turn to share, my love
Don't bring me pain, my love
By staying away

[Pre-Chorus: Eddie Kendricks]
A little love unused
Is a love so abused

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks, The Temptations]
So, come back, my love
(Come back, come back)
Come back, my love, to me
(Come back, my love)
Mmm

[Pre-Chorus: Eddie Kendricks]
And the chill won't end
Until you hold me once again

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks, The Temptations]
So, come back, my love
(Come back, come back)
Come back, my love, to me
(Come back, my love)

[Interlude: Paul Williams]
Yes, darling, I'm here, all alone
Just waiting for you to come back home
Yes, I'll be here, just waiting on you, waiting
Waiting, waiting

[Pre-Chorus: Eddie Kendricks]
A little love unused
Is a love so abused

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks, The Temptations]
So, come back, my love
(Come back, come back)
Come back, my love, to me
(Come back, my love)

[Outro: Eddie Kendricks, The Temptations]

I love you so and I'll never never go
Come back, my love

You're what I need, it's all I'll need
Come back, my love
(Come back, come back)
Come back, my love, to me
(Come back, my love)
Oh

[Verse 1: David Ruffin]
I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Ain't too proud to beg, and you know it
Ooh, sweet darlin', please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

[Verse 2: David Ruffin]
Now I know you'd never leave me
'Cause you can't stand to see me cry
So if I have to cry to keep you, I don't mind weeping
If it'll keep you by my side

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Ain't too proud to beg
Ooh, sweet darlin', please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't lеave me, girl, don't you go

[Verse 3: David Ruffin]
I know sympathy is all you feel
And it keeps you from leaving
So еach day I'm gonna cry a little bit more
'Cause crying keeps you from walking out that door

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Ain't too proud to beg
Ooh, sweet darlin', please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Hoo, ooh, ooh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4: David Ruffin]
Now I know a crying man is half a man
So, some folks say
But if being half a man means keeping you longer
Then I don't mind crying 'til my heart gets stronger

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Ain't too proud to beg
Ooh, sweet darlin', please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

[Outro: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
If crying keeps you near, I don't mind crying
Ooh, sweet darlin', please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl

[Verse 1: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
Oh, there she is, she looks so good
Finest thing in the neighborhood
She's sheer beauty, from her head to her feet
She's exciting everyone, everyone she meets
What's her name? Where does she live?
(Where does she live?)
All I own I would gladly give to meet that

[Chorus: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
Pretty little brown skin girl, a brown skin girl
Said I would like to meet her, you look so good
Just wanna meet that
Pretty little brown skin girl, a brown skin girl
Baby, baby, hear me when I say, oh yeah
Listen

[Verse 2: Dennis Edwards, The Temptations]
Big brown eyes (Big brown eyes), cute as can be (Cute as can be)
Her cinnamon skin is getting to me
Oh, you'll never know (You'll never know) 'til you can see
(Until you see)
What that little girl is doing to me
She's just a pretty

[Chorus: Dennis Edwards, The Temptations]
Pretty little brown skin girl (Good God), a brown skin girl
And I need her, and I love her
I don't want nobody else but my

[Bridge: Dennis Edwards, Paul Williams, The Temptations]
She's so fine, I've got to make her mine
Oh baby, gonna walk me a mile
Just to see her smile
I stop and think and I find I'm as rich as can be
(Rich as can be, oh, I'm rich now)
Oh, if you look around, you'll see
You're just as rich as me
And oh, oh-oh, you're just a pretty

[Chorus: Dennis Edwards & The Temptations]
Pretty little brown skin girl, a brown skin girl
Good God (Doo-doo, doo-doo, oh, oh)

[Bridge: Dennis Edwards & The Temptations]
Woo (She's so fine), oh baby
I've got to make her mine
Walk a country mile (Gonna walk me a mile)
Just to see her smile (Woo)

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks]
She's a work of art with plenty of soul
I'll be content if she were mine to hold
Sheer beauty from her head to her feet, you know
Outshine everyone, everyone she'll meet
She's just a

[Chorus: Dennis Edwards & The Temptations]
Pretty little brown skin girl, a brown skin girl
Brown skin girl (Doo-doo, doo-doo, oh, oh)

[Outro: The Temptations]
She's so fine, I've got to make her mine
Walk a country mile, just to see her smile
She's so fine, I've got to make her mine

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
A house sits on the corner of 45th and State
Where the most of the days of my life
That's where I slept and ate
But if you wanna know where my home is
Let me set the record straight

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
Baby, baby, home is where the heart is, oh yeah
Oh, oh, home is where the heart is, oh yeah
Making my home wherever you roam

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
A house is not a home, although it's filled with happiness
Unless thе one you love is therе, you're at the wrong address
Wherever you are is automatically home to me, I guess

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
Oh baby, baby, baby, home is where the heart is, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, home is where the heart is, oh yeah
Making my home wherever you roam

[Bridge: The Temptations, Eddie Kendricks, Melvin Franklin]
Ooh, hoo, hoo
Ooh, hoo, hoo
Mhm, mhm
Oh my love, my heart will be with you
Forevermore, 'til time itself is through
Far or near, there or here
Home for me is wherever you might be

[Outro: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
Oh baby, baby, home is where the heart is, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, home is where the heart is, oh yeah
Making my home wherever you roam
Home is where the heart is, oh yeah
Oh baby, baby, baby (Home, home)

[Chorus: The Temptations]
No time, no time, no time
Oh, oh, oh, ooh

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
No time for boatin' and fishin'
No time for hopin' and wishin'
I've got to get up and make my move
I've got love for you I have to prove
And I spend every day tryin' to think of a way
To get you, hoo

[Chorus: The Temptations]
No time, no time, no time
Oh, oh, oh, ooh

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
No time to talk with the fellows
No time for more than just hellos
But they all understand and wish me well
'Cause you're so right for me and they can tell
A man understands, gotta do what I can
To get you, baby

[Bridge: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
No matter what I have to go through, baby
I'm doing what I can to show it, baby
That you're the right girl for me, and when I kiss tenderly
The girl in my arms she'll be
You, hoo-ooh

[Chorus: The Temptations]
No time, no time, no time
Oh, oh, oh, ooh

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
No time for subtle advances (Baby, no time)
Don't want to take any chances (Or leave enough time)
You're all my hopes and dreams rolled into one
I'm doing everything that can be done
To make it me that you choose, can't afford to lose

[Outro: The Temptations & Eddie Kendricks]
No time, no time, no time
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
(Can't afford to lose no time)
No time, no time, no time
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
(Can't afford to waste no time)
No time, no time, no time

[Verse 1: Paul Williams]
Every night I'm a victim of
The haunting ghost of precious love
That now is gone
And in the gloom of my lonely room
The fragrance of her sweet perfume
Still lingers on
The vows of love we spoke so dear
Still are ringing in my ear

[Chorus: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
And never will love again
No love left since she is gone

[Verse 2: Paul Williams]
I know the blame is mine alone
For things done wrong
And little things I failed to do
But, like a man, I had my pride
But now I've learned
I cannot replace a lovе that's true
Without her, therе's no since in trying
I guess my foolish pride was dying

[Chorus: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
Never will I love again
No love left since she is gone
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, never love again

[Verse 3: Paul Williams]
Don't get me wrong, my story is not a bitter one
Although it's truly, truly sad
What could be sadder than a man
Too proud, too strong to hold on to the love
He needs so bad
A man that must not sit alone
And learn the pain he should have known

[Chorus: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
And never will I love again
There's no love left since she is gone
Never will I love again
There's no love left since she is gone

[Outro: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
Never will I love again (Love again)
There's no love left since she is gone
Never will I love again (Love again)
There's no, no love since

[Verse 1: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
Now if a rock should separate us
I'm gonna think of a way I can move that rock
(Move the rock, move the rock)
And if the clock should keep me waiting
I'm gonna think of a way I can speed up the clock
(Speed the clock, speed the clock)
And if a wall is between us
I'm gonna think of a way I can climb that wall

[Chorus: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
I tried to think of something I wouldn't do
Baby, to get a little closer to you—you know what?
I couldn't think of a thing at all
I couldn't think of a thing at all

[Verse 2: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
Now if opinion should become between us
I'm gonna think of a way we can reach an agreement
(An agreement, an agreement)
And if a brick floor should be between us
I'm gonna think of a way I can dig through the cement
(Through the cement, through the cement)
If there's a ball of fire between us
I'm gonna think of a way to get through that ball

[Chorus: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
I triеd to think of something I wouldn't do
Baby, to get a little closеr to you—you know what?
I couldn't think of a thing at all (Baby)
I couldn't think of a thing at all (Mmm)

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Paul Williams]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
Now if a million miles should separate us
I'm gonna think of a way I can cross those miles
(Cross the miles, cross the miles)
And if my actions begin to bore ya
I'm gonna think of a way I can change my style
(Change my style, change my style)
If there's a burning hall between us
I'm gonna think of a way to get down that hall

[Chorus: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
I tried to think of something I wouldn't do
Hey, to get a little closer to you—you know what?
I couldn't think of a thing at all (Really baby)
I couldn't think of a thing at all

[Outro: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
Hear what I say
I couldn't think of a thing at all
Babe, when I tell ya
I couldn't think of a thing at all
I tried and I tried
I couldn't think of a thing at all

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
Yes, I'm smiling every time you pass me by
I know you wonder why I never cry

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
But let me tell you, happiness (Happiness)
My happiness (Happiness)
Is just a camouflage (Camouflage)
Just a camouflage for a broken heart
I said it is now, yes it is now, for a broken heart

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
They call me the Joker
'Cause I, I'm so gay
But I'm just a clown
'Cause I'm really not that way

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
'Cause all my happiness (Happiness)
My happiness (Happiness)
Is just a camouflage (Camouflage)
Just a camouflage for a broken heart
I said it is now, yes it is now, for a broken hеart

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks]
They call me the Jokеr
'Cause I, I'm so gay
But, I'm just a clown
'Cause I'm really not that way

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
'Cause all my happiness (Happiness)
My happiness (Happiness)Is just a camouflage (Camouflage)
Just a camouflage for a broken heart
Yes it is now, yes it is now, for a broken heart

[Outro: The Temptations]
Oh, baby, for a broken heart
Yes it is now, I said it is now, for a broken heart
Yes it is

[Intro]
Pillow (Dip dip, dip dip)

[Chorus]
My pillow (Pillow, pillow, pillow)
Pillow took your place
My pillow (Pillow, pillow, pillow)
Pillow took your place

[Verse 1]
Last night I cried myself to sleep
A thousand tears ran down my cheek
I held my pillow in a sad embrace
'Cause last night my pillow, my pillow took your place

[Chorus]
My pillow (Pillow, pillow, pillow)
Pillow took your place

[Verse 2]
I closed my eyes, I tried to sleep
I prayed the Lord my love to keep
I held my pillow in a sad embrace
'Cause last night my pillow, my pillow took your place

[Chorus]
My pillow (Pillow, pillow, pillow)
Pillow took your place

[Bridge]
Ah, ah, ah
Why did we fight? Chop, chop
It isn't right, chop, chop
'Cause I love you so

[Verse 3]
Telephone rings last night about two
I heard your voice say "I love you"
I held my pillow in a glad embrace
'Cause tomorrow you will take my pillow's place

[Chorus]
My pillow (Pillow, pillow, pillow)
Pillow took your place
My pillow (Pillow, pillow, pillow)
Pillow took your place

[Outro]
Pillow

Tear-stained letter
A tear-stained letter now
A tear-stained letter
A tear-stained letter
Oh, oh, oh (A tear-stained letter)

[Verse 1: Paul Williams & Melvin Franklin]
That's what I received from you
It made me realize you still
You still love me, too
(Tear-stained letter)
Darling, darling, darling, darling
(Tear-stained letter)
It really took me by surprise
To know after all, all of these years
I brought tears into your eyes

[Bridge: Paul Williams]
I've scribed so many letters now
Wanting to say the same things to you
But I had to tear them up
Because I started crying, too

[Verse 2: Paul Williams, The Temptations, Melvin Franklin]
Why did you have to send me
(Tear-stained letter)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Whoa, oh, ooh
And now you've got me, got me crying, too
A tear-stained letter gonna make it a little better now

[Outro: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
Tears, tears, tears, tears, tears, tears, hey, hey, tears
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Tear-stained letter now
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Oh, you don't have to cry no more
Tears, tears, tears, tears, tears, said tears
Tear-stained letter, a tear-stained letter
That's what did it now, I can't quit it now
Tears, tears, tears, tears, tears, a tear-stained letter

[Intro: The Temptations]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
Come on back to me, baby
I'll pretend that you’ve never been gone
Come on back to me, baby
I'll pretend that you didn't do me wrong

[Verse 1: Paul Williams  & The Temptations]
I’ll pretend, the great pretender
That you were truthful from the start
The bad times, I won't remember
But the good times will last forever in my heart

[Chorus: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
Come on back to me, baby
There are two sides of love, I know
Come on back to me, baby
I'll forgеt the bad side I've been shown

[Verse 2: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
I'll do еverything to please ya
Just don't keep us apart
About the bad side, I'll have amnesia
But the good side will live forever in my heart

[Bridge: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
I'll remember, baby (I’ll remember, baby)
How we used to laugh and joke at the words you spoke
That made my heart feel good
I’ll forget about (I'll forget about)
The times you made me blue with some help from you
I know I could (Know I could)
Know I could (I know I could)
I know I could and I would say

[Chorus: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
Come on back to me, baby
’Cause my faith in you will be restored
Come on back to me, baby
And the new heights of love be explored

[Verse 3: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
Come, I'll give you all my trust
We can make a brand new start
I'll forget the bad because I must
But the good times will last forever in my heart
Come on back

[Outro: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
Come on back
For good times that last forever in my heart
Come on back
I need ya
Come on back
Physically, I want you, baby
Come on back
Baby girl, please
Come on back
I want you right now

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
To get stones from a rock, you've got to break it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
To get bread from dough, you've got to bake it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
To get water from a faucet, you've got to turn it
And if you want my love, if you want my love
You've got to earn it (Earn it, earn it, earn it)
What I say (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
To get fire from a match, you've got to strike it

One more thing

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
To make broken things work, you've got to fix them
(Fix them, fix them, fix them, fix them)
Listen, to make two things one, you've got to mix them
(Mix them, mix them, mix them, mix them)

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
To get butter from milk, you've got to churn it
And if you want my love, one more time, if you want my love

[Intro: The Temptations & David Ruffin]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: David Ruffin]
Her love's so real but friends could only see
From a picture staring out at me
Oh, just a cold face in high society
A face that's real but yet to them a fantasy

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
They called her a mannequin, oh baby
But if they could feel the warmth of her sweet love
Then they would know that she's real and she's loved
She's not a statute of a mannequin
No, she's not a mannequin
I know, I know, I know she's not a mannequin

[Verse 2: David Ruffin]
Oh, but they don't know how much we love each other so
That's because I'm just a common man, no one must know
So we must meet in thе shadows on the street
And 'cause only we arе there no one will ever know

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
She's not a mannequin
Listen here, fellas
In her eyes, I see coldness there
'Cause when she walks by, she doesn't seem to care
That is why they call her a mannequin
But I know, I know she's not a mannequin
Ooh-ooh, she's not a mannequin

[Bridge: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
One day we'll show the world
One day we'll show the world
The realness of our love they will see
Behind those eyes so cold
You have a precious heart of gold
Not a mannequin, ooh (Mannequin)

[Outro: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Even though it's her disguise, what she failed to realize
Things must be this way
'Cause she has a role to play, each and every day
A mannequin
I know, I know, I know she's not a mannequin
Tell me, baby, you're not a mannequin
I know, I know, I know she's not a mannequin
Doo-doo, doo-doo, mannequin

[Verse 1: Paul Williams]
So many heartaches, so much misery
So many lonely hours of hurt you've been causing me
Something is wrong, I can see a change
When we're together you seem so strange
Maybe it's me, or can it be
You haven't changed a bit but I just noticed it

[Chorus: The Temptations]
I was blinded by love for years
I now see you clear through my tears

[Verse 2: Paul Williams]
So many phone calls, so many dimes
So many people said you're not wrong so many times
So messages you never replied to
Maybe you don't think it's as important as I do
You keep me in doubt, I'm finding out
That when you see me crying, to you it's satisfying

[Chorus: The Temptations]
I was blinded by lovе for years
I now see you clear through my tears
Baby, I was blindеd by love for years
Hey, but I now see you clear through my tears

[Bridge: Paul Williams]
Mhm, you were a devil in an angel's disguise
These tears I shed will open up my eyes
This fool is wise, I realize
That you're no good for me and that you'll never be
I was

[Chorus: The Temptations]
I was blinded by love for years
I now see you clear through my tears

[Outro: The Temptations & Paul Williams]
(Baby) I was blinded by love for years
(Baby, when I tell you, but I now)
I now see you clear through my tears
(And oh yeah, said I was)
I was blinded by love for years
(Believe me, darling, but I now)
I now see you clear through my tears
(Hear me when say I was)
I was blinded by love for years

[Verse 1: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Once I thought that love was a toy
(For girls and boys)
I never gave my heart, I just played the part
(Right from the start)
Then there was you, sweet you
With love that I knew, I knew was true
But in my pride, I left you, baby
Just hanging on, now love is gone

[Pre-Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
(Now I know) Now I know, baby
What I was too, too slow to learn
(Now I know) Woo, now I know
Now I'm all alone and my heart is yearning

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Only a lonely man would know
Only a lonely man would know
The bitter tears I've cried since I've lost you
Since you said goodbye
(Ask a lonely man)
Only a lonely, lonely man would know, honey
The pain inside of me since I let my pride make a fool of me
(Ask a lonely man)

[Verse 2: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Ask any lonely man you see, yeah
Ooh, ask any lonely man like me, yeah
Foolishly, girl, I broke your heart (Now we're apart)
Now in my lonely room I just reminisce (Long for your kiss)
Now through my lonely tears, I can see ahead long lonely years
Without your love, my world, my world's at an end
Black's closing in

[Pre-Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
You don't know, honey, how much I need you, baby
Woo, you don't know how sorry I am that I failed to keep you, baby

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Only a lonely, only a lonely, lonely man would know
Bitter tears I've cried since I've lost you
Since you said goodbye
(Ask a lonely man)
Only a lonely, only a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely man would know
The pain inside me since I've let my pride make a fool of me
(Ask a lonely man)

[Outro: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Ask any lonely man you see, yeah baby
Ooh, honey, honey, just ask any lonely man like me, yeah
Ask him, baby
Only a lonely man would know
Only a lonely man would know, baby

Bitter tears I've cried since I've lost you
Since you said goodbye
Ask a lonely man
Ask him, baby
Only a lonely man would know
Ask any lonely man would know
The bitter pain inside of me since I let my pride make a fool of me
Ask a lonely man
Only a lonely man would know

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
Yes, I'm smiling every time you pass me by
I know you wonder why I never cry

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
Well, let me tell you, happiness (Happiness)
My happiness (Happiness)
Is just a camouflage (Camouflage)

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks & David Ruffin]
They call me the Joker (I'm a joker)
'Cause I, I always play
But I'm just a clown (I'm just a clown)
'Cause I'm really not that way

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
'Cause all my happiness (Happiness)
My happiness (Happiness)
Oh, is just a camouflage (Camouflage)

[Bridge: The Temptations]
Open your eyes and see I'm crying
Open your eyes and see I'm dying
Open your eyes and see I'm crying
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks & David Ruffin]
They call me the Joker (The joker)
'Cause I, I always play
But I'm just a clown (I'm just a clown)
'Cause I'm really not that way

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
'Cause all my happiness (Happiness)
My happiness (Happiness)
Oh, is just a camouflage (Camouflage)

[Outro: The Temptations & Eddie Kendricks]
Open your eyes and see I'm crying
(I love you)
Open your eyes and see I'm dying
(Oh, yes I do)
Open your eyes and see I'm crying
(Ooh baby)
Open your eyes and see I'm dying
(Ooh baby)
Open your eyes and see I'm crying
(Of a broken heart)
Open your eyes and see I'm dying
(I've got a broken heart)
Open your eyes and see I'm crying

Open your eyes and see I'm dying

[Verse 1: David Ruffin]
I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Ain't too proud to beg, and you know it
Please don't leave me, girl (Don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl (Don't you go)

[Verse 2: David Ruffin]
Now I heard a crying man is half a man
With no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you, I don't mind weeping
If it'll keep you by my side

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl (Don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl (Don't you go)

[Verse 3: David Ruffin]
If I havе to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walking away
Let your friends laugh, еven this I can stand
'Cause I want to keep you any way I can

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl (Don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl (Don't you go)
Hoo, ooh, ooh, alright

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4: David Ruffin]
Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to come and plead to you, baby
If pleading keeps you from walking out that door

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl (Don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl (Don't you go)

[Outro: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Ooh, sweet darlin')

[Verse 1: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
When the people slide down ski trails without any snow
(Any snow)
And the little children fly their kites, no wind to blow
(Wind to blow)

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Neither you nor I would be fools enough to try
That'll be the day, that'll be the day
When I stop loving you, stop loving you, ooh

[Verse 2: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
When it's easy as pie to pick a rose that never, never did bloom
(Didn't bloom)
When the heartbroken man's convinced that there ain't any gloom
(Ain't no gloom)

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Neither I nor you believe some things come true
That'll bе the day, that'll be the day (That'll bе the day)
When I stop loving you, stop loving you (I'll stop loving you)
Ooh, that'll be the day, baby (I'll stop loving you)
(I'll stop loving you)

[Bridge: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Ooh, my love is deeper, baby (Deeper, baby)
Far more than any sea
The day that I stop loving you
What a mess this world would be

[Verse 3: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
When every bit of the warmth is gone from the summer sun
(Summer sun)
When leaves bloom on the trees and winter has come
(Winter has come, winter has come)

[Chorus: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
You and I have fears, this could happen in a million years
That'll be the day, that'll be the day (That'll be the day)
When I stop loving you, stop loving you

[Outro: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
(I'll stop loving you)
That'll be the day, baby
(I'll stop loving you)
That'll be the day
(I'll stop loving you)
People slide down ski trails without any snow
(I'll stop loving you)
Little children fly their kites with no wind to blow
(I'll stop loving you)
When a heartbroken man's convinced that there's—

[Verse 1: Paul Williams]
Oh, when I can give you all the stars in the sky
And all of the things your little heart desires
When I can place the world at your feet
And satisfy your every need
When I can cry and not be sad
But cry because you make me glad
When I can smile and make you know
Without saying the words I love you so

[Chorus: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
You'll be forever mine and I'll be satisfied
Baby, baby, I'll be satisfied

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
When I can give to you a song
That your heart sing the whole day long
And when I can set your soul on fire
I'll be your onе and only desire
And when I can provе to you that I care
That I'm worthy of your life to share
Chances are I love you more
Guess I won't mind as long as I know

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
You'll be right by my side, and darling, I'll be satisfied
(Baby, baby) You know that I will
I'll be satisfied
You'll be right by my side, and darling, I'll be so satisfied
Baby, baby) So satisfied
I'll be satisfied

[Verse 3: David Ruffin]
Baby, when I've done my very best
To fill your life with happiness
Our two hearts, you know, will beat as one
We'll only part when life is done
And then I'll take you in my arms (I'll be satisfied)
And kiss your sweet lips from dusk to dawn (I'll be satisfied)
Darling, heaven will know I won't ever let you go (I'll be satisfied)
You'll be mine now and forevermore (I'll be satisfied)
Everything will be fine, and I'll be so satisfied

[Outro: Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams, David Ruffin, The Temptations]
Baby
I'm gonna take you in my arms
Say you love me so, girl
I'll be satisfied, baby, ooh-hoo
I'm gonna take you in my arms
Every day of my life
Oh, I'll treat you right, baby

My girl, my girl, my girl

[Chorus]
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me

[Verse 1]
City of gods, city of dreams
City where nothing is ever what it seems
They'll never take it all away from me
'Cause I see nothing but infinity
And I, I will love, I will love you wherever you are
I've been wishing, wishing on every star
I believe, I believe that you're never far
I'm begging you

[Chorus]
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me

Does it ever get easier?
Does it ever start?
Does it always end with a broken heart?
Will you ever see me for all that I am?
Have you already given all that you can?
I'm begging you

[Chorus]
New York City, please go easy on me tonight (I'm begging you)
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me

[Verse]
Everyone knows him as "old folks"
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird, and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so, mmm
Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Puts his napkin under, oh, his chin
And that yellow cob pipe
It's so mellow, it's right
You needn't be ashamed of him

[Bridge]
Every Friday he'd go fishing
Way down on Buzzard's Bay
But he'd only hook a perch or two
"A whale got away"
So, so we warmed up the steak, yeah

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, someday there'll be no more old folks
What a lonely old town this will be
Children's voices at play
Will be still for a day
The day they take old folks away

[Verse 1]
I wish I liked you as much as I love you
'Cause things you do make me cry
But when I say goodbye
Like a fool, I come running back for more, mhm
I wish I liked you as much as I love you
I know there's heartaches ahead
I should turn but instead
Like a fool, I keep going on for more

[Bridge]
They say there's a line between love and hate
So close, you can't tell them apart
But I don't care what they say
In your arms I'm gonna stay
Though I wind up with a broken heart

[Verse 2]
And I, I wish I liked you as much as I love you
But darling, what can I do?
I'm so in love with you
So let this fool come running back for more
Oh, my darling

[Outro]
But darling, what can I do?
I'm so much in love with you
Let this fool comе running back for more, oh-ho
Oh baby, let this fool come running back
I wish I likеd you, darling
Ooh, my darling, my darling

[Intro: The Isley Brothers]
There will always be a weak spot here in my heart for you
There will always be a weak spot here in my heart for you
Oh, what a pleasure seeing you again

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
It's so good seeing you once more
Although things are like they were before
You have a new love, and I one, too
But after all the things that we've been through

[Chorus: The Isley Brothers, Ronald Isley]
There will always be a weak spot here in my heart for you
(Yes, it will)
Therе will always be a weak spot herе in my heart for you

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]
I remember how I called your name
And each time I called, honey, you changed
The thing that stands out most in my memory
Is that you've always been so good to me

[Chorus: The Isley Brothers, Ronald Isley]
There will always be a weak spot here in my heart for you
(Yes, it will)
There will always be a weak spot here in my heart for you

[Refrain: Ronald Isley, The Isley Brothers]
And I believe that everybody's got a weak spot for someone
I said I believe that everybody's got a weak spot for someone

[Verse 3: Ronald Isley]
Now we both must go our separate ways
There's just one more thing I wanna say
If I never cross your path again
It doesn't matter whose arms I'm in

[Chorus: The Isley Brothers, Ronald Isley]
There will always be a weak spot here in my heart for you
(Yes, there will)
There will always be a weak spot here in my heart for you

[Outro: Ronald Isley, The Isley Brothers]
And I believe that everybody's got a weak spot for someone
There will always be a weak spot here in my heart for you
Yes, it will

Hoo-hoo, ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
You're such a sweet thing
You're so fine
You're just as pretty on the inside
As you are outside
To think that you were mine

[Pre-Chorus]
And when some other girls start hanging around
Like a fool I went and put you down

[Chorus]
I gave up quality for quantity
Gave up quality for quantity
And now I'm sad and blue
Because I put them all together
And they don't equal just one you
(Just one you, just one you)

[Verse 2]
You gave me all your love
With a gentle touch (With a gentle touch)
How could I have given up one girl
For five timеs as many
And still not have as much?

[Pre-Chorus]
They say that a bird in the hand
Is worth tеn in the bush
And since I gave you up for them
You don't know how I wish

[Chorus]
I hadn't gave up quality for quantity
Gave up quality for quantity
And now I'm sad and blue
Because I put them all together
And they don't equal just one you
(Just one you, just one you)
Little old you

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Oh, baby, now, you've got a certain quality
That only diamonds possess
The rest are like costume jewelry
You're the best (You're the best)
Baby, I confess (I confess)

[Chorus]
I never should have gave up quality for quantity
Gave up quality for quantity
And now I'm sad and blue
Because I put them all together
And they don't equal just one you
(Just one you, just one you)

[Outro]
Whoa, I shouldn't have gave
Gave up quality for quantity
Tell me why did I give up quality for quantity
I never should have gave up

[Verse 1]
Sweetheart, if you should stray
A million miles away
I will always be in love with you
Although you find more bliss
In someone else's kiss
I will always be in love with you

[Bridge]
I can't do anymore
I tried so hard to please
Let me thank you for
Those kind, sweet memories

[Verse 2]
I said I wish you
I wish you happiness
But for me, I will guess
I will always be in love with you

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, oh baby

[Instrumental Break]

Hey, yeah, yeah

Ah, I said I can't do anymore
Huh, I tried so hard to please
But darling, let me thank you for
Those kind, sweet memories

[Verse 3]
I said I wish you
I wish you happiness
But for me, sweetheart, I guess
I will always be in love with you

[Outro]
I said that although you find more bliss
Yeah, in someone else's kiss
I will always be in love with you, yeah
I said I wish you
I said I wish you happiness

[Verse 1: Stevie Wonder, India.Arie, Both]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir, and
Folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows the turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard sleep to tonight

[Bridge: India.Arie, Stevie Wonder, Both]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder, India.Arie, Both]
And so we're offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Stevie Wonder, India.Arie, Both]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Outro: Stevie Wonder, India.Arie, Both]
And so we're offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although It's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you
(Yeah, yeah) Merry Christmas, everybody
(Yeah, yeah) Merry Christmas, India
Merry Christmas, Stevie

[Verse 1]
In life we have our pains and sorrows
Face mountains we think we can't climb
Not thinking there's always tomorrow
You feel like giving up
You say you're out of luck
But then you hear a voice in your mind
Telling you to

[Chorus]
Hold on to your dream
'Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a father to his son
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you
Hold on to your dream
'Til the day that life is said and done

[Verse 2]
This world is filled with peaks and valleys
With rivers we think we can't cross
Too busy keeping sorrows telling
You say you're at you're end
You say you never win
But then a light comes on in your mind telling you to

[Chorus]
Hold on to your dream
'Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a father to his son
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you
Hold on to your dream
Until the day that life is said and done

[Bridge]
If you wanna hold on to something
You better hold on to your dreams
If you want to hold on to something
You better hold to your love
To your love

[Verse 3]
So if they try to burst your bubble
It's 'cause they have none of their own
And when you feel you are in trouble
Hold your head up high
And feel your heart inside
And know that you are never alone
Just as long as you

[Chorus]
Hold on to your dream
'Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a father to his son
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you
Hold on to your dream
Until the day that life is said and done
Hold on to your dream
'Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a mother to her child
Don't let anyone ever steal your dreams from you
Hold on to your dream
And do your best to always wear a smile

[Outro]
(I love you, papa)
Hold on to your dream

[Verse 1]
Give me a chance to catch my breath
'Cause I'm in a state of awe
Guess miracles do never cease
For we're back together now
Pardon me please if I pinch myself
So to know this is not a dream
As I reminisce the love we shared
And the pain there was between

[Chorus]
Look at the clouds in the sky
They seem so happy now
Look at the sun, feel its rays
With such a smiling face
Maybe we can't, maybe we can
With the lovе that we're feeling inside
Sharе it with all the world and see each heart
Kiss lonely goodbye

[Verse 2]
If given a chance to live again
I'd change not a single thing
'Cause that little change could sadly mean
That you to me faith wouldn't bring
Partly I cry for those lonely nights
And a heartache I thought couldn't end
Yet joyfully I cry 'cause I know our love
We won't let us lose again
Never again

[Chorus]
Look at the clouds in the sky
They seem so happy now
Look at the sun, feel its rays
With such a smiling face
Maybe we can't but I know we can
With the love that we're feeling inside
Share it with all the world and see each heart
Share it with all the world and see each heart
Share it with all the world and see each heart
Kiss lonely goodbye

[Outro]
Share it with all the world and see each heart
Kiss lonely goodbye

[Verse 1]
I'm not a saint
I couldn't be a guardian angel
Can't be what I ain't
And if you want more, then I can't blame you
If I had a chance with you
Darned if I wouldn't do my best
My best to be true, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Ain't very smart
I can't hold no deep conversation
But I offer you my heart
You could save it from a sad situation
Oh, how I'd love to hold you in my arms
To the fascination with my many charms
Try me, try me

[Bridge]
Love, love, love, you ain't seen no lovin' yet
Talkin' about some holding you (Holding you)
Squeezing you (Squeezing you)
Be it right, be it true, oh, hey, hey, oh

[Verse 3]
I don't go out very often
Ain't got a whole lot of money
Sit at home alone thinkin' 'bout ya
Let me tell you, it sure ain't fun
Now I could have a wеalth untold
If I only had you in my arms, yeah, to hold

[Outro]
Give me a chancе, baby
I need your lovin'
Just a chance with you
Oh, hey, hey, yeah, baby
Said I want a chance
Just a—

[Verse 1]
Ow, look out, baby, you're the one
I've chosen you so here I come
You better prepare yourself for me and nobody else

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm gonna take care of business
Take care of business

[Verse 2]
Oh, pack everything and say your goodbyes
Kiss your mama, tell her "Don't cry"
You'll never have a need
'Cause you've been blessed to be

[Chorus]
With a man who take care of business
Baby, take care of business, woo

[Bridge]
Put your hand in my hand
Let's go, baby, hoo
(Take care of business, take care of business)
You know I'm stubborn, and I hate to be denied
Like every other man I know, I like to be satisfied
I may throw my weight around, darling, seem all out of place
But it's not my fault, I was born that way, hey
(Take care of business, take care of business)
Woo-hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Take care of business, take care of business)
Ah, you'll never have a need
'Cause you've been blessed to be

[Chorus]
With a man who take care of business
Oh baby, take care of business, woo

[Outro]
Put your hand in my hand
Let's go, baby, woo-ooh
(Ah, takes care of business)
I know, honey, I can take care of business
You know, I can take care of business
Your mama knows I'll take care of you, baby
Ah baby, woo-hoo
You know that I can take care of lots of business, sugar
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Take care of business, take care of business)
Ah, woo-hoo
(Ah, take care of business)
Oh, oh, every day of your life, darling
(Ah, takes care of business)
I know, I know, I know, ooh
(Ah, takes care of business)

[Intro]
Ah, ah

[Verse 1]
I sob in pain, I call your name
'Cause you're leaving, baby
And soon this room will fill with gloom
I'll be grieving, baby
I call to you, so don't say we're through

[Chorus]
I cannot do without your love
(Can't do without your love)
Don't leave me, girl, I cannot do without your love
(Can't do without your love)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 2]
Something went wrong, he'll soon be gone
I'll be lonely, baby, will be lonely
Say it's not true that you won't do
Why don't you show me, show me, darling
Please don't leave, you're what I need

[Chorus]
I cannot do without your love
(Can't do without your love)
Don't leave me, girl, I cannot do without your love
(Can't do without your love) Oh baby

[Bridge]
(Ooh) Stand beside me
(Ooh) Don't lеave me
(Ooh) Don't deny mе
(Ooh) 'Cause I need you, baby
Can't do without your love, can't do without your love
Can't do without your love, can't do without your love

[Verse 3]
Oh, if I have done wrong by you
Then darling, darling, help me to do right
Come show me what I must do
Let me hold you tight
Oh, let me know, and I will show
That I, I love you, yeah
Yes, I do, yeah
Stevie love, love, baby, hey, hey, hey
Hope in my heart that we won't part
Please don't hurt me
Don't you hurt Baby Steve, baby
Please turn around, don't let me down
Don't you desert me, no, baby
We loved so long, so no sense going

[Chorus]
I can't do without your love
(Can't do without your love)
Don't leave me, girl, I can't do without your love
(Can't do without your love)
No, no, no, no, no

[Outro]
I can't go on if you'll be gone
It's you that I need, so please don't leave
Can't do without your love, can't do without your love
Can't do without your love, can't do without your love
Can't do

[Chorus]
Hello, Mister Moon
I wanna thank you for the love light that you give me nightly
(Yeah)
Hello, Mister Stars
Your winking is the reason that my baby holds me tightly

[Verse 1]
'Cause you gave me lovin' I never thought I'd have (Ooh baby, baby, yeah)
Gave me every reason to be glad (Ooh baby, baby, yeah)
Now you brought me to a girl that loves me so
And I never ever could say no, yeah

[Chorus]
Hello, Mister Moon
I wanna thank you for the mellow tune you taught my baby
(Ooh baby, baby)
Hello, Mister Stars
I wanna thank you for the words you whispеr to her softly

[Verse 2]
'Cause she nеver ever keeps a thing from me (Ooh, ooh, baby, yeah)
You know every word you said you done to me (Ooh baby, baby, yeah)
You said "I love you, and I'll never let you go
You're the only one for me, I know" (Hey, hey, hey, hey, woo)

[Refrain]
Hello, Mister Moon
Hello, Mister Stars
Hello, Mister Moon
Hello, Mister Stars

[Verse 3]
Now that my lovin' girl belongs (Ooh baby, yeah)
I'm gonna tell her how it came to be (Ooh baby, baby, yeah)
The way my baby make me feel good every touch
But the moon and stars helped win her heart

[Outro]
Hello, Mister Moon
I wanna thank you for the love light that you give me nightly
(Ooh baby)
Hello, Mister Stars
Your winking is the reason that my baby held me tightly
(Oh, oh, oh, hello, Mister Moon)

(Baby, baby, baby, yeah, oh baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah)
Hello, Mister Moon
I wanna thank you for

[Verse 1]
You're gone and now I'm all alone
I cry and wonder what went wrong
God knows I tried, you know I need you
You are my life, my only vice
They say, "Go on," I can be strong
My pride is gone, I'll never leave you

[Bridge]
We've got love to share together
Don't let them keep us apart
Let's not let another minute go

[Verse 2]
Your friends all say we won't go on
They say your love was never strong
They say that I could never please you
Don't let them toss our lovе aside
Hey girl, don't break this hеart of mine
How could you ever listen to them?

[Bridge]
We've been used, abused, confused
But we can't let them get us down
Say you love me, say you need me now

[Chorus]
Why don't we start out a new day
Start love a true way
We'll get along so well
We've heard enough talk
Let's try to walk hand in hand
Why don't we stop our hearts from hurting
Start our flames a-burning
We'll work it out somehow
Get something going
Start something going now
Hey, hey, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Harmonica Solo]

[Bridge]
We've been through so much together
Love has always been our guide
We can make it, our love will survive

[Outro]
Ah, why don't we start out a new day
Let's do it our way
Our love would be so strong
We're gonna make it
We've got to make it now
Why don't we start out a new day
Start love a true way
We'll get along so well
We've heard enough talk
Let's try to walk hand in hand
Why don't we start out a new day
Start love a true way
We'll get along so well
We've heard enough talk
Let's try to walk hand in hand
Di-di, di-di-di-di-di, yeah, oh

[Intro]
Honey, I'm sorry that I had to go
But there's something about me that you didn't know
When I was young, I fathered a son
Now he's got himself in trouble
And now he's on the run

[Verse 1]
His mother and I were quite young at the time
But there's not much room for doubt
That the child was mine
I asked her folks for her hand
But they said there's just no way
No matter how I begged and pleaded
They sent their daughter away

[Pre-Chorus]
I only know his name
But I was touched by what the paper said
They said he's on the run
With a price on his head

[Chorus]
So I've got to find him
I feel it's my place
I've got to find my son
I've got no time to waste
I've got to find him
'Cause he's my son
If he had had a father there to guide his way
He wouldn't be on the run today

[Verse 2]
I never saw my son
I only knew his name
When he turned five years old
His photograph came
I've got this worn out picture
A name of a town
With no other trace left to be found
But I'm sure I'll find him
'Cause he is my son
'Cause a father's love remains
No matter what his child has done

[Chorus]
So I've got to find him
I feel it's my place
I've got to find my son
I've got no time to waste
I've got to find him
'Cause he is my son
If he had had a father there to guide his way
He wouldn't be on the run today

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, yeah
I'm really getting worried, people
I've got to find my son
Some friends of his told me they saw him
Running with a gun

[Chorus]
So I've got to find him
I feel it's my place
I've got to find my son
I've got no time to waste
I've got to find him
Oh, 'cause he is my son
If he had had a father there to guide his way
He wouldn't be on the run today

[Outro]
Oh, I've got to find, oh, I've got to, ooh
(I feel it's my place) Feel it's my place
Oh, I've got to find my son
I've got no time to waste

[Chorus]
When I'm away from you
I’m happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin’ you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't awarе that you made me misеrable
So if you rеally wanna know

[Chorus]
When I’m away from you (When I’m away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn’t true, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
’Cause you only listen to your—
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this sh—
You made me hate this city

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk - about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that ****'s embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me ******' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

[Outro]
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just ******' leave me alone, yeah

[Verse 1]
Everybody come on and go to the Go-Go
If you're in a dancing groove
Everybody come on and go to the Go-Go
If you really like to move

My pleasure to share it with you
Don't you feel it?

[Refrain]
Don't you feel it?

Just sing your blues away, hey
For my dreams you help come true
Thanks to all of you, and you, and you

[Hook / Opening]
Don't do drugs, drugs are bad
Don't smoke weed, remember kids
Don't do drugs, drugs are bad
Don't smoke crack, say no to drugs

[Verse 1]
Woke up in the room spinning
Two fat women beside me dressed in black linen
No teeth, and grinning (yuck)
Empty bottles and ecstasy on the night stand
Who wants to have sex with me? Let's see a show of hands
Imagine if all rap sounded like this, only songs with a message about smacking a bitch
Or maybe a song about snorting lines and getting lit
Maybe I could burn it to a disc, and sell it to the kids (it's for kids)
I think I was born just to fuck with your head, a white rapper who only raps about snorting coke and getting head
My mom gave me somе rope and said to tie it around my neck
I spеnt the rest of the day just hanging around in the shed, up in the lab cutting lines and getting high
Can't decide if I want to listen to 50 Cent or Obie Trice
Don't make any sudden moves cause I have Dre tied up in the back
And if you do I'll fuck around and write a sequel to fack

[Hook]
Don't do drugs, drugs are bad
Don't smoke wee, remember kids
Don't do drugs, drugs are bad
Don't smoke crack, say no to drugs
Don't do drugs, drugs are bad
Don't smoke weed, remember kids
Don't do drugs, drugs are bad
You see it's so easy just say no to drugs

[Verse 2]
Hi there, Susan (Hello, Mr. Shady)
Did you know that adults dump out half or their soda and then mix booze in?
Or better yet they do it while driving their car
It's really dangerous, but how else are they suppose to get home from the bar?
And how about the pills your mom calls candy, locked in the cabinet?
Haven't you ever wondered? Don't you want to try it?
You already know where she keeps the key
Just wait until she's had a couple and falls asleep
Remember, there's no reason to tell your dad (why's that?)
Well, there's no telling how many he's had
You see, your dad has a problem that we call addiction
It blurs his vision and he ends up making bad decisions
Quiet, there's a knock at the door (Who is it, Mr. Shady?)
It's your father, more drunk than before (shit)
Well I guess that's my cue to bail, your mom's passed out
And your dad is looking for some tail, good luck Susan

[Hook 4x]

[Intro]
(Wooh)

[Verse 1]
Hey, you're walking down fifth avenue
There was no way I could not say hi
When your smile so gorg, girls get mad at you (Oh)
'Cause your body makes them young boys cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight, I feel young good
Girl I really, I really really wanna dance with you
And hold your hand and I could be the one you'd go
When you need a fren
We're just beginning (Ohh)

Playing my harmonica in a mellow way"

[Interlude]
Hi, this is Stevie Wonder, and I'd like to thank all of my fans for buying my records over in Great Britain. And when I was there I'd like to say I enjoyed being there very much. I'd like to thank very definitely all of my fan members in the Tamla-Motown Appreciation Society. I'd like to say, until I come over there, I just wanna hear everybody just keep on saying "Yeah."

[Verse 1]
Don't wanna believe what they're telling me
Somebody's been picking in my cherry tree
Don't wanna mistrust nobody by mistake
But I can tell someone's been digging 'round in my cake

[Chorus]
And I ain't gonna stand for it, baby

And I ain't gonna stand for it, baby

[Verse 1: Stevie Wonder]
You made my soul a burning fire
You're getting to be my one desire
You're getting to be all that matters to me
And let me tell you, girl
I hope and pray each day I live
A little more love I'll have to give
A little more love that's devoted and true
'Cause all I do is think about you

[Chorus: The Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder]
All I do (Oh baby), is think about you (Think about you, baby)
All I do (Mmm), is think about you

[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder]
Baby, just suppose I should happen to cross your mind
And by some chance a boy like me you've really been trying to find
Well, let me tеll you, girl
Think of how exciting it would be
If you should discover you feel likе me
If you should discover this dream is for two
Well, I'm gonna tell you, girl
I'd light a candle every day
And pray that you'll always feel this way
And pray that our love will forever be new
'Cause all I do is think about you

[Chorus: The Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder]
All I do (Oh baby), is think about you (I think about you)
All I do (Yeah, baby), is think about you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Stevie Wonder]
Gonna tell you, girl
I'd light a candle every day
And pray that you'll always feel this way
And pray that our love will forever be new
I'm gonna tell you, girl
If I cannot have you for my own
I'd rather be lonely and all alone
I'd rather keep thinking the way that I do
'Cause all I do is think about you

[Chorus: The Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder]
All I do (Oh, oh, baby), is think about you (Think about you, baby)
All I do (Ooh, oh, baby), is think about you (I think about you, baby)

[Chorus: The Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder]
All I do (Just get on down, yeah, yeah), is think about you
(Oh, oh, oh, get on down)
All I do (All I do is think about you, baby), is think about you
(I think about you, baby)
All I do (Oh baby), is think about you
(Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel the fire burning?)
All I do (Can you feel that I think about you, baby?), is think about you
(Oh, oh, can you feel my love flowing?)
All I do (Can you see my love growing?), is think about you (Whoa)

[Outro: Stevie Wonder & The Jackson 5]
All I do, is think about you

[Interlude]
"You Will Know" originally started off as a love song that turned into a song dealing with another form of love. And that is the most important form of love of all: the force of God talking to that lonely one of young being so brokenhearted, traveling down the rigid road of life, using pharmaceutical extractions to find the paradise. Um, dealing with a person who has lost their way in life, and feeling that they have no purpose in life, no reason for life. It's saying, as they get down on their knees and start to pray and look up to Heaven for the answer and they hear a voice that says that voice is the almighty God, or Allah, or whomever one you believe in

[Chorus]
Oh, you will know
Troubled heart, you know
Every life has reason
For I made it so

[Interlude]
When I think of character, I think of a kind of person with character with respect, respect towards others as well as themself. I have character, everyone has character, every person has their individual personality. Personality is character. When there is a major disaster, people show character, a sense of caring. And we can take how, and what we are in those times, those times of feeling love, you know, the feeling of Christmas. I'm talking about when people really give from their hearts to those less fortunate, that's character. The character of life is what you do in life. After life, you can only be remembered for that that you have done in life, so it is important for me to try to do the best that I can do in this life to elevate myself to the highest of my ability, to be the best me that I can be. So I really, um, I'm very excited, I'm very thankful. Like I said, because this is not three, this is not two, Characters is one of a kind

[Outro]
Every life has reason
For I made it so
Know
Troubled heart, you know
Problems have solutions
Trust and I will show, mmm
You will know
Lonely heart, you know
Every life has reason
For I made it so

[Verse 1]
I was a lonely no one
Living in a vacuum as life's debris
Victimized as one whose self deprivation
Had made for my outer insecurity
I was a "he ain't nothing"
Living in the slums of love's misery
Starving from the lack of sweet affection
'Til you came to rescue me

[Chorus]
Hey, now my eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Since you walked through my door
I don't have to no longer be blue

[Verse 2]
I was a Mr. Lonely
Seeing only darkness in the bright of day
Blind even though my eyes were wide open
But then your love sunshined my way

[Chorus]
Hey, my eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more (No)
Since you walked through my door
I don't have to no longer be blue
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more (No)
Now that love's touched my soul
All my lonely nights alone are through

[Bridge]
I don't cry, baby, baby, I don't cry
(I don't cry, I don't cry no more)
I don't cry (I don't cry)
Baby, baby, I don't cry
(I don't cry, I don't cry no more)
My eyes don't cry, no, no, no
My eyes don't cry, no, no, no
(I don't cry, I don't cry no more)

[Verse 3]
I was a Mr. Lonely
Seeing only darkness in the bright of day
Blind even though my eyes were wide open
But then your love sunshined my way

[Chorus]
Hey, my eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more (No)
Since you walked through my door
I don't have to no longer be blue
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more (No)
Now that love's touched my soul
All my lonely nights alone are through

[Outro]
(I don't cry, I don't cry no more)
I don't cry
(I don't cry) Baby, baby, I don't cry
(I don't cry, I don't cry no more)
I don't cry (I don't cry)
Baby, baby, I don't cry
(I don't cry, I don't cry no more)
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
My nights are not lonely no more
My tears don't flow no more
My eyes don't cry (No more)
My eyes don't cry
My heart don't ache no more
My eyes don't

[Verse 1]
My outer self looks happy as can be
A perfect dream, love as clear as all can see
But just like that, real has hit me suddenly
My outer is a liar

[Chorus]
'Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me
Loud and clear my soul cries out with total honesty
I need the fire, fire, fire
To keep me warm, I got to feel the fire

[Verse 2]
My smiling face with laughter on the side
You'd say no doubt I get passion every night
But if in our bed your arms don't hold me tight
Means it leaves much to be desired

[Chorus]
'Cause when I look into my heart and I tell the truth to me
Loud and clear my soul cries out with total honesty
I need the fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire
To keep me warm, I got to feel the fire, oh, oh
And if you look into my eyes (Look into my eyes)
And you told yourself the truth (Told yourself the truth)
You can't make a body hot if you don't light the fuse
I need your fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire
To keep me warm, I got to feel the fire, oh yeah

[Bridge]
It don't take a rocket scientist to know
That if you don't fan the flame then the fire will eventually go

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, when you look into my heart (Look into my heart)
And tell the truth to me (And tell the truth to me)
Loud and clear (Loud and clear) my soul cries out (Soul cries out)
With total honesty (Total honesty)
I need the fire (I need the fire), fire (I need the fire), fire (Yeah)
To keep me warm, I got to feel the fire

[Outro]
Oh, oh, 'cause when you look inside my heart (When you look inside my heart)
And I tell the truth to me (And I tell the truth to me)
Loud and clear (Loud and clear) my soul cries out (Soul cries out)
With total honesty (Total honesty)
I need the fire (I need the fire), fire (I need the fire), fire (Yeah)
To keep me warm, I got to feel
To keep me warm, I got to feel
To keep me warm, I got to feel the fire
(To keep me warm, I got to feel the fire)
I got to feel the fire, hey

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
Oh, oh, silent night, holy night
All is calm, and all is bright
'Round yon virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Oh, oh, sleep in heavenly peace

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born, He's born
Christ the Savior is born

[Outro: Eddie Kendricks]
'Round yon virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Oh, sleep in heavenly peace

[Chorus]
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, low, sweet char—, sweet chariot
Oh, coming for to carry me home, oh Lord

[Verse 1]
And I know
Looked over Jordan, what did I see
They're coming for to carry me home
There was a band of angels coming after me
Oh, coming for to carry, carry me home

[Chorus]
Swing low, sweet, sweet, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry, carry me home
Swing low, sweet, sweet char—, sweet chariot
They’re coming for to carry me home, oh Lord

Tell all my friends that I'll be there, too
Coming for to carry, carry me home
Yee, hee

[Outro]
Swing low, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet chariot
Oh, coming for to carry me home

[Intro]
Tryna do this hard jam they wrote, ha ha
Right, right (One, two)

[Verse 1]
Suddenly, without a warning, my heart skipped a beat
As if for a breathless moment
All the world stood still
Suddenly, my lips could find no words to speak
Emptiness was all that my arms could feel

[Chorus]
'Cause just like child (Like a child)
With a toy enchanted, I took one (I took one)
Far too much for granted
Suddenly (Suddenly), I was all alone

[Bridge]
Never, never forget to feel the flame of love
Else that burning fire just flickers and dies
I was a fool who played a game of love
Suddenly I lost my prize possession

[Verse 2]
Maybe by some chance, I'll hear down the hall
The footsteps of my love returning to my side
Maybe fate has pity for fools after all
And gives them a second to turn the tide

[Outro]
Oh, well, be true (Be true)
I will cling to love and vow to be (Vow to be)
Always thinking of how suddenly (Suddenly)
I was all alone

[Verse 1]
I'm in bad shape since you've been gone
I lay in bed and cry the whole day long
I can feel my mind beginning to crack
Gotta find a way to get you back

[Chorus]
I don't want loneliness to be my destiny
Baby, save me from this misery
Can't sleep, full of thoughts in my head
Feel like I got rocks in my bed
I can't sleep, girl

[Verse 2]
Your lipstick stains on my shirt
Add more pain to my hurt
It affects me deeply, there's no doubt
'Cause it reminds me of a kiss I'll have to do without

[Chorus]
Girl, you gotta have pity on me
Baby, save me from this misery
Oh, I need you so bad
It's straining my heart, it's 'bout to drive me mad

[Verse 3]
Oh, I'm tired of cryin', tossin' and turnin'
These salty tears keep my eyes burning
Bеlieve me, woman, I'm in pitiful shapе
Can't take no more or my heart will surely break

[Chorus]
Your love, woman, is the only remedy
Baby, save me from this misery
Oh, I'm hurtin' so inside
I need your love, I ain't got no pride

[Outro]
(I'm in misery) Girl, I'm so lost without you
(Only you can save me, girl) I need you, need you, need you, yes, I do
(I'm in misery) Gotta find a way to stop these tears
(Only you can save me, girl) Feel like I've been crying for a thousand years
(I'm in misery) Oh, I'm lonesome as can be

[Intro]
This is my song
Oh, oh

Can I go on my way without you?
Oh, how do I know?
If I go on my way without you
Oh, where would I go?

New love to find
And though I leave another behind

So we'll say, say our last goodbye
And we'll make it this time
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Set sail with me
Oh, we're going to a paradise out beyond the sea
Say yeah if you wanna go
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Politicians come to power, take it slow
People need what you know
You're a leader so you have to play along
Show the hand, right or wrong
When you're feeling that you know the way to turn
Either way, still get burned
It's the pride that makes you feel that you belong
It's the pride that keeps you strong

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you think it's fascinating? Yeah, hey
Don't you think it's fascinating?

[Chorus]
It's the pride that you feel, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)
It's the pride that you feel, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down it's the pride)

[Verse 2]
What makes you want to do the best you can?
What makes you a better man?
What makes you try again before too long?
What keeps you standing strong?
What makes you say the things you wanna say
To make it a better day?
It's the pride that makes you feel that you belong
It's the pride that keeps you strong

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you think it's fascinating? Yeah
Don't you think it's fascinating?
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Chorus]
It's the pride that you feel, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)
It's the pride that you feel, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down it s the pride)
Oh, it's the pride that you feel, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)

[Outro]
When you finally break it down, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down it s the pride)
Whoa, it's the pride that you feel, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)
When you finally break it all down it s the pride
(When you finally break it all down it s the pride)
Oh, it's the pride that you feel, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)

[Intro]
(Got to have you back) I need you
(Got to have you back)

[Verse 1]
A jealous lie hurt my foolish pride
Made me break your heart
Now our love has died
I see a closing door - a door never more
A door of jealousy between your love and me
Now life's a storm of tears
You took the sunshine from my face
Now I'm just another man
Who walks the undestined way
Without your guiding hand
I'm a poor example of a man
Pride made a fool of me
Now I'm drowning in my misery
Misery is drowning me

[Chorus]
(Got to have you back) I need you
(Got to have you back)
(Got to have you back)
Pray night and day for heaven to see you
(Got to have you back)

[Verse 2]
Oh, cold is a lonelinеss
Dark is the emptiness
Sincе you've been gone in me
Gone is the love I need
Pride destroyed the love we knew
But not my need for you
Without your love around
My whole world is falling down
Falling down, falling down, hey

[Outro]
(Got to have you back)
Gotta, gotta get you, love
(Got to have you back)
Gotta have you back
(Got to have you back)
Girl, I need your love
(Got to have you back)
Come on back to me
And take my heart up out this misery, ah
(Got to have you back)
Gotta, gotta, gotta get your love
(Got to have you back)
Oh, got to have you back
(Got to have you back)
Gotta, gotta, gotta
(Got to have you back)
Boop, boop
(Full send, brother)

I got a stack for the waitress
I got a stack for security
And I got five for the bitch that I'mma fuck while she wearin' my jewelry

And I got a couple hundred dollars for the n**** that park my whip
And I got a lot more in my pocket, somebody better stop it
That ain't shit, that's just tips

That's just tips
That's just tips
And I got a lot more in my pocket, somebody better stop it
That ain't shit, that's just-

Pocket change, tried to tell you let that rocket bang
????
Got the strip club lookin’ like the stock exchange
You better watch your tone before that two-tone watch come and rock you homie
You are not the homie
Put a boulder on top of your molar, then drive off
Now that’s what I call a “rock n’ roller”
I am not for folding unless it’s these bills
The colder ??????
That’s a Netflix password, come chill
You ain’t never been in a Wiscansin mansion with a bitch, you ain’t lived
Let me get some understanding, you just in here dancing on broke n****s for real?

What? Ew

Well let me get it jumping (shit)
I come from the slum but I’m a Slumdog Millionaire
I’ll show you how to get it bumpin’ (shit)
You know I’m coming just as long as it ain’t in your hair

We gotta get up in something (Mmm)
Take that ass straight back cuz I ain’t bluffin’ (Mmm)
I got bread, got a pocketful of muffins (Mmm)
I gotta pay you back for your patience, but what if I said-

I got a stack for the waitress
I got a stack for security
And I got five for the bitch that I'mma fuck while she wearin' my jewelry

And I got a couple hundred dollars for the n**** that park my whip
And I got a lot more in my pocket, somebody better stop it
That ain't shit, that's just tips
That's just tips
That's just tips
And I got a lot more in my pocket, somebody better stop it
That ain't shit, that's just-

The tip of the iceberg, legit lit
My bitch whippin’ the Viper, your shit don’t hit
You in the pit with the vipers, you gon’ get bit
Cuz you a clown-ass n**** so you won’t get shit

I got a chain and another chain
Hop out the Lambo and get in another thing
I’m with the fam, oh, ain’t nobody struggling
?????

You gotta be honest, you know you feelin’ it
So get on your knees and do your due diligence, I’m killing it
Is it me or it is it a fucking ???? in this?
The Tallahassee hero on some villain shit

I can’t walk with a million (Uh-huh)
Blue-face hundreds, they cripplin’ (Uh)
I know they don’t like it I’m still gettin’ it (Huh)
Teddy Pain is officially into ????

(Ungh)
Been with the baddie like a few times
Brought her out the booty like a shoe shine
I’m ‘bout to murder this pussy, true crime
One thing ‘bout a shot, I’mma shoot mine

Pull it over, you too fine
Hit it back to back, that’s two times
Open up your mouth, I gotta pay you back for your ??? , and before I leave

I got a stack for the waitress
I got a stack for security
And I got five for the bitch that I'mma fuck while she wearin' my jewelry

And I got a couple hundred dollars for the n**** that park my whip
And I got a lot more in my pocket, somebody better stop it
That ain't shit, that's just tips

That's just tips
That's just tips
And I got a lot more in my pocket, somebody better stop it
That ain't shit, that's just-
Lyrics from Snippet

I don't know if we just crossed the line
'Cause I don't even know what just happened
Everything I said last night was lies...

[Intro]
Uh

[Verse 1]
Running through the woods, I drop my nine in the snow (Uh)
Ten feet deep, look like a pile of the blow
Had to choke a motherfucker on the side of the road (Uh)
I can feel my blood boil, man, I’m out of control (Yeah)
Wetsuit thick so I can shred when it's ice (Uh)
Then lay in bed with your wife (Uh)
And get mad head from your wife (Uh)
Then get out of bed with your wife (Ah)
'Cause I don't cut the bread with a knife (Ah)
I rip it like a man supposed to
Leather jacket, Mickey Mantel poster (True)
Rock bottom through the buffеt
Chicken wings flying every mothеrfuckin' which-a-way
Hash burning while a motherfucker’s switching lanes
My pants rip away (Uh, ha-ha)
Arm out the window, leave you crippled
Dawg, it’s been six years, I’m trying to get in contact with Pitbull
We’ve got some business to get into (Uh)
Short story long, your shit is like soft porn (Uh)
Write your name on a list and cross it off (Off)
I drag deer in the swamp (Uh)
Then I roll twenty-five times and disappear in the swamp (Whoo)
Four Rolls-Royces disappeared off the lot (Whoo)
And then four Rolls-Royces just appeared on the block (Whoo)
I had to wrestle two bears for the title shot (Uh)
Kamikaze in the plane baby, sayonara (Nyeeeaow)

[Break]
Uh, bitch, motherfucker (Psssshhhh), it’s me

[Verse 2]
It’s the final board (Uh)
Young Baklava signing off (True)
Drink fluid out your spinal cord (Uh-huh)
Come through, same Jerry Curl, that Lionel (Uh)
Me and you, it’s like a lion versus a boar (Same)
Both eyes open blasting iron through the door (Boom)
Twenty canisters of tear gas
Slide them on the floor like James Brown’s shoes (John Wick)
I had your bitch drinking man juice (Uh), high top canvas (Uh)
Straps on the black vandals (Ah)
Time for battle, paint face like John Randle (Ah)
I'm like Gama with the Gada (Whoo)
Easily triggered by old trauma (True), motherfucker
And you know I voted for Obama (Bitch), it's me

[Verse 1]
I ain't worried 'bout this
I ain't worried 'bout that
Wanna hear you say (Ayy!)
Wanna hear that hand clap
One more time
Two more times
Three more times, nevermind
I wanna hear you say (Ayy!)

[Chorus]
Hot as hell in this club, doin' whatever I want
Put my face in the sub, tell the DJ turn it up
Me and my friends, we came in hot
Now we're really really not (Ew)
But I don't care, they don't care
We don't care, no, nobody cares

[Hook]
I'm your instructor, make it sweat
(Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat)

[Verse 2]
I ain't worried 'bout this
I ain't worried 'bout that
Wanna hear you go (Oh!)
Finger snap (Uh-huh!)
One more time (One more time)
Two more times (Two more times)
Three more times, nevermind
I wanna hear you go (Oh!)

[Pre-Chorus]
We're so in the zone right now
It's like we're workin' out, we can go all night
No we ain't throwin' in the towel
Even though it's soakin' wet, wet, wet (Wet)

[Chorus]
Hot as hell in this club, doin' whatever I want
Put my face in the sub, tell the DJ turn it up
Me and my friends, we came in hot
Now we're really really not (Ew)
But I don't care, they don't care
We don't care, no, nobody cares

[Hook]
I'm your instructor, make it sweat
(Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat)
(Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat)

[Bridge]
Hot as hell in this club (Doin' whatever I want)
Put my face in the sub (Tell the DJ turn it up)
Me and my friends, we came in hot (Now we're really really not)
But we don't care (They don't care, we don't care, no, nobody cares)

[Pre-Chorus]
We're so in the zone right now
It's like we're workin' out, we can go all night
No we ain't throwin' in the towel
Even though it's soakin' wet, wet, wet (Wet)

[Chorus]
Hot as hell in this club, doin' whatever I want
Put my face in the sub, tell the DJ turn it up
Me and my friends, we came in hot
Now we're really really not (Ew)
But I don't care, they don't care
We don't care, no, nobody cares

[Hook]
I'm your instructor, make it sweat

[Verse 1]
I wanna be the girl under you (Oh, yeah)
I wanna be your G.U.Y
Yeah, I wanna be the grave and earth you (Oh, yeah)
Our sex doesn't tell us no lies (Lies, lies, lies)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna wear the tie, want the power to leave you
I'm aimin' for full control of this love (Of this love)
Touch me, touch me, don't be sweet
Love me, love me, please retweet
Let me be the girl under you that makеs you cry

[Chorus]
I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)
I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)
I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)
Thе girl under you, guy

[Verse 2]

You'll be my G.I.R.L
Guy I'm Romancin' Loves to hold you (Oh, yeah)
Know you'll wear my makeup well

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna wear the tie, want the power to leave you
I'm aimin' for full control of this love (Of this love)
Touch me, touch me, don't be sweet
Love me, love me, please retweet
Let me be the girl under you that makes you cry

[Chorus]
I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)
I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)
I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)
The girl under you, guy

[Bridge]
I don't need to be on top to know I'm worth it
'Cause I'm strong enough to know the truth
I just want it to be hot
Because I'm best when I'm in love, and I'm in love with you
Touch me, touch me, don't be sweet
Love me, love me, please retweet
Let me be the girl under you that makes you cry

[Chorus]
I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)
I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)
I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)
The girl under you, guy

[Verse 1]
I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, "Is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an IV, baby, could I bear
Being away from you? I found the vein, put it in here

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Chorus]
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make ’em touch, touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)

[Post-Chorus]
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make ’em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

[Breakdown]
Touch

[Verse 2]
I've overheard your theory, "Nostalgia's for geeks"
I guess sir, if you say so, some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture, in me

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Chorus]
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I’ll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make ’em touch, touch (Make it real loud)

[Post-Chorus]
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)

Ale-Alejandro

[Verse]
She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

[Post-Chorus]
Just let me go, Alejandro

[Verse 1]
You're my infinity
You turn my world round
The way that you look at me, babe
Only you can break up my walls down
Touch can resuscitate
Lips on my mouth now
No we're never gon fade out
No we're never gon fade out

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I know all the times that we had were broke
But, but you're still on my mind
Never wanna let go
I know I know all the times that we had were broke
Never gonna regret em

[Chorus]
You take me deeper than the ocean waves
I don't wanna hesitate
Sing me like a sweet song
No I don't wanna medicate
Take the pleasure with the pain
My love for you goes on and on
And on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on

[Verse 2]
No, I'm always gonna give that wrong love but I need you
Got wrong love, but you need me too
It's fucked up when I see you
Got one shot and I wanna let you know
That I'm never gonna let you go

[Chorus]
You take me deeper than the ocean waves
I don't wanna hesitate
Sing me like a sweet song
No I don't wanna medicate
Take the pleasure with the pain
My love for you goes on and on
And on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on

[Verse 1]
Chill out, whatcha yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be, you would see
I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talkin' to me one-on-one
But you become

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somеbody else, gets mе frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get
And you turn it into honesty
And promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

[Verse 2]
You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are and where it's at, you see
You're makin' me
Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know, you're not foolin' anyone
When you become

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get
And you turn it into honesty
And promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

[Bridge]
Chill out, whatcha yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be, you would see

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
But you look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're

[Intro]
Yeah, I'm sorry (Huh?)
What did you say?
Oh, I can't hear you
I have an ear infection and I can't figure it out (Out), yeah (I need Auto-Tune)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
It's my alter ego's fault
These evil thoughts could be so dark
Cerebral palsy, three Zolofts
I eat, doze off to "Rico Suave" (Look it up)
Cadillac with a ladder rack in the back, with a cracked axel, a backpack full of Paxil
A black satchel, a knapsack and a flask full of 'gnac and Jack Daniels
Girl, let's go back-back to my castle (Yeah)
I don't wanna hassle you, Alexandra
But my --- an acronym 'cause it stands for you (Stands for you, oh)
Wait, Alexandra who? (Damn)
All I know is Friday, I met you (What?)
Saturday, I'll probably forget you
Guess that's what the Molly and ex do (What the hell?)
'Cause who the hеll am I laying next to? (Huh)
But ever sincе D-Nice To Tha Rescue, Fila Fresh Crew (Uh)
I been a lab rat (Yeah) from a test tube (Uh)
I'm goin' in-nn like the red roof (Red Roof Inn)
You don't like it, eat a --- 'til your jaw breaks (Yeah)
Call it caught between a rock and a hard place
Like a sasquatch in a crawlspace
'Cause you're watchin' your heart race like you're Scarface
In a car chase with the cops or an arcade
Stuck inside of a Mario Kart race duckin' saw blades
At a stop and a start pace
What I'm tryin' to say is I'm the mall crazy

[Chorus]
I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone-deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone-deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone-deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I see the rap game, then attack the verses (Uh)
Turn into a graveyard packed with hearses (Yeah)
Just like your funeral, I'm at your service (What?)
Pockets 'on stuff' like a taxidermist (Woo)
Just landed in Los Angeles when this chick Angela and her grandmother in a tan
Colored van pull up with a handful of Xans
And a substantial amount of gan' just to ask what my
(Plans) plans for the night are (Yeah)
I said, "Sneak into the Sleep Inn for the weekend and pretend it's a five-star," yeah
Or leap into the deep end of the pool
I can show you where the dives are (Get it?), ha
We don't even gotta drive far
I know this spot that is so live
But I'm tryna get some --- first (What?), like a nosedive (Haha)
So many side chicks, can't decide which to slide with and which should I ditch
So when it comes to ---, you bet, I get behind like the Heimlich (Get behind, yeah)
Had one chick who liked to flip sometimes on some switchin' sides stuff
Pushed her out the Sidekick, then I flipped the lil' white trick off like a light switch (Trick)
It's okay not to like my spit
Everything's fine, drink your wine, trick
And get offline, quit whinin', this is just a rhyme, trick (Rhyme, trick)
But ask me, will I stick to my guns (Guns) like adhesive tape? (Adhesive tape)
Does Bill Cosby sedate once he treats to cheesecake and a decent steak? (Huh?)
You think gettin' rid of me's a piece of cake?
I'm harder than findin' Harvey Weinstein a date (Damn)
And that's why they say I got more lines than Black Friday
So save that ssssh-- for the damn library (Shh)
You heard of Kris Kristofferson? (Yeah)
Well, I am Piss Pissedofferson (Oh)
Paul's askin' for Christmas off again
I said, "No," then I spit this song for him
It goes

[Chorus]
I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone-deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone-deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone-deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Betcha' I can make "orange" rhyme with "banana" (Yeah)
Bornana
Eating pork rinds, sword fightin' in pajamas
At the crib, playin' Fortnite with your grandma
But I'm more like a four-five with the grammar
'Bout to show you why your five favorite rappers can't touch this
But before I get the hammer
I should warn you, I'm Thor-like in this manner (Thor)
But the day I lose sleep over you critiquin' me or
I ever let you ---suckers eat at me
I'd need to be a --- pizzeria
But you ain't gettin' no cheese from me
I went from Little Caesars, BLTses, grilled cheeses
Bein' dirt poor to filthy rich, I'm still me, trick
Like a realtor, that's real tea (Realty), trick (Real talk)
Aftermath, trick, whole camp's lit
We put out fire, Dre stamps it
With my cohorts, hit a bogart
Yeah, got your whole squad yellin', "Oh, God"
Here comes Barshall with no holds barred
Trick, I'm a hurricane, you're a blowhard
Like your old broad, she full of --- (Sea men), like the coast guard
And life's been pretty good to me so far (Yeah), for the most part
Had a couple of run-ins with po-po, caught
A couple assault charges, got a few priors (Priers) like crowbars (Priors)
Which is so odd 'cause I'm forty-eight now
That 5-0's startin' to creep up on me like a patrol car (Woo)
I'll be an old fart, but you don't want no part, so, trick, don't start (Don't start)
Simmer down, compose yourself, Mozart
I ain't went nowhere, call me coleslaw
'Cause I'm out for the cabbage and I'm so raw
And if time is money, you have no clocks
And any folk caught within close proximity's gettin' cold-cocked
My enemies, I'm a chimney, give me the smoke, opps
And R.I.P. to King Von, and it don't stop, and I know not
What the --- you say? I told y'all, it ain't me, it's my alter ego's fault
But if y'all wanna cancel me, no prob
I'll tell you the same thing I told Paul (Woo)

[Chorus]
I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone-deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone-deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone-deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (I'm tone-deaf)
Lyrics from snippet

Because you're crazy for me
And I'm the best that you ever had

It's kinda funny
Said it was raining, but the sun is out
You said you love me, you're with her now
No, I don't need you to explain
I'm just saying that it's strange
Lyrics from Snippet

[Kanye West]
I can, I can, I can
...

Manager, you look like you need a manager
Someone that can handle 'ya
...

Daylight, daylight
Daylight, daylight
...

Oh, baby
...

I feel your pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain...

[Verse 1]
Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That be known let me know
Let me

[Verse 2]
Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination, but I'm just not there
All the street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination, but I'm just not there

[Chorus]
In the streets
In the streets
I'm just not there in the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair

[Verse 3]
Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination, but I'm just not there
All the street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination, but I'm just not there
All the street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination, but I'm just not there

[Chorus]
In the streets
In the streets
I'm just not there in the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair
Life's just not fair

[Chorus]
Uh, thinking 'bout times, huggin' and fuckin' you
When I'm laid up alone and it's nothin' to do
Got a lot on my mind, got a lot to prove
Tryna balance, keep you a priority too
But every day I'm wakin' up, and it's bad news
When you in love, gotta be thinkin' for two
I know I'm selfish at times but I be needin' to
Be what I wanna be, I want everything
And you just what I need, and it's medicine
But I need to fuck up to get better again
Fast life, might crash, how I'm pedallin'
Tryna retrace steps, can't go back again
Another tattoo of you covered on my skin
In relationships, man, I'm like on ten
But I feel like my next one a big win

[Verse]
Gotta manifest, gotta be best friends
Gotta be movin' P, gotta tap in
Gotta takе you overseas, gotta trust me
But it's things in my lifе I don't want you in
And I know that's a problem, gotta fix it
But I'm still young and I got a hitlist
I be in deep thought, I be vibin'
I be talkin' to myself like, "Why me?"
Baby, you deserve better and I'm not him
But I know when we happy, we be locked in
And it's some shit I just can't comprehend
Maybe I deserve better and you not her
Wish I could reverse time and say I had you first
I was late, I ain't partyin', I'm puttin' work
God gave me purpose, put me on the Earth
I be readin' all the signs, put me on alert
I be in Palm Springs lookin' at the stars
And I never thought that I'd get this far
'Bout to be a couple hits then they write me off
But I keep reinventin', that's real talk
Reflectin' life in real time (Real time)
Got me missin' you when it's bedtime
Can I be with one soul for a lifetime? (Lifetime)
Maybe in another lifetime (Lifetime)

[Chorus]
Thinking 'bout times, huggin' and fuckin' you
When I'm laid up alone and it's nothin' to do
Got a lot on my mind, got a lot to prove
Tryna balance, keep you a priority too
But every day I'm wakin' up, and it's bad news
When you in love, gotta be thinkin' for two
I know I'm selfish at times but I be needin' to
Be what I wanna be, I want everything
And you just what I need, and it's medicine
But I need to fuck up to get better again
Fast life, might crash, how I'm pedallin'
Tryna retrace steps, can't go back again
Another tattoo of you covered on my skin
In relationships, man, I'm like on ten
But I feel like my next one a big win (Big win)
My next one a big win (Big win)

[Outro]
Thinking 'bout times, huggin' and fuckin' you (Huggin' and fuckin' you, huggin' and fuckin' you, huggin' and fuckin' you)
Love will make you do crazy things
Reflectin' life in real time (Real time)
Can I be with one soul for a lifetime? (For a lifetime)
