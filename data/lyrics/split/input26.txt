 I get over you, over you
When you're all over me?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Why do we stay
When only fools would?
I guess we’re both fools
'Cause the sex is good, it's way too good, yeah
Call us crazy, misunderstood
'Cause I can’t leave you
And I know I should
People say I should, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
But one touch always makes me
Too hard to escape
Three strikes, I’m still yours
What am I waiting for?

[Chorus]
I’m running out of room
Or your tattoos
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me?
So don’t tell me it’s cool (cool)
That I’m tattooed (tattooed)
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me?
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Permanently trying to hide, the scars we can’t remove
You’re drawn on me and I’m still drawn to you

[Chorus]
I’m running out of room (running)
For your tattoos
How can I get over you, over you (how can I get over you, over you?)
When you're all over me?
So don’t tell me it’s cool (so don't you tell me, cool)
That I’m tattooed (tattooed)
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Walking the dog in my neighborhood
Said I never would, for you for you
I got drunk on a Monday night
Hope it looks alright, tattoo of you, oo
I'm a yes man on the loose, yeah
Maxed out all my credit cards
Bought your favorite car, times two

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm crazy for you, Lord knows what I'd do
I'd even die for you
Whatever you need, I'm down on my knees
I guess that means, I guess that means

[Chorus]
I’m dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
I’m stupid in love
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Stupid
I’m stupid in love
Stupid

[Verse 2]
Uh. re-decorate my crib
Can't believe I did, it's true, it's true
I'm ashamed but I said okay
To share a Facebook page with you, with you
'Cause I'm a yes man on the loose, ooh, yeah
And I'll do anything for you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm crazy for you, Lord knows what I'd do
I'd even die for you
Whatever you need, I'm down on my knees
I guess that means, I guess that means (means I'm dumb)

[Chorus]
I’m dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
I’m stupid in love, yeah, yeah
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Stupid
I’m stupid in love, yeah, yeah, yeah
Stupid (yeah)

[Bridge]
And they can all call me crazy (crazy)
I'm a fool for you, baby (baby)
But they ain't never seen you naked, naked
Uh, they can all call me crazy (crazy)
I'm a fool for you, baby (baby)
But they ain't never seen you naked, no, oh, naked

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm crazy for you, Lord knows what I'd do
I'd even die for you (I'd die for you, baby)
Whatever you need, I'm down on my knees
I guess that means, I guess that means (means I'm dumb)

[Chorus]
I’m dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb (woah)
Dumb da da dee da dumb
I’m stupid in love, ooh, yeah
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb

What’s your suggestion for the night
Should I turn off or maybe leave on the light?
Maybe leave on the light? Maybe leave on the light?
Uh, electric lady
What’s your suggestion for the night
Should I turn off or maybe leave on the light?
Maybe leave on the light? Maybe leave on the light?
Uh, electric lady (Hey, hey)

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Oh my, you’re skipping my heart
Kiss in the dark with your lightning eyes
Said I want you igniting fires all night
And you got the power
You’re damn right it’s life or death
Not gonna make it if we don’t connect tonight right

[Pre-Hook: Justin Timberlake]
Strike twice all night
Body moves like waves
You’re reaching my heart fast
You’re searching for something
That’s just how electricity behaves
And I been needing it so bad
The other ones don’t last

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
Wait a minute, I feel a charge
I should’ve known as you glow in the dark
You turn it on and I touch you till it sparks
Electric lady, ooh
Wait a minute until it drops
I feel it jump, we get closer to a shock
You turn it on and I touch you till it sparks
Electric lady

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
Love won’t die (running low)
But girl, your love won’t die
So what you’re giving me girl, all that energy, give it here
You know how it goes sometimes
Love won’t die (running low)
But girl, your love won’t die
But if you need any, girl, I got energy, come and get it
You know how it goes sometimes

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Sometimes I need a little (more)
Give a little, if I get a little
We could meet any place
How about the middle, tonight?
And you got the power
Baby you know if you’re ever low
I will go low and bring you back into the light

[Pre-Hook: Justin Timberlake]
Strike twice all night
Body moves like waves
You’re reaching my heart fast
You’re searching for something
That’s just how electricity behaves
And I’ve been needing it so bad
The others don’t last

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
Wait a minute, I feel a charge
I should’ve known as you glow in the dark
You turn it on and I touch you till it sparks
Electric lady, ooh
Wait a minute until it drops
I feel it jump, we get closer to a shock
You turn it on and I touch you till it sparks
Electric lady

[Breakdown: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
What’s your suggestion for the night
Should I turn off or maybe leave on the light?
Maybe leave on the light? Maybe leave on the light?
Uh, electric lady
What’s your suggestion for the night
Should I turn off or maybe— (Maybe, maybe)
Maybe leave on the light? Maybe leave on the light?
Uh, electric lady (Hey, hey)

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
Wait a minute, I feel a charge
I should’ve known as you glow in the dark
You turn it on and I touch you till it sparks
Electric lady, ooh

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
Love won’t die (running low)
But girl, your love won’t die
So what you’re giving me girl, all that energy, give it here
You know how it goes sometimes
Love won’t die (running low)
But girl, your love won’t die
But if you need any, girl, I got energy, come and get it
You know how it goes sometimes

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
So get it understood, boy
I am from the hood, boy
Came up from the dirt
Self-made hustler, I'm a beast
I'm a beast

[Verse 1]
I'm surrounded by all these deviled mouths, they talking about Kellz
Some say I came from heaven but I rose up from hell
And ever since I rose up, success has been my cell
So call the hits my lawyer 'cause they got me out on bail
Never been a snitch boy
Never been a bitch boy
Why I gotta hate on you? Look at me, I'm rich, boy
You need a steering wheel the way you ridin' my dick, boy
Say you's a go getter, go get your own shit, boy
What it's gon' take for you muthafuckas to understand I'm a R&B boss?
(Kellz think he a rapper) Naw, bitch, I'm just tryna get my point across
Niggas hatin' on niggas, man, y'all know y'all keep up shit
Thats why when it come to these hits, I'm gon' keep up shit
Keep rising to the top, keep gettin' that money
Keep laughing at you clown, 'cause you clowns is funny
I've been grindin' for 17 years, tryna keep the peace
Well now, you muthafuckas done brought out the beast

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
So get it understood, boy
I am from the hood, boy
Came up from the dirt
Self-made hustler, I'm a beast
I'm a beast

[Verse 2]
When I was young all my dreams seemed so far
Coming up was so hard
Now I'm a rock star, 'cause all I do is rock bars
I stays on fire, just look at the hot cars
You need a hit from Kellz? Alright, my nigga, no prob
I'm clean but I'm dirt
I'm good but I'm the worst
I'm last and I'm first
I'm blessed and I'm cursed
But my career is soaring while my life is a hot mess
But the depth of my struggle determines the height of my success
I believe that
Whatever billion dollars, tryna see that
Whatever billion, I'ma be still askin', "Where the weed at?"
Hit lots of clubs, take lots of shots of Patrón
Hold my middle finger up, tell haters to get the fuck on
Stay shinin', boy
Stay grimey, boy
Keep these fine ass bitches straight eyein' me, boy
Now where you gon' hear a better name?
I'm 17 years in the game
Still continuing to make it rain, to put these fools to shame
I'm a beast

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
So get it understood, boy
I am from the hood, boy
Came up from the dirt
Self-made hustler, I'm a beast
I'm a beast
So get it understood, boy
I am from the hood, boy
Came up from the dirt
Self-made hustler, I'm a beast
Wait a minute, wait a minute, where you going?
You ain't going no motherfuckin' where
I'm a beast
I got more to say, bitch
Look at me

[Verse 3]
Y'all smile in my face and talk shit in back of me
I got the ball, I'm tryna shoot, but y'all niggas keep hackin' me
Could it be that I'm a king 'cause R&B been good to me
Or could it be that you's a lame that hate the game and can't beat me?
I used to rep the CHI, but now I know my worth
I still rep the CHI, but Earth is my turf, nigga!
I been around the world
Flown bitches 'round the world
Heard rumors 'round the world
Still I'm touring 'round the world
Talk about me on your records to make your sales better
Play it backwards, it'll probably say (Kellz is the coldest ever)
So don't think this is a song, it's a taste of my wrath
Bet 'til your nervous, nigga, I got a dick and a half
I'm a beast

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
So get it understood, boy
I am from the hood, boy
Came up from the dirt
Self-made hustler, I'm a beast
I'm a beast
So get it understood, boy
I am from the hood, boy
Came up from the dirt
Self-made hustler, I'm a beast
I'm a beast

[Outro]
Ha ha, niggas, got your ass
I would call out some muthafuckin' names
But it's so many of you muthafuckas hatin'
Song ain't muthafuckin' long enough, bitch ass niggas
Fade that shit
Maybe on the remix, nigga, I'll call your name out
You gotta stay tuned for that shit
I'm tryin' to sell records, bitch, I'm a business man
Dear Dad –

Well...Although I lost the address, I feel I must write before I get too far away – We're in Munich, Germany now – We just left Paris and Nancy France – We're playing around london now. That's where I'm staying these days. I have my own group and will have a record out about 2 months named "Hey Joe" By the Jimi Hendrix EXPERIENCE

I hope you get this card – I'll write a decent letter – I think things are getting a little Better –

Your loving son

Jimi

Thank u again 4 writing me.

Until I hear from u,

Prince
Dear Pat

Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you. I recieved your letter in NY but I had to leave for Mich, which is where I am right now. I have thought long and hard about what I want to do with our songs, my record, the sound, the vibe etc. I had always intended to do a portion of the record with Nellie Hooper because I like the sound of all of his records and I think he has really good instincts. Then I thought about doing the rest of the record with you not really thinking what the divide would be. This is where my head was at when I left Miami. Then I started thinking about how I didn't want a record that sounds like two different producers worked on it. I allready had that nightmare experience. Then i started leaning towards Nellie doing the whole thing because he's not a song writer and I thought he would treat all songs fairly without favortism and ego involved. I sent all my demos to Nellie to listen to and while he gave it up to a few he made some disturbing remarks about how he was going to have to change the music so much he would want a writers credit. Which of course made me sick. EGO-EGO-EGO!!!! When I was in NY I had to meet with William Orbit which has you know we're trying to do a deal with and he played me more tracks that blew my mind and I mentioned that I would like to write with him and he said he had studio time and why not tomorrow? To make a long story short we ended up doing several tracks together that I absolutely adore and more importantly I love his sound. Suddenly i felt like he knew what direction I wanted to go musically (sonically). I haven't formally asked him to produce my album but I'm going to and I wanted you to know first. I know he will be gobsmacked and humble and eager to please which is not to say that you aren't but I really feel strongly about taking a new direction and William's sound is a complete departure. After making so many records it's what I need to get my blood boiling. I hope you will not be insulted or take offense by this decision. I loved working with you again. You're a brilliant musician/songwriter and I have the utmost respect for you. On top of all that I adore you. You did say you were cool with any decision I made. Obviously if we use any of your programs you will be compensated. I may use a rough vocal or two and I haven't decided if I will use all the songs we wrote. I will keep you posted on everything. I will probably be working all of July and August and September. In any case these are my thoughts for now. I'll be in LA on Monday if you want to write or call

Take care

Love

Madonna

[Intro: DJ Drama]
Studies say humans forget 90% of their dream
Upon the first 10 minutes of waking
Cardo on the beat
They say most people don't even remember
99% of the dreams they ever even had
Cardo on the beat
As dream chasers we're the exception

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Hundred grand large on the watch, blessed
Quarter mil for the Mulsanne, flex
All my niggas gon' cash checks
And all y'all niggas look mad stressed
And we ain't even made niggas mad yet
Cause next time I grab, I'm a grab jet
I might go Bugatti, with a bad bitch beside me
Nigga hotter than Wasabi, get that ass wet
Young niggas going hard in the streets
We ain't ever know to call the police
Got birds for the twenty five K
Sounds like a bargain to me
Young niggas getting money
In the Bent, leather looking like spalding to me
And I don't know what no line look like
Hundred bad bitches gettin' all in with me
Get 'em all in for free
Started, started with a quarter ounce of hard rock
And now I got a lot of cars
If a nigga talk the foreigns, got a car lot
And everybody talkin' money
But they ain't showing numbers like the call block
And all I do is count money
Fuck pretty ass hoes, and car shop

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Yeah nigga I'm leanin', leanin'
Young rich nigga, I'm leanin'
Puffin' on strong, getting gold, bad bitches
Looking like Nia Long I mean it
Nigga I'm leanin', leanin'
Young rich nigga, I'm leanin'
Sippin' on promethazine that nigga
My team got money all season
Nigga I'm leanin'

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Mmm, leanin' -- damn near spilled my semen (straight up)
Had a twenty-twenty on my preacher wife
Damn near see my demons (La Flame!)
Loose furs, hyenas
For the love of money and Selena
Vatos losing their nerves, bird niggas on the curbs
And let 'em pull up and do the Macarena (skrt)
H-town nigga spilled Peach Crush on my jeans (nope)
Never go far with no bitch with no condoms
Unless they can cover the lease on my Beamer (straight up)
Ahh, you know, Louboutins don't touch my hoes (La Flame)
Let's go down in Ibiza town
We get cold, you don't need no coat
Motherfucker, I'm leanin' (dope)
Don't talk to me, couple street niggas
Think twice before crossing me (oh no)
Meek, these niggas shit can't last that long
Why these motherfuckers keep bothering me (straight up)
I'm leanin', for a minute you had me
Then the second I caught it when it passed me
Oh no (straight up)
Somebody pass me a blunt and a double world cup
Motherfucker, motherfucker...

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Yeah nigga I'm leanin', leanin'
Young rich nigga, I'm leanin'
Puffin' on strong, getting gold, bad bitches
Looking like Nia Long I mean it
Nigga I'm leanin', leanin'
Young rich nigga, I'm leanin'
Sippin' on promethazine that nigga
My team got money all season
Nigga I'm leanin'

[Outro: Birdman & Meek Mill]
Yeah, straight levels to this life nigga
Parlay or nothin'
See we started trap before we was rap
And then we was, trappin' at rap
Shining on these hoes, high life
This what we live now
Blowin' out the pop
Italian on the floor nigga
You understand me
Stepping onto a mil' nigga
They say money rule the world, you can't pay God with it
Step your game up nigga
Or lose your bitch nigga
It's just that simple

[Outro 2: Diddy]
Yeah, we dreamchasers
We out there gettin' this money
So you can't fuck with everybody
'Cause everybody ain't at you motherfucking level
So the motherfuckers that don't understand you
They wind up motherfucking hating you
So you know what you gotta do
You gotta hate them motherfuckers too
Fuck them niggas
Fuck they motherfucking mommas
They daddies, they aunts, they uncles
And they little tee tees, too
Ayo, suck a dick
Meek Mill, let's get it

[Verse 1]
You're beautiful
You brighten up my day
And when your skin touches mine
I get goosebumps right away

[Hook]
But you don't even know
Don't even know, know
I said you don't even know
Don't even know, know (said you don't even know)

[Verse 2]
As usual
I long your embrace
I'm a fiend for your attention
Yes I am baby

[Hook]
But you don't even know
Don't even know, know
I said you don't even know
Don't even know, know (said you don't even know)
You have no idea (said you don't even know)
You have no idea (said you don't even know)

But you don't even know
Don't even know, know
I said you don't even know
Don't even know, know (said you don't even know)

[Verse 3: Tay Walker]
If you only knew
How I look at you
You'd call me crazy
But maybe it's you who
Who hasn't a clue

[Hook]
And you should already know
Already know, already know
Said you should
Already know
Already know, already know

[Verse 4]
You're the reason
I'm singing this song
When I say that
You're the beat in my heart, baby

[Hook]
And you should already know
Already know, already know
Said you should
Already know
Already know, already know

You have no idea (said you don't even know)
You have no idea (said you don't even know)

But you don't even know
Don't even know, know
I said you don't even know
Don't even know, know (said you don't even know)

[Bridge: Tay Walker]
You don't even know
You have no idea
You don't even know
You have no idea
(Repeat)

[Outro]
You don't even know
You don't even know
You don't even know
You don't even know, know,know
You don't even know, know,know
You don't even know, know,know
Yeah
You don't even know
You don't even know

[Verse 1]
I miss your brain, the way you think
But I don't miss the way you used to drink
I miss our talks, the universal law
You had a way of seeing through my flaws
It's so confusing, I thought I met my match
An intellectual with talent, what a catch
You always said we'd be better off as friends
It was inevitable that it would end

[Pre-Chorus]
Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forevermore

[Chorus]
Still I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

[Verse 2]
I miss the countryside where we used to lay
The smell of roses on a lovely summer day
You made me laugh, you had a clever wit
I miss the good times, I don't miss all of it
You wrote me poetry, you had a way with words
You said you wanted more than just a pretty girl
Maybe I challenged you a little bit too much
We couldn't have two drivers on the clutch

[Pre-Chorus]
Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forevermore

[Chorus]
Still I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend
Yet I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

[Bridge]
It's so sad that it had to end
I lost my very best friend
Not gonna candy coat it
And I don't want to pretend
I put away your letters
Saved the best ones that I had
It wasn't always perfect
But it wasn't always bad

[Chorus]
Still I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend
Yet I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I will not lie and I can't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

[Outro]
It's so sad that it had to end

Say hello to the man who could save hip hop
Say hello to the man who could save hip hop
Say hello to the man who could save hip hop

[Verse 1]
They say the game fucked up
And the records ain't sellin
It was bad in 06' gettin worse in 07'
Market over saturated with all the bootleggin
When it seems better shawty ain't no tellin'
Well, call Lyor, give him this message
Then hit K'ys tell hiim, tell Kevin
Craig, Julie Greenwald, all of them present
The fifty mill you gave me
Was a sound investment
This time around we gon sell 5
No less than 4 on a slow day
Call vegas and bet
By the way, if you a winner
I'm the one you should be with Hit J
Tell them niggas to bet against
Grand Hustle homie
I'm a make you respect this
They say "the market share down"
So... I ain't affected
Tell the label relax
Ain't no need to stress shit
Just cut the check a
Nd I'll handle the rest...shhiit

[Hook]
They say the game in trouble
Help on the way
Don't worry bout nothin
Help on the way
They say the game in trouble

[Verse 2]
You hear my name so hot, I got the game on lock
You niggas keep floppin, But i remain on top
Still the same ol' me, With the same ol' Glock
From the first cd, With the Kangol top
I was hollerin dopeboy when I first came out
It seems like everyone in the dope game now man
I told these niggas that it ain't gon stop
All the hatin' gon' stop or this thang gon' blah
Most of these niggas ,ain't slang ,no blocks
Got a lil' somethin', but it ain't so hot
Try to sell a record when my shit drop
Get the cover of the magazine
When my shit out nope
I think not just why
If you ever eye with a nigga this fly
You better watch your mouth
You ain't that high
KING OF THE SOUTH, you ain't that guy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
To the fans and the critics
Think hip hop is missing
This is a lil' proof that hip hop livin'
You can hear a hip hop top now, just listen
Now see a hip hop walk out with 6 bitches
In the ATL, see hip hop chillin'
In a multimillion dollar crib hip hop building
You know how many cars hip hops driven?
Nigga I'm everything hip hop's missing
Nigga you is everything hip hop isn't
My heart and my soul, where hip hop live at
To anyone whos ever said hip hops finished
It can't be dead while I'm still livin in it
I'm livin (and well, might I add that)

[Hook]
Part I

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Okay, these niggas wanna be sleep
It's nine in the morning
I ain't been asleep yet
I though sleep was for billionaires
I think I'm the last of the street niggas left
Uh...

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
When it come to stuntin', I'm like money man Meech
Brought my city with me and we coming in the fleet
And now I'm getting richer and they don't want me in the streets
I'm thinking fuck a album sales, we sold a hundred bricks this week
Thousand grams of crack, take it to the table
Bag it all up, take it to the label and tell 'em distribute it
I'm getting cake ridiculous
'Rari like a frog, jumping through the traffic, ribbitin'
And they tellin' me to turn down, they say that I need Ritalin
Ballin' like I'm Jordan, no assists from Scottie Pippen
In an' out the flows, crossing over like I'm dribbling
Running laps round them rappers, tired like Michelin
Started off with Tip and 'em but that wasn't it for him
Yellow, gold Cuban, diamonds blue like Michigan
Been taught you niggas
That there's levels and there's differences
To this lifestyle, the way a real nigga livin' it
I'm gettin' it, nigga put yourself in my predicament
If you was gettin' all of this fucking money
You won't spend this shit
I be at the dealership, pointing out and picking shit
Just to shake the town up, talking off the Richtor shit
Take 'em to the Clear Port, no Instagram, picture it
Niggas taking pictures for the Instagram, you in the shit
On the jet, fifty for the flight to go to LIV and shit
Spend another thirty on the champ
And never sipped the shit
One million, two million, three million, four
I can have a million dollars knocking at my door
Ridin' in the passenger, like 2Pac Shakur
Only thing that's different is this new Glock that roar
Get a rush from the paper, rush from the money
If money talk it's like you said hush to your money
These broke niggas say I talk too much about the money
That's what we do it for the love of the money
Nigga...
Part II

[Intro: Allen Iverson]
We're sitting here, I'm supposed to be the franchise player
And we're in here talking about practice
Not the game that I go out there and die for
And play every game like it's my last
Not the game
We talking about practice man
I mean how silly is that?
We talking about practice
What are we talkin' about?
Practice? We talking about practice man
We talking about practice
We talking about practice
We ain't talking 'bout the game
We talking about practice, man

[Verse: Meek Mill]
Killed my nigga snupe
I'm going hammer on these niggas
Ridin' through my city
With my finger on the trigger...
Woke up this morning
After another one of those crazy dreams
Oh, nothing is going right this morning
The whole world is wrong it seems
Oh, I guess it's the chain that binds me
I can't shake it loose, these chains and things

Got to work this morning
Seems like everything is lost
I got a gold-hearted, wrong-doing woman
And a slave-driving ball
I can't loosen these chains that bind me
Can't shake them loose, these chains and things
Just can't loosen these chains and things

Well, you talk about hard luck and trouble
Seems to be my middle name
All the odds are against me
Yes, I can only play a losing game
These chains that bind me
Can't loosen these chains and things
Just can't loosen these chains and things
Oh I would pack up and leave today, people
But I ain't got nowhere to go
Ain't got money to buy a ticket
And I don't feel like walking anymore
These chains that bind me
I can't lose, I can't lose these chains and things

[Intro: Meek Mill]
The world is yours and everything in it
You gonna go get it?

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Mama couldn't save me, daddy dead so he couldn't raise me
I'm still tripping off them hoes that played me
Same bitches fronting on me when I had my baby
It's crazy, and niggas say they made me
Taking credit from my mama, shit amaze me
How niggas talking down when I'm not around
But every time I'm in the building, shhh, not a sound
I line my haters up and clap them down
That choppa have nigga dancing like he Bobby Brown
I'm well-respected in my city, even out of town
And don't ever tuck my chain
Nigga, how that sound? How that look?
We don't live by the book, we just live by the code
A lot of niggas got exposed when feds came through
They was dropping names too
Niggas say I changed up but I'm with the same crew
I was always told to get the money and remain you
Never let these pussy niggas tell you what you can't do
Every time they said that I left, that was when I came through
Range new, .38 special when the flame blue
Just in case I gotta flame you
What a feeling when them people tryna frame you
Lock you in a cell when detain you
Rather die before I go out working like I'm Django
I'm gone...

[Chorus: French Montana]
Niggas want me dead, everyday that I wake up
Fuck you talking ‘bout, you ain’t talking paper
And here's another one, here's another one
Streets watching
A new bitch, a new car
Her ass soft, I go hard
And here's another one, here's another one
Streets watching

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
If I fuck her, I'm brainless
She fuck me, she might get famous
She might get a chance to ride jet and drive Ranges
Money'll have your closest friends turning into strangers
That's dangerous, niggas shoot and they'll aim at us
Shooting in the sky, you tryna hit the angels up
Niggas tripping like y'all dipping off angel dust
And all these Cubans 'round my neck getting tangled up
I only fuck with bad bitches that be trained to fuck
Five niggas, ten bitches run a train on us
Looking at these rap niggas they all lame as fuck
Mini skirts, skinny jeans with the strangest cuts
I stick to the script, switch like stick on the shift
Early mornings in the kitchen like I'm whippin' the grits
Nigga, I could score your bitch with a flick of the wrist
Swear that Audemar flashlight like I'm flicking a pic

[Chorus: French Montana]
Niggas want me dead, everyday that I wake up
Fuck you talking ‘bout, you ain’t talking paper
And here's another one, here's another one
Streets watching
A new bitch, a new car
Her ass soft, I go hard
And here's another one, here's another one
Streets watching

[Intro: DJ Drama]
Alright lets be clear
They might of done a thing or two
But there track record in the streets is "Ain't Like Me"
They ain't me

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me
Got a couple main hoes that I'm fucking round with
But this one bad bitch you can't see
And all my niggas get straight to the money, these stones all clear HD
And my DC chain shine bright, shine bright with my gold AP
Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me
Got a couple real niggas that I'm fucking round with
Can't come round a nigga ain't see
And them bricks still sell them for the high
My nigga in the drop top birds ain't cheap
These niggas still sell the work
Tell 'em work ain't that easy

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me
These pussy ass niggas can't come to my hood
Cause you pussy ass niggas ain't me
I got all these shooters that's down for the cause
And they all get money like me
And, and I still ride around my hood
Quarter milli on a nigga white tee
And yall niggas still hating on it, still hating on it
Talking what they gonna do to me
But I'm strapped up & I'm waiting on it
These niggas ain't built like that
These niggas get killed like that
Running 'round my name in their mouth
Banana clips get peeled like that
And they wonder why I feel like that
Cause every other month, I make a mill like that
Took my whole family up out that hood
Set 'em all nice in the hills like that, shit real like that
You ain't gotta like my shit, paid for the flow, I don't write my shit
Better pray to God I don't like your bitch
Cause if she catch eye then she might get hit! Woah!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me
Got a couple main hoes that I'm fucking round with
But this one bad bitch you can't see
And all my niggas get straight to the money, these stones all clear HD
And my DC chain shine bright, shine bright with my gold AP
Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me
Got a couple real niggas that I'm fucking round with
Can't come round a nigga ain't see
And them bricks still sell them for the high
My nigga in the drop top birds ain't cheap
These niggas still sell the work
Tell 'em work ain't that easy

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I'm a real ass nigga and I've been like that
Day one and I ain't gone change
In the hood nigga act a little different when I come through
Cause a nigga got a little change
Little pussy ass nigga don't test no nigga
Cause if he do then its gone be flames
That 40 gone go bang bang
Them niggas might say my name
My young niggas got rollies on
Bitches got them Birkins on
My trigger finger been itchin'
My patients short, but my money long
Its levels to this shit for real
Boy I'm dream chasing tryna see a hundred M's
Got the plug on deck if I wanna go back
Put work in the trap what you know about that
Pillow talking to ya ho hating on a nigga
Fuck around lose ya ho like that
Ain't me, ain't me, these rapping ass niggas, ain't me
Only fuck with real niggas like Meek (What up meek?)
You ain't CMG or DC

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me
Got a couple main hoes that I'm fucking round with
But this one bad bitch you can't see
And all my niggas get straight to the money, these stones all clear HD
And my DC chain shine bright, shine bright with my gold AP
Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me
Got a couple real niggas that I'm fucking round with
Can't come round a nigga ain't see
And them bricks still sell them for the high
My nigga in the drop top birds ain't cheap
These niggas still sell the work
Tell 'em work ain't that easy

[Verse 3: Omelly]
Ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me
Gettin' money my day ones you know we reppin' DC
Cousin dropped that bag on you, I kill you niggas for free
I got all this money on me, I got all these hundreds on me ho
Backin' up in this Panamera with some rich ass hoes
Started off with a quarter ounce, had to get that dough
Flip them, move circles on them like Tic Tac Toe
Hoes ready they fucking sucking on the get set go

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me
Got a couple main hoes that I'm fucking round with
But this one bad bitch you can't see
And all my niggas get straight to the money, these stones all clear HD
And my DC chain shine bright, shine bright with my gold AP
Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me
Got a couple real niggas that I'm fucking round with
Can't come round a nigga ain't see
And them bricks still sell them for the high
My nigga in the drop top birds ain't cheap
These niggas still sell the work
Tell 'em work ain't that easy

[Outro: DJ Drama]
I guess we can't tell you enough
What you do won't make you me
Truthfully some of you niggas need to get some sleep
Your dreams aren't manifesting correctly

[Intro: TakBar and DJ Drama]
Yeah, it's DC nigga
You see what we doing in these fucking streets
Pushing the flyest whips, fucking the baddest chicks
Big guns with 30 shot clips, motherfuckers can't see us
All gold AP's, these niggas wearing G-Shocks
We sending G4 pilots to the Wing Stop
Going where they said we wouldn't and doing what they said we couldn't
We come from nothing nigga, let's get this fucking money
I got my money right, call me Rich Homie Dram

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I'm sipping on patrón nigga
My bitch bad to the bone nigga
She fucked up, I'm fucked up
She like how we gon' get home nigga
I can't smoke that strong nigga
Swear that's word to my PO
That lil chick to expensive for you
I'll take her back like repo
Say, shorty want a pair of red bottoms
Fucked her good then I went and got 'em
Percs got me fucking for a hour
Got a boyfriend, forget about him
I got young niggas that'll get it popping
And all my niggas get a dollar
Started of with an impala
Now all my whips a hundred thousand
Hold up, Now throw your rollies up in the air
And wave that shit to the side nigga
Bad bitches just popping pussy, you dead broke just die nigga
On private jets, we fly nigga
Sipping lean, we high nigga
Stand tall, feet five nigga
They riding for ya, they die with ya
Say foreign whips my fucking problem
Got a couple, don't fucking drive them
My homies whip them like fucking molly
Mo' money mo' fucking problems
A Wraith coming, I take that
I'm everywhere that that cake at
Them hoes stunted, this the payback
I'm in a Rolls Royce screaming out Maybach

[Chorus: Future]
Money ain't no issue

Lean inside my cup I beat that pussy till she miss me
Fuck nigga die slow, I don't give a fuck if he come up missing
Any nigga gettin' money I salute ya, I salute ya

[Verse 2: Future]
Young nigga in a Bimmer coupé with a lot of money and a lot of booze
Young nigga getting plenty money I'm turnt up than Tom Cruise
Mollies all in my cup nigga, screwed up I ain't slowing down
AP I'm trigger happy nigga, young niggas at Atlanta Zoo
Shootin the A up out the chamber, nigga 

[?]
Bad bitch from Beverly hills, I'ma fuck her good on TMZ
Quarter mill for the AP, Quarter mill for Lambo
Quarter mill for a new truck, quarter mil' that's on the counter
Freebandz I'm eating now, rock and roll, no guitar
A lotta drugs and a lotta bitches
I'ma fuck the bitch like a porn star

[Chorus: Future]
Money ain't no issue
I'm on them mollies and prescription
Lean inside my cup I beat that pussy till she miss me
Fuck nigga die slow, I don't give a fuck if he come up missing
Any nigga gettin' money I salute ya, I salute ya

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
I'm just tryna chill but niggas really really want to make me talk reckless
Have these niggas on your neck, you don't really really want to talk necklace
Heard you got L's in the hood you don't really really want to talk Lexus
We got it right now man you thing niggas really want to talk Nexus
Fuck the nigga like his bitch say if she with me in a 6 trey
She ride the stick every which way while shit play from the mixtape
She say shit go hard, she say shit go hard, shorty sound like Big Sean (Swerve)
Bitch keep saying "Oh God" (Oh God)
I done fucked around and got used to money
Fuck game I just use the money
All the suckers get is middle fingers
And the bum bitches get deuces from me
So if you getting money, I salute you I'm saluting
And if you getting mad I rebuke you, Final Solution
Niggas like y'all find excuses
Niggas like us rock exclusives
I come through, beat them streets up cause my whip game so abusive nigga
This that getting money music nigga
When they play it all the winners gon' lose it nigga

[Chorus: Future]
Money ain't no issue
I'm on them mollies and prescription
Lean inside my cup I beat that pussy till she miss me
Fuck nigga die slow, I don't give a fuck if he come up missing
Any nigga gettin' money I salute ya, I salute ya
When I was young I
Fell in love with you
You were my balloon
When you left I
Called upon the rain
Now you sit in skies of grey
Hoped we meet another day
But you up and flew away
I'm moving on
Told myself that one day I'd find you
My red balloon, my red balloon
Said don't fly away, help me fly away
When I get older I plan to follow you
In my new hot air balloon
When I'm bored I
I can get so high, high, high
In my champagne golden sky

[Intro: DJ Drama]
Most of us successful people could tell you a story
About when they wasn't fucking with us
Now that we at the top, y'all not fucking with us

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
They ain't fuck with me when my money low
Now they tryna ride 'cause my money long

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
These niggas ain't shit, half million dollar whip, nigga
Tell your bitch suck a rich nigga dick
They may hate like I ain't grind for this shit
But I ain't tripping cause you niggas ain't fucking with me
Tell 'em "Nah, nah, you niggas ain't fucking with me"

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, when the money came all the hoes came too
These niggas started hating, I guess that's what fame do
And I remain who? Me! Still be with the same crew
None of my niggas don't fall out for bitches
They falling for money, we ain't you, we ain't y'all niggas
Started with a dollar and I turned that to a million
Now the Chasers in the building, it ain't hard nigga
I'm like oh lord what a feeling when you pull up
Drop the ceiling on them suckers that was watching while we starve nigga
They got fat and I got slim
So I shitted on them niggas when I got in
My homie caught me for some paper, that was not my friend
That was not my dawg, so it's fuck that nigga, knock him off
More money than you can ever think
Now we buying more PJ than we can ever drink
More than we could ever swallow
Get money that's my motto
When you in the lead there's nothing to follow
I know...

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
These niggas ain't shit, half million dollar whip, nigga
Tell your bitch suck a rich nigga dick
They may hate like I ain't grind for this shit
But I ain't tripping cause you niggas ain't fucking with me
Tell 'em "Nah, nah, you niggas ain't fucking with me"

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
When the money came all the problems came too
And when the problems came all they had to blame was you
And niggas said I changed, you would probably change too
When niggas is hating they catching them vapors
And mad at favors that you ain't do
They gon' switch sides
I could tell you suckers want me gone
Before I let my mama mourn, you know I'ma let that shit fly
And I used to get it on
Selling crack till it was dawn
Moving fish, and I ain't talking 'bout no fish fry
And the reason they can't keep up, cuz when they sleep you know we up
We move kilos, then re-up
I do one lap, then I speed up
With your plan A, you couldn't be us
Or see us, when it's game time
And it's 4th quarter now let's D-up
I'ma be up, with my feet up
And I'ma eat up, every beat up
That they feed us, as a fetus
I had more stripes than Adidas
And my dawg told me don't ease up, kill these niggas
And when I do murder them all me and my Philly niggas

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
These niggas ain't shit, half million dollar whip, nigga
Tell your bitch suck a rich nigga dick
They may hate like I ain't grind for this shit
But I ain't tripping cause you niggas ain't fucking with me
Tell 'em "Nah, nah, you niggas ain't fucking with me"

[Outro: DJ Drama]
I'm on a decade of dominating the game
With the legends, the hottest MCs, and the new niggas
It's me
They ain't fuckin' with me
It's the ball
DC 3

[Intro: Meek Mill]
There's three types of niggas in life
Niggas that make it happen
Niggas that watch it happen
And niggas that don't even know what the fuck is going on
Choose one...

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I got all these bad bitches twerkin’
Waves on swim, shit surfin’

Wanna fuck with a dope dealer? (Dope dealer)
Or keep fuckin’ them broke niggas? (Broke niggas)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I got all these dope dealers serving

Whack bitches make me curve 'em
Imported rug, that's Persian
One wheel up and we swervin'

Pull up on the curb so crazy, I done bent the door
Bad bitch wanna borrow it, I lent it to her
Make her bust that pussy open in Singapore
30 million though, Forbes list
Out in Philly in a condo, boss shit
Now they call me Young Oprah; Harpo
In the pool rockin' polo, Marco
Millionaires, never do leers
No, they can't see me, they're never my peers
Fruits of my labor, go get me my pears
Cause you're outta your element; I am your fear
So go get off my testicle, pardon my decimal, bitch!
Check up my resumé, I'm upper echelon rich
Them bikes is out and we throwing 'em up like we sick
My clothing line is out in them stores and I'm sipping a Myx, bitch!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Wanna fuck with a dope dealer?
Or keep fuckin’ them broke niggas?
And I don’t fuck with you ho niggas (NAH!)
Rollie yellow like Homer Simpson

Sticky fingers, 30 K

Philly brothers, sometimes they call me Ock! (call me Ock!)
I pray to God, everyday I drop my top (Thank you Lord!)
Humble man, with me and the Lord Meek
I'm the shit, coming down Broad Street
"Sal" Magluta, "Willy" Falcon
Flamboyant dough boy, talkin' Al Capone (ROZAY!)
From Monte Carlo to Los Muchachos
My Mexicanos not talking tacos
This jewelry tampered once, a nigga push that button
On the corner Pac-Man Jones, these niggas don’t want nothin'
You wanna fuck wit a dope dealer? Or keep fuckin' them broke niggas?
My sneaker deal like A.I.'s
We drink Belaire like St. Ides

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Wanna fuck with a dope dealer?
Or keep fuckin’ them broke niggas?
And I don’t fuck with you ho niggas (NAH!)
Rollie yellow like Homer Simpson
That’s dope, nigga!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Feelin' like I'm Richard Porter, I'm really ballin'
Bad bitches got 'em calling, they really calling
My Rollie flooded like New Orleans, just like New Orleans
Ain't talking money, what you talking? Nigga what you talking?
My bitch probably wouldn't speak if you ain't talkin' money
Don't even talk to me if you ain't talkin' money
Ain't shit in life for free so we were talkin' money
You hear that sound? I think it's Benji, he talkin' to me

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
They got me feeling like Rich Porter, I got them hoes
Selling work we got them bricks, and got the most
If he ain't test it I don't trust em', he prolly told
Dimed out your homies, seen them statements, he got exposed
These niggas ratting and you fucking with these pussy niggas
I put these hoes up on the jet and bring that pussy with us
I bring that new thing through yo' block, I see you looking nigga
36 up in the pot like what you cooking nigga?
Fish scale, I love the hustle, I'm 'bout my paper
And I'm fly as Alpo before he drop a statement
I knew I started getting money when I got them haters
Boy won't you go and kill yourself and just do God a favor

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Feelin' like I'm Richard Porter, I'm really ballin'
Bad bitches got 'em calling, they really calling
My Rollie flooded like New Orleans, just like New Orleans
Ain't talking money, what you talking? Nigga what you talking?
My bitch probably wouldn't speak if you ain't talkin' money
Don't even talk to me if you ain't talkin' money
Ain't shit in life for free so we were talkin' money
You hear that sound? I think it's Benji, he talkin' to me

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Don't you see a nigga ballin' like I'm Rayful Edmond?? (No snitching)
My DC shooter Fat Trel hold up that Mac-Eleven (Dem Bitches)
Nail me to the cross I swear I'll never testify (Never)
Never will, that Maybach murder got em' petrified
I'm hard to kill, I'm counting cake up with my finest bitch
Take off her makeup and she still look like a finalist
Top models, pop bottles, catch you bitches slipping
Do em' dirty that top dollar make a major difference
I bought another Phantom, cash count that at the dealer
It took an hour, fast money for us young niggas
Can't run around, marble statues in the front and back (Boss)
With no regard for the law, cause all I want is stacks
So fuck 'em all

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Feelin' like I'm Richard Porter, I'm really ballin'
Bad bitches got 'em calling, they really calling
My Rollie flooded like New Orleans, just like New Orleans
Ain't talking money, what you talking? Nigga what you talking?
My bitch probably wouldn't speak if you ain't talkin' money
Don't even talk to me if you ain't talkin' money
Ain't shit in life for free so we were talkin' money
You hear that sound? I think it's Benji, he talkin' to me

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, we back in the hood
I like recording in Philly
Put me in my zone
(Philly, wassup?)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I remember it was no lights
Mattress on the floor
A thousand roaches, four mice
Yeah, I remember it was no lights
Yeah, I remember it was no lights
Mattress on the floor
A thousand roaches, four mice
Yeah I remember all the cold nights (I do)
Niggas sold white just to live the Lo Life
Ralph Lauren, I was sinning
The crazy part is the designer ain't wanna send it
The dope dealer, was out in me
And not magic, you couldn't imagine
The shit I saw, had no choice but to get involved
You either spit it raw, or sell crack and dribble the ball
It's crazy when I seen my own neighbor hitting the soft
I was thinking in my head like I gotta get with this raw
Shit's getting tow up, as she watch me grow up
Right in front of the kids, she fucking her nose up
She's thinking like so what
My homie got colder
She even sold a nintendo, I'm thinking like hol' up
I done seen my homie mommy turn into a zombie
And it was like New Jersey Drive the way we throw them johnnies
The way we stole them cars
Slide through like a bowling ball
Ain't had nowhere to go at all
Who thought that we would go this far?
Matter fact, who thought that we would live this long?
I got the money and the power, made a nigga strong
I had respect before that
Cause every fight, I fought back
Cause I was always taught that
A nigga hit you hold that
Down baby, now it's thirty rounds baby
As I'm riding through my hood
It been going down crazy in this bitch
Where they murder for a half a pound baby
So imagine for a kilo
Shark in the water, Nemo
Skinny niggas with a full pound, turn to Deebo
Got the four five and the six call it cee-lo
Ya'll niggas talking 'bout murder, that ain't be though
Fuck around and get your life took nigga, repo
Fuck what niggas tell us, I see 'em and know they jealous
Steppin' in my Margielas, this nina like my umbrella
Ballin' like I'm Melo
And kinging like I'm Coretta
Eighteen in my beretta and singing I won't do never
We shooting at all you pussies
Ringing on all you niggas
My city body for body
My finger all on the trigger
I'm ready my niggas heavy
Yellow gold all on my prezi
I'm switching gears in my rari
I'm feeling like I'm Andretti
I'm Freddie all in your dreams
Lean Like I'm Kareem
My 750 my beam I'm clean fuck do you mean
My team full of gorillas
Killers on 4 wheelers
They stuck me back in the trap
Fresh off of tour nigga
They wanna see my demise
Wanna see me with no job
Wanna see me back on the corner
Fifty niggas we mob
With choppers like fuck the coppers
Duckin' them helicopters
They wanna lock us in boxes
Courthouses and teleprompters
They jealous my album sellin'
Jealous that I ain't jealous
They jealous that I ain't tellin'
I'm focused no I ain't failin'
Propellin' up in the sky
Jealous I ain't die
They jealous a nigga made it
They jealous I don't know why
I don't understand y'all suckas
Guess I ain't meant to
Pussy motherfuckers
Lemme tell 'em what I been through

[Hook]
Won't you shadow dance for me?
Play it off and tell me how it feels
Won't you shadow dance for me?
Play it off and tell me how it feels

[Break]
Let's try something different, brand new
Hold that, right there, don't move
I wish I could tip you for all of your time
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Girl when you
Teasing me, pleasing me, guaranteed
You know that I love it when you (I love the way)
Dance for me, flashing me, all for free
That's the way I like it baby
It's what you do, me and you should rendezvous
Somewhere we can meet in private
Your debut, time to shoot, now's your cue, so

[Hook]
Won't you shadow dance for me?
Play it off and tell me how it feels
Won't you shadow dance for me?
Play it off and tell me how it feels

[Verse 2 X2]
If I could freeze
The hands of time I would stay
Right here with you
Right by my side, that'd be nice
The night is young
Your taste is sweet, lay with me
Until we find
Just what we need, what we need

[Break 2]
Tell me that you love me, babe
Tell me that you love me, girl
Tell me if you love me, baby
Do you really love me, baby?
Do you really love it, girl?

[Intro - Vocalizing]

[Chorus: French Montana]
Light the motherfucking roof on fire

(Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
I'm talkin' right now, right now
Shawty slide, I'm talkin' right now, right now
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
See that coupe when we ride

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yea, ok the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn (Let it burn)
Yo friend took a molly, it's yo motherfucking turn (Yo turn)
And y'all know all my money straight (It's straight)
Like a motherfucking perm (No perm)
And all I get is brain, and still ain't motherfucking learn
Hold up, nigga right now, turn the lights down
With a thick bad bitch and she light brown
And she gone make that ass clap, for a real nigga like right now
Oh, and I'm iced down, but that pussy so wet I might drown
With my swimwear, I jump in there, like splash

[Chorus: French Montana]
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
Know you see that coupe when we ride
(Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
I'm talkin' right now, right now
Shawty slide, I'm talkin' right now, right now
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
See that coupe when we ride

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
Fuck hoes we don't love those
Nigga you don't live by the thug code
It's levels to this shit, it's metals in this shit
And several niggas get introduced to the snub nose
Stomp niggas out till the club close
Leave a nigga shirt filled with mud holes
All my flows they love those, we ain't the same set
But you wearing blood clothes
I'm loaded now, fuck you talking 'bout?
I just left the judge, I just met your bitch
That mean it's going down

[Chorus: French Montana]
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
Know you see that coupe when we ride
(Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
I'm talkin' right now, right now
Shawty slide, I'm talkin' right now, right now
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
See that coupe when we ride

[Verse 3: Ma$e]
Man what it look like, being a nigga got the lot of y'all
Little snitch nigga like a fly on the wall
And I'm in a chick head like Tylenol
And I roll up in that black 'Bach, Matte black or that black Lac
And I put another hole in your snapback, step back, act bad
Who said something, I ain't getting on nothing, nigga picture that
Pop that nigga, stop that nigga, drop that nigga
Watch that nigga, rock that nigga, we get it back
When I turn up, niggas wanna chill
Niggas wanna chill? I figured that
Murder back on that old ish
Point me back where the strippers at

[Chorus: French Montana]
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
Know you see that coupe when we ride
(Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
I'm talkin' right now, right now
Shawty slide, I'm talkin' right now, right now
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
See that coupe when we ride

You took a chance to ask my man to come and dance

[Verse 1]
Once was a time you and I
Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me, I believed in your fairy tales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife

[Chorus]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, now this song is through
The things you said, I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do, boy
It's sad, but it's true

[Chorus]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes (Ever will deceive these eyes)
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
No, I'm never gonna hear your lies (Hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear (Make it clear)
Incase you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

[Breakdown]
Goodbye
No, baby
Oh, silly me, I believed in your fairytales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife

[Chorus]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips (Ever gonna kiss these lips)
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time (It's the last time)
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies (Never gonna hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
Ain't a thing you can do but wonder why
There's only time to say goodbye

[Outro]
Baby, goodbye
Cause I'm never gonna, never gonna cry no more
Goodbye, goodbye
Ohh

[Verse 1]
Baby, slow down
Just hear me out
There's something I gotta let you know
No need to push
No need to rush
You know you had me from 'hello'

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When it comes to my heart, I don't play
Baby boy, can't you see the stop sign?
You're moving much too fast
Baby, love doesn't grow in a day
Just get it right the first time
Make this feeling last

[Chorus]
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (Take our time)
Don't you know that it's getting late?
And I know what's on your mind
I know this feeling is crazy
It's mutual baby
But we don't have to rush something real
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (Take our time)

[Verse 2]
Boy, can't you see?
I'm not tryna be the girl who gets taken for a ride
You take your time, and you will find there's so much more to me inside
And you say there's no need to delay
You're telling me to trust you
Boy, you know I want to, baby
But my heart, it's so recently break
Before we take this very far, show me who you really are

[Chorus]
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (Take our time)
Don't you know that it's getting late?
And I know what's on your mind (I know, baby, baby, yeah, yeah)
I know this feeling is crazy (Crazy)
It's mutual, baby (Mutual, baby)
But we don't have to rush something real
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (Take our time)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hey baby
Baby, love doesn't grow in a day
Just get it right the first time
And make this feeling last

[Chorus]
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (Take our time)
Don't you know that it's getting late? (It's getting late)
And I know what's on your mind (And I know just what's on your mind, your mind, your mind, mind)
I know this feeling is crazy
It's mutual, baby
But we don't have to rush something real
We don't have to rush it
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (Take our time)
Our time
Don't you know that it's getting late?

[Verse 1]
I've been watching you from way 'cross the room
Won't ya come and rock it out with me?
You catchin' eyes like you catchin' ties
Over here's where you wanna be
It's so familiar, like we've met somewhere before
And I'm tired of waitin', baby, why you still debating baby?

[Pre-Chorus]
Want me, come and whisper in your ear
All the things you love to hear
I wanna come play nice with you
'Cause if I get you alone, I don't know what I might do
And I think that it's about time we leave
'Cause boy, you're my type
You got me so excited

[Chorus]
So let me come and get ya right

Maybe S's on my arms, so guess you know what it is
So act like you know

Knock it out the park for me
Need ya to hit a home run, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Want me, come and whisper in your ear

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone
Only see him after dark
I met him on the six train
Just the way he said my name
The brother had a lotta game
Had me open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride
Friday about a quarter to nine
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine

[Chorus: Rihanna]
There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
I know his crew's kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady
Gives me everything I need
I don't care who's hating on me
'Cause every night, he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down
But every time that he's around
My heart's on lock down
I feel love and I'm so proud

[Chorus: Rihanna]
There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (So good to me)
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything (Give him everything)

[Verse 3: J-Status]
T-H-U-G in ya life, baby
One in a million, that's what you are to me
And I know your friends say I'm rough
But I still got the tender touch just to make you giggle and blush
But ya mom does not approve of us
She needs to be a lot more understanding
'Cause all I have for you is thug loving
And loving, that's all I'm giving

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me (He's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now 'til forever
I know it's the real thing
If you don't, whatever
And I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be

[Chorus: Rihanna]
There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama? (How am I gonna tell my mama?)
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (Yeah)
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything (Give him all of me)

[Outro: Rihanna]
Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry (All of me)
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry

[Verse 1]
Took a chance
Rolled the dice on me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you write a story much too fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn’t last

[Chorus]
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

[Verse 2]
Remember when we said our love would last forever?
But then again, how are we to know?
There comes a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there'll always be a first time you get burned
Oh, whoa

[Chorus]
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

[Bridge]
I don't regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart’s the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby, can't you see?
It’s the way it’s gotta be

[Chorus]
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

[Outro]
Yeah, no no
Now I know

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
When you were standing in the wake of devastation
When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown
And with the cataclysm raining down
Insides crying: "Save me now"
You were there, impossibly alone

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And in a burst of light that blinded every angel
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
You felt the gravity of tempered grace
Falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go

[Bridge: Full Band]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go

Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go

The problem is I believe in you too much (Miley/Molly)

You don't know which one I'm talking 'bout though

So, Is Mack Maine a fortune teller?

I don't know, If he is I'm gon' get some cookies

[Chorus]
If you're looking for love, know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity, well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else

[Verse 1]
I used to believe love conquers all
'Cause that's what's seen in movies
Come to find out it's not like that at all
You see, real life's much different

[Refrain]
I don't wanna see you go
I only wanna see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile
I can't stand to see us there
We cried, we lied
Cannot pretend to take us back to what we had
To make us feel alive again

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me close
Don't let me go
I hope
Tell me now is not the end

[Chorus]
If you're looking for love, know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity, well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else (Someone else)
I've turned into someone else

[Verse 2]
I used to believe love conquers all
'Cause that's what I felt when you held me
I thought you'd catch me if I fall
And fill me up when I'm empty

[Refrain]
I don't wanna see you go
I only wanna see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile
I can't stand to see us there
We cried, we lied
Cannot pretend to take us back to what we had
To make us feel alive again

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me close
Don't let me go
I hope
Tell me now is not the end

[Chorus]
If you're looking for love, know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity, well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else

[Bridge]
Love is patient, love is selfless
Love is hopeful, love is kind
Love is jealous, love is selfish
Love is hopeless, love is blind
Love is patient, love is selfless
Love is hopeful, love is kind
Love is jealous, love is selfish
Love is hopeless, love is blind
Love is patient, love is selfless
Love is hopeful, love is kind
Love is jealous, love is selfish
Love is hopeless, love is blind
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah

Fuckin' bangerz (Bangerz)
Bangerz (Bangerz)
Fuck-fuck-fuckin' bangerz (Bangerz)

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
All the way in the back with a tree on my lap
All the boys like to ask me, "What you doing with that?"
Yeah, yeah
You say you love me, I ain't fooling with that
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack
One day he wants me
One day he wants me not
I don't do chances, 'cause time just ain't what I got
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at
I can't be sittin' 'round here waitin' on a man
To tell me where the fuck my seat be at
Where Mike WiLL at?

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)

[Verse 2: Britney Spears & (Miley Cyrus)]
I'm flying high up on the bird; acrophobiac
I slick, caught her eyeing down my purse
Where the dollars at?
I let her know the rent's due on the first
They can call the hearse
'Cause, if there's any violation, I go off with that
Catwalk, slick talk, flirting with a big dog
(Why I need his millis when I got Billy on the speed dial?)
You know I'm on that "meow", quick to scratch your eyes out
Strutting on the court, make them nervous, call a timeout

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
The plane, boss, the plane
‘Bout to get that big rock
Slip that on my hand
Make that media big talk
The plane, boss, the plane
Psych, that must be the purple
Got up in my brain
Had me a little bit dismal

[Outro: Miley Cyrus]
I, I, I (Bangerz)
I, I, I (Fucking bangerz)
I, I, I (Bangerz)
I, I, I (Fucking bangerz)
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I

[Verse 1]
Oh no, Pop is dead, long live Pop
It died an ugly death by back-catalogue
And now you know it gets you nowhere
And now you know, you realize
Oh no, Pop is dead, it just gave up
We raised the dead but they won't stand up
And radio has salmonella
And now you know you're gonna die

[Chorus]
He left this message for us

[Verse 2]
So what? Pop is dead, it's no great loss
So many facelifts, his face flew off
The emperor really has no clothes on
And his skin is peeling off
Oh no, Pop is dead, long live Pop
One final line of coke to jack him off
Jack him off

[Chorus]
He left this message for us
He left this message for us
He left this message for us

[Intro]
Oh-oh, hey, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, yeah, are you listening?
Wondering where you've been all my life
I just started living
Ooh-oh, baby, are you listening?
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

[Verse 2]
Baby, can you hear me
When I'm crying out for you?
I'm scared, oh, so scared
But when you're near me
I feel like I'm standing with an army
Of men armed with weapons, hey, oh-oh

[Chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

[Bridge]
I love lying next to you
I could do this for eternity, you and me
We're meant to be in holy matrimony
God knew exactly what he was doing
When he led me to you

[Chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more (I love you more)
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

[Outro]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I'm a female rebel, can't you tell?
Bang on the dashboard, just chipped a nail
Lean out the window, that's when I yell
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself
Police wanna get him and put him in jail
I'mma do whatever to get him his bail
Hooked on donuts and rooster-tails

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in that passenger seat, flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we plumb out of gas, let's go

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
I'm a female rebel, can't you see?
Riding 'round your backyard, who could it be?
Pulling out the steering wheel right from the seat
Pumping his breaks to the sound of the beat
Pumping his breaks to the sound of the beat
He don't understand what he's doing to me
Deep down inside, like a pitbull in heat
Someone's coming, so we head for the streets

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in that passenger seat, flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we plumb out of gas, let's go

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
It's twelve o'clock and I don't wanna party
My big boyfriend and my big truck hobby
A little bit of dirt never hurt nobody
Now I got dirt all over my body
Might as well lie to L
His big fog lights is bright as hell
Calls it off, he starts to yell
He hits the gas so I grab the rail

[Verse 3: Nelly]
Sure you wanna ride with me?
If you scared, don't lie to me
I'm a crazy motherfucker from the Midwest
With a Mississippi flow and an Arch rest
Four by four with the altar steps
We doing donuts underneath the arch, yes!
I need a chick on time, don't mind being early
A ride-or-die, dollar six thirty
A straight-up chick like twelve o'clock
"I don't know where he at", that's what she tell the cops
Take a stand for a nigga, raise a hand for a nigga
"I solemnly swear he was with me all day"
To the judge, "he the one I love"
Hell they could tell, she don't even budge
'Round and 'round we go
Don't stop 'til I tell you so

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in that passenger seat, flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we plumb out of gas, let's go

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Outro: Miley Cyrus]
I'm a female rebel, who can't you tell, who can't you tell
Who can't you tell?
I'm a female rebel, who can't you tell, who can't you tell
Who can't you tell?

[Intro: Miley Cyrus & Future]
Stand by me
Oh, my darlin'
Stand by me

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I walked through a puddle of water
When I seen the shadow of a broken-hearted girl
Pictured us walking to the altar
For better or for worse

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Future]
Why don't you stand, stand by me?
Oh, my darlin', stand by me
'Cause we gon' make a movie, a movie

I ain't pop no Molly
But you still got me sweating
What happened to that feeling?

I ain’t take no shots, but you still got me hot
What happened to the feeling?
I wish it wouldn't stop
We were supposed to be together
We were supposed to be together, yeah

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
They say that love can hit you so fast
Plenty odds are running out of time
But ours is on the boardwalk, baby
Take me as I am or not
I can't breathe without you, without you as mine

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Future]
Why don't you stand, stand by me?
Oh, my darlin', stand by me

[Pre-Chorus]
You're sexy, sexy

Do you feel me?
Oh! I thought so

Feel so alone when you are gone
Feeling right back home when I'm in your arms
You played my strings, like my guitar
When I look in your eyes, I see all the stars

[Verse 3]
Would you believe
I'm dancing in the mirror? (Dancing in the mirror)
I feel like I got no panties on
I wish that I could feel ya (Wish that I could feel ya)
So hurry, hang up that damn phone

[Chorus]
I been laying in this bed (This bed) all night long (All night long)
Don't you think it's time? (It's time to get it on)
But we gotta get it right, we can't get it wrong
Don't you wanna fuel this fire before it's gone? Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Going on and on and make it last forever
What you want all day?
Just as long as it's you and I together
Babe, don't make me wait, yeah
Ooh, oh
Don't make me wait
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Baby

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning (In the morning)
'Cause I don't wanna leave home
Without your love, without it

[Verse 1]
You told me that you wanted this
I told you it was all yours
If you're done with it, then what'd you say forever for?
If forever's out the door
I'll ignore when you call

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night, yeah
You could drop the keys off in the morning (In the morning)
'Cause I don't wanna leave home
Without your love, without it

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
You told me you were coming back, right back
You promised it was real, and I believed that
But if I fall for it again, I will be a fool
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you? Yeah
But I guess I got no valentine
Send me roses, I'll just let 'em die
I was crazy thinkin' you were mine
It was all just a lie

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't wanna leave home (Leave home)
Without your love, without it

[Bridge]
Oh (Ayy)
Oh
I always knew I never wanted this
I never thought it could happen (Never thought it could happen)
You acted like you wanted this
But then you led me on (Led me on)
I thought you would be there when I go (I go)
You promised you would be there when I go (I go)
But all the broken promises, I won't miss, I'm finished
All I know are the facts
That when I look you in the eyes, all I see are the lies
Been there, done that

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night (Night, yeah-yeah)
You could drop the keys off in the morning (In the morning)
'Cause I don't wanna leave home (Home)
Without your love, without it, yeah-yeah, uh

[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
Oh, you broke my heart
I told you I was weak for love
But then you went around
And did what you wanted to do
And now I'm cryin', cryin'

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
Ooh, it seemed like everything was going fine
I found the love that I thought was gonna last
But then I accidentally saw a few things in your cell
I even LOL'd
Man, I should've known
Why? Why you're doing what you do?
You, you might as well just tell the honest truth
See, I'm not really down with this
This ain't no texting shit
No, I ain't got no biz, but it is what it is

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
SMH
I'm pressing "send" on you

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Could've been this, could've been that
We done been there, we done been back
You ain't with it, could've said that
Why you tripping?
Let me hit that
I ain't trying to argue no more
I do it all for you
You know you're my ride or die, baby, let me show you

[Verse 3: Miley Cyrus]
Oh, I know what's been goin' on
Don't even try to act like Mr. Super Nonchalant
What makes you think I'll stick around?
I'm not as stupid as you sound
And you sound really dumb right now
From A to Zed, ooh-ah
I got a lot of nasty things floating up in my head
But none of them are worth my time
You're not even worth this rhyme
And I don't, I don't give a flying

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
SMH
I'm pressing "send" on you

[Bridge: French Montana & (Miley Cyrus)]
(Ooh-ooh, two letters for you, yeah) Letters for you
What you trippin' on?
Girl, you know you wrong
Don't let these girls drive you crazy, haan

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
SMH
I'm pressing "send" on you

[Chorus]
Every single night and every single day
I'ma do my thang, I'ma do my thang
So don't you worry 'bout me, I'ma be okay

And I, I'ma-I'ma-I'ma do my thang

[Verse 1]
Bang bang

Oh, shit
Pass that shit around, baby

But, but I don't hear a sound

[Refrain 1]

And I, I'ma-I'ma-I'ma do my, I'ma do my thang

[Verse 1]
Chapter one; we started happy
The second that you said you loved me
Started questioning us
Are we really in love?
Tryna figure out chapter three
But you're not giving me anything
If this is what we are, then I gotta move on
You think this is everything, but this is no book of love

[Chorus]
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right

[Verse 2]
Here comes the part of you and me
Arguing about nothing
You tell me it's as good as it gets
Yeah, I'm real emotional
Blame it on your mental jokes
How much did you think that I could take?
So much for taking this too far
You can't blame me for who I am
It's too late for us to try to be in love right now

[Chorus]
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right

[Bridge]
Fill the pages now, this chapter's done
Moving on up and forward onto all that will become
If you ever get to the place where the sun is shining every day
Then I'll be on your mind

[Chorus]
You might think I'm crazy (Crazy, yeah)
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right

Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh

Everybody was kung fu fighting
Those kids were fast as lighting
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

There were funky china man
From funky china town
They were chopping them up
They were chopping them down

It's an ancient chinese art
And everybody knew their part
From a faintin' to a slip
And a kick in from the hip

Everybody was kung fu fighting
Those kids were fast as lighting
In fact it was a little bit frightning
But they fought with expert timing
There was funky Billie John
And little Sammy John
He said: Here comes the big boss
Let's get it on

He took a vow and made a stand
Started swaying with the hand
But emotion made me skip
Now we're into a brand new trick

Everybody was kung fu fighting (hooh)
Those kids were fast as lighting (hyah)
In fact it was a little bit frightning (hooh)
But they did it with expert timing (hyah)

Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (hyah)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (hyah)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (hooh)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh Keep on, Keep on, Keep on, Keep on (hyah)

Everybody was kung fu fighting (hooh)
Those kids were fast as lighting (hyah)
In fact it was a little bit frightening (hooh)
Make sure you have expert timing (hyah)

Oh-Oh-Oh Kung Fu Fightin
Hands and feet, fast as lighting
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (hooh)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (hyah)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh Keep on, Keep on, Keep on, Keep on (hooh)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (hyah)

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
He stood in front of me
Everything that I was and what I wanna be
Shots fired, over a hundred G's
And if it wasn't be you, then who's it gonna be?
I never been such a (?) or alone
Sat in the (?) but couldn't stand for his tone
I'm out in New York with my hand on the phone
With a message to my Grammy saying "Man I'm so home"
I'm so home, I'm so grown ass man
But is it worth it?
Black man no perfect, white man no perfect
Praise his name, the hole blows sound, so sharp shit
That's why a nigga proceed straight from Kirkland
A million leaders just millimeters from grabbing heaters
I couldn't leave 'em, to call up my cousin had to believe him
Just to bow down
But we don't see each other, yeah I'm fine now
But I don't know my mother, she left me
America my foster care
I tried to get a hold of her, but I lost the trail
Tried to get her phone number but my pops in jail
I'm posted up on corners with rocks in hand
My big brother taught me how to go and move how a crook move
"Walk tall in the streets, don't be shook, dude"
This is our home, it might be broken but it's still good
You might be joking but you're still hood
They think they know you but they don't
They wanna own you but they won't
They wanna say "nigga, what's up?" Woah
We're not there yet, but I hear you whisper through the air vents

[Verse 1]
I was loungin' at the Chateau Marmont
Glimmerin' by the swimmin' pool
My man walked in like a slow-motion movie
I said, "You're so cool"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I heard a man screamin', "Lights, camera, action!"
I c-c-can't remember what happened
I overdose, you throw me over your shoulder
I was dyin', you were screamin'
"Open up that Lamborghini"

[Chorus]
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Open up your butterfly doors
(What do you say?)
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Let's ch-ch-change our DNA
Let's change our DNA

[Verse 2]
You're the king mafia baby
I'm the Queen of Alchemy
I know a way to make gold
By mixin' our souls to escape reality

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Me and Monterrey went to that ocean
I got that magical trance potion
Gotta leave, I can't wait 'til I'm older
You was laughin', I was runnin'
Use that remote to open up

[Chorus]
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Open up your butterfly doors
(What do you say?)
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Let's ch-ch-change our DNA
Let's change our DNA

[Bridge]
You can be my higher power, baby
I can be your endless USA
We can go on drives for hours, baby
Let's cha-a-ange our DNA
Let's change our DNA
Let's change

[Chorus]
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Open up your butterfly doors
(What do you say?)
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Let's ch-ch-change our DNA
Let's change our DNA

[Outro]
Heavy hitter

[Lil Snupe]
Youngin, been about the money
These niggas know bout the youngins, these niggas know that I run it
This nigga call me on the phone
And I ain't even want him to sign me
Just knew that he knew my name, so it was on
These niggas knew that I was smoking strong, then
And these niggas already knew I was gone come through in the Benz
These niggas know I don't really even can trust my friends
Cause you will commit 'em homie, if we commitin' them sins
How I got to Philly, rode on the bus, Greyhound
Man I heard I had to lay it down
Nigga, in the back cupped up, up in a fuckin seat
But I knew if I got to Meek I was gon' kill the fuckin beat
And could I be a fuckin millionaire, trillionaire
And people look at me, now they say yeah he's really here
These niggas here, we hated ya'll
Yea I got the .80 cocked
They tellin' me, damn boy you ain't in a day top, you ain't in the car
When I rolled to Philly I rolled in a Bentley
First nigga sent me my Bentley, this nigga Meek Milly
From my city you don't see shit like that
Yeah it's greatness, this shit right here amazing
It's crazy to know that I rolled in a Ferrari today
First time ridin' in a Ferrari was today
But see me, I'm a do it up in here, this major way
But these niggas they tryna take me, and nigga I just can't play
I'm a youngin
Last week we was everywhere
Real shit, nigga we was everywhere
Flew home, Monday had a fight
Nigga we was thuggin, goin hard all night
Then I had a wreck, man this shit right here is crazy
But I'm a fuckin star, man this life here, it's amazing
Police didn't come, that shit right there I don't believe
That this that, this shit right here happenin' to me
Tuesday, I was chillin
Girl named Kiara, I swear to God I was killin shit
She just knew that I was feelin
A young nigga was feelin
And she wanted me cause a nigga was fresh back from Philly
So I was rollin blunts all day
So I had to get it nigga in the hallway
Nigga I already know I was headed to the top
By 9 o'clock, pussy ass niggas spinned the block
The same pussy nigga, I had a fight with on Monday
The nigga try to kill me, funeral by Sunday
But mama never was gon have it, mama never was gon beat it
So I had to get it, show these nigga that I believe it
My cousin sayin Snupe, wanna ride on these niggas?
Tell me if you really wanna slide on these niggas
Then Meek text me, said what would you do?
Then I said man this shit a test but what should I do?
He said Snupe if wanna get him, I'm wit him
I said fuck these niggas, in a year, we gon get em
I got it right now, I gotta go and get these millions
Told these people that I'm with it so these people gotta get it
These niggas tryna take me to the under, I'm thug
These niggas tryna Twitter beef so they can get some buzz
But me I'm a young nigga, these niggas be with the thugs
And I got niggas when I say so, they'll really will hit you wit slugs
Happened at the battle, it was 10k
Most money I ever made, 10k
10k, it was crazy man, this shit was winnin
I won fuckin 10k up in 30 minutes
It was an easy battle
I ain't gon' lie, it was simple
Pussy nigga had no brain, felt like he was mental
Young nigga comin, these niggas know that we was into
He was rappin like his ass was playin the instrumental
Fuck niggas actin like I ain't been in one
A great nigga, they invented one
Mama and daddy, they had a king for real
Man I swear I'm livin out my people dreams for real
I do my thing right now, my daddy ain't livin' dreams
Mama ain't livin' dreams, granny ain't livin' dreams
My cousins ain't livin' dreams
So you know what I'm a do?
I'm a live all out through Snupe, we gonna rock

[DJ Drama]
Moment of silence... for Lil Snupe

[But My Mackin Ain't Easy Intro]
Yo, Soul Theory
Let's get it man, ha

[The Jukebox Intro]
DJ Capcom is the beast of this game (Yup, yup)
Y'all better get him a leash

[Chorus]
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another (Easy Mac)
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another (Soul Theory)
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another (The Ill Spoken)
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another (Haha, yeah; East End Empire)

[Verse 1]
You see, they probably wonder why I don't smile (Yup)
'Cause these cats need to get they own style (Uh-huh)
Hold the phone dial, I go miles (Chyeah)
When I'm sprintin' on the beat, you'll get lifted off your feet
When you spliffin' up my trees, quit givin' me a speech
I ain't really tryna hear this (Nah)
See, with these lyrics, I'm tryna run fearless
We playin' games in this jungle, Jumanji
With bomb tree, hidden under all my dirty laundry (Haha)
Call me an arm free fuckin' around
I'm puttin' words in your mind 'til you in love with the sound (Come on, man)
They savin' my place, tryna shove this food in my face
So they force it down my throat 'til I'm used to the taste
Now move to your place (Yup), 'cause I'm campin' out on top
Fresh kicks on my feet while you sittin' in some socks (Haha)
Cops tryna get me locked, catch me fuckin' with shenanigans (Fuck 'em)
But I'll just handle 'em and throw 'em in the ambulance (Bitch)
They wanna know what my hands is in, scare me straight (Huh?)
Get back, bitch, I ain't tryna share my plate (You know)
What's good, fam? I love money, I will marry cake
Get a rich bitch like Ashley and Mary Kate
And I ain't talkin' 'bout one of 'em (Nope), I'm gettin' both (Yup)
I grab 'em, get a loaf, then take their money and they coats (Gimme that)
I blow trees, so my mouth is always filled with smoke
You sniffin' coke, singin' but you haven't hit a note (Ah)
Plus that shit you wrote isn't set to carry a crowd
I'm legendary anywhere that I'm out (They know)
I'm sharin' this pound with my people like a How High sequel
Told my people, "Need to air out the house" (Oof)
So beware of my mouth, spittin' venom, comin' out the cerebellum
With these kicks on my feet, see, I told you I was gellin' (Yessir)
You playin' felon, you in stealin' a penny
I put a hole in your belly like you Oprah or Jenny (Chyeah)

[Chorus]
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
(Haha, keep those motherfuckers rollin' up, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another (Haha, yeah)
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another (Oh, I'm at the party now)

[Verse 2]
I sport a long white tee, fitted cap, baggy pants (You know)
If you see me, please be sure to slap my hand (What's good?)
Some people do it for the love, some people do it 'cause they can
But me, I'm tryna be a legend like Bagger Vance (Yessir)
Some rap will make you think, while other shit'll make you dance
So I bump whatever's in the system, try and make some plans
(Ayo, what's good, dog?)
I just wanna see what's good for the night time
If nothing's hype, I'ma head up to the crib and write rhymes
Age like white wine, nicer by the second (So nice)
That's why I never put punctuation on a sentence
'Cause the song goes on (Goes on), here a dope song
If they said I wasn't for real, then you was told wrong
See, you ain't on what we on
You bright, I'm neon
I'm smokin' up the weed 'til the tree gone, yeah
My life's up and down like a see-saw
So I stay with a bitch like my name was Leon Phelps

[Chorus]
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another (That's how it is, man)
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another (Soul Theory Productions, baby)
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another (Easy Mac)
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another (Ill Spoken)
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another

Make sure y'all look out for that young talent
Smackin' niggas across the motherfuckin' face this year
'09 and beyond, we flyin' the fuck out

False pretense and no convictions
Compromised commercialism

Mental castration, a generation forced to labor for a nation
Lock the means production down, price reduction down
Inflation and corruption need the medication now!
They need the medication now!
Corporate production in a state of mass combustion
Greed and lust and dangerous repercussions
To escape the rupture they speak of rapture
While still going after the things they spiritually capture

[Verse 1: King South]
I told you I don't want you no more girl and you keep trying (trying)

Cause sometimes girl shit just can't be worked out (at all)
I'm burnt down (burnt down), and I leaned out (and I leaned out)
Eating steak house (steak house) with my new b*itch right now (right now)
And I like her style (and I like her style), cause she treat me better (she treat me better)
Then she f*uck me better (she f*uck me better) we on another level

[Bridge: King South]

[Intro: MF DOOM]
He wants to get his girlfriend? Go get your girlfriend
Ay! And now...you is 'bout to dance, like you ain't never danced before

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
This one'll have you get the trash hash out the stash
As they say, "Ash to Ash"
Jewels free rash, fools ask the mask need me?
I'll be peeing in the pool, ka-splash!
You may feel a slight drizzle
Villain—give a squealer a candlelight vigil
Couldn't find a healer with a whistle in the line of sight
And he hold the mic like a fistful of dynamite
They wonder how he built his C-note tower
All before zero hour it's tree grow power
Then he go shower to scour off the funk
And watch a so-called comp cower soft punk
The god is the oddest fella you'll find
Paid to speak his mind like Father Jealous Divine
He came to rock the banquet, rank it
Along with two of the baddest broads to act stank wit, blank spit
Dilla raise the beat like a anchor banker
Overstand the Super plays the heat
Will shank a wanker
He drank a tank of angst, thank ya
Guess what? Chicken head butts
Hit a rhyme on time, like kicked 'em dead in the nuts
Oh... the victim had guts
Prepare to stick 'em, I'll slick 'em in the cut
Go... sell a spear chucker voodoo
Got'ed her off wholesale mare schmuck new spew
So... sell a beer trucker doodoo
Foes go to hell in a seersucker muumuu

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
DOOM!
Guilty!
Dilla, Dilla!
Grind for the paper, hot like Sanka
Top notch ranker, clock my banker
Dead Presidents, sick dudes - I'm the medicine
Storming in your residence when I'm in my element
No contest, I get hot and go unconscious - ya boy is automatic
Now go play in traffic, the flow is graphic
With no theatrics, still rock sold out shows for practice
Call it a walk-through. Def. The wrong one to talk to
Beef ain't nothin I can't stick a fork through
We break bread, eat good, and pour brew
Cheers!
Come toast to the one with respect to the utmost on more than one coast
GS, check the style I splash, to make the listener wanna pile my cash
King of the Hill, money is the issue
It's all on me tell 'em bring me the bill
Daddy Warbucks, shift gears in the armored truck
Like Big Daddy Kane when I warm it up
Fans scream for the two man team
Doom and Guilty - Hip Hop supreme
The denim is blue but the pockets green
Big knots in jeans, you can't stop the kings

[Mitch Mitchell]
Good Evening Ladies and Gentleman
Welcome to radio station EXP
Tonight we are featuring an interview
With a very peculiar looking gentleman
Who goes by the name Mr. Paul Caruso
On the dodgy subject of are there
Or are there not flying saucers or UFOs?
Um, please Mr. Caruso, could you give us
Your regarded opinion on this nonsense
About spaceships and even space people?

[Jimi Hendrix]
Thank you. As you all know
You just can't believe everything
You see and hear, can you?
Now, if you'll excuse me
I must be on my way

[Mitch Mitchell]
Ehh... but, but, but, but
Huh, I don't believe it

[Instrumental outro 0:40-1:55]
I just want to talk to you
I won't, do you no harm
I just want to know about your different lives
On this is here people farm
I heard some of you got your families
Living in cages tall and cold
And some just stay there and dust away
Past the age of old
Is this true?
Please let me talk to you

I just wanna know about
The rooms behind your minds
Uh do I see a vacuum there
Or am I going blind?
Or is it just uh, remains of vibrations
And echoes long ago?
Things like "Love the world" and uhh
"Let your fancy flow"
Is this true ?
Please let me talk to you
Let me talk to you
I have lived here before
The days of ice
And of course this is why
I'm so concerned
And I come back to find
The stars misplaced
And the smell of a world
That is burned
A smell of a world
That is burned

Yeah well, maybe, ehm...
Maybe it's just a... change of climate
Hmm, hmm...
Well I can dig it
I can dig it baby
I just want to see

So where do I purchase my ticket?
I'd just like to have a ringside seat
I wanna know about the new Mother Earth
I wanna hear and see everything
I wanna hear and see everything
I wanna hear and see everything
Yeah...
Ahw shucks
If my daddy could see me now
Everything, everything, everything, oh everything

[Intro]
I know when to go out
And when to stay in
Get things done

[Verse 1]
I catch the paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try
I try

[Verse 2]
There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try
I try

[Chorus]
Never going to fall for
(Modern Love) walks beside me
(Modern Love) walks on by
(Modern Love) gets me to the church on time
(Church on Time) terrifies me
(Church on Time) makes me party
(Church on Time) puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man) no confessions
(God and Man) no religion
(God and Man) don't believe in Modern Love

[Verse 3]
It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye
But I try
I try

[Chorus]
Never going to fall for
(Modern Love) walks beside me
(Modern Love) walks on by
(Modern Love) gets me to the church on time
(Church on Time) terrifies me
(Church on Time) makes me party
(Church on Time) puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man) no confessions
(God and Man) no religion
(God and Man) don't believe in Modern Love
(Modern Love) walks beside me
(Modern Love) walks on by
(Modern Love) gets me to the church on time
(Church on time) terrifies me
(Church on time) makes me party
(Church on time) puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man) no confessions
(God and Man) no religion
(God and Man) don't believe in Modern Love
Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love
Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love
Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love
(Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love)
Modern love, walks beside me (modern love)
Modern love, walks on by (modern love)
Modern love, walks beside me (modern love)
Modern love, walks on by (modern love)
Never gonna fall for
(Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love)

So pour it up, till we throw it up
Roll it up, blow it up
Girl you fine as hell (hell)

You should come to my
Apartment

We could make a movie
And your girls could make the sequel
But before we do..
Could you do it for..
Me and my people!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Everywhere I go

Told ol' girl in knee highs
To go put down that glass
And grab a bottle that is knee high
And I'm just so important shit
That they might be important shit
How it feel to waste liquor
That niggas cannot afford to sip
She be on that X times 3
Like it's a porno flick
My chain look like a ornament
Touch it
And you'll get that red dye
Like we recordin' shit
Terminator 4 and shit
Drinks pourin'
Now that all the cash pourin' in
Boi!
And I don't live off in no forest
But it's girls off in my bed
Like they aid
Upon my foraging(?)
Hold, stop, drop,EGO
Before you do
Could you do it fo'
Me and my people!

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
There's a star in the palm of my hand and I think it's yours
If you don't want it, then I'll understand, you deserve much more
When I brought it down from the sky, you almost forgot it
It was new back when you gave a damn
What you need, I'll go and get it

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I don't come back, girl, your love was worth it
That's the one thing I know
And if I don't make it back
Girl, remember that, that I said I'd go, baby

[Chorus]
Girl, your love is so hard, and it takes me so far
But I don't care I'll go, oh
If I don't make it home, at least now you know
Girl, for you, I'll go

[Verse 2]
Got my heart in the palm of your hand, now you're good, that's yours
If you don't want it, I won't understand 'cause I came so far
When you tossed it, took forever to find the place where you lost it
Now you're gone with my heart out the door
Home is here, girl, don't forget it

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you don't come back, girl, this love was worth it
That's the one thing I know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you don't make it back
Girl, remember that, that I said I'd go for you, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Girl, your love is so hard, and it takes me so far
But I don't care I'll go, oh
If I don't make it home, well at least now you know
I'll go, go
FUCK THE OPPOSITION.

I'M WINNING.

{Freestyle over Jay-Z's 'So Ghetto'}

[Intro: Eminem (Proof)]
Yeah. Now I'm getting distorted. (Can you turn it down) When I was...I should've been aborted. But it was too late...uh oh. (Uh oh) Yo, just turn up the beat a little bit. I don't care if the mic is distorted. Fuck it

[Eminem]
That's it, that's it, gotta hit than pass it
I'm blasted off a tab of acid
Flabbergasted
Hopped in a cab and blasted the cab driver
I said...haha
Hold on a minute
Give me infinite beats that I can kick for a minute
Y'all don't understand
The way that I got this mic in my hand
Killing any MC who stands or sits or walks
Or is handicapped
It doesn't matter, Mr. Handicap, hand me that
Haha
I clap hands with the rap fans
Jump in their wheelchairs and give 'em a lap dance
I'm the illest MC who will kill this
And what?
And Die Hard like who?
(Bruce Willis)
Thank you very much that's a fucking cliche
But I will rock the microphone and don't care about what he say
Or they say or I say or we say or them say
Eminem say shit that only Slim say
Or Slim says
Fuck a les
-bian in her ass
Korean or a...
Haha

[Interlude: Proof talking]
Ayo, let me try something. Uh uh uh uh uh uh. I'm not free in here, check it out

[Proof]
I rap if there was no rap within a soul clap
Expose wack rappers and smack 'em with my bozack
Flatten 'em like inner tubes
Punch my fist through the torso of thinner dudes
And when I'm in the mood make a serious winner lose
Get high of gin and booze

[Eminem]
Hahahaha
In an inner tube
While I'm in the nude
With a centerfold
In the winter cold

[Proof]
Ayo we give it though
Give me an envelope
I get open with Tim Westwood show
And Cypher Sounds I strike you down
Don't like the way you sound, you wack now
You got my style packed down or should I say down pack
Any MC's will tell you right now that you sound wack
Call us up and then we make noise then see shells
We shall prevail you faker than Lee Nails
And we tell D-12 to all those that don't know
Flow for flow we rocking your radio
How you feel right now?
C'mon Shady flow
Yo, yo, yo

[Interlude: Eminem and Proof talking]

[Eminem]
Trapped in a cinema, in a material world
Criminal, cops scour the rural area thorough
Cause I kissed a girl, married a girl
Carried a girl to the cemetery, buried a girl
And I'm desperate, no one to mess with
Always get arrested for something domestic
And I kill the way you met me
You'll never catch me, cops can't sketch me
You can't upset me, no matter how bad
How mad you get me
Problem with y'all, I'm letting the Tec speak
Went from sweet to hard
Beat the odds
From no shows to hoes, quit the pizza job
No more fools to rob, no more geeks to rob
No more stolen cars, no more Visa cards
(Visa cards)
Slim Shady
(Slim Shady and D-12)
Woke up, got my K
Soulja Boy Tell'Em, full gas no brakes
I'm headed to the money, ain't shit funny
Smoking chronic, I gotta roll hard like my first name Sonic
I'ma boss, I'ma fiend to the fuckin dead presidents
The IRS looking for me, for my residents
Sucked the time after time, they lied on my name
Spreading rumors about me in this hip hop game
But it's all good cause I put them tame after tame
They can't tame me, so they brainwash the public
So I had to do it like nobody else does it
And I had to leave the scene so they saying who was it
It was me, it was Beezy
I made the shit look easy
Yellow diamond watch, yeah that shit is so freezy
Shoutouts to my fans, they know I be throwing bands
When I'm standing on the stage and they standing in the stands
Man I ball hard, yeah I go hard
Still on the deck, I pull the check
I pull the check out, man I rest out
Man I cash out, man I break out
Man I mess out, take the gas out
Take the K out, I'm gone take off on the haters
Talking down on me, but I rose up like elevators
At the same time my mind was on money
I couldn't stop
So I had to get full throttle, headed to the guap

[Hook]
IGot, money in my pocket
IGot, girls scream my name
IGot, every shoe you name
IGot, iGot, iGot
Girls screaming for me
IGot, girls dreaming for me
IGot, every shoe you name
IGot, iGot, iGot
Every shoe you name
IGot, girls scream my name
IGot, go head and sing iGot
IGot

I'm stealin, I'm trusted
Moving and I'm pearlinin and I'm pullin
And I'm working heavingly
And I know these kids is influenced by this stuff they hear on the radio, deadly faces
I'm on vacation, I'm a movie
I need a standing ovation
My name is little Soulja, I can tell you two times to get yo money and shine because one day you gone die
I'm puttin this shit on the map
And if they keep swagger jacking man I promise I'ma snap
But I'm on back to the basics, I swear I'm back to the nation
I give back to the people, I swear everyone equal and all
My name is Soulja Boy Tell'Em, I ball
Everyday 'till until I fuckin' fall

[Hook]

[Intro]
Yeah
Suffix, people
Chyeah
You know
You, you, you already
Yeah
C'mon

[Verse]
Kicking rocks on the block, telling all the OGs:
"I be coming for your spot when you're not looking"
Hot cooking, mama got it on the kitchen table
I thank God we were always able to
Get the leather couch, big screen, cable, too
Nintendo when them good grades came through
Then the cooked Ks came through
Some soft, some stepped-on, but we kept on
And I slept with the work plenty nights
Thought I heard niggas coming, thought I saw the cop lights, but
I was dreaming, then I woke
The junkies was still fiending, and I had coke so
I had hope; you may say that its wrong
But I ain't talking to your child, I'm talking to this song
I'm just doing a buck down memory lane
If I crash, just pick up my brain
And yes, my niggas the same, but they quicker to bang
And if they do, then I'm the nigga you blame
So I shoot first anyway, and I would do the honors any day
And tell your honor he a bitch to his face
And whip through the stage like I whip through the yay
Show your ass how to take four and get eight
And it don't take four niggas to get straight
The only Hot Boy eating off this plate: Young
Weezy Baby, that's what your bitch say
Give her ass a location and a temp plate
Show her how to work the interstate
Stop working with that thinner weight, get your brakes fixed
Stop playing, 'cause all we know is gunplay
Trip while you full and my clip gon' be empty
When the stomachs get empty, anything's tempting
Ain't nobody safe when it's for the kids' sake
Hurricane wiped us out like a earthquake
We tryna save face, but we ain't got a place
To stay, so they made us evacuate
We on our way, pussies, relocate
Y'all know us, when you see us, put your jewels up
Put your cars, put your clothes, put your shoes up
It's that serious, homie, pick the news up
It wasn't good, nigga, think about the hood, nigga
The people who ain't never had shit, ain't gon' never have shit
Bullshit, 'cause they still gon' try to manage
Niggas doing anything, like, God gon' understand 'em
But please understand this: niggas with money lost mansions
Niggas with nothing lost families, lives lost in traffic
Water up to the attic, there goes the stashes
But a nigga got passion
Even though the bounce-back seeming like magic
Shit... Well, call me Siegfried
Watch how I turn one key to a hundred Gs
Yeah, dear summer, summer breeze:
Summer, please, know I live for you
Throw on the wife-beater, let back the lid for you
A few years I probably hear from you, but now I'm here for you
I know niggas that shed a tear for you
Behind bars, tryna get to you, and probably never see you
This that real talk if you ever heard it, homie
Shit hurts so much, might have to hurt you, homie
No commercial, no fronting, no curve on it
No cut; tell life, "So what?"
The drought's here; not only white's slowed up
The weed's slowed up, we can't even roll up
Fuck it, put a dent in the money too
But that's the last thing 'cause hustle is what we do
Hustle with what? How we getting on?
Where he sitting at? What he sitting on?
Stand up if you know it's true
The end of the world coming, and my city the proof, damn
Shit... And this is after disaster
This ain't rap, this a recap
Stepping off the G4, still strapped
Bust your head in the air, that's a sky-cap
Have my car pick me up where I arrive at
Drop the work off, 'cause it don't go where I reside at
Garbage bags filled up with dollars
Dead presidents, gotta dump the bodies
Birdman, as long as we gon' eat
Then everybody eat off me
Feet off ground, fingers to the stars, reaching
And I'ma get there through these bars, believe me
I'm down for the cause, even
When everything pause, I'm proceeding
I'm a leader, meet the son of Jacida
Fuck the world, not the people, damn!

[Intro]
It's our party we can say what we want
It's our party we can stop what we want
We can vote how we want, defund what we want
It's our party we can say what we want
It's our party we can stop what we want
We can vote how we want, defund what we want

[Verse 1]
Red states and sweaty bodies everywhere
Bills in the house like we don't care
'Cause we came to shut it all down now
No government around now
If you're not ready for healthcare
Can I get a hell no? (Hell no)
'Cause we gonna keep it shutdown
D.C. is a close town, all round

[Pre-Chorus]
So la-di-di-da-di, Republican Party
Repping G.O.P, doing whatever we want
This is our house, this is our rules

[Chorus]
And we did stop (the government)
Yeah, we did stop (shut that down)
Can’t you see it’s we who are the right?
Can’t you see it’s we who ‘bout that life?

[Interlude]
It's our party we can say what we want
It's our party we can stop what we want
We can vote how we want, defund what we want

[Verse 2]
To my government workers on the furlough
Even though you’re already paid low
Remember only God can judge us
Forget the haters 'cause somebody elected us
And everyone in line for early childcare
Anyone who planned to see a grizzly bear
We are all so shut down here
Getting so shut down
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So la-di-di-da-di, Republican Party
Repping G.O.P, doing whatever we want
This is our house, this is our rules

[Chorus]
And we did stop (the government)
Yeah, we did stop (shut that down)
Can’t you see it’s we who are the right?
Can’t you see it’s we who ‘bout that life?

[Bridge]
It’s our party, we can do what we want to
It’s our house, we can vote how we want to
It’s our floor, we can say what we want to
It's our bill, we can vote how we want to

[Outro]

[Spoken Intro]
(Is the microphone on?)

[Intro]
Hey baby where are you coming from?

[Verse 1]
Well she looked at me and smiled
And looked into space and said "I'm coming from the land of the new rising sun"
Then I said, "Hey baby, where are you trying to go to?"
Then she said "I'm going to
Spin and spread around peace of mind and a whole lot of love to you and yours"

[Chorus]
Hey girl I'd like to come along
Yes, I'd love to come along

[Verse 2]
"Would you like to come along?" She asked me
"Yes, take me along right now"
Hey baby, can I step into your world for a while?
"Yes you can," she said
Come on back with me for a while
We're going to go across the Jupiter sand and see all you people one by one
We got to help you people out right now
That's why I'm doing it all about

[Chorus]
Hey girl I'd like to come along
Yes, I'd love to come along

[Intro]
Uh-oh
Oh, no, no, no, no (She said)
No, no, no, no
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more, oh
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Yeah, no, no, no

[Verse]
Face down in the brown grass
Shame, shame on my brown ass
Birds in the trees as we run through
And if I'm dead to the world, what you gon' do?
What you gon' do? Like, "I can't remember"
Shots fired, rewind, please, girl, be mine
Email denied, talk to me, baby
Before I go crazy, might do it, maybe
We were so Jay Z, Beyoncé
My aunt say, "Keep the sex game picante"
The Aunt May and Mary Jane that I was hitting on
To make me try and forget that there was something wrong
Love is Russian roulette, I had the safety on
We popped pills at the Coachella
Hold my head in the weeds, man, I can't tell her
The fear that I feel, man, it might kill her
Man, it might kill her, it's the prep school mic killer
With the drums and the groove, so it feel Dilla
I don't care what he say
I'ma get my platinum back like I'm a half-ton gorilla
You can hang with homie on the low
But your boy so weak like a week ago
But we ain't speaking though
We ain't speaking, we ain't speaking though

[Chorus]
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you (She said, she said, she said)
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you (She said, she said, she said)
Love me better, kiss me back
Listen more, oh (She said, she said, she said)
Love me better, kiss me back, listen–

[Bridge]
The attitude
The attitude
And I hope you understand
And I hope you understand
We were never friends
And I hope you understand now
But I miss them
And I hope you understand
And I hope you understand
Oh, no, no, no
And I hope you understand
And I hope you understand
And I hope you understand

[Outro]
(I hope you understand) I hope you understand
'Cause everywhere I go
Everything I see
I just hope you understand

Ah!

[Hook]
Snort snort the snort the cocaine
Snort snort the snort the cocaine
Snort snort the snort the cocaine
Snort-y snort snort the cocaine

Ohhhhhh!
Drop the biggest bump I ever hit
Damnnnn!
Yo fucking chop another, kid

I wanna do it til my face falls off
Til my tongue's so numb that the taste falls off

I do blow
And boy I do it viciously
Lie to my face and that motherfucker's history

Cocaine cocaine
China bright, snow white
Rolled to a rave
And steal a motherfucker's glow light
Keep my dough right
Man these white lines bite
Make me bleed out my motherfucking eyes tonight
So highhhhh
Nose like a power vac
Girls rub me down just to get into my powder sack

On the power track, so I drink to my health
Lift the rail off the mirror and I wink to myself

No needle in my vein, I got to maintain
A bitch like me is doing cocaine

[Hook]
Snort snort the snort the cocaine
Snort snort the snort the cocaine
Snort snort the snort the cocaine
Snort-y snort snort the cocaine
Snort snort the snort the cocaine
Snort snort the snort the cocaine
Snort snort the snort the cocaine
Snort-y snort snort the cocaine

I like to do the cokey-coke
You'll never see me smokey-smoke
Never buy, already brokey-broke
Pass me a dollar and I'll roll it up
For me though
Were gonna sell and cut tonight
Uh huh
I'm gonna yell and fuck tonight
Uh huh
I'm gonna press my luck tonight
Uh huh
Motherfuckers better duck tonight
Uh huh
Doing lines off my face with a bendy straw
Pick up my whole car in half with a bendy saw
There ain't enough room for me in this town
And once my dick gets hard it'll never go down

A to the N to the DER to the SON
When it comes to getting gacked we stay number one
While others split a grab, we be sniffing a ton
And we never fucking stop until the bag is done

I walk in the party with my dick in my hand
And straight to the bathroom with my dick in my hand
You wanna step up I got the brick in my hand
Then leave your ass face down with my dick in my hand

Denis A. I hit the yay all day
Went to your party must stay all day
Hit you in the brain
Leave your face ug-lay
Andersons give a fuck what y'all say
Philip Anderson looking for action
Dear God on the floor
Call the chain reaction

Step up
You better learn how to act son
No go
You better hit the track bud

Arnold A., but the girls call me Arny
Do more blow than the Columbian army
Made my name in the hyrdogame
Now I play all day on my hydroplane

Tell me if your nose froze, girls with no clothes
Then your face pushed in, for that shit that you stole

We cut your shit with ajax, so products bump
And it sits a hundred grand out the back of my trunk
When no radio play you can't fuck with Philip A
Andersons motherfucker till my dying day

While you were horse faced, running
Tryin to get the crowd hyped
We was in the back, sippin yack, startin fist fights
Oh! I hit the light when I spit at your girl
Turn around, do a line, and I spit on your girl

Haaaa!
That's the sound of my laughter
My pillowcase is wired to a live firecracker
Never sleep, all my dreams end in disaster
Life in the fast lane just got faster

What's your name?
Arny A., call me Mr. What
Last to pass out and the first to fuck
And whatchya do?
Sell snow, man, all the blow
The motherfucking pied piper owes me dough

What's your name?
Denny A., soft soother with the luga
Hit more keys than the ones on your computer
Whatchya do?
Anything, anywhere, anytime and place
You try to shake my hand I'll fucking punch you in the face

What's your name?
Philip A., known as Bobby Flay
Cuz I cook that coke up everyday
And whatchya do?
Drink, fuck, snort, shoot and fight
Ya fuck with Phil ya gonna fuck all night

What's ya name?
Anderson, the family's here
The one that you love, and hate and fear
And whatchya do?
Known to party every night and day
Try to make us leave but we're still gonna stay

[Intro: Swizz Beatz, Diddy & DJ Khaled]
Ayo, Khaled, now y'all know that y'all done fucked up now
DJ Khaled!
Woo! I've been waiting for a long time (How long?)
Real damn long time (How long?)
I've been waiting for a long time (How ya feel?)
Man (Come on man, yeah!)

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz, Diddy & The Notorious B.I.G.]
I feel like Pac (Yeah!), I feel like Biggie
I'm feeling like these hating niggas waiting to get me (Let's go)
I'm losing my sleep, I'm losing my mind
You know I go hard when it comes to mine
I feel like Pac, Biggie, Pac, B-Biggie
Y'all know y'all done fucked up now, Rozay!

[Verse 1: Rick Ross & Diddy]
Sucka walk up on me, talking like he know me (Come on)
Ain't no codefendant do my dirt all by my lonely
Down south nigga, talking Jam Pony
Rest in Peace to Uncle Al, he showed me my first Rollie
Bitches want to know me, haters want to show me
But I'm just so vicious, double M worth eighty tickets
Cop just pulled me over, caught up in this thing (Woo)
Take my case to trial, my juror Paula Deen
I know they hate a nigga but he's such a major nigga
Give Chelsea Clinton the .44 when C.I.A. was with us
305 the realest, Ricky Ross the richest (That's right)
Belaire on my table, I talk it then I live it
Maybach Music

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz, Diddy, Meek Mill & The Notorious B.I.G.]
I feel like Pac, I feel like Biggie
I'm feeling like these hating niggas waiting to get me (Come on)
I'm losing my sleep, I'm losing my mind
You know I go hard when it comes to mine
I feel like Pac, Biggie, Pac, B-Biggie (Meek Milly!)
Ayo, don't be afraid to be great motherfuckers, let's go

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
All you starve and I eat fast, Mulsanne when I creep past
Blacked out, I max out with the same watch on Meech hand
We killing niggas, no repents, my momma got like three Jags
You talkin' 'bout you a baller, nigga
We really gettin' that street cash
Say old money, new work, smell the 'caine on my new shirt
My OG said, "Strap up and don't lay your head where you do dirt"
And my momma said, "Do schoolwork"
I was making that tool work
And niggas wanted me dead with a whole all in my head
Man they hit Big in the passenger, hit Pac in the passenger
So I'm riding 'round with this Mac on me
And a bunch of shooters in back of us
Roll up, you a dead man, headshots when we clap at ya
We sendin' niggas to the motherland
And I ain't talkin' 'bout Africa

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz, Diddy & The Notorious B.I.G.]
I feel like Pac, I feel like Biggie (Ayo, Khaled)
I'm feeling like these hating niggas waiting to get me
This that feeling
I'm losing my sleep, I'm losing my mind
This is what the game been missing
You know I go hard when it comes to mine
That gangsta, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta shit
I feel like Pac, Biggie, Pac, B-Biggie

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Feel like it's me against the world, bury me a G
My middle finger to the world, I'm gon' forever be a G
Pussy nigga want a witness, stay armed, no biggie
When we get busy, no alarms, just semis
We pour out a little liquor, thug life, straight balling
We cradle to the grave, ride when my homie call
Give a damn if it mean life or death, what's beef?
When somebody gotta die, we gon' march to the street
They said Brenda had a baby but she left it in the alley
One shot that playa hater now we going back to Cali
Hypnotize niggas, I got a story to tell
My ambitions as a rider got me ready to die
And when we ride on, no more pain, we go hard as shit
Why you complaining? And you wonder why we call you bitch
It's an everyday struggle nigga, me and my bitch
It's unbelievable suicidal thoughts you would get
Said fuck me warning and the gun don't blast
Give me the loot, sorry nigga, give me one more chance
You know this shit don't stop, keep these suckers under pressure
Hollerin' only God can judge me shawty, I ain't mad at ya
Got my mind made up, you nigga "can't see me"
A paid thug nigga, that's why shorty wanna be me
See a kid around around in your town kick in your door
I feel like Pac and Biggie, love the dough more than you know

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz, Diddy & The Notorious B.I.G.]
I feel like Pac, I feel like Biggie (Yeah)
I'm feeling like these hating niggas waiting to get me (Come on)
I'm losing my sleep, I'm losing my mind
You know I go hard when it comes to mine
I feel like Pac, Biggie, Pac, B-Biggie

[Outro: Diddy]
Ayo, how you gon' compare yourself to greatness
If you ain't ready to be great man? Ain't no more to it

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]

Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days. You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last, all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Phil made millions, James made millions
Coon went drop top Rarri, no ceiling
I'm just chilling, Omelly even spilling
Like Ace of Spade and Club LIV, we in the building
Pretty hoes too many flows the way I kill em
Give my cousin Tak my Bentley the way I'm feeling
Fuck this money and fuck these hoes
Same gear for a week, I'm like fuck these clothes
Pmon had bricks 'fore you had braces
My whips all black, I guess I'm acting racist
My bitch all bad, she half black and asian
Scream "sa'k pase," I guess I'm acting Haitian
Out in M.I.A with some real zoes
And no lame bitches around us, all real hoes
These niggas rap good but they weirdos
And if they ever disrespect me then it's air holes
They say do for self, that's a word to the third
But if my nigga can't rap I'll buy him a bird
All real estate, fuck it, I'm buying the curb
I buy a crib every week from the hood to the burbs
Making investments with this money I'm blessed with
Nigga tryna snatch my chain, that's a death wish
Riding through my city 57 that's the FN
You ain't never seen a nigga this rich and reckless
You niggas paying hoes just to stick around
Simmer down, Mulsanne how I get around
50 rounds through the town how I whip around
I'm getting richer so you know they wanna sit me down
It's DC, double M, know they hate us
Me and Ross both got rich but we ain't break up
Niggas falling out for the paper but try to make up
For the cameras, niggas might fool y'all but can't fake us
Pull up in the hood I put niggas on jets
Take 'em to Miami when they just was on steps
Selling green and serving fiends up in the 'jects
Packs still on 'em in the pool getting wet
They killed Dame set him on fire
And the crazy part that niggas was quiet
Niggas on obituaries like they flyers
Time is money so it's sky dwellers when we buy 'em
Rolex niggas,stretch like bowflex, nigga
Sellin' Instagram, feds takin' kodak, nigga
I've been rich since 24, you ain't know that, nigga?
And I was taught pay that man if you owe that nigga
Gone...

[Interlude: Meek Mill]
And all this shit I'm talking right now is straight facts
If you're from my hood, you know what I'm talking about

[Verse 2: Spad-O]
Meek what up boy, turn the beat up for me a little bit
Its your man Spade-O, DC, on deck, lets go

This that new philly due op
Who is you op (who are you?)
150 rounds in the o-op
I'm chasing big cheese
1 on 1 you can't get these (nope!)
Embalming fluid mixed with mint leaves
We call it wet wet
My niggas jet set
Were always on the go
Y'all just get set
Meek made millions, so why can't I? (why not?)
Pull up that cranberry Porsche with the slant eyes
I don't get mad, I get motivated
Back to backing in all foreigns we motorcaded
And I don't battle, I respect the war
Pull up that bullet proof caddy with the extra door
Stash box & the extra floor
Rock the world 24 bringing extra whores
Oh yea we about the pound cakes
You crawl snatching niggas ain't been around cakes
Saran wrap around the big blocks
And thats real rap I am hip-hop
You hear me rhyme, you can feel my pain and anguish
I don't do much talking, I speak the language
My crew too live
I'm in my new rise
Success go to the believers, I make my Duas
I'm at the game, in dem' floor seats
You got dem' nose bleed, barely at door seats
Uhh
I'm getting fit for ring
Bezel on my presidential crown fit for a king
DC is like the army, better yet the navy
Niggas, acting shady so i grip my 80
So I, peep the blitz like I'm Tom Brady
I'm the, sure thing & you niggas maybes
Nah, I dont two stroke, I live a bike life
But I move coke, I live the white life
I'm the truth, why i got to lie for?
I was born broke but I won't die poor

[Chorus:]
Extra, extra, read all about it
Soulja Boy is rich, sayin fuck an allowance
Ballin, shot callin, bitches callin
Models, poppin bottles, full throttle
Extra extra read all about
Soulja Boy is rich, screamin fuck an allowance

Swag, Dre, Dre..

Nobody can't tell me that my block wasn't movin
Westside getttin money like I'm always doin
And my flow classic like past tense or ruins
Marble Capcom flo', call me Soulja Akuma
And my third eye open for them boys in blue
You stuck on hatin with the negative glue
Disrespect me, then you know the rumors is sparkin
Drop top in my Jag, I let my swag do the talkin

Jimmy Kimmel: My guest tonight is a 21-time Grammy award winning performer, who last month threatened his very existence by threatening one of America's most beloved television personalities.  We had a big dumb fight on Twitter, but he was nice enough to agree to come and talk about it tonight.  Please welcome Kanye West!

[Kanye enters]

JK:  How are you?

Kanye West:  I'm okay.

JK:  I'm very happy that you came.  I'm glad you did, and I wanted to clear this up.  I really felt bad about all this stuff.  I did.

KW:  Mm-hmm. 

[Laughter]

JK:  I guess the first question I should ask is, who are you wearing?

KW: It's Ralph.

JK: Kramden? Lauren?

JK: Is that a new grill you have there?

KW: Nah they've been in my mouth for three years.
JK: That one on the bottom? OK well it's good to see you.

KW: Good seeing you too.

JK: I guess we should talk about what happened, because I do think that somewhere in you, you want people to understand where you’re coming from is that true?

KW: Yeah, correct.

JK: So we did a sketch on the show where we had - you did an interview  with the BBC Radio and it was an intense interview - and I’ll be honest with you, I only saw a couple of little parts of the 

[Zane Lowe] interview when we did this sketch.

KW: Yeah, that’s what I thought.

JK: In fairness, there was context to it and we took it out of context. And we had a couple of little kids reenact it. Which I didn’t think would be something that bothered you. Do you mind if we show a little clip of it?

Little Kanye: I've reached a point in my life where my Truman Show boat has hit the painting. I'm not trying to regurgitate myself. I'm a product person: not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could think about! Brought the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no! How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants?!

JK: I'm gonna tell you something, the truth is the main reason I did that is because I like to see kids curse. I think it’s funny. (*Kanye laughs*) And I think that some people read into it differently that we were positioning you as a child, but that’s not true. In fact, we’ve done this to other people, with Lady Gaga, with quite a few people that we've had kids say what they said and reenact them. Of course this is not something you knew. And this is not something that people who just watched it online or whatever knew. And you called me. A lot of people think this is some kind of publicity stunt that you and I cooked up. But this isn't, right?

KW: I mean everyone out there in TV world, real world, whatever world you stay in, needs to know that I’ve never done a publicity stunt in my life. Any time I went up and spoke my mind, whether it put my career in jeopardy or whatever someone so called said, it was always what I thought was the truth. Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever I felt emotionally. I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to say. So I don’t do publicity stunts, period. So don’t ever think that.

JK: Me neither guys. (Laughter) So we talked on the phone, and I didn’t really know why you were calling. I heard you were upset. But I didn't know the context, and we had a bad conversation, right?

KW: Yeah, I knew you before. And I saw you at a wedding and I remember you telling me, I want people to know this side of you and different things like this and I saw this good guy at the wedding. So when I saw the skit - which I didn't watch all the way through because I didn't want to be infuriated - I was like I know you. So it was a combination of me knowing you, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad headline on the cover of In Touch. And me not knowing this person. So I was like this is the one person I know. So I can go and let out everything that I feel about every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that people feel is ok to treat celebrities like zoo animals or act like what they're saying is not serious, or their life is not serious or their dreams are not serious. And you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we just had as men… that elevates sometimes, you take a guy, Jimmy does his thing. And I do my thing and at a certain point these egos can flare up and we kind of just took it back to high school for a minute.

JK: And I got beat up a lot in high school, So I didn't wanna go back to high school.
JK: And this is something that to be honest with everyone, this is something that when you're with another celebrity we complain about. This zoo animal, it's a perfect thing, because people online they just want you to click through so they'll put whatever they can put as a headline to get you to click through and it can be damaging and I think people look at you and they go, "this is a guy who’s got millions of dollars, he's got a beautiful wife and a new baby, we can’t possibly hurt this guy." And to be honest, even though I’m in that same position too - I don't have a baby - it’s not something that comes to my mind when I’m cooking up a comedy sketch. And some of these things are hurtful, and the truth is important. And it's... but on the other hand, I will say a lot of times you I think you bring it on yourself, this kind of misunderstanding about you.

I personally found it odd to be in the position that I was in because I often… I don’t know if you know this, a lot of people think you’re a jerk. And I often, in my own personal conversations, say, no, I know this guy, he is not a jerk. In fact I think we have a picture which I happened to see on my Dad's iPad at the wedding and it's you and my Dad 

[*shows a photo of Kanye with Kimmel's dad] - who you may have though was Wolf Blitzer in fairness - but I mean to go to a wedding of a friend of mine and you took a Southwest Airlines flight to that wedding just to make it for this guy who was just a coworker and then to be so nice to everyone there, that tells me a lot about you. Everyone's nice to me when they meet me because they know I have a talk show and almost everyone's on their best behavior. But what I observe is how celebrities behave around other people - how they treat our staff and how they treat in this case my family, and I’ve always said that to people about you. And I think that's important for... I know part of you doesn’t care, I see you onstage saying, "I don’t want to hold your baby, I’ll drop your baby on it’s head…" you know I don’t believe any of that stuff when you say it.

KW: I’m not running for office, I’m just here to make good music, make people feel good when they hear my music. And you know when I did that 

[Zane Lowe] interview, I was really vocal about a lot of things that I've been dealing with over the past 10 years, when I was put in the classification of “just a celebrity.” Because you know for me, I’m a creative genius and there’s no other way to word it. I know you’re not supposed to say that about yourself, and I say things the wrong way a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I wanna bring more things to the world, I want to help the world. I want to make peoples’ lives easier. I spent 2 of my checks in telemarketing when I was 18 years old on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is before there was H&M and Zara, you couldn’t just find cool stuff when you were growing up. And for me, I care about cool stuff. It means something to me, it means stuff to a lot of people that are like me, and that’s what I was talking about on the Zane interview.

So when I come on here, I can laugh and I can joke, and I can see a skit and we can say, ok we love Kanye or we think his baby is cute or whatever, but for me, it’s bigger than who I am and my presence, living. It’s about when I was on Earth what did I do to help? And at what point did I hit a glass ceiling where people said you’re a celebrity so you can’t help in this box, you can’t help in this box. But I talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend’s wedding, and you do music, you can do anything. Once you learn how to produce, you’re a producer, you understand textures and colors. I have an art background even before I was a musician. People told me I couldn’t rap. People had all this advice for me about how I shouldn't try to rap. And I wouldn’t even say I’m a rapper, I’m more of a messenger than a rapper.

So even when you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and keeps re-contexting what I said. Whereas if you look at the Zane interview, it’s really something extremely fearless for someone in my position to do. Because most people just like bow down to TV or bow down to these cameras. Like I could care less about any of these cameras, all I care about is my family, I care about protecting my girl, protecting my baby, and protecting my ideas and my dreams. And ya know that's the reason why I went so crazy.

JK: I wanna go back to one thing you said which is when you say you’re a genius that upsets people, but the truth is a lot people think they’re geniuses, and nobody says it because it’s weird to say it, but it is most certainly more honest to say "I am a genius"…

KW: I’m totally weird, and I’m totally honest, and I’m totally inappropriate sometimes. And the thing is for me to say I wasn’t a genius, I would just be lying to you and to myself.

JK: That's true, it’s false humility.

KW: Oh my god. It comes with your first ticket to LA, soon as you get off the plane, here’s your false humility. Maybe if keep up with this act long enough and go with this agency they'll give you a star on the Walk of Fame one day for kissing everybody's ass. But it's like that's not what we're doing. By the way, I want to shoutout the Walk of Fame,  because they said something like they’re not gonna put my girl on the Walk of Fame because she’s a reality star. It's like people are so so dated and not modern. There’s no way a Kim Kardashian shouldn’t have a star on the Walk of Fame. Its ridiculous old concepts. And you know for me, I’m just gonna give y’all the truth. It’s like my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and my grandmother hated Ali ’til she passed. So you’re gonna love me or you’re gonna hate me, but I’m gonna be me.

[Applause]

JK: Alright, Kanye West is here, more with Kanye when we come back.

[Intro]
I know it's your first
I will try to be gentle
My love....

[Verse 1]
Worst rapper to ever spit on an open mic
Worst rapper to ever get on so many likes
Worst rapper to ever blow up and over night
And when my D swell my D-12 friends, but Obie Trice
Young, black and gifted but he still in America
Heard the flow was gettin' better, is he sleeping with Erykah?
They passing me they demos, these rappers, I think it's funny
Cause they tryna get my demo, young white kids with money
I promise, worst rapper, iTunes most played
It's just me and both Macs, self made, self paid
Headlines saying he leaving to be a rapper
With niggas saying:
"This dummy; he eating off of his acting, I mean
Who the fuck wanna be a rapper, it's stupid, I mean
Who knew that every rapper with a new crew
Wanna do shit on Hulu,"—that's the blueprint
You drive until the lease up
I drive until it's dirty, please somebody call a Brinks truck
Yeah they know me, happy face emoji
That OG, I might OD so Avengers keep it lowkey (Ahh)
Well I'm sitting on top of the world
There's only one second secure
And I can't get it back
My life is a sham, no time to react; breathe
Find solace in the fact my ball bigger
Pause, like dog fingers
Give a fuck 'bout y'all niggas
Get the point like ball kickers
I do shit, eat good, need a toothpick
Your girl play my music
So that's thumbs down to your new shit

[Verse 2]
Buddha stance on a forest on the ayahuasca
I'm as high as copters, binoculars
Looking down on my confidence
Truly honest man, I wish there was more of us freaking out
I wet the bed the first night on my tour bus
God damn, what you doing man?
I can't name a lot of rappers that you better than
He hates women and himself, I won't give him the chance
Tear myself down first to make 'em pay in advance
Heard a lot of y'all talking behind his back
When he walking out
Me and Fam in the corner, what are they talking 'bout?
The same dudes who laughing after you go
Be the same dudes emailing asking you 'bout your show
It's on FX? Tight nigga
Me and my homies making flicks
Me and my homies making beats
Me and my homies making hits
Me and my homies hit the spot, roll with us, gold diggers
I don't really like those niggas, Childish like goldfishes
We saw this kid get shot up by the cops in Atlanta
They shot through his Phantom
And tandem cannons were blamming him
He was standing there like 20 seconds before
Now he gasping for air, bullet holes inside of his dome
What's the point? I don't know
Why am I here? Why am I alive? Why do you care?
Living real everyday, what was your undoing?
Khalifa's first name now there's urine on him (Eww)
Damn 'Bino why you gotta do it to em?
I'm Terio, I'm Terio, my cousin "Ooooh-ahh-Ooh-ing"
New shit, new shit alert, never fake (Ugh)
There's levels to the shit like a wedding cake

[Outro]
My new girl so pretty that the world shine
My new girl getting kissed by the coastline
My new girl so pretty we can bovine
Worst rapper ever, how I'm giving out a cosign?
Chance The Rapper, yeah that nigga crazy
Big brother, little brother lifestyle wavy
Cool, uhhh...
(Are we speaking?)

Kidnapping motherfucker
I can't duct tape a dealer

[Spoken: Lil Wayne]
That's right, you already know what the fuck it is, man. Weezy F. motherfuckin' Baby, bitch. I know you love me man! A nigga hating? Believe that, man. This right here is the Dedication 2, D2! Drama! Dramatic and the Aphilliates, man. I appreciate everything y'all does for me. I'ma do it for y'all, man. Open your motherfuckin' ears, sit back, and watch what I do. That's right! The President, baby! Right now, I ain't doing nothing but getting money, man. I'm just moving, man. I'm loving what we do. I'm Cash Money, Young Money to my heart, man. I can't complain, y'all. I can't complain. I love y'all, man. That's all it's about right now for Lil Weezy, man. I'm just— I'm just being Lil Weezy, man. Weezy Baby, man. So, like I said, man, we gon' get into this shit, man. We gon' do it how we do. Let's go!

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Now see, the first time I realized I was the best rapper alive, you know what I mean? Now, before I go into any further in this conversation, let me let y'all know what I mean about this "best rapper alive" shit. I don't think I'm better than anybody personally. I don't think I'm better than anybody spiritually. Knah'mean? I don't think I'm better than anybody in any way or form or fashion. But as far as this rap thing, I think I am better than everybody. I'm a competitor. I hope everybody else feel the same way about their craft, you know what I mean? If you do, it makes it better for the people. It makes it better for the listeners, dog. And that's how I feel about mine, so, if you're listening and you wanna hear somebody that's dedicated to what they do, I'm so dedicated that I feel I'm the best. And that's that!

["Dedication 2" false start]

[Intro: DJ Drama, Lil Wayne, & Nancy Sinatra sample]
Bang bang, I shot you down
See, I can understand that
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Niggas be saying "Dram', why you talk so much shit on your mixtapes?"
Bang bang, that awful sound
When you're grinding like I'm grinding to get where I'm at
Bang bang
You'll understand
I used to shoot you down
Believe that!
Hahaha! Dedication 2! That's right
And I won't be saying that I'm the best
You already—
But I run this!~

[Verse: Lil Wayne, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
Wake up, motherfuckers, it's Weezy, you got a problem
Hats to them Katrina victims, we still mobbin'
Shiny black coupe, at night, look like a goblin
AK on the backseat, baby, it's so— (Gangsta! Hold up!)

[Spoken: Lil Wayne]
Right now, we're gonna hold the fuck up man. See, y'all niggas ain't playing close attention right now.
Hahaha!
Ayy, Drama, this is what I want you to do, man. This is what I really need you to do right now. My nigga, Drama—plus, he be hitting y'all in the head with that gangsta shit. But listen, my nigga, Drama, man, here's what I need you to do: I need you to give me something else for you now, just to warm 'em up, and then, later on, we gon' hit 'em with that 

[?]. So I hope these motherfuckers ready to get high. So get your pipes! And get your gangsta grills!

[Spoken: Lil Wayne]
Would I ever think about retiring? Uh... I look at retirement, like y— I look at retiring, like, you retire out when you die out, straight up, 'cause you never retire out what you do. You never retire out of what you do, mean—meaning: if you put so much into— if what you do is your life, like mine—you know what I mean? Like, my career is my life. So I could never retire out. Even when I stop rapping, I'm gon' still be, some kind of way or form or fashion, "in it"—you know what I mean? Like, when I die, there's going to be rappers at my funeral—hopefully—you know what I mean? But—you know what I mean? That—That's just how it is. Or, y'all gonna remember that "that nigga was a rapper." But hopefully, I go down for something—known for something different—not "different," but known for something else, also, you know what I mean? But that's what I'm gon' do. It ain't "hopefully." I know what I'm going to do. I'm that nigga, man.

[Spoken: Lil Wayne]
Right now, man, the streets of New Orleans is real fucked up, man. But don't look at it like that, 'cause—I ain't gon' even gon' lie. It— It's so back— It's not back to normal, 'cause it'll never be, but, I mean— It— It's— It's back to a way that— that— that you probably didn't think it would be back to, so—you know what I mean? People are living, people are breathing. But—you know what I mean? That shit still was fucked up, and it's gon' always be fucked up. And people are still fucked up about it, and people are still fucked up over it. And people died, and that's what's real about it, so—you know what I mean? The streets is gon' always be fucked up

[Verse 1: T.I.]
You got a problem, you can get it how you live, pussy nigga
I ain't flexin', it just is what it is, pussy nigga
Get thrown, get shot, get killed, pussy nigga
So what? You got all that money but you still a pussy nigga
You ain't bout that life, you just be actin hard, pussy nigga
Every day I'm sucka duckin, trynna dodge pussy niggas
All we did was slang crack and get paid, pussy nigga
Been the man ever since first grade, pussy nigga
Don't believe me? See me, try me, see what happen, pussy nigga
You be dissin',I be laughin' cause you just rappin', pussy nigga
No matter what, you'll never be me, pussy nigga
And see me, no matter what, I'll never be a pussy nigga

[Hook: T.I.]
I play a lot of games, but I ain't playin', I ain't playin'
They say a lot of things, but they ain't doin' what they sayin'
Don't get it fucked up, them niggas scared not me
Hold up, let me tell these motherfuckers something 'bout me

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Hey when they walk up on me 'Man, what it is, my potna?'
I say nuthin' but Bankhead and Center Hill, my potna
Didn't believe us when we said 'They tried to kill my potna.'
That's why he doin' life, but he still my potna
Better get it back to section, you ain't one of my potnas
Get on your ass for touchin', that ain't one of my potnas
Ask Snoop, I'm the truth, like Trae, my potna
C-Dub, KT, yes they my potnas yo
Young Dro, Mac Boney, Big Kuntry, my potnas
They could talk but they know better than to fuck with my potnas
As a young'n OG told me 'Do your thang, my potna!'
That's why now I'm on everything and Hustle Gang, my potna

[Hook: T.I.]
I play a lot of games, but I ain't playin', I ain't playin'
They say a lot of things, but they ain't doin' what they sayin'
Don't get it fucked up, them niggas scared not me
Hold up, let me tell these motherfuckers something 'bout me

[Verse 3: T.I.]
These niggas talk tough, but they know they don't want it
You see me racked up, it's kinda fucked what you told me
Don't be a fool now, boy I'll leave you where you lay
And I got shooters, ain't no shame, just what they do every day
Back in the day my record wasn't gettin' played
I was trappin', ridin' dirty, gettin' paid
What? Cut the 5 keys in the back
Hey let me tell you niggas something bout that
My cousin Toot was the man, he got his work 'round the base
And how much money he made, nobody know 'til this day
My uncle quit, had the city sold up
He did 10k and back I blowed up
Ey Every man that's statin' 'bout me
At 16 all I wanted was a key
A bank roll, an apartment full of hoes
Hey let me tell you something 'bout me 'case you didn't know didn't know

[Hook: T.I.]
I play a lot of games, but I ain't playin', I ain't playin'
They say a lot of things, but they ain't doin' what they sayin'
Don't get it fucked up, them niggas scared not me
Hold up, let me tell these motherfuckers something 'bout me
I hung myself today. Hanged? Whatever,
the point is I hanged myself today and I’m still
hanging.

I feel fine. Just bored. I keep hoping that
someone will come home and cut me down
but then I keep remembering that if I knew
someone like that I wouldn’t be up here. Bit
ironic, right? Or is that not ironic? I read
somewhere that, like, anything funny is,
in some way, ironic. But I don’t know if it's
funny or not. I don’t think my brain owns
“funny”, you know?

I feel taller. I like that.
I’ve never been away from my shadow for
this long. It had always clung to my feet,
parting momentarily for a quick dive into
the swimming pool. But never for five
hours. I like it. There’s three feet of space
between my two and the floor.
I wanted something this morning. I may be
stuck. But at least I’m three feet closer to it.
Little Ashley hung magazine spreads on her wall,
after picking the magazines out in the mall.
Models and actresses, singers and more,
with cleavage and makeup and glamour galore!

All her heroes were finally nearer.
Her whole room looked perfect — except for the mirror.

Pour the lean so dark, it look like Jack Daniels

I drag a bitch by her hair, captain caveman
15 chains but I’m not a slave, man
Girl you got me real horny but your girlfriend corny
I never ever forced the check but I ride on Forji's
Reroll a vic or two, take a picture boo
And you can do me how you want, you got a Nicki booty
I spill my lean on her ass she got a sticky butt
I need half the deposit back, you got a rental booty
You got on 10 Versace chains that’s something Frenchie do
I got on 15 diamond necklace like Big Meech'll do
I murked the man and beat the charges just like Boosie did
Big diamond rings hang off my finger, Liberace kid
In a black Magnum pullin' up with plenty bails of mid
And if you tell 'em what we did then we’ll kidnap your kid (squad)

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Can you catch a box, ho?

Cargo mill when I'm feeling these smurf
Got a light blue box with blocks in it
And a rose gold watch with rocks in it
And an all-red Bentley with Glocks in it
My hoes love to go shopping
All I'm good at is catching boxes
Got an airport plane cross country
No contraband just hundreds
I'm post the mill and we punched it
Racists drinking them dirty Sunkists
If I had one wish, wish for three wrists
2 Rollies on each that’ll make 6
Send a box so big that she can't lift
And a weed so loud that she can’t keep hiff
Go right now bitch cause your plane here
And I ain’t even gotta know yo real name dude
Caught so many passes last year
She helped me get the Naismith
And she shake that ass at night time
But she catch boxes on day shift

[Hook]
Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch a box, ho?
All I wanna know is
Can you catch a box, ho?
I might send some dope, ho
I might send some smoke, ho
All I wanna know, 'do
Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch a box, ho?
I might send some pints, ho
I might send some blocks, ho
Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch these blocks, ho?

[Verse]
In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl
And never, ever think of counting sheep

[Chorus]
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all
See my eyes can't see clear
Cause their coated in fear
Shut down the left hemisphere
And it sent me here to abort

My intentions of thought
Or of thoughtful cause are no more and no less
See over there
There’s a storm in the west
Before it gets the best of me
This stress will be eased if you undress

But I think no less of your soul
See how it grows cold
I need to evoke before I lose control
Of my emotions

I don't want you to see
Soul drown in the ocean
With my body is spread across the city
You see these eyes
Can’t see my eyes
You see these eyes
Can’t see my eyes
You see these eyes
Girl I can’t see my eyes

Are they open wide
Or shut dead tight
I know you are all fake
Cause man I'm the same
Well burn at me at the stake
Are you content with this game?
Are you content with what you've made?

And when there was days of dark
Were you witness when I was torn apart
By my own hands and my own heart?

Let me tell you girl
There’s no room to leave a mark
See it’s all just fine if you think it’s okay
When in actual fact you think it’s great
What can I say?
What’s there to say?
Well you're brave
So bring the wet wipes I brought the star signs
And we knew that tonight would be just fine
This ain't a sign if you think it’s okay
It’s just divine, but what can I say?

Well you're brave
So bring the wet wipes I brought the star signs
And we knew that tonight would be just fine

I can’t see my eyes
This is no vice
This is no vice
Can’t see my eyes
It’s what was advised
By the love of my life
Bathed in the core of strife
And it was born inside

My urge to purge is so bold
I need the warmth of a brother to hold
I need the warmth of your mother to hold me down
So hold me down
Can you hear that sound?
It came from six feet beneath this ground
Let me lay here
Girl let me lay here
For a little while I’ll obey fear with style
You see these eyes
Man they sense the light
That could be near
Can’t see my eyes
Can’t see my eyes

[Kimmel]
So now, that was funny, right?

[Kanye]
I imagine the skit was probably funny too.

[Kimmel]
It wasn’t that funny, to be honest with you. It was a five, I’d give it. So I do want to ask you one more thing about the tweets because I just want to be clear--bring up that...yeah, that--do you really think I look like SpongeBob?

[Kanye]
It’s the first thing that came to my mind.

[Kimmel]
Where were you when you were writing those tweets. I like to imagine, on the toilet.

[Kanye]
Yeah, that’s when I think of the best shit.

I was just at my place here, my old home here in LA. As we were writing it, there was a frustration I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me as I was writing it, and I just thought it was so amazing that I was saying this in real time, in real life. You know, with my position, people are so scared to say anything, you know, as soon as you’re a celebrity, you’re not to say anything anymore. But just to completely wild out…

The only reason I could do that is because we could speak on a similar level, and we can go back and forth.

[Kimmel]
It was a crazy thing, to see that happen, as far as just the technology, and all of a sudden, everyone in the country knew you and I were having a really dumb fight.

[Kanye]
I just thought that that was amazing, to crack media, in a way. You know, I feel that media does everything they can to break creatives, to break artists, to break people’s spirits, and I do everything I can to break media.

[Kimmel]
From my standpoint, sometimes I’ll think of things and maybe it’s two o’clock in the morning on Saturday night, and my wife will go, “Don’t tweet that. Do not tweet that.” Because people take things out of context, but you just do it, you don’t care.

[Kanye]
You shoulda saw the second set of tweets…

[Kimmel]
Save them for next time.

I do just want to say congratulations on your new baby. In fact, I brought you a little gift. I made fun of this, but there really is such a thing as leather jogging pants, and there’s some tiny little leather jogging pants

[Kanye]
Fashion isn’t always practical. It’s more about emotion, it’s more about swag. It’s more about, you know, pussy. It’s more about, like, club. It’s more about style and stuff.

I remember me and my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision. We sat as interns at Fendi like six years ago. We had cue cards and everything, and the leather jogging pants is one of the things we presented that didn’t go through, and the reason I brought that up in the Zane interview is because there are people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants. It became  a phenomenon over the past three years. And it was to say, you know, I would sit with Hedi Slimane, who’s now the head designer of Saint Laurent, and he’d say, “Stop giving these  big brands your ideas and everything.” And it would just be like, what I was trying to express in the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I’m hip hop, and a rapper and everything--but I’ve got ideas that mean something if I could put the proper production around them. So when do a Nike Yeezy or a Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around it was at the same level as the production on my CD, or when me and Rick Rubin or Mike Dean of whoever are working together. But if I go out and make my own t-shirt or something, and I call it “Kanye,” everybody’s gonna think about when I just called myself a creative genius, and say “What’s so genius about this?” But when people line up for the Yeezy, they’re like, “Oh, wow, this is like really genius.” You need that production.

But currently in fashion and the way the fashion world works, there’s no black guy at the end of the runway in paris, in all honesty. And that’s what I was talking about when the Truman Show hit the boat.

[Kimmel]
What about a Steve Harvey collection?

[Kanye]
Yeah, no. There’s no Steve Harvey collection. No extra buttons on jackets or anything like that.

But for Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson had to fight to get his videos on MTV because he was considered to be “urban.” This is Michael Jackson.

[Kimmel]
That’s true. He was considered a Black artist and was not right for MTV at that time.

[Kanye]
Yeah, a black artist. So, for me, think about this: When I’m in Paris and I’m sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our outfits and all this, or people don’t understand why we’re there, I’m getting called names. Like stuff you can’t even say on TV. And I still can’t break that wall down. At a certain point, it’s like, Michael Jackson trying to get his videos on because, who do you know who’s known more for clothes than me? To not be able to do and produce to the highest level, and to have a meeting with everyone. I’m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy over here, this guy who runs this company, Leanne 

[?].  These are the real people who produce the clothes that are on your back. Zara, out there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone. And everyone just sort of looks at you  like you’re crazy and like you don’t crash the Internet. And you’re just like, “How can you get a shot?” And then you try to do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for a rapper, and you just cannot overcome it.

I mean, my grandfather drove the first cars in the marches just to get clean water, and one of the parallels  I wanted to do for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to always talk about, he just wanted a clean plate. He just wanted to serve his stuff on a clean plate.  So if I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they take all these classist shots at me because--it’s not about racism anymore; it’s classism, that’s what I talked about.

Paula Deen, she was old-school with it. They’re like, “We don’t do it like that anymore, Paula Deen. We’re classist now.” So this classism is what they do to try to say, “You’re a rapper,” or “Your girl’s on a reality show. You’re not up here with us. You know, we’re old money, we--

[Kimmel]
It’s snobbery--

[Kanye]
It’s snobbery. And I’m not into all that snobbery. Because, you know what? We have the loudest voice, we have the loudest communication, and all we want to do is make awesome stuff. All we want is a real shot.  Not: OK, I’m a celebrity, so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t-shirt. No, I understand about quality. I understand about fabrics. I spent ten thousand hours at this. I’ve dedicated my life to this. And a lot of people say, “OK, you have to do music.” I’m gonna keep doing music, but what if people told me I couldn’t rap, what woulda happened? What if people told me I couldn’t perform. I’m only 36 years old; I have other goals and other things.  And I’m gonna use my platform,  every platform, to stand up and say, “I want to make something, I want to make the next Ralph Lauren.” That was the point of the Zane interview, to say, people don’t stand up to protect their dreams. People are too scared of getting, you know, spoofed in a way. 

[Turns to Kimmel]

And the irony of it is, think about a creative person in school. When you picture them, you’re probably picturing them all the way in the back of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I’m the one creative, and this is the reason why I did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there’s moments when I stood up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, “You can’t have my publishing. Come and kill me. Do whatever you’re gonna do, but you’re not going to bully me, you’re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.” No matter how many people tell me, “Stop believing in yourself! Stop seeing what you can do! Stop affirming what you’re gonna do and then completing that in real life.” That’s the improper way to do it. I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and the way they control people  with low self-esteem. With improper information, with branding, with marketing… I refuse to follow those rules.

It’s about truth, it’s about information, it’s about awesomeness, and the only luxury is time. The time you spend with your family, that’s the only luxury. So this concept of “luxury” is improper to me. You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! Somebody pull out a Vertu phone right now, you look ridiculous, but there’s people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this to say, “Oh, we’re better than you.” I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, just the quality of your life. This is what I’m here to do, so  when I compare myself to Steve Jobs or Walt Disney, Howard Hughes, David Stern, Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Jesus of whatever it is, I’m saying, “These are my heroes. These are people I look up to. This is the type of impact I want to make on the earth.” If I can make this type of impact up to this point, what can I do, if you call Bob Iger and say, “Yo, give him a shot.” If you call Oprah and say, “Yo, back this kid. This kid, his parents were educators. He wants to educate. He wants to look at curriculums and say, ‘How do we simplify that?’”

Exactly what I did in music, I want to apply to product, I want to apply to education. This is what my company Donda is about. I could rap all I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain. I don’t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn’t have made it to the point to make “Jesus Walks.” And now, even as a celebrity,  I’ve reached a ceiling. And the way paparazzi talk to me and my family is disrespectful, also. We bring something of joy to the world. When people hear my music they have a good time. And I should be respected as such when I walk down the street. Don’t ask me a question about something you say in a tabloid. Don’t try to antagonize me. Cause, you know what, it’s not safe for you in this zoo. Never think that I’m not from Chicago for one second. And think you can walk right up and disrespect me and my family constantly.
And people say, “Well, you signed up to be a celebrity, blah blah blah…” It’s like, you know what, and I understand paparazzi, you gotta get your money, it’s hard out here, but let’s have respect for each other. You do help me get money, paparazzi,  you show people how fresh my outfit is, that helps me influence people.

[Kimmel]
But when they show up at your house in the middle of the night, and your wife and your daughter are there, there’s no human decency there.

[Kanye]
It’s a lack of decency.

[Kimmel]
Kanye West, everybody.

[Hook: Lil Wayne] x2

[Hook]

[Outro]
You see I hope your math is right
Take ya body as a sacrifice
You see them flashing lights
Welcome to afterlife

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah
Tryna figure out the difference
But I think—think the lines are starting to get blurred

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimmin' every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
‘Cause I'm mentally rearrangin' his face
I need a change of pace
‘Cause the pace I'm workin' at's dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger, and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey
And started slowly roastin' 'em
‘Cause that's where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings
I feel like I play for the Saints
I just wanna hurt you—aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes, Jays, Waynes, and the Drakes
I'm frustrated ‘cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm goin' all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is, I'm strapped for battle
Suck a duck, crawl out the back—it's a bar fight
Prepare your arsenal
And beware of bar stools flyin' through the air and bottles breakin', mirrors also
And I ain't stoppin' 'til the swear jar's full
"You done called every woman a slut but you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall" (Palin)
Oh, my bad, slut! And next time I show up to court
I'll be naked and just wear a law suit
Judge be like, "That's sharp
How much that motherfucker cost you, smart-ass?
You're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker!
You're so fuckin' gravy, Marshall, I should start callin' you 'au jus'
‘Cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo"
Evil Twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change but only for the worse
I coulda changed the world if it wasn't for this verse—so satanic
K-Mart chains panic ‘cause they can't even spin back the curse words
‘Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker
Rekcufrehtom! (Rape your mother)— Tihs! (Kill your parents)
And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screamin', "Fuck! Shit! Fuck!"
Adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out, I was like, "Merits?
Fuck that! I'd rather be loud, and I like swearin'"
From the first album even the gals were like, "Tight lyrics, dreamy eyes!"
But my fuckin' mouth was nightmarish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches to make sure I keep up with my competition (Haha)
Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first, then ignore the replies

[Hook: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
There's darkness closing in (Evil twin), there it goes again (My evil twin)
It controls my pen (My evil twin), but that ain't me, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
But he's just a friend (Evil twin) who pops up now and again (Evil twin)
So don't blame me (Evil twin), blame him, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)

[Interlude]
Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber?
Nah, F with Christina
I ain't fuckin' with either Jessica neither: Simpson or Alba
My album's just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve, or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3s
Feel like I'm burnin' to death, but I'm freezin'
Bedridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again, like the legend of Heath-uh-
Ledger
My suicide note's barely legible; read the
Bottom, it's signed by the Joker
Lorena said I never can leave her
She'll sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit, bitch! Give up my dick for pussy?
I'll be Jerry Mathers I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off tryna mess with a cleaver
Golly wolly, I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 19946 Dresden it was definitely in my destiny
When on the steps, I met DeShaun at Osborn
I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap
Used to mop floors, flip burgers, and wash dishes
While I wrote rhymes, tryna get props for 'em
‘Cause I took book smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleepin', I made 'em stop snorin'
Made 'em break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip hop in its tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blarin' through my car windows
Leanin' on the horn, screamin', "Fuck the police," like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin
So who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spot's for?
And crazy as I am, I'm much tamer than him, and I'm nuts
Then again, who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (Evil grin)
(Evil twin) please come in; what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear, and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney
Jeez, just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
‘Cause I'm so sick of bein' the truth
I wish someone'd finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh, LMFAO, no way, Jo-
-se Baez couldn't beat this rap—O.J., no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, hey ho (Hey ho!)
I sound like I'm tryna sing the fuckin' chorus to "Hip Hop Hooray"
No, I’m hollerin', you got bottom-end like an 8-0-8
And I (base) whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face so
Let your low-end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho? Slow dancin' or bowling?
You tryin' to hold hands with your homie?
What, you think I'm lookin' for romance ‘cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke, so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke ‘cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
‘Cause we are the same
Bitch
Part 1: Produced by S1 and M-Phazes

[Verse 1]
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it, reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryna soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
The way that you turned your back on me just when I may have needed you most—oh, you thought it was over?
You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing
You ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight I bet you that what you're
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges?
Mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this!"
Heart's saying, "I will, once I bury this bitch alive, hide the shovel
And then drive of in the sunset."

[Chorus: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth
But it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 2]
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think ‘cause he's been out the picture so long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And, gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on ya
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh

[Chorus: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth
But it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 3]
I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like nine frickin' hours and forty-five minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waitin' on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm duckin' on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential—I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat
You can have that shit back ‘cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in a car right now—wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die."
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!
Last album now ‘cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck, the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear?
Guess ninety on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: "Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!
Part 2: Produced by StreetRunner

[Verse 4]
I also represent
Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closin' in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stackin' up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talkin' a lot of shit but I'm backin' it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal cords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered comin' back on ya
Every woman you insult, batter, but the double-standard you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowin' what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case better make sure you're packing a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back
'Fore it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured, trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark
Uh, as we pick up where the last Mathers left off

[Teller]
Don't kill me!

[Eminem]
Hurry the fuck up! 
(Shoots the teller)
Thank you! 
(Running)
Go, go, go! What the... fuck? The fuck did he go?
Mothafucka bail on me? Fuck you!
*Car stops working*
Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding me!
Are you fucking kidding me? Shit! 
(Running)
(Climbs a fence)
Get off! 
(Shoots a dog)
Ha-ha! 
(Sirens)
Parking lot! Shit, ah!

[Officer]
Let me see your hands, bend over!

[Eminem]
Ah, fuck it!
(Shoots himself)

[Intro: Sample + Eminem]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
("What's your name?") Marshall
("Who's your daddy?") I don't have one

[Verse 1]
My mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle, then crashed in
The side of loco-motive with rap, I'm
Loco, it's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'Bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap, "In a spasm
Your music usually has 'em
But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't
Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan."
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and
Thoughts are entertainin'
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seein' eye dog
Can't even find the page I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on the ram-page
Couldn't see what I wrote, I write small
It says, "Ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with whitewalls
Had a fire in my heart
And a dire desire to aspire to Die Hard."
So as long as I'm on the clock, punching this time card
Hip-hop ain't dying on my watch

[Chorus]
Now sometimes when I'm sleepin'
She comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine?
Don't got time, don't care, don't have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand to promised land
And threaten everyone
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

[Post-Chorus: Sample + Eminem]
("Now, what's your name?") Marshall
("Who's your daddy?") I don’t know him, but I wonder—
("Is he rich like me?") Ha
("Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?")

[Verse 2]
No, if he had
He wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad
Yeah, Dad, I'm the epitome and the prime
Example of what happens when the power of the rhyme
Falls into the wrong hands and
Makes you want to get up and start dancin'
Even if it is Charles Manson
Who just happens to be rappin', blue lights flashin'
Laughin' all the way to the bank, lampin' in my K-Mart mansion
I’m in the style department
With a pile in my cart, rippin' the aisle apart but
With great power comes
Absolutely no responsibility for content
Completely despondent and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy is on a
Beat-killing spree, Your Honor
I must plead guilty, 'cause I sparked a revolution
Rebel without a cause who caused the evolution
Of rap, to take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
("Hip-hop is the Devil's music")
Does that mean it belongs to me?
'Cause I just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you hear a beep
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, 'cause it's the—

[Chorus]
It's the time of the season
When hate runs high
And this time, I won't give it to you easy
When I take back what's mine
With pleasured hands
And torture everyone, that is my plan
My job here isn't done
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

[Post-Chorus: Sample + Eminem]
("What's your name?") Shady
("Who's your daddy?") I don’t give a fuck, but I wonder
("Is he rich like me?") Doubt it, ha
("Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?")

[Verse 3]
So, yeah, Dad—let's walk
Let's have us a father-and-son talk
But I bet we wouldn't probably get one block
Without me knocking your block off, this is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm so bananas I a-ppealed to all those walks
Of life, whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'Cause I related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're rippin' out their fuckin' hair again, it's hysterical
I chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Yeah, uh-oh, better beware, knuckle heads!
The sign of my hustle says:
"Don't knock”, the door's broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold-cocked
You critics come to pay me a visit?
Misery loves company, please stay a minute!
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy gettin' stoned in your glass house
To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out
Mr. Mathers as advertised on the flyers, so spread the word
'Cause I'm promoting my passion 'til I'm passed out
Completely brain-dead: Rain Man
Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair
So, bitch, shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas
I'm angrier than all eight other reindeer
Put together with Chief Keef 'cause I hate every fuckin' thang, yeah
Even this rhyme, bitch
And quit tryin' look for a fuckin' reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a "Criminal!"
Ten-year-old degenerate grabbin' on my genitals!
The last Mathers LP done went diamond
This time I'm predicting that this one will go emerald! (Hehe)
When will the madness end?
How can it when there's no method to the pad and pen?
The only message that I have to send
Is: "Dad, I'm back at it again!"

[Outro]
Bitch… (Who's your daddy?)

[Intro]
You fuckin' groupie
Pick up the goddamn phone

[Verse 1]
Bitch, where the fuck were you Tuesday? With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio, bitch, what'd you do? Screw Dre?
You went there lookin' for me? Boo, that excuse is too lame
Keep playin' me, you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg
You fake, lyin' slut, you never told me you knew Drake
And Lupe? You wanna loose two legs?
You tryin' to flip this on me? If I spent more time with you, you say
"Okay, yeah, and I'm coo-coo, eh?" — Well, screw you
And I'll be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, fourth—Dre, Drake, Lupe—oohm, touché
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one true-blue ace
But you ain't and I can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face
'Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo, you make my fuckin' Bluetooth ache
You're feeling blue? Too late, go smurf yourself
You make me wanna smurf and puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead?
I would feel so much, much better

[Verse 2]
Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway tryna get some time alone and just think
'Til the cops pulled me over, but they let me go, 'cause I told 'em
I'm only drivin' drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck hoes, with a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby, come on!
Excuse the pun, but bitch is such a broad statement, and I'm
Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on!
'Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say, "he-art"
'Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts and threw it in the garbage
Who do you think you a-are? Bitch, guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again
I lo-lo-lo-lo… lesbian!
Aaahhh! I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, my life'd be so much better if you just—

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead?
I would feel so much, much better

[Bridge]
'Cause you told me
You'd love me
Forever
Bitch, that was a lie
Now I never
Wanted someone to die
So bad in my fuckin' life
But fuck it, there’s other fish in the sea

[Verse 3]
And I'ma have a whale of a time
Bein' a single sailor for the night, bitch, on a scale of
One to ten, shit, I must be the Holy Grail of
Catches, ho, I got an Oscar attached to my fuckin' name (De La)
I might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor-made
For me, say fuck it, kick some shots back, get hammered, and nail her
These bitches tryin' to get attached, but they're failin' to latch onto the tail of
My bumper, they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah, I'm rich as a bitch
But bitches ain't shit, I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch, you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me: that's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swingin' at this chicks on-site
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul, but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void, bitch, I'm a droid
I avoid Cupid, stupid! Wasn't for blow jobs, you'd be unemployed
Oye-yoy-yoy, man-oh-man, your boy-boy-boy's
Gettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink-oink-oink
You fuckin' pigs, all you're good for is doink-doink-doink
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of 'em, I need a machine gun
I'll take 'em all out, I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack and just
Drop dead, and I'ma throw a fuckin' party after this, 'cause yes

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead (I hate you)
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head (You made me like this way)
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead? (Bitch)
I would feel so much, much better

[Outro]
I'm just playin', bitch
You know I love you

[Intro: Polina]
Tell me where to go
Tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say
No matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid
That would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
‘Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often
Flyin' off at the handle at my mom
No dad, so I am noncompliant at home
At school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems
Thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalkin' up drawings
On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
To myself, either that or inside hidin' off in
The corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to
Be noticed ‘cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
‘Cause he said that I eye-balled him

[Pre-Chorus: Polina]
And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from all the wars
That are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words

[Chorus: Polina]
‘Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
‘Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'
‘Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit
Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I don’t give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit, look on the bright side, at least I ain't walkin'
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'?
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him
Grab hold of my balls, like, "That's right, fight's on, bitch!"
Who woulda knew, from the moment I turned the mic on, that
I could be iconic in my conquest?
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest

[Chorus: Polina]
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
‘Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
‘Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
Now you shut up, bitch, I am talkin'
Thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins
‘Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers
You're gon' die a ball-licker, I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind, y'all can
Suck a dick; the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flyin' saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exaltin' and I ain't haltin'
'Til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, and I'm the Fire Marshall, and this is my—

[Chorus: Polina]
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped
To think that I was speakin' to children
Everything was happenin' so fast
It was like I blinked—sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous
‘Cause I was gettin' sick of this feelin'
Like I'm always under attack, man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really thinkin': "If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him."
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many people ever give a shit
What I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawin' more attention toward it
‘Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, I'd just zone out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
It's like tellin' Gwen Stefani she sold out
‘Cause I was tryna leave no doubt
In anyone's mind, one day I'd go down in history
Think they know now because everybody knows

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

[Interlude: Eminem]
Thanks for the support, asshole! *scratch*
Thanks for the support, asshole!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he roundabout
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, well goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhandin' a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck's all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my belt—word to Pacquiao
Momma said, "There ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out!"
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo
My soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm takin' no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changin' back into that old maniac
In fact, there they go tryna dip out the back door retreatin'
‘Cause everybody knows

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed, "ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin' magnets work?"
‘Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm makin' up words so you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
‘Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet
‘Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
‘Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
‘Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
‘Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
But sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father
And I push it farther
So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
And motherfuck father time
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist
Who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half-alive
Poured my half-empty glass in a cup
Now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
I’m goin' back to what got me here
Yeah, cocky, and can’t knock bein' rude off, so fear not, my dear
And dry up your teardrops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

[Intro]
"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings"
"But I'm only going to get this one chance" (Six minutes— Six minutes—)
"Something's wrong, I can feel it" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
"Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances"
"You are just what the doc ordered"

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!"—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?

[Interlude]
"Or Eminem has a full line of chainsaws
"Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem
Eminem, Eminem"
"Marshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper Eminem"
"Who can say for sure?
Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science could operate on this distorted brain
And put it to good use, society would reap a great benefit"

[Verse 1]
I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of Tourettes
Fuck, fuck, fuck, can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors' hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up, bitches, with these hedge-trimmin' scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this mess
And make the best of this situation, I guess
'Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's
Despicable, I'm sick of just gettin' pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a frickin' wuss, a pussy
This kid just took my stick of licorice
And threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was twelve and was six foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell, I got back up, all I did was book
Now there's usin' your head, momma always said

[Chorus]
"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous" (I'ma prove you wrong)
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus (I'ma be the bomb)
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Momma always said)
"Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Verse 2]
Fast forward some years later, a teenager; this is fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished
They've stomped me into the mud, gee
For what reason you stumped me?
But how do you get the shit beat out of you, beat down
And be upbeat when you don't have nothing?
No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed
'Cause you're doomed from the start
It's like you grew up on Jump Street, from jump street
But if I could just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task, practicin' trash-talkin' in a trance
Locked in my room, yeah, but I got some plans, momma
These damn rhymes are fallin' out of my pants pocket, I can't stop it!
And I'm startin' to blend in more, in school this shit helps for sure
I'm gettin' more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore
I done put a stop to that, threw my first punch, end of story
Still, in my skull’s a vacant empty void, been usin' it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory: in this gourd, there's a Ford engine, door
Hinge, syringe, an orange, an extension cord, and a ninja sword
Not to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored
Ironin' board, a bench, a wrench, a ore winch, an attention whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fuckin' chain
Like an independent store, something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't
'Cause I'd probably be Dahmer, 'cause Momma always said

[Chorus]
"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous" (I'ma prove you wrong)
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus (I'ma be the bomb)
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Momma always said)
"Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Bridge]
Now my mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm
'Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb
I was on the bottom of the pile, gettin' stomped
But somehow I came out on top

[Verse 3]
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, y'all, fuck it, I'm out cold, now everywhere I go
They scream out, "Go!", I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell-outs, freak the hell out Middle America
Hear 'em yell out in terror, they were so scared, and those kids
Just about belted out whatever spouted
Or fell out my smart aleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate? So be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Motherfuckin' difficult, yeah
'Til then, hopefully you little homos get over your fears and phobias
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers
'Til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's
A stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You motherfuckin'— insert insult here
Who the fuck woulda thunk that one little ole MC'd
Be able to take the whole culture and reupholster it?
And boy, they did flock; can't believe this little hick locked
This hip-hop shit in his hip pocket, and still the shit got
That white-trash traffic in gridlock, shit hoppin' like six blocks
From a Kid Rock/Insane Clown Posse concert in mid-Oc-
-tober, and God forbid I see a wizard
And get a brain in my titanium cranium, y'all
'Cause I'll turn into the Unabomber, Momma always said—

[Chorus]
"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous" (I'ma prove you wrong)
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus (I'ma be the bomb)
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Momma always said)
"Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Outro]
"Insaneness" ain't even a word, you stupid fuck!
Neither is "ain't"

[Verse 1]
You used to say that I'd never be
Nothin' without you, and I'd believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze
And you'd laugh, and you'd tease
You're just fucking with me, and you must hate me
Why do you date me, if you say I make you sick
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge

[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Verse 2]
A beautiful face is all that you have
‘Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothin', nothin' for me
So, please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead

[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Verse 3]
You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide
That you caused, ‘cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde
Nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
‘Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
It's like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer!
‘Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left
And left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda had and we coulda been
But I'm breakin' out of this slump I'm in
Pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
I'm gettin' up once and for all—fuck this shit!
I'ma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin' punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So don't lump me in with them chump-ions
I'm done bein' your punching bag
It was the November 31st today
Woulda been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
But couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now—so I put 'em in a verse to lay

[Bridge]
And I thank you (Uh), ‘cause you made me (Uh)
A better person than I was
But I hate you (Uh), ‘cause you drained me (Uh)
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me (Uh), you're crazy (Uh)
And after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone

[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Intro: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Bridge: Rihanna & (Eminem)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
(Get along with) Get along with the voices inside of my head
(You're tryin' to) You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
(And you think) And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'

[Outro: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Intro: Eminem]
I own a mansion but live in a house
A king-size bed but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr. Brightside, glass is half-full
But my tank's half empty, gasket just blew

[Verse 1: Eminem]
This always happens
Thirty minutes from home, gotta lay a log cabin
Only option I have's McDonalds's bathroom
In a public stall, droppin' a football
So every time someone walks in the john, I get maddened
"Shady, what up?" What? Come on, man, I'm crappin'
And you're askin' for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?
Oh, that's odd, I just happened to run out of tissue
Yeah, hand me that, on second thought I'd be glad then
"Thanks, dawg! Name's Todd, a big fan"
I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and
Told him: "Todd, you're the shit," when's all of this crap end?
Can't pump my gas without causin' an accident
Pump my gas, cut my grass, I can't take out the fuckin' trash
Without someone passin' through my sub, harassin'
I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow than bask sufferin' succotash
But the ant-acid, it gives my stomach gas
When I mix my corn with my fuckin' mashed
Potatoes, so what? Ho, kiss my country bumpkin ass
Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is upper class?
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
Tupperware in the cupboard, plasticware up the ass
Stuck in the past—iPod, what the fuck is that?
B-Boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass

[Chorus: Eminem & Joe Walsh]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me
And (Life's been good to me so far)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
They call me classless, I heard that, I second and third that
Don't know what the fuck I'd be doin' if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned 40 and still sag—teenagers act more fuckin' mature, Jack
Fuck you gonna say to me? I'll leave on my own terms, asshole
I'm goin' berzerk, my nerves are bad
But I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people, look at her dag
Her nylons are ran, her skirt's snagged
And I heard she drag-races, *burp* swag
Tuck in my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick (Yeah?) word, skag
We'd be the perfect match
'Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies, no disrespect to technology
But what the heck's all of these buttons?
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?
Be an expert at computers?
I'd rather be an Encyclopedia Britannica, hell with
PlayStation, I'm still on my first man on some Zelda
Nintendo, bitch! Run, jump, punch, stab, and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti
Put in on bread, make a sandwich with Welch's, and belch
They say this spray butter's bad for my health, but
I think this poor white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett, Fred Sanford, and welfare
Mentality helps to keep me grounded
That's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I
Managed to dwell within these parameters
Still crammin' the shelves full of Hamburger Helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt, a
Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves, goddamn it, to hell, I
Can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I could yell, the
Other day, someone got all elaborate
And stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King—they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma's catchin' up with me

[Chorus: Eminem & Joe Walsh]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me
And (Life's been good to me so far)

[Bridge: Eminem]
Got friends on Facebook all over the world
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
So I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm tryin' to be low-key, hopefully nobody notices me
In produce, hunched over, giant nosebleed
Ogre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle
By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova
The show's over, I'm hidin' in Kroger, buyin' groceries
He just had front-row seats
Told me to sign this poster, then insults me
"Wow! Up close didn't know you had crow's feet!"
I'm at a crossroads, lost, still shoppin' at Costco's
Sloppy Joe's, bulk waffles
Got caught pickin' my nose (Agh!)
Look over, see these two hot hoes
Finger still up one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em, stuck at the light, the fuckin' shit's
Takin' forever to change, it's stuck, these bitches are lovin' it
Rubbin' it in, chucklin', couldn't do nothin'
Play it off, "What you bumpin'?"
"Trunk Muzik, Yelawolf's better," fuckin' bitch!
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up with
Another one, after Recovery was so highly coveted
But what good is a fuckin' recovery if I fumble it?
'Cause I'ma drop the ball if I don't get a grip
Hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivision to fuck with, bitch
Quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids
I love my city, but you pushed me to the limit—what a pity!
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's rainin' out
Kool-Aid stain on the couch, I'll never get it out
But bitch, I got an elevator in my house
Ants and a mouse—I'm livin' the dream!

[Chorus: Eminem & Joe Walsh]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me
And (Life's been good to me so far)

[Intro: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
"Cleanin' Out My Closet" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's fifteen degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, "Little prick, just leave!"
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight-years-old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 2: Eminem]
‘Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Mama, for "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it, though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, this shit is painful, though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left, I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Bridge: Nate Ruess & Eminem]
I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life

[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
Yeah, yeah
Let me see your hands in the air
Yeah, yeah (Oh)

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I remember dreaming 'bout the things I do right now (Right now)
Like I climbed onto a cloud, scared to look back down
I remember when I was all alone (All alone)
Nobody 'round to hold me down (Hold me down)
But now, you're here with me tonight
Look at what you found

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I was lonely for some time
Now it's only you and I
I won't live without your love tonight, tonight

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm dancing to the sound of my words in the crowd
Too high to come down
So let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
It's go hard or go home, and it ain't no looking back
My toughest enemy's in the mirror
Would you look at that?
I'm top five, dead or alive, one of the best to rhyme
And if I ever take a seat, I stood the test of time
Every verse, every song, every feature I was on, better know that I abused it
If I die before my time, I'll still be living through my music
I cracked the industry open, but still got this shit on lock
Even on the highway up to Heaven, Luda still will be on top (Hey)

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm dancing to the sound of my words in the crowd
Too high to come down
So let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm dancing to the sound of my words in the crowd
Too high to come down
So let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air

[Chorus: Kesha]
It's goin' down, I'm yellin' timber

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
This biggity boy's a diggity dog
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking in their bras and thongs (Timber)
Face down, booty up (Timber)
That's the way we like the what (Timber)
I'm slicker than an oil spill
She say she won't, but I bet she will (Timber)

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull & Kesha]
Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's goin' down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's goin' down
Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's goin' down (Oh-oh-oh)
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's goin' down

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird? It's a plane?
Nah, it's just me, ain't a damn thing changed
Live in hotels, swing on planes
Blessed to say, money ain't a thing
Club jumping like LeBron, now Voli
Order me another round, homie
We about to climb, why?
'Cause it's about to go down

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull with Kesha & Kesha]
Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's goin' down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's goin' down
Swing your partner 'round and 'round

[Verse 1]

Every day thinking 'bout how we get through
Everything I own is on IOU
But I'm here bringing you something new
You no like the people, they no like you
Then they gonna set it off with a big boom
Son in a battle, is a son and battle too
Why you wanna talk about who done who?
Why you wanna talk about—

[Chorus 2]
Sleng teng, that's that M.I.A. thang
I got the bombs to make you blow

Sleng teng, that's that M.I.A. thang

Get with it
Get with it
Get with it

Got beats that are boomin' to keep the crowd movin'
'Cause this administration needs some removin'
Since 9/11, got war on the brain
This U.S. nation needs show restraint

Oh, no way, what’s that, you say?
The U.N. don't mean nothin' to the U.S.A.?
Oh, no way, what’s that you heard?
Bush is makin' money off of the oil, word?

Never ending government spendin'
All for weapons of war, they keep on spendin' more
Trouble believing, all this deceiving
Is it really freedom that we're fighting for?

This government needs a tune up
This government needs a tune up
This government needs a tune up
This government needs a tune up
Imagine public healthcare, public housing
Public help without the religious founding
Imagine that, well, it could happen yet
And we can make it happen, it's a bet

Now I'm not trying to say I hate the U.S.A
I'd live somewhere else if I felt that way
But go back to the fifty's, if you think it's all nifty
This president is acting mad-shifty

FBI and the cops keep all filing
Who protest the war and who they're dialing
So be careful what you say up on the internet
We got a nosy government that won't forget

This government needs a tune up
This government needs a tune up
This government needs a tune up
This government needs a tune up
This government needs a tune up
This government needs a tune up

Need a little democratic socialism
Eassssse up on the capitalism
Eassssse up on the militarism
Ease up on the campaign finance schism
The next thing they'll want is abortion deaded
If you're not straight, white, and married, it's dreaded
Forget it, you know what they say, if you,re gay
You're not a real member of society

If you're with me say, What is this?
Our government's being run by big business
Wrecking shop, so let's fix this
Come on somebody and get with this

This government needs a tune up
This government needs a tune up
This government needs a tune up
This government needs a tune up

Get with it
Get with it
Get with it
Get with it
Get with it

[Verse 1]
Respected blends
Hopping out the 87 Benz
No pendent
Plus I’ve always been defendant
Never Plaintiff
Shorty crying at arraignment
This Jamie Lee Blue Steel what I'm aimin'
Queens to the death
Lean to the left
Walk in the kitchen? Meet and greets with the chef
I’m like a baby cause I sleep on the breast
But still fuck around throw the heat to your chest
Million dollar raps, million dollar beats
Five dollar dimes
Young Harvard minds
Yale in the spring
Bali in the summer
See me through the window like Batali in the Hummer
Sharp at the feet
Morimoto knife set
Young Cordell coming through the portal
Terry Gene Bollea motherfuckers are immortal
You in the corner looking floral

[Verse 2]
The New Yorker
Heavy body smooth talker
Stand in the foyer
Portraits of my yiddish lawyer
British walker
Presence like I’m Connery
You wanna die well swing
Knees like Olden Polynice
My shorty Polynesian don’t make no apologies
And when I’m rich I’ll probably join the Scientology
Three hookers
Street gynecology
Edward Scissors my existence is anomaly
Smoke the chronic, chronically
Bronson Chronicles
You ain’t really fucking with me honestly
Sonically we fuckin boom shit
Just be smooth kid or catch a fucking raping with the broom stick

[Verse 1]
I wish I was smarter
I got so lost on the shore
I wish I was taller
Things really matter to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But I put my face in tomorrow
I believe we're not alone
I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown

[Chorus]
And I'm still so afraid
Yeah, I'm still so afraid
Yeah, I'm still so afraid
On my own
On my own

[Verse 2]
What made my life so wonderful?
What made me feel so bad?
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds

[Pre-Chorus]
If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile
If I can talk on television
If I can walk an empty mile

[Chorus]
And I won't feel afraid
No I won't feel afraid
I won't be, be afraid anymore

[Outro]
Anymore
(And then I just won't be afraid)
Anymore
(And then I just won't be afraid)

[Intro]
He's a fairy feller

[Verse 1]
Ah, ah, the fairy folk have gathered
Round the new-moon shine
To see the feller crack a nut
At night's noon-time
To swing his axe he swears
As he climbs he dares
To deliver the master stroke

[Verse 2]
Ploughman, "Waggoner Will", and types
Politician with senatorial pipe
He's a dilly-dally-o
Pedagogue squinting, wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown
Dirty fellow, what a dirty laddio
Tatterdemalion and the junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter
He's my hero
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
(Can we see the master stroke)
What a quaere fellow

[Bridge]
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

[Bridge]
Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch-magician presides
He is the leader

[Verse 3]
Oberon and Titania
Watched by a harridan
Mab is the queen
And there's a good apothecary-man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
What a quaere fellow

[Outro]
The ostler stares
With hands on his knees
Come on Mr. Feller
Crack it open if you please

[Transition into Nevermore]

[Intro]
Nothing remains
We could run when the rain slows
Look for the cars or signs of life
Where the heat goes

[Verse]
Look for the drifters
We should crawl under the bracken
Look for the shafts of light on the road
Where the heat goes
Everything has changed
For in truth it's the beginning of nothing
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
For in truth it's the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed

(In your fear)
In your fear
(Seek only peace)
Of what we have become
(In your fear, seek only love)
Take to the fire
(In your fear)
Now we must burn
(Seek only peace)
All that we are
(In your fear, seek only love)
Rise together
(In your fear)
Through these clouds
(In your fear)
As on wings
This is the trip
And this the business we take
This is our number
All my trials
Lord, will be remembered

[Outro]
Everything has changed

[Verse 1]
Rocket number nine take off to the planet, to the planet (Venus)
Aphrodite lady seashell bikini, garden panty (Venus)
Let’s blast off to a new dimension, in your bedroom (Venus)
Aphrodite lady seashell bikini, get with me (Venus)

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't help the way I’m feeling
Goddess of love, please take me to your leader
I can't help, I keep on dancing
Goddess of love, goddess of love
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your leader (To the planet)
Your leader, your leader (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your Venus (To the planet)
Your Venus, Your Venus (To the planet)

[Chorus]
When you touch me I die just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Cause you're out of this world, galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love (Venus)

[Verse 2]
Have an oyster, baby, it's Aphrod-ishy, act sleazy (Venus)
Worship to the land, a girl from the planet, to the planet
(To the planet)

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't help the way I’m feeling
Goddess of love, please take me to your leader
I can't help, I keep on dancing
Goddess of love, goddess of love
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your leader (To the planet)
Your leader, your leader (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your Venus (To the planet)
Your Venus, Your Venus (To the planet)

[Chorus]
When you touch me, I die just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Cause you're out of this world, galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love

[Post-Chorus]
Wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Goddess of love, wonder if this could be love (Venus)

[Bridge]
Neptune, go
Now serve Pluto!
Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury, Venus (Uh-huh)
Uranus, don’t you know my ass is famous?
Mars, now serve for the gods
Earth, serve for the stars

[Chorus]
When you touch me, I die just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Cause you're out of this world, galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love

[Outro]
Wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Goddess of love, wonder if this could be love
(Venus)

[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Give me that old school love right now
You know when I hold you, you won’t be alone
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Give me that late 80s early 90s old school
Feeling like my second album, so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if he's ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that OG
But it's old school, it's like '03
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody else's past
Wassup...

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good
Top down, can't be a classic if it's no wood
If you don't know what, then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And that's a track, and if you want a (eeeeeeeh)
You have to make it like that
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?
Takes a long time to happen so fast
And realize your future is somebody else's past
Wassup...

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube
Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If it's better with time then think in line
That you're going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis
If you're life like Christ live your midlife like it's... Christ-like
Nigga I ain't psychic
I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school
Wassup...

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
Give me your old school love right now
I'm leaving it all up to you darling, giving you everything you want
And give me that old school love right now
You know that only you and me alone...

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

[Verse 1]
When you wake in the morning
And I can tell it’s not your best side
No good morning, good day
I stay to the right if I know you’re mad
And on the left side, stay outta your way

[Pre-Chorus]
Just hold on
In a minute, it’ll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

[Chorus]
(I know, I know) That you go through a lot
(I know, I know) That the pressure makes you hot
(See, I know, I know) 'Cause you still know what you got
(I know, I know) Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
(Woo, woo!) I’m rooting for my baby
(Woo, woo!) Yeah

[Verse 2]
If you were here, I’d get your beer and I would hang your coat
You wanna be home
So you roll up your sleeves and you sweat and breathe
This is a long road, so much more to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just hold on
In a minute, it’ll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

[Chorus]
(I know, I know) That you go through a lot
(I know, I know) That the pressure makes you hot
(See, I know, I know) 'Cause you still know what you got
(I know, I know) Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
(Woo, woo!) I’m rooting for my baby
(Woo, woo!) Yeah

[Bridge]
See I’ve been dreamcatching
I thought that this is everlasting
A life filled with you, me, love, and laughter
Happily ever after

[Pre-Chorus]
So hold on
In a minute, it’ll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

[Chorus]
(I know, I know) That you go through a lot
(I know, I know) That the pressure makes you hot
(See, I know, I know) 'Cause you still know what you got
(I know, I know) Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
(Woo, woo!) I’m rooting for my baby
(Woo, woo!) Yeah

[Outro]
I’m rooting for you, baby
Yeah
I’m rooting for my baby, yeah
That you go through a lot
The pressure makes you hot
You still know what you got, yeah

[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
Hey, girl, I know this shit might sound crazy
Before you get in bed, throw on those heels
Hey, girl, now I know why you waited
Had to be sure that I was worth the thrill
Ladies come and go but you got something different
Had me so addicted from the start
And I'd never known all this loving I'd be missing
If I didn't work my way into your heart

[Chorus: Jason Derulo & Jordin Sparks]
You give me vertigo, vertigo
The bed, the floor, the kitchen, don't really matter long as I get
Vertigo, vertigo
On top, on bottom, inside of the bed, baby, you're making me sweat
Tell me that it's cool (Cool)
That I'm stuck on you (You)
Like your birthday suit (Suit)
You give me vertigo, that vertigo

[Verse 2: Jordin Sparks]
The way that you please me sets this room on fire
I'm burning with desire in this bed
So if I'm dreaming please don't wake me up
If all of this is happening in my head
Waited for so long, but what you got is different (Different)
Had me so addicted from the start
Boy, I'd never known all the shit that I was missing (Missing)
If I hadn't worked my way into your heart

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks & Jason Derulo]
You give me vertigo, vertigo
The bed, the floor, the kitchen, don't really matter long as I get
Vertigo, that vertigo
On top, on bottom, inside of the bed, baby, you're making me sweat
Tell me that it's cool (Cool)
That I'm stuck on you (You)
Like your birthday suit (Suit)
You give me vertigo (Vertigo), that vertigo

[Bridge: Jordin Sparks & Jason Derulo]
I'm working downtown, you all in my head
This love that we found, we'll never regret
Was empty inside
I'm filling you up with our vertigo
You waking me up (Yeah), to my fantasy
Right here in this bed, we stay here all day
And my head be spinning
You do it to me with our vertigo

[Chorus: Jason Derulo & Jordin Sparks]
You give me vertigo, vertigo, vertigo
The bed, the floor, the kitchen, don't really matter long as I get (long as I get)
Vertigo, vertigo, vertigo
On top, on bottom, inside of the bed, baby, you're making me sweat
Tell me that it's cool (Cool)
That I'm stuck on you (You)
Like your birthday suit (Suit) (Suit)
You give me vertigo, that vertigo, vertigo

[Outro: Jason Derulo & Jordin Sparks]
Say you give me, oh
Vertigo, vertigo
Baby, oh
Vertigo, vertigo
Say you give me, oh
Say you give me, oh
Vertigo, that vertigo

[Verse 1]
Oh-oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to shine in my life
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long, long time
Better believe it
Oh-oh, whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
'Til you're back again, oh, yeah, yeah
You think I'm biased to my significant other
You hit it right on the head, only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone, and I don't reply
But the next eight bars tell you why

[Chorus]
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
What's a king, babe, without a queen?
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete, you're all that matters to me

[Verse 2]
Take the gas out the car, it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you
And only you
Oh-oh, I'm grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe

[Chorus]
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
What's a king, babe, without a queen?
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete, you're all that matters to me

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all that matters to me

[Chorus]
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron

[Verse 1]
I see you in the park, you're always wearing Dodger blue
Mad doggin' me and anyone from any other crew
I am small but I'm strong, I'll get it on with you
If you want me to, what else can I do?
Everyone would take a cue from anything you do
If you want them to, what else can they do?
I don't want to fight, I want to get along with you
This time of night's for singing songs about the local news

[Chorus]
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron

[Verse 2]
I'll come around and make peace, get down, have a barbeque
Let's keep the moon awake and do electric boogaloo
I am small but I'm strong, you see I'm just like you
If you only knew that I'm just like you
All the world would take a cue from anything you do
If you only knew that they're just like you
I don't want to fight, I want to get along with you
This time of night's for singing songs about the local news
I don't want to fight, I want to get along with you
This time of night's for singing songs about the local news

[Chorus]
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron

[Bridge]
If you want me to, what else can I do?
'Cause I'm just like you if you only knew

Cabron, cabron

[Verse 1]
This is my time, this is my tear
I can see clearly now that this is not a place for playing solitaire
Tell me where you want me
This is my time, this is my tear

[Verse 2]
Comin' on strong, Baudelaire
Seems to me like all the world gets high when you take a dare
Let it rise before you
This is my crime

[Chorus]
All in all and I'm loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take breath to be sure of this
In the end and then all will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I gave what I came to give

[Post-Chorus]
Say it now because you never know

[Verse 3]
Devil may cry, Devil may care
Distiller's got a scream an' now I know just why when she's movin' air
Can you feel the voltage
This is my time

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
California skies got room to spare
This is my time

[Chorus]
All in all and I'm loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take breath to be sure of this
In the end and then all will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I gave what I came to give

[Post-Chorus]
Say it now because you never know
Aw, never know

[Guitar Solo]

[Trumpet Solo]

[Verse 4]
Take it outside, take it out there
Seems to me like all the world gets high when you take a dare
In the final moment
This is my time

[Chorus]
All in all and I'm loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take breath to be sure of this
In the end and then all will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I gave what I came to give

[Post-Chorus]
Say it now because you never know
Aw, never know

[Verse 1]

Hot dart acceleration
Pop art, pistol chasing
Catfight intimidation

He knows everything
You make a sound, the spell is bound

He knows everything

It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
He knows everything
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Catfight intimidation
All out interfacing
Black star motivation

I change the key from C to D
You see, to me, it's just a minor thing, y'all

[Verse 1]
Shiver for me, girl
Deliver for me, my darling
Ah, pushing up to you
A river that runs right through you
Swim for your smile in a Blue Rock Quarry
Make it for me, baby, you won't be sorry
Shiver for me now
Deliver for me, my darling

[Chorus]
Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam
Settle for love you never far from home
Carry me down into the waters of
Carry me down into the water of love
Two of us were made of angel's dust
I've been around, but not around enough

[Verse 2]
Shadow my free form
A woman that I could keep warm
Quiver for me, girl
Give me your head and shoulders
Shot from the pages of love and glory
Sleeping next to you and I'm in your story
Shadow my free form
A woman that I could keep warm

[Chorus]
Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam
Settle for love I'm never far from home
Carry me down into the waters of
Carry me down into the water of love
Two of us were made of angel's dust
I've been around, but not around enough

[Bridge]
Let's go
I know I make it for two
Intuition's only what you take from it
I know I make it for two
You were there and I was fortunate
I know I make it for two
Messy bed a part of cheating I won't fall for you
I know I make it for two, I make it for two, I make it for two and

[Verse 3]
Shiver for me now
Deliver for me, my darling
A living that I could
Be giving to you, my sweet love
Swim for your smile in a Blue Rock Quarry

Shot from the pages of love and glory
Sleeping next to you and I'm in your dreams

[Outro]
Settle for love
Settle for love

[Verse 1]
Does it go from a-east to west, y'all
Body free and a body less, y'all
Come again just to start afresh and
Once again to find a home
In the moment of the meantime
Dropping in, coming through the mesh, y'all
Checking in just to get it blessed, y'all
Hard to leave when it's picturesque and
Find a form that's free to roam

[Chorus]
Where you come from, where you going?
Where you come from, where you going?

[Verse 2]
Do it all then it all again, y'all
Make it up and you make a friend, y'all
Paddle on just around the bend and
Find a place where you can see
All the mamas and the papas
Take a chance on a recommend, y'all
Hard as hell just to comprehend, y'all
Disbelief that I do suspend and
Easy now to find a breeze

[Chorus]
Where you come from, where you going?
Where you come from, where you going?

We all want to tell her, tell her that we love her
Venice gets a queen, best I've ever seen
We all want to kiss her, tell her that we miss her
Venice gets a queen, best I've ever...

[Outro 1]
I know you said you don't believe
In God, do you still disagree?
Now that it's time for you to leave
G-L-O-R-I-A is love, my friend
My friend, my friend

[Outro 2]
Your stylish mess of silver hair
A woman of your kind is rare
Your uniform returns to air
G-L-O-R-I-A is love, my friend
My friend, my friend

[Outro 3]
And now it's time for you to go
You taught me most of all I know
Where would I be without you, Glo?
G-L-O-R-I-A is love, my friend
My friend, my friend

[Outro 4]
I see you standing by the sea
The waves you made will always be
Your kiss goodbye before you leave
G-L-O-R-I-A is love, my friend
My friend, my friend

[Soulja Boy]
New York where we at with it
Money
Forget the comments that they made, we just some young niggas getting paid
I ain't worried bout nothing, nothing I ain't worried bout nothing
Forget the comments that they made, we just some young niggas getting paid
I ain't worried bout nothing, nothing

And these days at red carpets I let my jewellery bling
Stand for some fuck nigga fall for anything
And everyday I hit the block and I make it rain
No, literally bruh I make it rain
Watch the throne mother fucker I'm the last king
Young Soulja Boy came in tag team
Shouts out Lil' B this the new shit
Swag took over the rap game bitch I knew it
I dooze it it and I fucking bruise it get your mind right
Collateral damage when the head hit the mind sight
It's Lil' Dre outta sight nigga outta mind
So I'mma spit the same shit like 20 times
Lil' Dre came in the building to kill and I'm willing
To stack about 30 million
And if you don't believe Google it and see yourself
This 

[?] won't pool they self, look
Money coming in everyday, yeah you know that I'm on the grind
Welcome to my city I can show you how I get I done gave you your time to shine
We gon' pop bottles in the club and all
20 racks shit we gon' blow it all
Standing in the VIP so I see everybody trying to see a king
I know they just didn't know it right now right now but I ain't worried bout nothing
And when she drop it down on down on down on down and pop it…

Came up, show respect
Snapback on my head with a S on my chest
I'm the best in the flesh
Young Dre flash bash digital dash in the club with all that cash
Still on deck getting money yeah you know wassup
Every time I pull up man it's like 10 trucks
Black on black followed by another like I'm Obama
Every single time I drop it's a hit in the summer
No droughts over here, we getting to the cake
Hopped up out the bed with the cash in the safe
Money on deck man nobody's safe
20 on my chain man we headed to the safe

Zan with that lean, nothing but Irene
Girls going crazy when I'm on the scene
Racks on the way, busting out them jeans
I keep the camera on me I ain't worried bout a thing
All the bands on me, all the cash on me
All the racks on me, I ain't worried bout a thing
Zan with that lean, nothing but Irene
Hoes going crazy when I'm on the scene
Sober for a sec, bent so I write easier
That weapon make a peppermint out of that white tee
If you coming, then godspeed to you,  you sonning me, don't speak to me crooked
I'm stuntin, look at me ma, it's no handouts 
Sweaty want the dumb cash
I'm done with the bus riding
She made the mistake for thinking he gave a fuck 'bout her
Tell 'em duck down or get drug out the backdoor
Flow got the mouth doing duties like the Task Force
Doobie and a passport, standing where the path forks
Quick to grab your bitch's wrist and get the shit I asked for
Wang trashy as bitches in smooth garments
We switching through lanes, handling business on my side of the line
Where they ain't having it, and all that sweet talk is cheap
And niggas ain't talking, that's regardless what the docket read
Stop and stare, it's really him, fresh from out the piggy pen
If I die tonight, then tell my mom I was a pretty bitch

Nigga
I'm afraid of the future
I'm afraid my parents won't live long enough to see my kids
I'm afraid my show will fail
I'm scared my girl will get pregnant at not the exact time we want
I'm scared I'll never reach my potential
I'm afraid she's still in love w/ that dude

I feel like I'm letting everyone down
I'm afraid people hate who I really am
I'm afraid I hate who I really am
I'm scared people will find out what I masturbate to
I'm afraid I'm here for nothing
I feel that this will feel pretentious

I'm scared I'll never grow out of Bro Rape
I'm afraid people think I hate my race
I'm afraid people think I hate women
I hate people can say anything
I hate caring what people think
I'm afraid there's someone better for you
Or me
I'm afraid this is all an accident
I'm scared I'll be Tyrese
I'm afraid Dan Harmon hates me
I'm scared I won't know anything ever again
I'm scared I never knew anything
I'm afraid I'll regret this
I'm afraid this doesn't matter at all

I didn't leave Community to rap
I don't wanna rap
I wanted to be on my own
I've been sick this year
I've seen a bunch of people die this year
This is the first time I've felt helpless
But I'm not on that
Kept looking for something to be in with
Follow someone's blueprint. But you have to be on your own

The label doesn't want me to release in December because it's not a holiday record and I'm not a big artist. I started the record last Christmas. Christmas always made me feel lonely, but it helped me restart the new year. I want people to this album when everything's closed. When everything slows down and quiet.  So you can start over

I got really lost last year. But I can't be lonely tho. Cause we're all here
We're all stuck here

I wanted to make something that says, no matter how bad you fuck up, or mistakes you've made during the year, your life, your eternity. You're always allowed to be better. You're always allowed to grow up. If you want

The grass eats up my insides, and my brunette starts to sprout

Verse 1

From the bright side of hearts in darkness/
Where parts make light of the harshest contents/
And your thoughts, they can start departing/
Take flight like hawks, far from your conscious/
It was a touch a feeling, a Devil out of sight/
With no evidence of presence, make a rebel out of knights/
A fellowship & resonance with everything unlike/
All that's typical & regular & everything combined/
It was the most evolved of all things/
To ever have the civil dissolve from human beings/
Fully evasive of the absolve that truth brings/
And totally contagious to all whom it sings.../
Uh! And it's call is in the air!/
You don't want it, don't speak, don't listen, don't stare!/
Cause it's always right there!/
In the deepest silence even, there's the smallest fanfare/
To announce the virus, the sickness, the dying/
And once you've got it, there's no denying it either!/
It'll sprawl through your body like the web of a spider/
And trickle down to your soul, like the drips of a drying hydrant!/
There's no immunity, and a cure they won't find it/
It's a salesman, and your whole community's a client/
You don't wanna have it, the only option is hiding/
But once secluded, you're vulnerable & anything can find ya'/
I guess it all depends on insides/
It's 50% body; 100% mind!/
So would you dig mines to avoid landmines?/
Cause my, I don't mine to protect what's mine!/
But my only real suggestion's ingestion!/
A full acceptance of what's at question/
Cause you can't get caught if you don't run/
So gimme, gimme some; gimme, gimme, gimme some/

[MGMT Verse 1]

It can't pay attention
What slips into the system
Don’t touch the whisper that puts you to sleep
Don’t slip your body to the mystery disease
All I have is this feeling
Pain just to feel
Lost mind you know I’m afraid to let it slip
She’s bored of the mystery disease

Break

[MGMT Verse 2]
Don’t go to the past, darling
You just stay close to my mind
And that’s good, sip like the end of June
Fall back into the mystery disease
Go on, tell your secrets to me
It’s not ?? got them rushed to me
It's no fun to face what you don’t need to be
What's one more to the mystery disease

Break 2

Breakdown 

[w/ Piano]

[J.ReaL Hip Hop's Verse 2]

It all kicks off with a fever/
A touch of disease where curiosity leads ya!/
And where denial & animosity keeps ya'!/
Unleashing a beast of a reaper!/
It'll be exposed to anyone who sees ya'/
Everyone who knows you, nose will say you reach of/
All the things the preachers said they should keep from/
Each one, teach one; eat some & be one/
Find who you can and make them who you feed on/
Group with those like you, then create a legion/
You are many, you are more, you are numbers/
They will try to fight you, but you can overrun them/
Hungry? Well, I guess it's a little hard to save food/
When they only word you've learned is "CONSUME"?/
Hmmm. Just make sure that you say grace first!/
The Diseased shall inherit the Earth for dessert!/

[MGMT Verse 3]

Floating in patience
Smacks right into a sea of black smoke
As soon as the pressure’s released
Lose their sight to the mystery disease
Consumed by your honesty, caught with the passion of ??
Dizzy stars, sunsets bleed in the street
Tell me what you want, waste what you need
And when your lips dry as sweets turn to leaves
That’s the place you thought you’d leave
Smoke parts, can't see ?
Wrapped in the dust of the mystery disease
Break 3

Outro
Uhhhhhhhhh!
I don't feel so good!
I think it's....I think I'm sick or...
Maybe it's something worse...
I need a doc....Fuck it

So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party

Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Early morning, longer nights (Yeah)
Tom Ford, private flights (Yeah)
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in, 'cause it's our life
(But let's slow it down)
I could be the drink in your cup
I could be the green in your blunt, your pusher man
Yeah, I got what you want
You wanna escape (Oh)
All of the crazy shit (Let go)
You're the Marilyn, I'm the president
And I love to hear you sing (Girl)

[Pre-Chorus 2: R. Kelly]
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Back of the club, taking shots, gettin' naughty
No invitations, it's a private party
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Yeah, we taking these haters and we roughin' 'em up
And we layin’ the cut like we don't give a fuck

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & R. Kelly]
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind (My mind)
But do what you want with my body (Yeah)
Do what you want with my body (With your body)
You can’t stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body (Body)

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body and don't stop the party

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & R. Kelly, Both]
You can't have my heart and (Help me now)
You won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body (With your body)
You can’t stop my voice, 'cause
You don't own my life (You)
But do what you want with my body
(What I want, when I want, when I want)
Do what you want with my body

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, world
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, world
Help me now
What you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
Want you want with my body, world

[Verse 1]
Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
"'Cause I'm a wandering man," he said to me
"And what about the future plans?
Does this thing we have even makes sense
When I got the whole world in front of me?"
So, I said...

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Verse 2]
So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Hook]
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

[Bridge]
And then he asked me, he said
"Baby, why do we love each other?"
I said, "Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother."

[Chorus]
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life (If you go with me)
For life (See the world with me)

[Hook]
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

[Outro]
Russia, UK, Paris
I'm Italian, Asian, かんぱい !
Africa, India, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
I'm Latin-American
I don't speak German, but I try
Someday in Jakarta
I'm American, I'm gypsy
I'm Bangkok, Australian, Malaysia
Sweden, Finland, Norway
Be my home just for the day
I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
Hey (Hey, hey, hey)

[Intro: Ace Hood & DJ Khaled]
We the motherfuckin' best
DJ Khaled

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Khaled]
You haters can't stop me, I'm a franchise
You're now rockin' with the best, put your hands high

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Do it, do it, I'ma fuckin' do it
These niggas try to hold me back, I swear I've been through it
Middle finger to 'em all, I'ma make 'em pay
PSA for any nigga standin' in the way
You don't want these problems
You don't, you don't want these problems
You don't want these problems
Nigga you don't want these problems

[Bridge: Big Sean]
Oh God! I tell 'em nigga, you don't want these problems
You don't, you don't want these problems
You don't want these problems

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Maybach Music
Out in Vegas like Lamar, third floor Tropicana
Fascinated with the cars, smokin' dope in the Phantom
Teflon's on the rise, I despise propaganda
Camouflage Mac-11, I should set an example
Never baptized, as I walk through the fires
The pain and the flame never match my desires
Crucified cause I'm rich, in the coupe, take a pic
On the phone at the light, Kelly Rowland's a friend
Catfish in the Benz, Manti Teo's a sucker
Plaques on the wall, hustler so I can say "fuck 'em"
Bel Air for the hoes, Ciroc in the pool
My bitch is a stripper, her name is April's A Fool
Maybach Music

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Khaled]
You haters can't stop me, I'm a franchise
You're now rockin' with the best, put your hands high

[Chorus: Big Sean]

You don't, you don't want these problems

Nigga you don't want these problems

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I said "haaaan!" That's what the title say
Cause I'm rich, homie, it's why you feel some kind of way
She threw the pussy and I caught it, presidential 'bout 40
That drop head from Europe, that coupe got deported
I turn coke boy to that corporate money
Big choppa, I'm walkin' funny
Money talk but you ain't talkin' money
You ain't even got no corporate money
Haaaan! Whip game proper, I'ma make it work
Versace, Versace, nigga know who did it first

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
We the best, Khaled tried to told ya
TRUUUU! You just second best, Kelly Rowland
(Hahaha, I'm just playin' babe)
Uh, renegade like Em and Jay
VIP section, started out from section 8
Arm and Hammer, I'm armed with the hammer
If it was a slumber party, I'd be fresh in pajamas
Silence the shawty, I'm killin' them softly
They slept on me, I stopped sellin' work and started sellin' them coffee

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Khaled]
You haters can't stop me, I'm a franchise
You're now rockin' with the best, put your hands high

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
I stay jumpin' out that thing ho, I swear that's word to my momma
I took risks with that 'caine, ho and I sold work for my momma
These niggas don't want no drama
These niggas don't want no problems
These niggas don't want no beef
Have 'em walkin' out with that choppa
These North niggas don't play that
They murk somethin', I'll tell you that
200 change for this Mulsanne and the wheel's a fortune, Pat Sajak
We catch cases, don't say jack
Don't talk work cause they tape that
Don't sell the work where we lay at
And don't spend the bread you can't make back, no

[Verse 5: Ace Hood]
Rest in peace
I'ma start murderin' and bodyin' beats
Ain't no defeatin' the eye of the beast
And I'm laughin' at people who try to compete
Name any rapper that's fuckin' with me
I'm who these niggas pretendin' to be
Claimin' you wantin' these problems
Tell momma get flowers and plannin' your funeral speech
My sanctuary's that cemetery
My choppa, named it "Obituary"
Act up, Tyler Perry
Boy you sweeter than February
Real nigga, I define that
You don't even need no dictionary
You ain't even 'bout that life
So these shooters with me ain't necessary

[Chorus: Big Sean]
You don't want these problems
You don't, you don't want these problems
You don't want these problems
Nigga you don't want these problems

You don't, you don't want these problems
You don't want these problems (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Cork's off, it's on
The party's just begun
I promise this drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
Because I lost my only friend
God, forgive my sins

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't leave me, I
Oh, I'll hate myself until I die

[Chorus]
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Sing with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer, 'cause I need you more than dope

[Post-Chorus]
I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope

[Verse 2]
Toast, one last puff and two last regrets
Three spirits and twelve lonely steps
Up Heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of his soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Each day, I cry
Oh, I feel so low from living high

[Chorus]
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Sing with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer, 'cause I need you more than dope

[Post-Chorus]
I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope

You niggas mad 'cause you fuckin' with them regular hoes

Hold up, wait, nigga fuckin' with my patience
'Cause I'm that nigga, give a fuck about a racist
If I gotta pull the trigger, I'ma kill a nigga

If you trip, banana clip
This shit'll make a nigga fuckin' go ape shit
I'm 24, yeah, a nigga gettin' older
Don't give a fuck, my heart gettin' colder
Now every nigga in the industry done fucked my bitch
And all my niggas said, "I told ya"
Now all these rap niggas wanna be political
Fuck that, nigga I'm a real lyrical killer
Spit sick shit, get a cold

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go;
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, burns my eyes to see;
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life;
And one's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
And now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't a winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
There ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down

Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much
Too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
I can try to give you everything you ever wanted
You're not hard to please
And the only thing I'm asking in return is something
You can give with ease

[Chorus]
Keep on sending your love
In the heat of battle
You've got something that'll save us
Save us now

[Verse 2]
I've got a feeling there's a jungle rhythm beating in me
When I'm close to you
I don't really want to ask for many favors
But there's something you can do

[Chorus]
Keep on sending your love
In the heat of battle
We've got something that'll save us
Save us now

[Bridge]
Woah, oh, oh, oh
You're my woman
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Keep it coming
Woah, oh, oh, oh
You've got something that can save us, save us

[Chorus]
Keep on sending your love
'Cause in the heat of battle
You've got something that'll save us
Save us now

[Outro]
Save us now
Save us now

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm a lover not a fighter, I can't find my lighter
My house is four stories, I tell'em I don't write em'
And my living room is white, my lies are much whiter
My darkest secrets are bright I need a sun visor
I say "187", make your bitch run my errands
I'm at the bar with a Dracula ordering bloody Mary's
I got a house on the prairie, got a corpse in the basement
I see hell out the window, man this view is amazing
And if I go back to jail, Persian rugs in my cell
Got the world in my hands it got all under my nails
In a room full of stairs (stares), give em something to see
I be so fucking faded, Who washed the colors with bleach?
Now they biting my style, hope it get stuck in yo teeth
I been had the green light, so don't jump in the street
The World's under my feet, I'm just kissing the sky
Tune, what is that smell? That's the shit on my mind, hah

Uh, breaking up the kush, sticky fingers-onics
I'm throwing up gang signs you can see I'm in my vomit
And I'm cool right na' but please dont change the climate
Cause I'm sleeping with the enemy in bulletproof pajamas
I got issues bigger than you, bitches taller than me
Ratchet and Bougie, I like R'n'B
Unapologetic I'm sorry for not being sorry
You niggas old news prehistoric
I need benadryl for my trigger finga
Bad bitches for my home boys
The grass is greener on the other side
I'm focused on my own yard
Ain't got enough, need more dough
We twisting blunts like torsos
I'm rich as fuck but more so, a poor soul
Oh well, If snow fell like hoes fell in love I be a snow man
My bitch a die for me, she a soldier, GI Joe-Ann
— take chances when I know I ain't got no chance, roll em
I left that crab table with a chip on my shoulder, huh?

[Chorus: DJ Khaled & Lil Wayne]
Fuck all you bitches

Fuck all you bitches

Fuck all you hoes
Fuck all you hoes

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
We ain't got no motive, we just killin' yall for nothing
And my bitch got cotton mouth, you know them snakes cannot be trusted
And I bet y'all niggas don't say shit, because I'm feeling lucky
And I still pray everynight that Aliens abduct me, Tunechi
Whattup Khaled?

Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
This is how we do

[Breakdown]
(This is how we do)
This goes out to all you people
Going to bed with a 10, and waking up with a 2
(This is how we do)
Ha, not me!

[Chorus Until fade]
This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
What? Wait
No no no no, bring the beat back
That's right
This is how we do
Uh-oh
This is how we do
Uh-oh

[Verse 1]
Under a silver moon, tropical temperature
I feel my lotus bloom
Come closer
I want your energy, I want your aura
You are my destiny, my mantra

[Pre-Chorus]
I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight
Oh, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary (La la la la la)
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary (La la la la la)

[Verse 2]
Go down in history, go down together
Into infinity, forever
Your Cleopatra, your blushing Juliet
Anything for your love, a ride or die

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight
Oh, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary (La la la la la)
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary (La la la la la)

[Interlude]
(Check it out)
Legendary lovers, legendary lovers, legendary lovers

[Breakdown]
Oh, take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

[Chorus]
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary (La la la la la)
Legendary lovers (Legendary lovers)
We should be legendary (La la la la la)
Oh, take me down to the river
Underneath (Underneath the sun) the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum (Oh baby, legendary lovers)
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary (La la la la la)
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary (La la la la la)

[Verse 1]
I heard you're feeling nothing's going right
Why don't you let me stop by?
The clock is ticking, running out of time
So we should party all night

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So cover your eyes, I have a surprise
I hope you got a healthy appetite
If you wanna dance, if you want it all
You know that I'm the girl that you should call (Come on)

[Chorus]
Boy, when you're with me, I'll give you a taste
Make it like your birthday every day

So hot and heavy 'til dawn
I got you spinning like a disco ball
All night they're playing your song

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We're living the life, we're doing it right (Right)
You're never gonna be unsatisfied
If you wanna dance, if you want it all (All)
You know that I'm the girl that you should call (Yeah)

[Outro]
Happy birthday

[Verse 1]
Oh no, did I get too close?
Oh, did I almost see what's really on the inside?
All your insecurities
All the dirty laundry
Never made me blink one time

[Chorus]
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally

[Verse 2]
So come just as you are to me
Don't need apologies
Know that you are worthy
I'll take your bad days with your good
Walk through the storm, I would
I'd do it all because I love you
I love you

[Chorus]
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally

[Post-Chorus]
So open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart

[Bridge]
Acceptance is the key to be
To be truly free
Will you do the same for me?

[Chorus]
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
And there is no fear now
Let go and just be free
'Cause I will love you unconditionally, oh yeah

[Outro]
I will love you (Unconditionally)
I will love you
I will love you unconditionally

[Verse 1]
Flowers in her hair, she don't care
Peach-pink lips, yeah, everybody stares
(Ooh) You think you've seen her in a magazine
(Ooh) It's like she walked right out of your dreams
Black Ray Bans, you know she's with the band
Passport stamps, she's cosmopolitan
(Ooh) Yeah, she runs the place like Penny Lane
(Ooh) Yeah, you're lucky if you're on her plane
From Tokyo, to Mexico, to Rio!

[Chorus]
That girl’s a trip
A one-way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she’s got that one international smile
Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she’s got that one international smile

[Verse 2]
She’s got that je ne sais quoi, you know it
So très chic, yeah, she's a classic
(Ooh) Yeah, she’s footloose and so fancy free
(Ooh) Yeah, she dances to a her own beat
'Cause she's the muse and the artist
Always leaves a trail of stardust
(Ooh) 'Cause she’s a little bit of Yoko
(Ooh) And she’s a little bit of, “Oh no”
From LA, Miami, to New York City!

[Chorus]
That girl’s a trip
A one-way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she’s got that one international smile
Catch her if you can (Catch her if you can)
Yeah, she's so in demand (In demand)
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she’s got that one international smile

[Spoken Interlude]
Please fasten your seatbelts
And make sure your champagne glasses are empty
We are now approaching the runway
So get ready for take-off

[Breakdown]
She’s got that international smile
She’s got that one international smile

[Chorus]
That girl’s a trip (Girl’s a trip)
A one-way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she’s got that one international smile (She’s got that smile)
Catch her if you can (If you can)
Yeah, she's so in demand (So in demand)
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she’s got that one international smile

[Verse 1]
You’re a one-of-a-one, a one-of-a-kind
That you only find once in a lifetime
Made to fit like a fingerprint
A code that clicks open the gold mine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They say one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
When I found you, it was all pitter-patter

[Verse 2]
Secretly, I hit the lottery
'Cause you're brighter than all of the Northern Lights
You speak to me, even in my dreams
Wouldn't let you go for even the highest price

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They say one man’s trash is another girl’s treasure
So if it’s up to me, I’m gonna keep you forever

[Chorus]
'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

[Verse 3]
Was a phenomenon when you came along
Yeah, our chemistry was more than science
It was deafening, loud like lightning
It was striking, you couldn't deny it

[Pre-Chorus 3]
They say one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
The two of us together make everything glitter

[Chorus]
'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

[Bridge]
To the bottom of the sea, I'd go to find you (Oh)
Climb the highest peak to be right beside you (Oh)
Every step I take, I'm keeping you in mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go (And wherever you go), so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

[Outro]
It's hard to find
Oh, it's hard to find
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime

[Verse 1]
You sent a text
It's like the wind changed your mind
We were best friends
Yeah, we were building a life
With every kiss and every letter
Every promise of forever
Oh, but you hit “send”
And disappeared in front of my eyes

[Chorus]
And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back, never woulda known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor)
There’s just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there’s just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision’s 20/20
I see through you now

[Verse 2]
Something has died
Now that I have made up my mind
(I’ll be alright) I’ll be alright
It doesn’t haunt me at night
'Cause every gift and every letter
Every promise of forever
Now, is out of sight
Like you were never alive

[Chorus]
And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back, never woulda known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor)
There’s just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there’s just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision’s 20/20
I see through you now

[Bridge]
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
So, rest in peace
I’ll see you on the other side

[Chorus]
And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back, never woulda known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor)
There’s just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there’s just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision’s 20/20
I see through you

[Outro]
Now, now, now, now, now
Oh, now, now, now, now, now
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
I see through you now

[Verse 1]
Was 27, surviving my return of Saturn
A long vacation didn't sound so bad
Was full of secrets, locked up tight like Iron Mountain
Running on empty, so out of gas

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Thought I wasn’t enough
Found I wasn’t so tough
Laying on the bathroom floor
We were living on a fault line
And I felt the fault was all mine
Couldn’t take it anymore

[Chorus]
By the grace of God (There was no other way)
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way

[Verse 2]
I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water
When the truth was like swallowing sand
Now every morning, there is no more mourning
Oh, I can finally see myself again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know I am enough, possible to be loved
It was not about me
Now I have to rise above
Let the universe call the bluff
Yeah, the truth will set you free

[Chorus]
By the grace of God (There was no other way)
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out

[Bridge]
Oh, that way, no
That way, no
Not in the name of love (In the name of love)
That way, no
That way, no
I am not giving up

[Breakdown]
By the grace of God
I picked myself back up
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror (Looked in the mirror)
Looked in the mirror (Looked in the mirror)

[Chorus]
By the grace of God (By the grace of God)
(There was no other way)
I picked myself back up (Picked myself back up)
(I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I (In front of the other)
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way

[Produced by Katy Perry and Greg Wells]

[Verse 1]
I lost myself in fear of losing you
I wish I didn't do, but I did
I lost my own, my own identity
Forgot that you picked me for me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They always seem to get the best of me
I found I had to love myself the way I wanted you to
Love me

[Chorus]
No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wish my skin was a costume
That I could just unzip and strip
But who I am is who I'm meant to be
And it's who you are in love, in love with

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They're going to have to take a back seat
I know I have to love myself the way I want you to
Love me

[Chorus]
No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me

[Bridge]
No more standing in my own way (Let's go deeper, let's get closer)
No more standing in my own way (The way I want you to love me)
No more standing in my own way (Let's go deeper, let's get closer)
No more standing in my own way (The way I want you to love me)

[Chorus]
No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing my feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me
No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me

[Verse 1]
Can you tell me, who called a race?
Can anyone stay in one place?
And when you get to the finish line
Will you wish for more time?
But see, one day
One day you will
But maybe one day you will find
That you just can’t push rewind

[Chorus]
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now

[Verse 2]
Do you ever think that, we're just chasing our tails?
Like life is one big fast treadmill
And we pop what is prescribed
If it gets us first prize
But you know who I, who I think will win
Are the ones that let love in
Are the ones that take the time

[Chorus]
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?

[Bridge]
Be here with me now
Be here with me now
'Cause the future is right now, right in front on you
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do
Our future is right now, I'm in front of you
Baby, don't blink and miss this moment

[Chorus]
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now

Smash on you pronto from all directions

Hit you with the fisticuffs, homie you're my next win

Put down the sticks, survival of the fit
You bout to get smashed on, probably get flicked
Probably get kicked, so you probably gonna lose, so you probably bout to quit
Riding Dogg, almost cut your braids off
Shock a number one and I still remain boss
2 and 0, homie, first round draft pick
Get your jaw broke, get laid down quick
You gotta have hands in this fighting tournament
So put it on thick
Press start to go, get punched in the lip
The winner keeps playing and the loser gets tipped
Sat him on his pockets, he outta here, that boy gone

[Hook]
Get ready for the next battle

DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, back from the dead like Michael Jackson in red jackets
With naps in my head, who's white or black? It's a rare package
Get smacked if you said that I'm neck and neck with them square rappers
My guest room's got plantinum plaques and a air mattress
No time for furniture shopping, too busy burnin' you
Watching you, learning you, word to Pac, I'm plottin' to murder you
Sure the thought didn't occur to you, my next album flop
Then I'm goin pop like Nelly with tops dropped on convertible
Porsches, born sinner, not burning no crosses
Might burn a couple bridges, I'm losing by double digits
I gotta do somethin', fightin' depression, I'm trying my nigga
But everytime I think about it, I'm cryin' my nigga
Cried myself to sleep on thousand dollar sheets
I reak of the scent of a vendetta that's deep
I'm playing for keeps, but you ain't think I'd bounce back
They love to hear a black nigga count stacks, count stacks

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Forty thousand in my pocket, you see it
Another twenty on the way, you see it (Ay)
I got a fist full of dollars, you see it (Uh)
Five hundred for the Js, you see it (Ay)
I got money out the ass, you see it
I thought I'd never see the day, you see it (Ay)
They put a price on my head, you see it
But they won't ever have to pay, you see it (Ay yeah)
I fell down on my knees and yeah I prayed
Cause Heaven seems a million miles away
I dreamed of all the things that I would say
On that day

[Chorus: J. Cole]
But for now I'm cooking up in Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing
I'll get out of Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
Tell my story, I'm just hopin' they'll listen
Cooking up in Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing
I'll get out of Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
One day, hey

[Verse 2: Bas]
Yeah, omission's usually, an admission of guilt
Hari-kari yourself, all the way to the hilt
You get nothin', no love, zip, zero and zilch
We don't mention you lames, man I be pleadin' the fifth
There's a Judas in every crew, concealing a kiss
Kiss of death, let's put the rest all to tedious bits
Fuck's sake, you niggas emanate effeminate traits
Bitch nigga, we could never relate
Nah, cause man, you niggas is birds
You learn that at bird school or somethin'?
You eaten that bird food or somethin?
You sick with that bird flu or somethin'?
That's my word, cause every where I turn
When folks I known for years that couldn't pronounce my name
And asking me for pics, there's something 'bout this game
It's somethin' for the bitches
It's somethin' for the bitches

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Forty thousand in my pocket, you see it
Another twenty on the way, you see it (Ay)
I got a fist full of dollars, you see it (Uh)
Five hundred for the Js, you see it (Ay)
I got money out the ass, you see it
I thought I'd never see the day, you see it (Ay)
They put a price on my head, you see it
But they won't ever have to pay, you see it (Ay yeah)

One day, hey

[Chorus: LMFAO & Natalia Kills]
We're gonna get you wet

Put your hands up
Everybody just dance up
We came to party rock
So flash your titties like Mardi Gras (Ha!)

[Verse 1: Redfoo]
They call me Redfoo
I walk in the club with a bottle or two
Shake it, spray it on a body or two
And walk out the party with a hottie or two, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Redfoo & Natalia Kills]
I'm gonna get you wet
I'm gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget

[Verse 2: Skyblu]
Boom!
Guess who stepped in the room
SkyBlu, Redfoo and Goon
He's a party rocker from night 'til noon
And it's about to be a champagne monsoon
Baby girl, you look legit
Come to my table and take a sip
Open wide cause we're spraying it
Fifty six bottles ain't paid for shit

[Pre-Chorus: Redfoo & Natalia Kills]
I'm gonna get you wet
I'm gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget
Won't forget- no!

[Intro: DJ Khaled & Anthony Hamilton]
Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody (Nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Scarface]
Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surroundings when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Point it at your head, got the bread then you blacked out
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage
They say that every dog's got a day coming
It's like you seein' a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pane to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures say them words we ain't tryna stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing round-ups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now I'm stunned thinkin "Fuck that" (Fuck that)
For the money, niggas murder what they close to (Get this nigga)
Entire families, these motherfuckers ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepare for the payback cause it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz

[Bridge: John Legend]
Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unawareable
He fuck around, jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats, they done already killed him, who you compare him to
To really figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites, that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, no chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him, you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love, the hurt's pure
When you front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
You was right there back-to-back with me my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz 'em in then meet 'em right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
You was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead, you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'bout what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kits, old Schnitzers
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton & Meek Mill]
See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh (Yeah, for life)
There's a story in me

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't into making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action, they grab him, he take the stand
Damn, say loyalty make a man
Got a homie and he told, I don't even shake his hand
I don't even crack a smile, knew him since a child
Man this game so foul but niggas made vows
To a code I never break, ridin' in the heavyweight
Thirty-six Os in the bird, call it featherweight
Never on time, when I show up, I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved, they already ate
And I'm tryna get full, mask on, clip full
If he got the money, we attack him like a pit bull
We sellin' soft and sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

[Bridge: Akon & John Legend]
My pain ain't never been told (Ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (This knowledge I know)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (In my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day

[Chorus: Akon]
'Fore I surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender to you, which I will never do)

[Bridge: John Legend & Anthony Hamilton]
Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around (Nobody's around)
Cold world (Cold world) cold world (Mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close
Are the ones that'll take you down (Always take you down)
Cold world (Cold) a cold, cold world

[Chorus: Akon & Anthony Hamilton]
'Fore I surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender to you)
Fore I surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender to you, which I will never do)
Oh-ohh, oh-whoa
Oh-ohh (oh-ohh) oh-ohh

[Outro: Anthony Hamilton, Akon & John Legend]
See there's a story in my life (Hey, surrender)
There's a story in my pain (Hey, surrender)
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh (Surrender)
There's a story in me
I won't surrender, I won't surrender, ohh no no no

[Verse 1]
Girl, tonight we're gonna make love
You know how I know?
Because it's Wednesday
And Wednesday night is the night that we usually make love
Monday night is my night to cook
Tuesday night, we go and visit your mother
But Wednesday, we make sweet, weekly love
It's when everything is just right
There's nothing good on TV
You haven't had your after-work social sports team practice
So you're not too tired
Oh boy, it's all on
You lean in and whisper something sexy in my ear like
"I might go to bed now, I've got work in the morning"
I know what you're trying to say, girl
You're trying to say, "Oh, yeah, it's business time
It's business time"

[Chorus]
It's business, it's business time
(I know what you're trying to say
You're trying to say it's time for business, it's business time, ooh)
It's business, it's business time
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Then we're in the bathroom, brushing our teeth
That's all part of the foreplay; I love foreplay
A-chicka-chicka, a-chicka-chicka, a-chicka-chickow-ow-oww!
Then you sort out the recycling
That isn't part of the foreplay process, but it is still very important
Next thing you know, we're in the bedroom
You're wearing that baggy old ugly t-shirt
You got from your work several years ago
Mmm, you know the one, baby
With the curry stain, oww!
I remove my clothes very, very clumsily
Tripping sensuously over my pants
Now I'm naked, except for my socks
And you know when I'm down to just my socks
What time it is; ooh

[Chorus]
It's business, it's business time
(You know when I'm down to my socks it's time for business
That's why they call it business socks, ooh)
It's business, it's business time
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)

[Bridge]
Ah, makin' love
Makin' love for
Makin' love for two
Makin' love for two minutes

[Verse 3]
When it's with me, girl, you only need two minutes
Because I'm so intense
You whisper something sexy like, "Is that it?"
I know what you're trying to say, girl
You're trying to say, "Aww yeah, that's it"
Then you tell me you want some more
Well, uh, I'm not surprised
But I'm quite sleepy

[Chorus]
It's business, it's business time
(Business hours are over, baby)
It's business, it's business time
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah, yeah
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

They want my name from me because they know what it do
They say I'm A-Rod, nigga, cause I got the juice
They tryna blackball me, went and bought a Ghost as a coupe
Soon as I ordered it, they put it right on the boat
These bitches hungry, they tryna take me to court
They tryna blackball me, I should of went to the pros
They tryna blackball me, I keep a gang of them hoes

[Verse 1: Plies]
I'm tryna fuck me thirty hoes by the end of this month
Ain't drive my Rolls Royce no more, I seen a fuck nigga in one
I heard some niggas downtown tried to jail me up
I heard they tell the Feds everyday to pick me up
But I'm like damn my nigga what I did to you?
And I'm like damn my nigga what you want me to do?
Want me to burn your pussy ass out and knock you off?
Want me to go by your baby momma house and kick in her door?
Guess what? Some 36 niggas, they’ll be here tomorrow
Don’t know what the fuck they goin' on
I’m gonna go buy some Lamar
My homie pulled me to the side and told me tell me the truth
She say she heard I’m fuckin' her sister I say she’ll fuck me and you

[Chorus: Future]
They tryna blackball me, they say I get too much money
They want my name from me because they know what it do
They say I'm A-Rod, nigga, cause I got the juice

These bitches hungry, they tryna take me to court
They tryna blackball me, I should of went to the pros
They tryna blackball me, I keep a gang of them hoes

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Say, when you getting money, that shit bring plenty haters
Just cop that Phantom coupe, I list a Grammy later
White crib a couple acres, she fin that good Jamaica
They tryin to count me out
But bitch I’m back like Schwarzenegger
They tryina blackball me, don’t wanna see me win
Hit after fuckin' hit, like there he go again
They say I’m underrated, I’m just misunderstood
They can’t compare to me, I wish, I wish you would
I’m screaming, "Fuck the world and everything in it"
My homie beat his case, cause they can’t find a witness
You wanna test my G, man fuck this industry
I strap C-4 to your mattress, for those who sleepin' on me

[Chorus: Future]
They tryna blackball me, they say I get too much money
They want my name from me because they know what it do
They say I'm A-Rod, nigga, cause I got the juice
They tryna blackball me, went and bought a Ghost as a coupe

[Verse 1]
Nothin' ever (ever) happens in this town
Feelin' low down (down), not a lot to do around here
I thought that I would go right out of my mind
Until a friend told me the news
He said, "Hey, you know that vacant lot
Right beside the gas station? Well, somebody bought it
And on that spot they're gonna build a shop
Where we can go buy bolts and screws"
Since then I've been walking on air (air)
I can barely brush my teeth or comb my hair
Cause I'm so excited and I really don't care
I've been waiting since last June
For this day to finally arrive
I'm so happy (happy) now just to be alive
Cause any minute now I'm gonna be inside
Well, I hope they open soon

[Chorus]
I can't wait, (no I) I can't wait (oh when)
When are they gonna open up that door?
I'm goin' (yes I'm) goin', I'm a-goin' to the
Goin' to the (hard) ware I'm goin', really goin' to the
Goin' (hard) I'm goin' to the (hard) oh yes, I'm goin' to the
Hardware store

[Verse 2]
In my sleeping bag I camped out overnight
Right in front of the store, then as soon as it was light out
I pressed my nose right up against the glass
You know, I had to be first in line
Gonna get me a flashlight and a broom
Want a pair of pliers for every single room of my house
See those hacksaws? Very, very soon
One of them will be all mine
Guys with nametags walking down the aisles
Rows of garden hoses that go on for miles and miles
Brand new socket wrenches in a plethora of styles
All arranged alphabetically
And they're doing a promotional stunt
There's a great big purple sign out front
That says every 27th customer
Will get a ball peen hammer free

[Chorus]
I can't wait, (no I) I can't wait (oh when)
When are they gonna open up that door?
I'm goin' (yes I'm) goin', I'm a-goin' to the
Goin' to the (hard) ware I'm goin', really goin' to the
Goin' (hard) I'm goin' to the (hard) oh yes, I'm goin' to the
Hardware store
I'm goin' (yes I'm) goin', I'm a-goin' to the
Goin' to the (hard) ware I'm goin', really goin' to the
Goin' (hard) I'm goin' to the (hard) oh yes, I'm goin' to the

Careless if she white, atleast she got her mama booty

[Verse 1]
Is Mercury in retrograde?
Or is that the excuse that I've always made?
'Cause I wanna blame you
But I can only blame myself
Yeah, it's easy to throw you under the bus
Or call you crazy, while filling my cup
I say these things to hurt you
But I only hurt myself

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I can only take responsibility for me

[Chorus]
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby, to say "I'm sorry" (I'm sorry)

[Verse 2]
I've faced my demons, yeah, I paid my dues
I had to grow up, I wish you could too
I wanted to save you
But I can only save myself

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I can only be the change I want to see
Yeah, to see

[Chorus]
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, yeah, oh
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby, to say "I'm sorry" (I'm sorry)

[Bridge]
I point my finger, but it does me no good
I look in the mirror and it tells me the truth, yeah
Why are these lessons always learned the hard way?
Is it too late to change?

[Chorus]
Oh, it takes two (It takes two)
Two sides to every story
Not just you (Not you)
I can't keep ignoring
And I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh
It takes two (It takes two)
Two sides to every story
Not just me (Not me)
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby, to say "I'm sorry" (I'm sorry)

[Verse 1: Jennifer Hudson]
Boy, I see ya, lookin' at me
I feel your eyes on me, like you gotta have me
Watchin' every move, like it's for you
You can't help it, you're attracted like a magnet

My love ain't easy
You gon' have to put in some work
You can't buy me a drink, thinkin' I'ma fall for your flirt
You gotta make it right
If you wanna go spend some time
You gotta raise the bar tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
Love me, baby, treat me right
Make it eternity and not only one night
If you love me 'til the end of time
Then I will promise you the night of your life

[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
So now love me, baby, treat me right
And we'll be ridin' it from mornin' 'til midnight
If you love me 'til the end of time
Then I will promise you the night of your life
Night of your life, life, life, life, life, life
Night of your life, life, life, life, life, life

[Verse 2: Jennifer Hudson]
I could have ya, if I wanted to
Down on one knee, in front of me, wedding bells ringin'
I could claim ya, be your savior
Wrap your heart inside of these arms and you'll never leave
I could have your hands tied, 'round my body, all up on me
Boy, you'll be stuck to me, if I wanted with no release
I'll have you beggin', wishin' now I give you a piece
Baby, you'll never be the same

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
Love me, baby, treat me right

If you love me 'til the end of time

I want you to love me like your favorite dream
Let's make tonight a reality

[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
So now love me, baby, treat me right
And we'll be ridin' it from mornin' 'til midnight (Oh)
If you love me 'til the end of time ('Til the end of time, baby)
Then I will promise you the night of your life (Night of your life)
Night of your life, life, life, life, life, life
Night of your life, life, life, life, life, life (Night of your life)
Night of your life, life, life, life, life, life
Night of your life, life, life, life, life, life

[Verse 1]
One thousand different houses and Münchausen, I'ma make you
Wanna punch out some-fuckin'-one: "Ouch! What the fuck you hit me for?!"
Screamed life as I punch counter, in bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger in a dumb gown
Black hoodie with a scythe, shit, I laughed in his face, spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like, "Take this!
Now get your ass back in that game, bitch! Don't take shit
For granted, and don't take shit, give it!"
Only bull you should take is by the horns, a mixture of Whitey Ford
And Mighty Thor, I everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writin', then record, replenish, keep writin' more
Nothing's ridin' on it but your pride, that's all you're fightin' for
So you fight, scratch, you claw, backs to wall, no one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls like they're gargantuan and ask yourself how fuckin' bad you want it
Pull out your badge for whoopin' ass and flash it on 'em
Nobody's gonna back you in the corner, you're a hornet
No one's more ignorant than you fuckin' four in the mornin'
You're at the laboratory, stormin' like there's nothin' that's more important
Emcees, you better consider this a formal warnin', you're in for it!
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face?
I ain't finished, bitch, I meant "in half", oil the blades
Nobody wants to play, they say I'm a spoiled lil' baby, but—

[Chorus]
Nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya

[Verse 2]
What goes through an addict's brain besides static pain
And Big Daddy Kane, breakbeats and words? An erratic train
Of thought like splatter paint, scatter brain
Yeah, maybe that explains why you're back but don't rap the same (Yeah!)
And you're lookin' way thinner 'cause your hunger got you lookin' like
They took away dinner (Chicka) "Sugar Ray" Leonard
Wouldn't sugar-coat a fuckin' booger though just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a (Chicka) what? (Chicka) GOAT
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips, hope it lands on
Another rap singer's lips who can't think of shit anything of wit
That's interesting to spit, yo, who's king of this fuckin' English lit?
Let your middle fingers flip on each hand while extendin' the shit
How low can you go? Lower than Chuck D, ho
Hear the bassiness in my voice? Rocky's back, where my Adrian's?
Nobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the Patriots
To rap; I'm not a man, I'm a weapon who just happened
To be a rapper who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany in the bathroom
I'd never be the same after now I'm back with an appe-
-tite for destruction and a fuckin' recipe for disaster
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished, every deed is a dastardly
One, evilest bastard, even you askin' for me to be po-
-lite to people's like me havin' my teeth pulled

[Chorus]
Nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya

[Verse 3]
So step inside a dimension demented side of a mind that's like
An inside of an engine while I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded: if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper you'll be the first one who finds him offensive
Got him climbin' the fences, lost some time to addiction
But look up "rhyme" in the dictio-nary, I'm in the picture
"Eminem" is the synonym for it, I'm an enigma
Fuck it, let's get to the meatballs, I'm gonna skip the
Veg and potatoes, edumacator (They are)
Shit, legends are made of, spit treacherous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretched is what you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
Then combine 'em with Method Man and Redman with metham-
-phetamines in each left hand, in each right is a sledgehammer
In pajamas, standin' in front of a webcam
Beatin' themselves in the head 'til Russell lets him off Def Jam
Maybe I need my head exam-ed, Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hangin' from his ceiling, drippin' with a bed pan
I need meds, swear to God 'cause if I go off the edge
T.I. ain't talkin' me off the ledge, man
Heart-throb that'll fart, ah, nah
More like a smart slob, part blob that'll stab you with a sharp ob-
-ject to the heart and leave claw marks all over the Wal-
-Mart walls, little baby with large balls
Fuck mud-slingin', I'm blood-flingin'
There's nothing on this fuckin' Earth better than bein' the
King of the playground, I hate the swings, but I love bein'
An underdog 'cause when I'm pushed I end up swingin' (Ah!)

[Chorus]
Nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Girl, you give me writer's block, I'm at a loss for words
Uhh, my mind's as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours
How much that cost? That's what I call a Roethlissplurge
You drive me bonkers, I’m about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas, the first
Date 'cause I think I gave you power
When I gave you flowers in a vase
A box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs
Probably shoulda never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Shoulda been one of the first signs to cause alert
Man, we jumped in too fast
'Cause since then I just can't be apart from her
'Cause nobody's body's awesomer
I lust her and she loves me 'cause I'm popular
But you know this ain't love

[Chorus: Jamie N Commons and Eminem]
You know this ain't love, oh no (Oh this ain't love)
You know this ain't love (Oh this ain't love), oh no
What is it then?
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right) (Hey!)
(Wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight) (Hey!)
('Cause I give in at the sight of her)
And I here I go again

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You were obviously oblivious to me
I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from
The beginning, now I'm in disbelief, I
Never knew that this could be such misery, ah
'Cause now you see nothing but me
And I don't see nothing but you
And I'm about to flip 'cause we are – super glued in
We stuck to each other's hips and we can't
Do anything individually, which is to cling on
Scared to be alone, can't specifically describe it
I just can't seem to give a reason
That's definitive, just need ya
Talkin' about I live and breathe ya
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically
Addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you
Don't wanna be with you neither
Bitch, put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek
'Cause this ain't love

[Chorus: Jamie N Commons and Eminem]
You know this ain't love, oh no (Oh this ain't love)
You know this ain't love (Oh this ain't love), oh no
What is it then?
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right) (Hey!)
(Wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight) (Hey!)
('Cause I give in at the sight of her)
And I here I go again

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just want you to myself
Don't wanna share you with no one else
"What the fuck you whisperin' for?
You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it's time that we just split and leave the
Games behind, your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
I think you need to finish developing a
Little more mentally to get the picture."
That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the keys up
To the crib ever again, no Visa
Not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You better have an epiphany, slut
Guess what? (What?) The lease up
I'm just mad the time it took to discover
You were usin' me for loot like I used you for looks
Oh, thought you was too good for me, huh?
Yeah, toots, used to be my Carrie Underwood
I was your lumberjack
But I can't stomach this, I'm leavin' you, I'm not comin' back
She said, "The fuck with that!
Where's my Louisville Slugger at?"
She grabbed that fuckin' bat
And swung it at my head, I barely ducked and that's
Right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, girl probably coulda put a 100-yard field goal
Through the uprights

[Chorus: Jamie N Commons and Eminem]
You know this ain't love, oh no (Oh this ain't love)
You know this ain't love (Oh this ain't love), oh no
What is it then?
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right) (Hey!)
(Wants me to be that guy to her)
Lord, it's desperation (I can't even put up a fight) (Hey!)
('Cause I give in at the sight of her)
Desperation (And I here I go again)

[Intro]
"What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare"

[Verse 1]
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
'Til one day I grew suspicious
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start anew, but ditchin'
Missouri for Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone, put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom, please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitchin’, her rules are Krypton-ite
So the walls, I done lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into 'em, runnin' through the kitchen
Pretendin' to be blind Superman, 'cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though, I could turn into Invisible Kid
Disappear out of sight like a true magician
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new but different
Music into the picture, and it became my new religion

[Interlude]
"I remember it clearly, even today"

[Verse 2]
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Nan
Always itchin' for somethin' to do, was flippin'
Through the radio stations one day
And discovered this DJ who was mixin'
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to The Wizard
You ain't have a fuckin' clue what you was missin'
I'd zone out with my headphones
All I remember doing's wishin' for shoes
Fuck them stupid Pumas, bitch!
It's all about them new edition Troops
You get them LL Cool J coolin' system
Made that final manoeuvre to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this
That's how I knew my mission
Little boom box boomin', spittin'
Practicin' numerous writtens
When I'd sit in my room, envisionin' my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit
He'd go cuckoo ballistic, go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed
To do this shit; never quit, too persistent

[Interlude]
"Carved an underground empire"

[Verse 3]
Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition
If we all band together, there ain't no stoppin' this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop, 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin'
You, and you forgot your written
Opportunity knocks once, it ain't knockin' again
It tried ding-dong ditchin' shit, I fuckin' got that bitch in
A headlock, cut off its oxygen, Slim
Is not budgin' like cocksuckin' cinder blocks in the wind
Now I got a pot to piss in
Spot in that top position, koppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin', leg up on the competition
Promisin' complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' 'em
Probably end up on top of 'em
Stompin' 'em like Ndamukong
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian, LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle, bitch, I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words
Is loose, but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts – shit, no wonder you're sore losers!
Now where's your poo, birds?
Ooh, no more trippin' in bird shit
Songs of self-empowerment surgin'
Words of encouragement, but discouragin'
The rappers, the rap game's god
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
Since yours ain't workin' out, each verse is
More merciless than the first is
And you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch
To get served, bloodthirst revenge of the nerds, chka

[Interlude]
"Know, too, that you'll not escape my vengeance"

[Verse 4]
But the dumpy kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
Word to Uncle Ron, I'm turnin' into a non-humble Don
You blonde dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on
So start the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on
Better back away from the front row, get launched
Show you I'm bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo
On the fuckin' Jumbotron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you bomboclaats
I'll leave you stretched out like a fuckin' yawn
So mow the fuckin' lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fuckin' up this whole landscape of rap
The G.O.A.T. just ate eight acres, an eighth of that
Was just to make a path
And take it straight to your favorite rapper
Oh, look, my notebook looks smoke-cooked
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
Charred debris floatin' like Oakwood
Was burnin', return of the no good and I won't quit

[Interlude]
"And the next thing I know
Something came crawling up from below
Something that made Godzilla look like a blamed..."

[Hook]
And I don't quit, won't change
It's like a Groundhog's Day
So crowd around, y'all, 'cause you may
See if I popped your head

[Bridge]
I'm a monster, mutt
I'ma turn into a monster
I'm a monster, mutt
With my dick in your mouth all day!

[Outro]
"I'm not so sure I want to know from whence it came
But the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
There, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing"

[Intro: Eminem & Sia]
I can feel the heat risin'
Everything is on fire
Today's a painful re-
Minder of why
It can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the
Inside lookin' out, ‘cause—

[Chorus: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
To find the light, find the light, find the light
Standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yesterday was the tornado warning, today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake in its wake
To start the mourning process and rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass—uh
Thunderstorm has passed ya, you weathered it and poked its
Eye out with the thornbush that ya used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner faster, more assertive, never looking back
May hit the curb, but every day's a new learning curve as ya
Steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to
To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
‘Cause they hurt you so bad it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket, but you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chantin'

[Chorus: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
To find the light, find the light, find the light
Standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died, 'cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive, which means you will survive
Although today you may weep ‘cause you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in, that's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the motherfreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing and by tomorrow
You may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em
Even after all the shit you've been put through, this feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burnin' quick as fire would (firewood) through this building
You're sealed in, but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin', you look down, ‘cause you're so over 'em
You could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

[Bridge: Eminem]
As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal but scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow, today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even
Perspire from the heat, exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief, it's like watching the walls melt
In your prison cell, but you've extinguished this livin' hell
Still, a little piece of you dies as you scream—

[Chorus: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
To find the light, find the light, find the light
Standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Bridge: Sia]
I feel the burn
Watch the smoke as I turn, rising
A phoenix from the flames
I have learned
From fighting fights that weren't mine
It's not with fists
But with wings that I will fly

[Chorus: Sia]
And I'm standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
To find the light, find the light, find the light
Standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Hook: X Ambassadors]
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers'? It's a rare condition
It's what you're sufferin' from when you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no frickin' air conditionin'
And you can't see the bitch’s hair is frizzin'
'Cause you got the windows up, blarin' the system
In your Chevrolet Prizm
The devil ain't on a level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him givin' an adjective an ass-whoopin'
So bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs
Like they did somethin' to me personally
Used to get bullied, so I'd cut class and ditch it
Now I bully rap, I'm the shit, faggot (Sniff it!)
Cadillac from a K Car
My ass from a hole in the ground, still can’t tell 'em a-part
Came straight out the trailer park
Screamin', "I'm proud to shop at K-Mart," and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart, arguin' over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin', I don't give a fuck, I don't play
Bitch, you think you saw this basket first?
You're ass backwards like motherfuckin' Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
Ripped a gapin' hole in it, flipped out
Ripped down the drapes, tied 'em around my neck
Went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped, fell straight down to the ground
Splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell, got impaled by the gates
Saw Satan, stuck his face in an ashtray
While I sashayed around flames with a match
And I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothin' to do with a scale
Or being gay, little faggot, but by the way
Thoughts are gettin' darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey
Tyler, the Creator, and Violent J
It's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face
I'm insane, every rhyme I say
Sons you like an ultra-violet ray
I’m sellin' hatred, buffet style, all the shit you can eat
$11.99, so come on and pile a plate!
I’m throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I’m spittin' while I’m shittin' on competition
In the meantime it’s always mean time, I'm gettin'—

[Hook: X Ambassadors]
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I’ve been a career asshole
I don’t see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit
I was born a mistake, but I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose
Was to beat a beat purplish, slaughter tracks
I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
I’m comin' to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong, the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
'Cause that cougar's a MILF
She's the oldest trick in the book, but I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'ma snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed woulda caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Indigestion, my suggestion’s Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm runnin' away with the game
It's 'cause I am, don't speculate, spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by with my wicked ways
Lady, you can suck a dick 'til your neck aches
Cry 'til you get puffy eyes, red faced
But I'm leavin' on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
And I'm sick of poundin' a square peg in a round hole
Sorry, another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gon' fit in my storage overhead space
'Cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words: don't try to put your heart in a headcase
'Cause, baby, stable mentally I ain't
I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me, I think my face is melting
If you felt these migraines
And see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
If you read my mind, you can see my pain
And you'd see why I be this way
Ever since I was knee-high playin' with G.I. Joes
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game
'Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Like a fuckin' (fuckin') echo (echo)
(Psych) Psycho on a cyclone cycle, spiralin', here I go
I'm outta control like no other mic go
Stab you 'til the knife goes – dull
I'm nothin' but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
'Cause I'ma sock it to you!
Dyke ho, you don't like it?
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
And ride it like a motorbike
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night, so
Strike up the fuckin' maestro, I'm nitro
And hi, ho, hand me my shovel!
I'm liable to dig my hole deeper
And it's off to H-E double hockey sticks, I go

[Hook: X Ambassadors]
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

[Outro/Skit: Eminem & Ken Kaniff]
Ohh, please be empty
Please be empty, please be empty
Thank you, God!
Shit… Is that a girl?
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth
And get my balls blew out, and get gay into the A.M
And lay with eighteen guys naked
And let myself show, let myself show
Buttfuck it, suck it, pull it, tug it
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body
Who is that? Where are you going? Come back!
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? Fuck you then!
Blow it out your ass!

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Birdman, what up?
Last time I seen bird, he said young nigga get this money
Fuck these niggas
And you know what I said
I said, fuck ‘em!
DJ Khaled

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Uh, murcielago when the doors go up
And when the money fall you know the hoes turn up
But, when the money gone you know the hoes turn down
And I pray to God he don't let my soul burn up

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Born sinner nigga, I was born winnin'
Heart cold, but my soul warm in it
Glock 40 and, I go to war with it
Steady aim, shoota' with a form, with it
And I go on tour with it
If I see it, then you know I'm gon get it
Yeah nigga, for the love of that paper
I got hoes sipping, liquor, six in the morning with it
I’d die for this cream, die for my dreams
As I stay and I fight on the side of the ring
With my back to the rope
Hear the crowd as they scream
But I come out on top like Mohamed Ali, woooo!
These hoes fuck so good
Now lil' nigga get money now
Same bitches laughing at me I was dead broke
Gettin' head from 'em thinkin' how funny now
Brand new Rolls Royce in the summer now
Big boy mink coats when they come around
And they wanna put a hole in my soul
Head shot for a hater now simmer down

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Murcielago when the doors go up
And when the money fall you know the hoes turn up
But, when the money gone you know the hoes turn down
And I pray to God he don't let my soul burn up
Murcielago when the doors go up
And when the money fall you know the hoes turn up
But, when the money gone you know the hoes turn down
And I pray to God he don't let my soul burn up

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Yeah
Eight million dollars on a brand new Lamb
Suicide like revolvers don’t jam
Mountain top, nigga, high in this fame
Filthy rich, still doing my thing
Popped off, we had to pop that spot
Jewels flying, nigga, we so hot
Yachts, condos, living that life
I’ll do it again and I’ll pay that twice!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Murcielago when the doors go up
And when the money fall you know the hoes turn up
But, when the money gone you know the hoes turn down
And I pray to God he don't let my soul burn up
Murcielago when the doors go up
And when the money fall you know the hoes turn up
But, when the money gone you know the hoes turn down
And I pray to God he don't let my soul burn up

[Intro: Future & DJ Khaled]
The price of fame (Shit real)
Fuck fame (Man fuck this shit)
Fuck the game (Young Chop on the beat!)
DJ Khaled!

[Chorus: Future & DJ Khaled]
Got too many racks on me
I can't even go to sleep
Just to get em out V.I.P
I'ma need to see I.D. (I don't trust you)
I'm sufferin' (I'm suf-suf-sufferin')
(I'm suf-suf-sufferin', I'm suf-suf-sufferin')
I'm sufferin' from success (I'm suf-suf-sufferin')
(I'm suf-suf-sufferin', I'm suf-suf-sufferin')
I'm sufferin' from success

[Interlude: Ace Hood & DJ Khaled]
Ace Hood!
I worked so hard, this my intro
Chea, look

[Verse: Ace Hood]
Fuck this money nigga, fuck this chain
Fuck my watch, you can have that ring
Keep my whips, you can have that fame
So stressed out, I'm going insane
Young nigga can't even sleep at night
All this money I done seen in life
More cash bring more haters
Fuck around and went and bought a chopper twice
Cause I'm paranoid, and I bury boy
If he playin' with mine, then it's oh lord (oh lord)
Please don't make a nigga do that (nah)
Please don't make a nigga do that
You don't know what the fuck I been through
Plus my lawyer texting me too
Boy my baby momma be trippin'
Talking 'bout child support, I can't do it
I don't trust nobody but God
All these foreign's parked in my yard
Swear last night I swimmed in that money
Then woke up in a million dollar car
Boy I'm too stressed, so blessed
Please somebody pray for me (woo)
I'm suffering from success, Lord have mercy

[Chorus: Future & DJ Khaled]
Got too many racks on me
I can't even go to sleep
Just to get em out V.I.P
I'ma need to see I.D. (I don't trust you)
I'm sufferin' (I'm suf-suf-sufferin')
(I'm suf-suf-sufferin', I'm suf-suf-sufferin')
I'm sufferin' from success (I'm suf-suf-sufferin')
(I'm suf-suf-sufferin', I'm suf-suf-sufferin')
I'm sufferin' from success

[Post-Chorus: Future]
My momma told me when I was a little bitty boy
I was blessed, frustrated

[Bridge: Future]
Nigga fuck this car, fuck these hoes
Fuck these millions, fuck your feelings
I'm sufferin', I'm sufferin'
Fuck this house, fuck this condo
Fuck these models, fuck these bottles
I'm sufferin', I'm sufferin'

[Chorus: Future & DJ Khaled]
Got too many racks on me
I can't even go to sleep
Just to get em out V.I.P
I'ma need to see I.D. (I don't trust you)
I'm sufferin' (I'm suf-suf-sufferin')
(I'm suf-suf-sufferin', I'm suf-suf-sufferin')
I'm sufferin' from success (I'm suf-suf-sufferin')
(I'm suf-suf-sufferin', I'm suf-suf-sufferin')
I'm sufferin' from success

[Post-Chorus: Future]
My momma told me when I was a little bity boy
I was blessed, frustrated

[Verse 1]
I ain't looking at you for no particular reason
It's just a tough spot for me to be in
I gotta open that door
Gotta get it open
I'ma push my way through, just like a robber
And smile for the camera
Damn, that felt awesome
Push it open little more
Gotta get it open

[Pre-Chorus]
You would never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject, 'cause, 'cause it's beyond you
And when you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up, and do it on my own

[Chorus]
Hey
I'll find a way, yeah
And I'll do it on my own
Hey
I can do anything, yeah
And I'll do it on my own

[Post-Chorus]
I will get it done with the help from no one
Came into this world by myself
So I don't need nobody else
We have just begun
So much to do, so young
Don't be afraid of alone
You'll get it done on your own

[Verse 2]
I know you're in there; open up, open up
Just like the Feds looking for the stuff
Three knocks at the door
I gotta get it open
I'm so confused with all the traffic
I'ma skip the line
Who cares what happens
I gotta stay on that course
I gotta get it open

[Pre-Chorus]
You would never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject, 'cause, 'cause it's beyond you
And when you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up, and do it on my own

[Chorus]
Hey
I'll find a way, yeah
And I'll do it on my own
Hey
I can do anything, yeah
And I'll do it on my own

[Post-Chorus]
I will get it done with the help from no one
Came into this world by myself
So I don't need nobody else
We have just begun
So much to do, so young
Don't be afraid of alone
You'll get it done on your own

[Pre-Chorus]
You would never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject, 'cause, 'cause it's beyond you
And when you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up, and do it on my own

[Chorus]
Hey
I'll find a way, yeah
And I'll do it on my own
Hey
I can do anything, yeah
And I'll do it on my own

[Post-Chorus]
I will get it done with the help from no one
Came into this world by myself
So I don't need nobody else
We have just begun
So much to do, so young
Don't be afraid of alone
You'll get it done on your own

[Intro]
Okay

[Verse 1]
I want someone to come home to
I need somewhere I can sleep
I need a place where I can rest my weary bones
And have a conversation not too deep

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody else busy doing better than me
And I can see why it is, they've got someone setting them free
Someone breaking the chains, someone letting them be

[Verse 2]
I want someone who can save me
When I come home from the zoo
I need somebody who's a sweet communicator
I can give my alligator to

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody seem to know what they are talking about
And I can see why it is, they got someone breaking them out
Someone finding a key, someone setting them free

[Chorus]
Could you be that person for me?
Would you feel right setting me free?
Could you dare to find my key?

[Verse 3]
I want someone who can bail me
When I get up to my tricks
I need somebody used to dealing with a sinner
Whenever I get in a fix

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody else busy doing better than me
And I can see why it is, they've got someone setting them free
Someone breaking the chains, someone letting them be

[Chorus]
Could you be that person for me?
Would you feel right setting me free?
Could you dare to find my key?

[Verse 1]
All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'
They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops
Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'

[Chorus]
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

[Interlude]
What are we even doing?

[Verse 2]
Ridin' clean
With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
I've seen some things
I wish we had met when I was in my teens
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
'Cause these days I only know conditional love
I'm not used to settlin' down
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, "You don't how good it is to be you 'cause you're him"
And I say "Well, goddamn"

[Chorus]
Then ask myself
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

[Outro: Dennis Graham & Drake]
All of this, it's alcohol, it's drugs, weed, it's everything that you could ever imagine. Man, our sisters, our sisters, and our brothers, our brothers, need to stop this shit. They need to take a step up. Young girls are hot, and they will fuck anybody, anytime, anyway. Because they are so hot and young guys are, they are going for it. This shit has to stop, man. This shit has to stop. These people need to uh, uh, uh, uh educate themselves. Women are too fucking hot.  
Yeah, you're right. You're right. Alright man, well, shit, I just wanted…
They know they're too hot. They don't give a fuck. It's the heat of the moment. It's the heat of the moment and that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment.  
I agree
This shit, that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment. Be a 100% woman, or try and be a 100% man, and use a fucking condom
Haaa

[Chorus]
They can't take it from me, if they tried
I lived through those early days
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter
Just to keep from getting crazed

[Verse 1]
Dressed in black from head to toe
Two guitars across our backs, we would walk the city roads
Seeking someone who would listen to the music
That we were writing down at home

[Chorus]
They can't take it from me, if they tried
I lived through those early days
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter
Just to keep from getting crazy

[Verse 2]
Hair slicked back with Vaseline
Like the pictures on the wall of the local record shop
Hearing noises we were destined to remember
We willed the thrill to never stop

[Bridge]
May sweet memories of friends from the past
Always come to you, when you look for them
And your inspiration, long may it last
May it come to you, time and time again

[Verse 3]
Now everybody seems to have their own opinion
Who did this and who did that
But as for me I don't see how they can remember
When they weren't where it was at

[Chorus]
They can't take it from me, if they tried
I lived through those early days
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter
Just to keep from getting crazed

I lived through those early days
I lived through those early days

[Verse 1]
Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet (dead roses)
Sake and strange divine
Uh-huh-huh-uh, huh-uh (You'll make it)
Passionate bright young things
Takes him away to war (Don't fake it)
Saddening glissando strings
Uh-huh-huh-uh, huh-uh (You'll make it)

[Chorus]
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Battle cries and champagne
Just in time for sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?

[Verse 2]
Motor sensational
Paris or maybe hell (I'm waiting)
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane (You'll make it)

[Chorus]
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain
Just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane
Love Aladdin Sane

[Piano Solo]

[Chorus]
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain
Just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane
Will love Aladdin Sane

[Outro]
They say the lights are oh so bright on Broadway

[Verse 1]
I see you every damn day and I can't help wondering why
Why you look so good, but I ain't ever seen you smile
Got a man that could buy you everything in this world
But I guess he ain't loving you right, girl, no

[Chorus]
Cause I, I can see that you're lonely
Baby, your one and only
He ain't giving you attention
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Is he telling you you're sexy?
Girl, I wonder if you let me
When I look at you I wonder, wonder, wonder
What's he doing with a girl like you
I wanna know, know, know, know
You're too fine to be looking so blue
So blue, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

[2x]

So blue, so blue

[Verse 2]
With a body like that, girl, you being his ain't fair
See, I will love you all time and all around town, I swear
I can see that he ain't been hitting that at night
One ride with me would change your life

[Chorus]
Cause I, I can see that you're lonely
Baby, you're one and only
He ain't giving you attention
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Is he telling you you're sexy?
Girl, I wonder if you let me
When I look at you I wonder, wonder, wonder
What he's doing with a girl like you
I wanna know, know, know, know
You're too fine to be looking so blue
So blue, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

[2x]

So blue, so blue

[Bridge]
See, blue ain't your color
Baby, you need a lover
That knows what your life comes through
Every time it ain't acting as it should
I'm that solution, cause your man is a loser
I'm looking, you feel so blue, so blue, so blue

[Chorus]
Cause I, I can see that you're lonely
Baby, you're one and only
He ain't giving you attention
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Is he telling you you're sexy?
Girl, I wonder if you let me
When I look at you I wonder, wonder, wonder
What he's doing with a girl like you
I wanna know, know, know, know
You're too fine to be looking so blue
So blue, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

[2x]

So blue, so blue

[Outro]
Too fine to be looking so blue
Too fine to be looking so blue
How he ended with a girl like you
Too fine to be looking so blue

[Intro]
Another one!
Cudi! Ain't no fucking game man (Midwest action)
Cudi! Ain't no fucking game man
Cudi! Ain't no fucking game man (Midwest action)
Cudi! Ain't no fucking game man

[Verse 1]
Never
Fold for nah nigga
Understand me, raps is intact
Like a perfect blunt rap, I take that
And getcha contact on my lyrical poetry
I rip shit down

[?] when I run around
Tryin' hold me back from greatness
I shake them quicker than puppets can do any man
Fuck them, I just stick with my mission, control
Niggas is clowns
Niggas wanna hold me up
Like security in an airport
Should I board now
Y’all got me wrong
Cause I'm dripping like the H1 documentaries, man
Who can fuck with me now?
Cudi ain't a fucking gimmick

[?] and vivid, baby don’t hold back
I live it, I breath it, won’t fade out
I spit fireball straight from my mouth
Bitches love my style

[Chorus]
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you

[Verse 2]
Homie
You ain't even gotta know me
Kill the raps and tracks
Get them buried in a hurry
Drink out beats, with the heat, just like a Honda
Keep rap hard, and my guards up
So doggy, what’s good?
Keep flowing just like a waterfall, faucet
Breaking niggas down like a brick
I toss it, jerks tellin’ fairytales
What would they dwell, say oh well
Most niggas are lame
I don’t even have time 

[?]
Like bananas that pick up they brain
I show you the big pick up in the frame
I’m bringing the flame, I’m bringing the heat
Lame niggas duck down
Cudi apocalypse now
I get around like 2Pac 

[?]
Niggas tongue-tied like nights, I take flight

[?]
These flows’ll melt ya

[Chorus]
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you

[Verse 3]
Simp
Get the guards attack
Kick niggas in the grill like 

[?]
Get ready for ace like a fine wine is made
Metaphorically speaking the flow
Niggas is slow
And I know

[?], run it back
But fuck that, take it to the hill off

[?] a nigga was built
MVP’s and 

[?] possibly, yeah
I be the one
Got the glow like Leroy Green
Directing your feet, son
Cudi hot shit, son
People be dumb as rocks cause Cudi was born a rock
And all they say is “Cudi rap, bitches and panties gon' drop”
No...
Nigga understand my mind
A nigga will see, homie understand my grind

[?] and just to see the cash money
Life attempts to estop Mesc
My niggas know me, know me
Scott nigga!

[Chorus]
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you

[Outro]

[Chorus]
Did you read the paper? They'll be coming for us soon
Come on Rocket, we're going to the moon
We could shoot for the sun, but that'd be too soon
So one step at a time. Let's get the moon

[Verse 1]
Since you were a thought
Floating around in our minds
We knew that you could teach us the true meaning of life

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Is to try without fire and blast through all our fears
You can fly so much higher and take us all from here

[Chorus]
Did you read the paper? They'll be coming for us soon
Come on Rocket, we're going to the moon
We could shoot for the sun, but that'd be too soon
So one step at a time. Let's get the moon

[Verse 2]
You could not be bought boy
You'd be sold out all the time
Who wouldn't queue and long for
The vital meaning of life

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Which is to ride heart and mind and learn along the way
Find our stride inside with no turbulence or sway

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You're the one I promise you
Love is your rocket fuel
Nothing is stopping you
You're special
Keep climbing impossible
A thousands of altitude
Isn't that what God will do
You're special

[Chorus]
Did you read the paper? They'll be coming for us soon
Come on Rocket, we're going to the moon
We could shoot for the sun, but that'd be too soon
So one step at a time. Let's get the moon
Did you read the paper? They'll be coming for us soon
Come on Rocket, we're going to the moon
We could shoot for the sun, but that'd be too soon
So one step at a time. Let's get the moon

[Verse]
There were rules you never told me, never came up with a plan
All the stories that you sold me didn't help me understand
But I had to get it worked out, had nobody who could help
So then in the end it turned out that I had to do it by myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Life's a game, rags from riches
Dogs and bitches hunt for fame
Difficult to know which way to turn
Lay the blame on the snitches
Wicked witches fan the flame
Careful what you touch in case you burn

[Chorus]
Queenie eye, Queenie eye, who's got the ball?
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out (out), that's out (out)
Without a shadow of a doubt
'Cause you've been putting it about (About)
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout

[Pre-Chorus]
Play the game, take your chances
Every dance is much the same
Doesn't matter which of them you choose
Never blame circumstances
If romances seldom came
Never pick a fight you're gonna lose

[Chorus]
Queenie eye, Queenie eye, who's got the ball?
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out (out), that's out (out)
Without a shadow of a doubt
'Cause you've been putting it about (about)
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout

[Bridge]
It's a long way to the finish
When you've never been before
I was nervous, but I did it
Now I'm going back for more

[Pre-Chorus]
That's out
Yeah (Ay), yeah (ay), ay ay ay
Ay (Yeah), ay (yeah), ay, ay, ay (yeah)
Hear the people shout
Yeah (Ay), yeah (ay), ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Queenie eye, Queenie eye, who's got the ball?
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out (out), that's out (out)
Without a shadow of a doubt
'Cause you've been putting it about (about)
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout

Queenie eye, Queenie eye, who's got the ball?
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out (out), that's out (out)
Without a shadow of a doubt
'Cause you've been putting it about (about)
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout

[Verse 1]
On my way to work, I rode a big green bus
I could see everything from the upper deck
People came and went, smoking cigarettes
I picked the packets up, when the people left

[Bridge 1]
But all the time I thought of you
How far away the future seemed
How could I have so many dreams
And one of them not come true?

[Verse 2]
On my way to work, I bought a magazine
Inside a pretty girl liked to water-ski
She came from Chichester to study history
She had removed her clothes for the likes of me

[Bridge 2]
But all the time I thought of you
How would you know that I was there?
How could I soul-search everywhere
Without knowing what to do?

[Verse 3]
On my way to work, as I was clocking in
I could see everything, how it came to be
People come and go, smoking cigarettes
I pick the packets up, when the people leave

[Bridge 3]
But all the time I think of you
How far away the future seems
How could I have so many dreams
And one of them not come true?

[Refrain]
On my way to work

[Bridge 2]
But all the time I thought of you
How would you know that I was there?
How could I soul-search everywhere
Without knowing what to do?

[Outro]
On my way to work
On my way to work

[Intro]
Pretty girl it's yo world
Hey Pretty girl it's yo world
She loves to do it over and over again
So hard to tell you no girl
She loves to do it over and over again

[Verse 1]
I think we need some you and me time
I think we need I think we need
I think we need a trip to the bedroom (bedroom)
Do it once and rewind, rewind
And if not now girl very soon
I need it very soon

[Per-Hook]
In the bed like watch me work, watch me work

[Verse]
Short cup but my clip tall

Only dark nigga coming’ in this shit hard

Every nigga round ready for the quick draw
Bullets open like a split door
Hundred women lookin' for me with a flashlight
All they niggas lookin' for me with the jigsaw
Wait, hold up, I told ya I blamma like Tony Montana
I roll with the hammer like popo and slammas

Just to shine on 10 when i slam her

Fiber artist really I don’t like these artist
Every motherfuckin’ line that you write is garbage
Every motherfuckin’ time that i might just start your eye department
Cuts you nigga teeny to me hit a nigga with a bottle
Thats a genie to me easy for me to get a little piece of the B-I-E
Fuck niggas wanna D-I-E with that dot on your top
Like E-Y-E I had to smell it to tell you niggers
Jealous hundred women with me they twista up like impalas

SHABBA!!
And all the crazy shit I did, that'll make the best memories
Seems my old friends always make the best enemies
Can't make ends, without making bills
And you can't ask fake niggas to keep it real
Baby, I can't, I can't, I can't, argue no more
When the only thing deep about you is your throat
Why you always rock the boat?
I swear you harder to read than a doctor's note
I put my demons on the page
And put my passion on the stage
Crashing on the websites, spazzing on the websites
Driving on the wrong side, crash into the waves
Surfs up, tide's low, so you can see the stakes, drive slow
You in the presence of ghetto royalty
Do what the fuck we want and pay the lawyer fees
I'm in Paris driving in the same lane
Where Princess Diana was killed by the damn fame
The lonely king, who's only flaw is
Looking for somebody that's flawless
No fairy tale, no ending to this story book
This could very well be the same road that glory took
Or Maria Antoinette, the fall of the Rome
The ghost of the fallen king is calling me home

[Intro]
Now, Mr. Peterson, this is no ordinary classroom we're talkin' about You see, this is classroom 105
Now I'm warnin' you, some of these students are not right in their minds
You see, these were the kids who couldn't pay attention in class because they were too busy drawin' or writin' lyrics in their song books
With you bein' the substitute teacher, Mr. Peterson, I can't lie to you, these kids are lookin' for a show

[Verse 1]
Soon as my sneakers hit the tile of the classroom
I am your latest teacher, this is past due
Mr. Class Clown, boy, sit your ass down
I am not issuin' hall passes for the bathroom
Mr. Peterson is teachin' this
So much soul brother, I'm preachin' it, leadin' it
Students like, "Oh, oh, he's so secretive"
Even secretaries couldn't tell me what my secret is
My first lesson is maneuver shit
I'm so fly, I need a stewardess for jewels to fit
So if you got the new, I know I got the newer-ish
And I don't even shit on them, it's manure, bitch
My flockin' brains on planet Mars
I ride the beat like wheels with some handle bars
My flow iller than a man with a can of sauce
It's Mr. Peterson, baby, I am in charge
Juicin' this music, am I confusin' your students?
'Cause I don't want to, I just want you to get through when you do it
Movin' through, doin' your schoolin', coolin' with friends that you cool with
You sure would love with this music, it's like aruga from Cupid
They screamin' man on fire, red so hot that
The children wanna die that my hands on fire
This the best of me and I can't call Maya
12 for the rims, suckers can't ball higher
I'm goin' too hard
I swear my students say recordin' is my job, they mock me foolish lately
Call me a slob, that's what they used to say
But now you ain't even got a choice, gotta get used to me
It's Mr. Peterson, I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone
I'm outta here

[Chorus]
Lately, I been tired of loving
So cold, so cold, so cold
Lately, I been tired of loving
So cold, so cold, so cold

[Outro]
Said it's the Mr. Peterson
It's the Mr. Peterson
I'm so motherflockin' go
We outta here, baby
We outta here, baby, woah
We outta here, baby
We outta here, baby
We outta here, baby
We outta here, baby

[Soulja Boy]
I'm so motherfucking dope, bitch I'm the truth
Riding through my hood throwing money out the roof
And everybody saying Soulja Boy got the juice
But the real shit is bitch, the nigga is the truth
And the real kicks is bitch, that shit cost a hundred
'Bout six hundred see my nigga getting blunted
Shout out to my niggas on the block getting money
Real shit he got his whole clique stunting
Got no top and no buster, no weak motherfucker
Pull up in that trap and everybody screaming whoa
Where the fuck you get that at home boy froze but
Home boy cold with the motherfucking most but
Everywhere I go they wanna take a fucking picture
Oh my god, I must be that nigga
Oh my god, she drunk off that liquor
But I'm not a fucking hipster but I will fuck your sister
Swag off the ripped a bitch nigga you remember
Came through the hood frozed up like December
Got this ice on my chain, the jewellery was a mystery
When Soulja Boy came out you know I made history
I stepped in the club VIP 'bout 60 deep
Bitches walking up saying Soulja you the shit to me
Hoes wanna kiss my feet, goddamn I'm royalty
They ain't really shit to me you know I swag OD
I swag out the roof doe, bitches so cold like pluto
Man I thought you knew doe, Soulja Boy Tell'Em got the juice doe
Every time you see me got a new ho
Goddamn you know it's going down for the 2-4
2-4, catch me on the Maserati flip
Slap the Maserati matte black paint, these niggas wanna copy
But hold on, my nigga got the last throne and the king
Hold on, tell my nigga get your crown roll on
Tell my nigga get his goddamn bling
Every time you see me I'mma rock the scene
I'm a Soulja, nigga I done told ya'
CEO swag mob, man my young nigga fold ya'
Pull up in the Rover, fucking with Mustard
And I got everything on me custom
25k, tell a nigga rush them
With the baggage claim put 20 on them busters
50 and his sister nigga still window shopping…

[Verse 1]
Distant lover, lover (lover, lover, lover)
Ooh, so many miles away
Heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night
And sometimes I yearn through the day

[Verse 2]
Distant lover (lover, lover)
You should think about me
Say a prayer for me
Please, please baby
Think about me sometimes
Think about me here
Here in misery
Misery

[Verse 3]
As I reminisce, ah baby
Through our joyful summer together
The promises we made
All the daily letters
Then all of a sudden
Everything seemed to explode
Now I gaze out my window
Sugar, down a lonesome road

[Verse 4]
Distant lover, ooh sugar
How can you treat my heart so mean and cruel
Didn't you know, sugar
That every moment that I spent with you
I treasured it
Like it was precious a jewel, oh baby
Lord, have mercy

[Outro]
Oh baby, don't go
Please, come back, baby
Something I want to say
When you left you took all of me with you
My lord I wonder, do you want to hear me scream?
Please, please, please
Oh please baby
Come back home, little girl
Oh baby please, please

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Happy birthday

[Chorus]
They hold on tight
Yeah they hold on tight, ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, they hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Verse 1]
Don't let this go to your head
But you're the best I've ever had
Not to mention that thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
Something like a ziploc, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh

[Chorus]
They hold on tight
Yeah they hold on tight, ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, they hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Verse 2]
Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don't know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Ooh when you got me in a gridlock, what a great spot
With a turned up kind of loving, it just won't stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh-wee

[Chorus]
They hold on tight
Yeah they hold on tight, ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, they hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Bridge]
Oh baby, holding back the faces I would make
I'm a fan and you're the rockstar, making it hard on me
Visualise a monster, cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow I'm hit, need you right near me
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, no no
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, ooh

[Chorus]
They hold on tight
Yeah they hold on tight, ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, they hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Verse 1]
Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground (oh, oh)
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "no"
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and (I, I, I, I)
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees (eh, eh)
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus 1]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

[Verse 2]
Just a shot, just a shot in the dark (oh, oh)
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're on to something
I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus 2]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

[Bridge]
I’ll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I’ll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
I’ll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I’ll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I’ll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when
When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "no"
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus 2]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Like shining oil, this night is dripping down
Stars are slipping down, glistening
And I’m trying not to think what I’m leaving now
No deceiving now, it’s time you let me go
Let me go

[Bridge]
I’ll be gone!
I’ll be gone!

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
King Push
Dope game keep callin'
Dope boys keep fallin'
Askin' me "What's my legacy?"
I just wanna die ballin'
I just wanna die pourin'
I just wanna ride foreign
I just wanna bring hoes together
Lonny, Lisa, meet Lauren (Wooo!)
Then I be gone, keep it movin', what I be on
Damn right I know what time it is
Patek Philippe and the Tourbillion (Yuugh!)
I'm stylin' on 'em, I'm swervin' on 'em
I know it's wrong, but life's a bitch and she turn me on!

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, and to each his own
Hatin' ain’t something that we condone
'Cause the way I flip when the beat come on
I gonna pop that shit 'til your speakers blown
And y'all wanna cop a plea
Who you gon' talk to? Not to me
Because the chain of command work properly
You gotta earn a few stripes 'til you talk to me
Word to Pusha, word to Vice
Built a track once and killed it twice
Built a stage up and killed the lights
Opening act was like "Fuck my life"
Y'all can love it, ain’t nothing wrong
Forget the hatin' that y'all be on
Enjoy it now because after long
Keyser Söze, I'll be gone

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I’ll be gone!
I’ll be gone!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, I’ll be gone
I’ll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I’ll be gone
I’ll be gone

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, I’ll be gone
I’ll be gone
I’ll be gone!
I’ll be gone!
I’ll be gone!

[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up

[Verse 1]
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend, so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl, why is you lying? Girl, why you Mufasa?
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Woah)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hol' up

[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up)
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up)

[Verse 2]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So, therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it
So insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
'Cause we all just ticking time bombs
Got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go
Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so
Can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care
It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing, whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special
And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand
Even if you don't understand, hol' up

[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do (No, no)
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you (You and me)
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up)

[Post-Chorus]
Hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up

[Outro]
Na—na—na, na—na—na—na—na

Nigga, you so thirsty

[Intro]
Is this thing on?
It's on?
Let me know when you want me to stop

[Verse 1]
Rifle in the left hand, gospel in the other
Sisters in the front seat, I'm back with my brothers
I can go farther if I'm guided by the mother
Whatever level rappers on, KRS is on another
This that raw Emceein' you don't want none of
Blastmaster KRS-One-uh
Original boom bap beats with just the drummer
Seems like people nowadays is getting dumber
They don't see they're getting older, not younger
So I split the Stevie and make them all wonder
I come with than Donna Donna every summer
They want the high ground, me? I want the under
Rhyme books, rap hooks, I got a ton of them
But here's just one more of them
Now you're about to hear the style of someone who has mastered this
Now it's time to show you what boom-boom-boom-boom-boom bappin' is
This that '86, but from Gecko, we coming back again
Showing you the difference between what MC'ing and rap again
Many have attempted and wrecked it, this very style I spit
Peace to them but you are now hearing the very off the tech
When it comes to music, good music, I'm all on top of it
Criminal Minded, you can find it with Scott LaRock and it
This mix drive, you have to get
You must have forgot what real Hiphop can get
I haven't stole a topic yet, or a beat
I don't get cash every week, I get cash when I speak
I throw it out anywhere, like trash in a street
I spaz on these beats, see the passionate heat
Entrepreneur, I'm not asking to eat
I'm off to Geneva, I'll be back in a week

[Hook]
All through the years, in the end ?

[Verse 2]
Me stopping with hip-hop
That's like MJ no longer being regarded as the king of pop
You're thinking of the commercial flop could make me stop
20 years in this game, I ain't aiming for the top
I stay up in that underground cozy spot
That in-cognito nobody knows me spot
Most MC's rhyme but don't know their plot
Maxing out their credit 'til their bank closes shut
You went from holding jewels to holding a mop
From talking about, "Don't snitch," now you roll with a cop
It's like you erased your mind and forgot
What the founding fathers truly saw posses ? with Hiphop
We're screaming back to the ? knowledge, culture, and overstanding
While beats are slamming and the people are jamming
Sick of all these talentless hustlers scamming creating mental famine
Don't you think it's time we re-examine?
Let them know what the truth and the facts is
That the game nowadays is manipulated by masonist blue-collared fascists
Marketing schemes is controlling the scene
Fiends for the green, I'm just a man trapped in a machine

[Hook x2]

[Intro- Lil' Wayne]
Yeah
What Up World
It's your boy Weezy Baby
Bless on the music. Mixtape murder, bitch. Ya know?
So get your ? shit right
Listen

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]

Ima squeeze the game till faggots scream mercy
I spit it for niggas who will never see mercy
Throwback New Orleans number 17 jersey
Bang bang eagle gang early
If you heard a verse thirsty, I got your cup
I put killa flow on ya plate eat it up paw
And every slow song needed
My shit already seasoned
No pepper added the boy is acid
Fee yelling from the sideline "boy he don't pass it"
I tuck and scramble and 100 yard dash it
I tuck it handle coming out my pants
Its like fucking animal, blame it on my past tense
You niggas running trying to catch up wit my past tense
Ya need your ass kicked, maybe your run faster
Dumb bastard, this is Young Money and me I'm the young master
Ask for Weezy shit
Im SQAD Up niggas telling me to kill it
Knowin when we come out we gone dumb out
Glocks rung out, shots rung out
Party flyers reading no party if the SQAD come out
Cuz it's no party when them nines come out
When you're trynna dance and your man's spine come out
My tec did that
Not me, my tec did dat
I thought it was a bitch song but niggas is yelling "my neck, my back"
I ain't respecting that
Petty ballers step with that
We major just cope, we neglected crack
U.S. lets get Clinton elected back
Cuz Bush got the hood on a hectic lack
But I'm good at this I practice techniques
Wrestle the streets Cactus Jack
How black is that?
My flow a civil rights act attack
The spine of the neighborhood back is back
That Weezy; That Baby; That Hot Boya
Have your lady that hot and bothered
That gangsta that pimp that balla
Name ringin in the streets like a black tomas
Name ringin hustle like I gotta smack bonas
Name keep ringin till the feds smack on us
Name ringin in then game like I clash Jordan
Young field still young, name ringin in the school classroom like I'm Zach Morris
Team ringin in New Orleans like we are that Hornets team
I got the maybe peach? under garments clean?
In a Bentley limousine, know what I mean?
Weezy is king
Bitch
Ya Know? What it is
You thought I was finished?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]

I'm Weezy Wee boy posted in my b-boy stance
5 g's on pants like 500 little G, G's on pants
Jeep jeep on fans
She she haul ass
The see the boy pass
We be off glass
To you haters who gone trip don't leave y'all bags
Y'all come on back ya hear, we gone beat y'all ass
Big money over hear, I over beat y'all cash
Getting money over hear, I over see y'all cash
Little money over there, I can't see y'all cash
I could get y'all cash
We flee off fast
Like holdin down clutch pop neutral to first, wait flee off gas
Yes, you could keep on playing and we gone dance
And we don't dance no more all we do is this
Nigga you just witnessed terrific business
I learned that from the game and earned it with the name
Fuck Ya
Because y'all not fucking wit me cuz I'm Cash Money and I'm Young Money
Tell em I'm SQAD Up till I leave, put it on my mommy gat behind me
You could try me
Y'all not fucking wit me cuz I'm Cash Money and I'm Young Money
Tell em I'm SQAD Up till I leave, it's on my mommy gat behind me
You could try me
Fuck it

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
All alone, not by myself
Another girl bad for my health
I've seen it all through someone else
And I— (Another girl bad for my health)
I celebrated, but undisturbed
And serenaded by the terror bird
It's seldom seen and it's never heard, oh
(Serenaded by the terror bird)

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
Disintegrated by the rising sun
A rolling blackout of oblivion
And I like to think that I'm your number one
Now— (Now, I'm rolling blackout of oblivion)
I wanna leave, but I just get stuck
A broken record runnin' low on luck
There's heavy metal coming from your truck
And I'm— (I'm a broken record runnin' low on luck)

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
(Oh-oh!) We could all go down to Malibu and make some noise
(Oh-oh!) Coca Cola doesn't do the justice, she enjoys
(Oh-oh!) We could all come up with something new to be destroyed
We could all go down

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
I love the feeling when it falls apart
I'm slow to finish, but I'm quick to start
And beneath the heather lies the meadowlark
And I'm— (Slow to finish, but I'm quick to start)

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]

Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things

[Verse 1: Barrie James O'Neill]
I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
A song that I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said lets pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh, Summer wine

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mm, Summer wine

[Verse 2: Barrie James O'Neill]
My eyes grew heavy and my lips, they could not speak
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Mm, Summer wine

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mm, Summer wine

[Verse 3: Barrie James O'Neill & Lana Del Rey]
When I woke up, the sun was shining in my eyes (in my eyes)
My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size(in my eyes, uh)
She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime(Uh, Uh)
And left me cravin' for more summer wine
Oh, uh, Summer wine

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Barrie James O'Neill]
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine

[Verse 1: Kat Dahlia]
I’m from Miami, bitch, yeah, that’s Miami streets
And all the haters want to push us, try to give us heat
Baby, we live in heat, so drop that shit and drop the beat
Let's party in my streets and leave the hotel room with dirty sheets
I’m no holds barred, baby, I’m gung ho
They sayin’, “Girl, you ain’t Jamaican, accent's got to go”
And I say, “Hell no, hell no”
I got Jamaica in my lungs, it’s that good hydro
I got that Barbee flow, I’m feelin’ irie
Party, work and chill on the beach all day
Got Corona in my hands, got that iron in my blood
Got my toes in the sand and my God is the Sun

[Chorus: Kat Dahlia]
I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck
Living life everyday by what comes up
Yeah, I’m working on some things, getting my weight up
I’m Helen Keller to the hate, I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?”
I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck
Living life everyday by what comes up
Yeah, I’m working on some things, getting my weight up
I’m Helen Keller to the hate, I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?”

[Interlude: Kat Dahlia]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh

[Verse 2: Kat Dahlia]
We in that heat wave, where people ain’t phased
Workin’ to get paid, this town, they don’t play
The girlies like, “Yay”, they like the heart race
White girl on a white girl’s face, and oh-oh-oh
We do it for the thrills, thrills, thrills
We got enough bills, bills, bills
So keep poppin’ them pills, pills, pills
I’m chillin’ in my booth, feet up, V.I.P
Bring my girls to the damn party
Bro, don’t touch me, I got my own money
If you want a drink for free, show my girls your body

[Chorus: Kat Dahlia]
I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck
Living life everyday by what comes up
Yeah, I’m working on some things, getting my weight up
I’m Helen Keller to the hate, I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?”
I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck
Living life everyday by what comes up
Yeah, I’m working on some things, getting my weight up
I’m Helen Keller to the hate, I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?”

[Interlude: Kat Dahlia]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh

[Verse 3: Kat Dahlia]
My town likes to party all of the time
All of the time, take me down to Prime
Give me a steak, if it’s bloody, that’s fine
Got a roach in my pocket, took Mary J to dine
Let me clear my throat, uh (yeah, yeah)
Have mercy, babe, I hope you don’t mind, mind
I’m on a fucking boat, uh (yeah, yeah)
And I’m thirsty babe, pass me the champagne, pagne

[Chorus: Kat Dahlia]
I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck
Living life everyday by what comes up
Yeah, I’m working on some things, getting my weight up
I’m Helen Keller to the hate, I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?”
I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck
Living life everyday by what comes up
Yeah, I’m working on some things, getting my weight up
I’m Helen Keller to the hate, I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?”

If it's like a MAC you own

Baby, if you connect with me
I'm just like your high speed cable
Even if you gotta fly
To where they drive, on the passenger side
I'll be the like the Autobahn

I want love, like any world wide woman would need
I know you think that can't be
Still got sensitivity
In my world, it's hard to get authenticity
But you feel so damn real to me
Come take the lead
Enjoy this world with me

[Intro]
"Ooh!"—"Damn!"
"Fuck outta here, dawg"—"Ooh!"
"What's up? What's up? Don't, don't try to jump me, don't try to jump me!"
"You got it, I ain't even wanna fight homies. You got it, cuz."
"Damn!"—"You got his–"

[Verse 1]
(Blow up) Worldstar before rap, you already know that
So Fresh Prince, they about to bring the show back
Listening to Kilo, weekend cost a kilo
Hair so long, I'm about to bring the fro back
Phone call gotta say "Moshi Moshi" (Moshi Moshi)
Girlfriend actin' all wishy-washy (wishy-washy)
It's your birthday, make it earthquake
Fell in love with a nigga like a mermaid
(Daddy, I love him!) That's a first date, uhh
Nobody think about it, worst case, uhh
Best case, we the front page, uhh
10K on the first day, uhh
Yeah, motherfucker, take your phone out
To record this, ain't nobody can ignore this
I'm more or less a moral-less individual
Making movies with criminals, tryin' to get them residuals
When it all go crazy
When I hear that action, I'ma be Scorsese
My nigga, hold it horizontal, man, be a professional
Damn, my nigga, be a professional, what you doing, man?

[Interlude]
Get up, get up
Get the man right here (*screams*)
Worldstar!
Worldstar! (Worldstar) Worldstar! (Worldstar)
Worldstar! Worldstar! ('star!)

[Verse 2]
My girl ain't bad, she more like evil
When I'm lookin' in the mirror, how fly's this negro?
She on Hollywood and Vine, thinkin' that she Hollywood on Vine
Makin' movies with her friends all the time
Showin' off her ass, that's a net twerk (Twerk)
But I saw through it like a wet shirt (Hol' up)
Drive slow 'cause you might swerve off it
Still eat and the hate so salty
Put shrooms in my roommate's coffee
And got more likes than a white girl talking
More hits than a fight comp
Where they fight cops 'til they stop, when I heard shots
Watching dude drop from a Glock at a—(shots fired)
Ohhh, Worldstar!
Let me flash on 'em, we all big brother now
Lil' sis, let her run around
Money talking, you know the sound—Brrt!
Money counter—Brrrt!
AK—Brrrt!
Cell phone—Brrrt! Hello?

[Interlude: Steve G. Lover]
Yo, bro, man, check out that video I just sent you, man
This shit is hilarious, man, it's like this kid, man, he got like sh–
He got like hit on the side of the head, man, he's like freakin' out
Like, heh, it's like he think he completely lost blood and shit
Hahaha, it's hilarious, man...

[Outro]
(Worldstar! Worldstar! Worldstar!)
We don't wanna be on (Worldstar! Worldstar!)
And all I wanna be is a (Worldstar! Worldstar!)

We don't wanna be on (Worldstar! Worldstar!)
And all I wanna be is a–

[Produced by Childish Gambino & Ludwig Göransson]

[Verse 1]
Here, you focus
So I can see your faces
The eyes are wrong
How will I know if it's working right?

[Verse 2]
Light confuses
The tiny isles of bruises
The mangled lines
I see the signs of aging

[Bridge]
But if I try to feel at all I am deceived
My mind's affected
It's empty now
As I lay down
I feel alright
My heart is racing

[Verse 3]
Turn the noise on (the noise on!)
I'd like to feed my poison (my poison!)
Assembly lines
Carry a velvet warning
To the yard
It's just like striking matches
The polish lies

[Chorus]
But it's working in your blood
(Working in your blood)
Which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind
(It's working in your mind)
And not your heart

[Refrain]
No, it's working

[Chorus]
It's working in your blood
(Working in your blood)
Which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind
(It's working in your mind)
Not your heart
It's working in your blood
(Working in your blood)
Yet, you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind
(It's working in your mind)
Not your heart
It's working in your blood
(Working in your blood)
Which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind
(It's working in your mind)
Not your heart
It's working in your blood
(Working in your blood)
Which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind
(It's working in your mind)
Not your heart
It's working in your blood

[Verse 1]
He spends his time
Or maybe half of his time
Or part of his time wandering
Around the creeks and cobble stones of hackney lanes
With a tear in his eye
As the children walk by, he's thinking of a song
And then stops to paint a picture of a frown
Walking around

[Verse 2]
Dan Treacy's smile
Leaves you trying to decide
Who's the victim, what's the crime?
No rest for the mind that's seen it all before
And I don't know where he lives
But he's a myth of a man
And Texas Bob the cameraman
Is off to fix his suit before the show
Yeah, but where did he go?

[Bridge 1]
To know when your time's up
You flip the glass and watch the hours quickening
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the back of the station
Fluorescent lights about to quit their flickering
Well he speaks his mind
He says "what is crime?"
Dan Treacy's eyes

[Verse 3]
In the middle of the park
When the underground is dark
He's a poet, he's a lark
He starts thinking
About a place that no one knows
And when the creeks run dry
He stays frozen in time
Strange lights in the sky start blinking
I can see the car outside but he's listening
He's listening
He's listening
Ahh...
And he's making up his mind

[Bridge 2]
(He made his mind up)
To get things done and overcome
(He made his mind up)
Yeah, he's gonna let it go
(He made his mind up)
In the park and at the station
(He made his mind up)
Yeah, he's gonna get it done
(He made his mind up)
Ooh yeah, he's gonna get it done
(He made his mind up)

[Pre-Outro]
Yeah, he's gonna let it go, uh oh
No matter the time
Oh, oh
When the creeps run by
Oh no
He's making his mind up
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Said Yeah, he's gonna get it done, whoa oh
Oh yeah, when the creeks run dry, whoa oh
Said yeah, he's gonna listen to his soul
Yeah, when the creeps walk by
"Come here boy, look me in the eye"
Bow to the heart, back to the beat of Dan Treacy
Hey, I found a whistle that hangs like a charm
And when my noose is tied I could blow it
And fall down into your arms
15 centuries of dissolution and grief
To return a yellow trickster and a thief

Hey, I found a whistle that works every time
That's when the trail escapes to nowhere
And the flood erases the crime
Such conviction, to paint all the walls with the blood
Of the young and the faithful and the good

Yeah, I found a whistle as thin as a sheet
To split the dumbness of a vision
Between a sleep and asleep
Tiny axes repeatedly raising the flag
All ignored, real emotion's such a drag

Hey, I've got a pistol that's aimed at your heart
And on dark nights when the moon is right, I could show you
The head attached with a scarf
Aerophane sorceress, at home obeying the fates
When it's gone, has it gone all the way?
This time, found a whistle that works every time
Yeah, I found a whistle that works
Hangs like a charm on my neck
Found a whistle that works every time
Yeah, I found a whistle that works
Closes my mind every time
A whistle, I've got it
I've got it this time

[Part I: Direction of Truth (Part 1) (0:00 - 1:23)]

[Verse 1]
Sleep as the goer
The bridge that watches the light speed through
And cries while the spirit stumbles
The inside missile for the protection of you

[Verse 2]
Maybe it's silent
The voice can't bear any more strain
But speaks without even knowing
And streams outside in the direction of truth

[Part II: Secrets to Decode (Part 1) (1:23 - 2:10)]

[Verse 3]
There's no reason there's no secrets to decode
If you can't save it, leave it dying on the road
Wide open arms can feel so cold
So cold, feel so cold

[Part III: The Older I Get (2:10 - 4:55)]

[Verse 4]
Balance the books, the ledges, the looms
The disappointed look on the faces that squint at the moon
Let's see it with shadows enhanced
And then vote to decide who'll advance
Silver jet plane making a turn
Exciting the brain that expects it to crash and then burn
It's not the life lesson I'd've guessed
If you're conscious you must be depressed
Or at least cynical

[Chorus 1]
But someone might still eat the steaks
Even if they're tough
Spending the day, chewing at the fat
Floating away isn't rough but it's not enough

[Verse 5]
Oh Marianne, pass me the joint
The sandpaper's tan, go-getters are surfing the point
And London's a scratch on the lens
It's over before it begins
Silk 'round her neck falls down to her shoulders
The older I get, the more I suspect there's a trick
But really there's no trip at all
That doesn't result in a fall
Or a faltering

[Chorus 2]
But something could spit out the bait
Even if it's real
Rolling away, missing a spoke
Close to the ground like a wheel, but it's not a joke
Holding the line, clutching the phone
Nobly wasting the night, but it isn't right
It's not right
Smelling for blood, praying for rain
Running away isn't rough, but it's not enough

[Part IV: When It's Over (4:55 - 6:07)]

[Verse 6]
The low tide is telling me when it's over
To breathe in everything exposed
And comes back to cover me with a blanket
Being here's always changing tunes

[Part V: Secrets to Decode (Part 2) (6:07 - 8:22)]

[Instrumental: 6:07 - 7:02]

[Verse 7]
The empty sky surrounds me but I can't see at all
Wide-open arms can feel so cold
And you can sit beside me and tell me what it's worth
But I hope I die before I get sold
I hope I die before I get sold
I'd rather die before I get sold

[Part VI: The Way That It Was (8:22 - 9:12)]

[Verse 8]
If you find the soul that you lost
Frozen in a starry void
Take it within and hope the sight of blood
Can will signs of life to return
Back to the way that it was
Long before it made a noise
To keep on quietly reminding you
What's never created or destroyed

[Part VII: Direction of Truth (Part 2) (9:12 - 9:55)]

[Verse 9]
Wake as the swell peaks
The close-outs drowning the birds with roars
And howls scare the new unkindness
That picks and laughs at the carrion scene

[Verse 10]
Forces you see breathe can always go into hiding
And wait 'til it passes over
Or stay far gone for all eternity

[Part VIII: American Nightmare (9:55 - 12:06)]

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
So tired, soul searching
I followed sounds to a cathedral
Imagine my surprise to find
That they were produced by Brian Eno

[Verse 1]
Past the gates, quite stark
The roses trimmed and the windows dark
I see the walls through a limestone crack
Not red not blue not yellow but black
And all the spaces left for you
If the sky was synthesized, you'd probably know

[Verse 2]
He taught me many things
The wisdom of oblique stratagems
The prophet of a sapphire soul
Presented through creative freedoms
And everything I say is true
Because if I was telling lies, it'd probably show

[Chorus 1]
I can tell when he's kind of smiling
But what does he know? (What does he know?)
We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
Brian Eno (Brian Eno)

[Verse 3]
When I was stuck he'd make me memorize elaborate curses
Tinctures and formulas to ditch the chousi and flip the verses
My whole foundation came unglued
When I tried to humanize by ambient light

[Chorus 2]
Dipping swords in metaphors, yeah, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
Brian Eno (Brian Eno)

[Bridge]
He promised pretty worlds and all the silence I could dream of
Brian Peter George St. John Le Baptiste de la Salle Eno

[Chorus 3]
Well, all alone by the oldest stone where the shade trees grow
(What does he know?)
The creature by the water feature with the ghostly glow
(Brian Eno)
Making sure that time's preserved well, we reap what we sow
(What does he know?)
We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
Yeah, I can tell that he's doing well, yeah, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
I'm always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno
(Brian Eno)
Yeah, he dips swords in metaphors yeah, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
I'd like to see him plant a forest, because I don't know
Brian Eno
I can tell that he's trying to smile, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
I'll always be a step behind him, Brian Eno
(Brian Eno) Yeah
He's making sure that time's preserved well, we reap what we sow
(What does he know?)
I'm always one step behind him, because I don't know
What Brian Enos

[Instrumental Outro]

[Part I: Metanoia (Part 1) (0:00 - 1:38)]

[Verse 1]
Metanoia, reshaping the world
It can teach you and reprogram you
It can show you the flood that's trapped inside
This one's alive
Tale is breathing and she's listening
Kill the serpent, divide, disperse and grow
Into an oak
Silver lining on a black scale
Wicked hunter, on three hooves, he still rode
But where is the fourth?
You can climb there to your lofty perch
It can teach you the fairy tale of hurt

[Part II: Satchidananda (1:38 - 3:34)]

[Refrain]
Ooooh, aaaah!

[Verse 2]
Mystic referee, don't look on me with scorn
I'm a child; I'm a lover being born
Satchidananda
Disregard the path I'm on

[Verse 3]
You can justify the action should you bless
My ambition and my indecisiveness
Satchidananda
Let me know that you exist

[Bridge 1]
Watch me tremble as I'm answering the phone
I am separate from everything you know

[Verse 5]
Mystic referee, I promise to return
Once I've given up and lessons have been learned
Satchidananda
You can watch my fire burn

[Speaking]
"We were talking junk, right?"
"Yeah."
"Just before the show, this wild-eyed kid came up to the fence
He took one look at us, and he said..."

[Part III: Help Me, Drummer! (3:34 - 4:48)]

[Bridge 2]
Help me! Drummer!
Ticket! Yeah!
Help me! Drummer!
Ticket! Yeah!
Help me! Drummer!
Ticket! Yeah!
Help me! Drummer!
Ticket! Yeah!

[Refrain]
We didn't play his favorite song
Now he'll never come to another show
Now he'll never come to another show
Now he'll never come to another show
Now he'll never come to another show
Now he'll never come to another show
Now he'll never come to another show

[Part IV: Red in the Eyes of Everyone (4:48 - 6:39)]

[Verse 6]
Hospitals and woods confirm (Now he'll never come to another show, now he'll never come to another show)
Red in the eyes of everyone (Now he'll never come to another show, now he'll never come to another show)
Parasites and lovers scrape the meat from bones (Now he'll never come to another show)
Turned into jade and tiger's eye
Save me some dark hair over a face like hers
She'll help the rain come to a pour
Bathroom floor of stone and tiles broke in two
Warm where they touch her porcelain, timid skin
I'm careful to untie this rope
Wrapped in a knot, indifferent
Lion's foot unearthing all the things I've seen
But never truly understood
Rotten wood, from oceans that were never green
Crumbles beneath the canopy, secretly
(Let's pretend he never touched the sugar)

[Part V: Metanoia (Part 2) (6:39 - 9:44)]

[Instrumental]

[Part VI: Watching People Disappear (9:44 - 11:04)]

[Verse 7]
Tonight, under rose
You won't find another wheel to roll
When autumn winds appear
We wear these fears on our right
We just wants to be surreal, cause
All dressed in diamond image jeans
Mercury's found in old field
We miserable in love
And chance we walked right on in
Into the streets of the city, but

[Bridge 3]
Watching people disappear
Without reaching out
Years and years
You're left by yourself
On the wheel

[Part VII: For Carl Jung (11:04 - 13:47)]

[Instrumental Outro]
Come along with us
Come along to Awesometown
Come along with us

"Roll Call!"

Come with us to Awesometown
Fun times are a must
In Awesometown!!!

[Verse]
Have you ever been, have you ever been
To Electric Ladyland?
The magic carpet waits for you, so don't you be late
Oh, (I want to show you) the different emotions
(I want to run to) the sounds and motions
Electric woman waits for you and me
So it's time we take a ride
We can cast all of your hang-ups over the seaside
While we fly right over the love-filled sea
Look up ahead, I see the loveland, soon you'll understand

[Bridge]
Make love, make love
Make love, make love

[Outro]
(I want to show you) The angels will spread their wings, spread their wings
(I want to show you) Good and evil lay side by side
While electric love penetrates the sky
(I want to show you) Lord, Lord Lord I want to show you
(I want to show you) Hmm, hmm, hmm
(I want to show you)
Show you
(I want to show you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down
Down, down, down

[Verse 1]
Well I asked my friend, "Where is that black smoke coming from?"
He just coughed and changed the subject and said, "Oh, I think it might snow some"
So I left him sipping his tea and I jumped in my chariot
And rode off to see just why and who could it be this time
Sisters and brothers, daddies, mothers standing around crying
When I reached the scene the flames were making a ghostly whine
So I stood on my horse's back and I screamed without a crack
I say, "Oh baby why'd you burn your brother's house down?"

[Chorus]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red, Lord
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red, Lord
Somebody's house is burning down down
Down, down, down

[Verse 2]
Well, someone stepped from the crowd, he was nineteen miles high
He shouts we're tired and disgusted, so we paint red through the sky
I said the truth is straight ahead so don't burn yourself instead
Try to learn instead of burn, hear what I say, yeah, yeah
So I finally rode away but I'll never forget that day
Because when I reached the valley I looked way down cross the way
A giant boat from space landed with eerie grace
And came and taken all the dead away

[Chorus]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red, Lord
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red, Lord
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby

[Intro]
Yo yo yo

[Verse]
My mom sent me up to the store with a food stamp
For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the newsstand (Here)
Two dudes ran up, jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him, and bit him
He came back with six or seven dudes screaming "Get him!"
I grabbed one, lit him on fire, pinned and bit him
The next faggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept droppin' 'em in a rhythm
Then I woke up swingin' in the middle of the kitchen

[Outro]
(Damn... damn... damn...)

[Verse 1]
Used to dream of being a millionaire without a care
But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there
'Cause it's over, that just won't be fair, darlin'
I'd rather be a poor woman livin' on the street, no food to eat
'Cause I don't want no pie if I have to cry
'Cause it's over when you said goodbye

[Chorus]
All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone

[Verse 2]
Now I see myself through different eyes, it's no surprise
What being alone would make you realize
When it's over, all in love is fair
I shoulda been there, I shoulda been there, I shoulda, shoulda

[Chorus]
All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone

[Bridge]
I know I pushed you away
What can I do that will save our love?
Take these material things
They don't mean nothing, it's you that I want

[Chorus]
All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone
(I shoulda been there, I shoulda been there, I shoulda, shoulda)
All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone

[Chorus]
Roll Jordan roll
Roll Jordan roll
I want to get to heaven when I die
To hear ol' Jordan roll

Roll Jordan roll
Roll Jordan roll
Oh, I want to get to heaven when I die
To hear ol' Jordan roll

[Verse 1]
My brother, you ought to been there
Yes, my Lord
A-sitting in the kingdom
To see ol' Jordan roll

[Chorus]
Roll Jordan roll
Roll Jordan roll
Oh, I want to get to heaven when I die
To hear ol' Jordan roll

[Verse 2]
My mother, you ought to been there (ooh)
Yes, my Lord
A-sitting in the kingdom
To see ol' Jordan roll, ooh

[Chorus]
Roll Jordan roll (roll Jordan roll)
Roll Jordan roll, oh
I want to get to heaven when I die
To hear ol' Jordan roll
Oh, I want to get to heaven when I die
To see ol' Jordan roll

[Intro]
I tell her, "Baby, don't be scared"
Yeah, baby, don't be scared
Now lil' mama, don't be scared
Listen, shorty, don't be scared
Tell her, "Baby, don't be scared"
Lil' mama, don't be scared, don't be scared

[Verse 1]
Hey, I tell her, "Baby, don't be scared," the sign sayin', "Beware"
My room stay smokey, go outside for some clean air
All around the globe I see these bitches at my shows
Who invite me to their crib sayin' they twistin' up a O
Bunch of haters on the internet
Trust me, I ain't finished yet
I'ma take care of all of y'all like a Giga Pet
People say I'm dead, I tell 'em that they just ain't livin' yet
Excess weed, alcohol, hoes, and cigarettes
Hockey player money, now I'm gettin' checks
Dream come true (Come true)
I get my cake and eat it too
Spendin' all this money like, "Fuck it" (Uh-huh)
The Jew who never budget
It's just ya happy side that you are not in touch with
They knew I spit, didn't listen to me though
That's exactly why they called and I ain't pickin' up the phone (No)
My pops wanna retire, he can't back out
I'ma make a million dollars, take his ass out

[Interlude]
Hey
Ha, I know you feel me, right?
Make 'em say, "Ah, ah"

[Chorus]
I guess it's all for the money, power and success
Livin' life to the fullest, on pursuit of happiness, yes
You wanna hate it, be my guest
But you can't fuck with me when I'm at my best
They keep askin' me, "Why?", askin' me, "Why?", askin' me, "Why?"
"Is this you?" (Is this you?)
Yeah, it's me, you should know that, it's nothin' new
I just tell 'em that it's what I do, yeah, it's what I do (Aight, look)

[Verse 2]
I'm always smokin' in a non-smokin' room
We be soakin' up the fumes
Do the opposite of everything they hopin' that I'd do
I was local for a few until they noticed I'm the truth
Now they loadin' up to shoot, I'm in the open for your view
Not duckin' and dodge, and I tell 'em, "Fuck it, I'm walkin'"
And if they come with a problem, I'ma smile, tell 'em, "Go 'head"
You got no bread, worry what your ho said
Think about the dream that you chasin', don't lose focus
Progress, no stress, whatever happen, happen
I'm laughin' when we passin' 'cause my raps is bringin' cash in
I got a job, a career, I'm the talk of the year
Look at myself and I fog up the mirror
I'm hot and you not, you don't got what I brought
To the table, to the fans you just basic cable
Make this money, blow it all away
That's what the fuck I call a day

[Chorus]
I guess it's all for the money, power and success
Livin' life to the fullest, on pursuit of happiness, yes
You wanna hate it, be my guest
But you can't fuck with me when I'm at my best (Haha)
They keep askin' me, "Why?", askin' me, "Why?", askin' me, "Why?"
"Is this you?" (Is this you?; uh-huh)
Yeah, it's me, you should know that, it's nothin' new
I just tell 'em that it's what I do, yeah, it's what I do

[Outro]
What? And it's the best day ever, haha
This that jazzy shit
Hey, Jerm, this that jazzy shit, brah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it go on, it go on, it go on, it go on, it go on
Hey, hey, it go on, it go on, it go on, it go on
'Til the end of the song
Muhfucka, need to light up your bong
Then I'm gone, and you far
Bitch, why don't you hop up in my car?
We could take a ride to the stars in a spaceship
Me and you could get wasted...

A solider dies once, but 10,000 does for a coward
Miamis my second home, I'm shopping 

[?]

I bet your girlfriend pussy lousy
I see your diamonds very cloudy

[Verse 2]
I got these girls goin' crazy like I was Elvis nigga
They call me Gucci Guwop and I'm one hell of a nigga

Now she bringing her nigga, I wish that I never hit her
She didn't have no ambition, she didn't have no protection
I pay her no attention, but that make it an issue

You's a liar say I kissed her
Confront Gucci bout a bitch and you get slapped wit a pistol (Gucci!)

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Syd tha Kid]
Life's a mess
Mind's in disarray
So are my clothes
As I undress
And pick an outfit for this sunny day
Cause it's okay
I attempt
Not to let my optimism slip away
Cause it's okay

[Hook: Syd tha Kid]
Cause as long as the sun is rising
We can get up, and brighten
Somebody's day
By shinin' bright as the rays
Inside my soul

[Bridge: Yuna Zaraai]
So, maybe you feel it
Maybe you don't
Maybe you love it
Maybe you won't
Maybe the sunshine isn't enough
To heal your pain
So, maybe you play
Or maybe you fold
Baby you stay
Baby go
Maybe you touch me
I'll be afloat
Or maybe we'll stop somewhere down the road
Put on some headphones, sit at my home
Watchin' the sun set
Shed its good light on me, yeah

[Verse 2: Syd tha Kid]
I obsess
Over things that shouldn't matter
But they do
And it affects me
In the worst possible way
But it's okay
We forget
What a big part all the little things can play
And that's okay

[Hook: Syd tha Kid]
Cause as long as the sun is rising
We can get up, and brighten
Somebody's day
By shinin' bright as the rays
Inside my soul

[Chorus]
First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I’d see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah

[Verse 1]
I'm missing your good intentions, I'm missing you from a distance
Hope you did the same
I know that I caused a problem, know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away
Learned it don’t pay to lie cause I don’t wanna see you cry
Saying nothing gets you nowhere fast, I'mma hold it back inside
Well now that I'm back around ya, nothing else really matters
Hope you feel the same

[Chorus]
First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I’d see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah

[Verse 2]
I'm going through old emotions, tryna find a reason
That we ended that way
Nothing in life is perfect, we'll be changing like the seasons
That's what they used to say
If it's going to sleep alone at night, I don’t wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give, no more holding back this time
Well now that I'm back around ya, nothing around me matters
Hope you feel the same

[Chorus]
First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I’d see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah

[Outro]
You know I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right
I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right

[Intro: Yesi Ortiz]
Power 106!
LA, it's ya girl, Yesi Ortiz
Got some brand-new music
I need y'all to turn it up and let me know what you think
It's Lloyd, called "Oakland", on Power 106

[Verse 1: Lloyd]
I was making Japanese and she's watching DVDs
In Oakland, in Oakland
Now I'm driving up the 5 and she waits 'til I arrive
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything that I wanted
Only gotta drive for the moment
If you tell me, "Turn around," then I'm on it
For the moment, but you know me
You know how I get when I'm lonely
And I think about you and the moments
But everything you do is so Oakland, so Oakland

[Chorus 1: Lloyd & Childish Gambino]
Foot on the gas, I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights and the stop signs
I'm ready to go
Before I get to The Bay, babe, that's a problem
Because I'm way too scared to call
And you might get me to stay, and oh

[Post-Chorus: Childish Gambino & Lloyd]
I don't really mind the drive
But I think I'd rather die in Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends on Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old in Oakland, in Oakland
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot in Oakland, in Oakland

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Everything, that I needed
Now that I got you in your feelings
Everything you won't say, you tweet it
And a nigga don’t like that shit at all
So treated
Can we just roll with the feeling?
Can we just roll for a minute?
Wait a minute

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Foot on the gas, I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights and the stop signs
I'm ready to go
But I'm really not ready, girl, that's a problem
'Cause I'm way too scared to fall
And I know you choose to stay, and oh

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
All the girlfriends saying, "Here we go again"
Rich kid, but he act like a gentleman
Last one didn't end like it should've been
Two dates and he still wanna get it in
And they're saying it's because of the Internet
Try her once and it's on to the next chick
X-O the O face on your exes, right?
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have at it
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at it
I was thinking 'bout me, I'd be really bad at it
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah, we can try
So let's try

[Outro: Childish Gambino & Lloyd]
Whoa
I took off my nine-to-five
But you still don't have the time to kiss me, just hit me
And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone?
It's iffy, you miss me
I got furniture to move
And we'll both be thirty soon in Oakland, in Oakland
The only one I know is you
So the fuck I'm supposed to do in Oakland? In Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland

[Produced by Childish Gambino & Ludwig Göransson]

[Verse 1: Big Boy]
One thing that makes me mad is when people get foolish
On Halloween, people start to feel like they're kinda ghoulish
Comin' into my face, sayin' "Hey can I get a picture?
Can I get a picture of you and your son?" and I say "Hold on, I don't want one"
Step back, get away, give me my space
Wait, give me my space, because I may Chris Brown you and punch you dead in your motherfuckin' face
Because I don't like people comin' into my category, into my area
Because they cause mass hysteria
It gets scarier, or should I say it's scary
Because I can hit high notes, kick in your nuts like Mariah Carey
And that's the way it is, so those things make me mad
When my momma passed away, that was the thing that made Big Boy really sad
We're talkin' about mad, we're talkin' 'bout gettin' frustrated
We're talkin' about before me and my girl got married, before we dated
We're talkin' about when people say things about my momma or my family
You can't do that to me, because you can't trust me
Now I'm Ida's son, Keith's brother, Sheila's brother, Kenny's brother
Sharell's brother, Nicole's brother, Sharnice's brother, a whole lot of brothers
But anyway, let me get back on topic
That's the way it is when I kick freestyles, let me stop it
So Kanye, you're here
What makes you mad? Make it clear
I'm fallin' off, let me put my shoes back on, let me tie 'em up
Kanye, here you go, brother, could you please fill up our cup?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Uh, I guess I get mad when you get boxed in
So mad, you wanna start boxin'
So mad, you're gonna turn to Tyson
Slicin' and dicin'
Paparazzi, I'm like a nazi to 'em
I'm not Bill Cosby to 'em
And I ain't Bing Crosby
More like the next Sinatra to 'em
Uh, ayo I got to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to doin'
When people usually do music
I am a visionary, Christian soldier, don't confuse it
Ayo, before I lose it, and have to prove it
This the way that we gon' do it, time we gotta move it to the future
Kamasutra
Any way that suit yah
Don't shoot yah
Stop the violence and it's been stopped
Uh, we stopped the violence in the hip-hop
Uh, we stopped the hatin' and the degredation
Uh, we 'bout to build like one nation
Uh, got off the phone with Benjamin Carson
Uh, that's the next president, arson
Burn it down, burn Hollywood, burn, like Ice Cube said
Uh, I'm the rudest
Lot of people say that, cause they say Ye don't play that
They be off that Grey Goose, I be off that Ye juice
Uh, that's the way I stay loose
Confidence and esteem, American dream
Uh, my crib spacial
Uh, my relationship is interracial

[Verse 3: Big Boy]
You can't categorize me, you can't put me in a box
I'm the ox that rocks, bagels and locks
Learn what you're eatin', learn the menu
Cause I continue to send freestyles through your denu
Or should I say I dim you, down like a lightswitch
That's the way it is, Big Boy, you know I'm not a yitch
I gotta go 'head and censor myself
And if you look into my pocket, I'm a little bit of wealth
But anyway, Ida's son, the real McCoy
Ida's son, the homies, they call me Big Boy
Yesterday, today, 

[?]
I had to drop 7-10 cause it's Kanye West day
In the neighborhood, Power 106, it's all good
That's the way it is, I think you should
Let me get back on, because I'm fallin' off again
Let me kick my volume way past 10
'Because it's Ida's son, the B-I-G
Big Boy's in the house, in the place to be
I don't know why I'm saying these old simple last rhymes
But anyway, I'm Kickin back with some friends of mine
That's louis, E-man, and Kanye, Can't Forget Ricky
That's the man that's on the microphone

[?]
Thats the man thats on the turntables, Willing and able

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I don't where to start, I don't where to start
Maybe the chart, maybe the heart
Maybe the, Maybe the flow
Maybe the ’Go, where i was grow
Where I grew up in, Where you could see
When my momma divorced my daddy and we moved down 

[?]
When we was three, in the cold
Straight from Chicago, where I go
And everybody know
From my homie Don C, I be eh
Ay yo, like IBM
Or Apple Steve Jobs, or this
Yeah, I'm on my job with this
Ay yo its very very simple
You heard me on Jimmy Kimmel
I can do it in every tempo, I use my temple
I wanna build a temple, I wanna build Churches
That could be as big as the Adams Family, where it lurches
Ay yo, this is not a circus
The zoo is closed motherfucker
Ay yo, it ain't no
No cursing in the versing, what you know is not perfect
And you know its still worth it
I might short circuit
I might just blackout
Hit you with that blakka, you know I'm the rocker
Number one Chief rocker, Number one Chief rocker
Ain't nobody gon' stop em', ain't nobody gon' stop us because
I got God on my side, thats the way I ride
Jesus  Christ
Yeezus Christ
Yeezus nice

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I guess I get mad when you get boxed in
So mad, you wanna start boxin'
So mad, you gonna turn to Tyson
Slicin' and dicin'
Paparazzi, I'm like a Nazi to 'em
I'm not Bill Cosby to 'em
And I ain't Bing Crosby
More like Frank Sinatra to 'em
Aye yo, I've got to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to doin'
When people usually do music
I am a visionary, Christian soldier, don't confuse it
Before I lose it and have to prove it
This the way that we gon', time; we gotta move it to the future
Karma Sutra, any way that suit ya
Don't shoot ya, stop the violence and it's been stopped
We stopped the violence in the hip-hop
We stopped the hatin' and the degradation
We 'bout to build like One Nation
Got off the phone with Benjamin Carson
Uh, that's the next president, arson
Burn it down, burn Hollywood, burn like Ice Cube said
I'm the rudest, a lot of people say that
Cause they say, "Ye, don't play that"
They be off that Grey Goose, I be off that Ye Juice
That's the way I stay loose
Confidence and esteem, American dream
My crib's spatial and my relationship is interracial

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I don't know where to start, I don't know where to start
Maybe the chart, maybe the heart
Maybe the flow, maybe the gold
Where I was grown, what I grew up in
Well, you see, my mama divorced my daddy
And moved my family when I was 3
And in the cold, straight from Chicago where I go
And everybody know, from my homie Don C, I be air
Aye, yo, like IBM or Apple, Steve Jobs of this
Yeah, I'm on my job with this
Aye, yo, it's very, very simple
You heard me on Jimmy Kimmel, I can do it every tempo
I'll use my temple
I wanna build a temple, I wanna build churches
That could be as big as The Adam's Family's, where Lurch is
Aye, yo, this is not a circus
The zoo is closed, motherfuckers
It ain't no cursin' in the verse which you know is not perfect
And now you know it's still worth it
I might short-circuit, I might just black out
Hit you with that "BLOCKA!"
You know I'm Ibaka
Number One Chief Rocker, Number One Chief Rocker
Ain't nobody gon' stop him, ain't nobody gon' stop us
Because God on my side, that's the way I ride
Jesus Christ, Yeezus nice!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
One time I had lost my faith
But I had to stay faithful and grateful for the God I was given
The way that I was livin' or the life that I've been livin'
It didn't make a difference
See, when I was 30, I had 6 parents
Grandmother, grandfather, grandmother, grandfather
Mother, father, now I've only got one parent
Life could change in a blink, and that is apparent
But still you've got to stay strong
I don't know what everybody else is on
Sometimes I don't listen to music, I just need to zone out
Sometimes I don't listen to music, everybody clones now
And I doubt they even listen, and I ain't tryna diss 'em
But sometimes I be in music and feel like it's a prison
And everybody say bein' a rockstar is everything
But see, I wanna do everything
And I know I could do everything
And be anything that I wanna be
So simply, if you wanna be like Mike
I wanna be like Christ, I wanna be that nice
You know what I'm saying?
Okay, this beat just threw me off
Took it extra old-school
This ain't no freestyle beat, yo, yo, dude!

[Allen Iverson Snippet]

I'm supposed to be the franchise player, and we're in here talking about practice. I mean, listen, we talkin' about practice. Not a game, not a game, not a game, we talkin' about practice

[Intro]

It's motherfucking me
Bam Bam Shit man
Slap her ass like she scored 30
Ride dirty

[Verse 1]

Thirty thousand for the DNA swab, don't quit your day job
You batty boys ain't even on my radar
Order breasts of veal at Walt Frazier's
Dog, my women come in all flavors, fold paper, Lord save us
Complete a drug deal in a rental rented from AVIS
Best believe my motherfucking Timberlands pounding the pavement
Dog, I lay with hoes, I smoke butter the same color as Jalen Rose
Stand on the balcony naked, just screaming, "Fuck it, I made it!"
Every meal I eat steak to make a statement
Patrick Bateman, thirty Mexicans in the basement, let's get it shaking
The whole block's smelling like bacon
My shorty keep it real, take a shit out the car window
Hide money in a Nintendo
Got a degree in dental
Cook like she down in the delta
Wrestled the gator for the foot display
River monsters, Dog the Bounty Hunter
Open bally stuntin', this is Southern Cali summer, bitch

[Verse 2]

It be the novelist, bare-handed choke a hippopotamus
I need to go to Drug-Dealing Anonymous
Cheerio ship-flip like Rey Mysterio
Me laid up with big money be the scenario
Out the watch flew a canary, it's cuckoo
Let my man who just came home throw a party where you poo-poo
Uh, that is not a nice thought
Get locked up in the afternoon, I make it out by Night Court
Long as I don't see that world
I got the lawyer on retainer like a teenage girl
Eating chicken parmesean in the holding cell
My feet up, hittin' my G-Pen, yeah, you know me well
Quadruple-black coupe, smacks for if you act stupid
No love here, motherfuckers, I clap Cupid, jump in the black Buick
Then make a sharp right
My mother wrist is so cut, look like a shark bite
And when I play the guitar, I'm always on acid
She said I look like David Justice when she see me floating in the Maxima
It's me

[Intro: Usher]
Rocko, Think he gon'; have this hot ass shit?
You don't even know it

You ain't even know it
Rocko!

[Hook: Future]
My niggas all ride with me on, you don’t even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don’t even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don’t even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don’t even know it

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Ay that monster truck, sit tall as fuck, it’s so big can’t even tow it
Don’t like snakes keep my grass cut, so low can’t even mow it
Sip Dom Perri’, little high glow, no no we don’t do Moet
If it ain’t P.J., no Rose from me ho, so don’t even pour it
Specks on Tom Ford, button-down Michael Kors
Always on like the refrigerator, I’m plugged in, ho, you know it
AP and that PK, wear a Breitling when I’m bored
Got a Masterpiece and a 41-millimeter, and you ain’t even know it
Keep the .45 in my pocket: ain’t gon’ show it ’til I have to pop it
Then you gone know it, damn who shot you, they don’t even know it
Hawks game fuckin’ floor it, TV seat front row it
Rocko Da Don CEO it, ain’t gotta rap and you know it

[Hook: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and you don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and you don’t even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don’t even know it
I came up from bottom, you don’t even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don’t even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don’t even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don’t even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don’t even know it

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Got tats all on my skin, up to my forehead
Tryna hide all this pain, I don’t wanna show it
I’m about my dollars, I Creflo it
What’s the use of havin' that ass if you ain’t gon' throw it? (tell ‘em)
I say throw that ass (throw that ass)
Got the city on my back right now, I’mma need shoulder pads
In every photograph I take picture
Niggas know I got them priors Richard
Jealous niggas I despise pistol
And if she a cutie-pie, I’ll eat you
Got half a key in my car, you don’t even know it
I don’t have a key to my car, that bitch foreign
Ammunition on me, I Rambo it
Watch me swag over this beat, I’m flamboyant

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Future]
I’m turned up every day, you don’t even know it
Got your bitch with me right now, you don’t even know it
We turn up in the club, you don’t even know it
Got a hundred bottles comin’, you don’t even know it
We came up from nothin’, you don’t even know it
Drive a half a million dollar car, you don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don’t even know it
Got a bitch that speak no English, she don’t even know it

Get out the way, mister
With your short sharp tips
No, I won't read your lips right now
And baby, hey
You send a shiver down my spine
But do you read my mind
Do you?
And you're looking pretty suspicious
And probably planning a heist
He's wanting to go to the strippers
It makes him feel all nice

(Cigarette smoke yeah)
The cigarette smoke in your eyes
Watching a stripper and
(Smacking a bloke yeah)
Smacking a bloke here tonight

Get out my way, mister
With your short sharp tips
No, I won't read your lips right now
And baby, hey
You send a shiver down my spine
But do you read my mind
Do you?
He's probably got stopped by a panda
For speeding on his way there
Flashing of digital cameras
From tourists in Trafalgar Square
(Cigarette smoke yeah)
The cigarette smoke in your eyes
Watching a stripper and
(Snortin' some coke yeah)
Snortin' some coke off her thighs
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah

[Lil Wayne Talking]
Whats poppin'? Whaddup 5?
The problem with me is i believe in you too much
Whoo! Ya heard me? We in this bitch
Uh.. I dont really consider myself a living legend
Because uh... Sometimes legends arent true
So... And sometimes i dont even feel like im living
So... To answer the question about what it is to be a living legend
Uh! Honestly i wouldn't know
But what it is to be Lil Wayne; its amazin' its awesome
I wouldn't give it up for the world
Ya dig?

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Listen, girl, you want me but he needs you
Yet you're telling me that everything is cool
Trying to convince me, baby, to do as you say
Just go along and see things your way

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ron Isley]
And keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know
We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Secret lovers is what you wanna be
While making love to him, girl, you're silently calling on me
What is a man to do in a situation like this?
I feel there is something that I, I don't wanna miss

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ron Isley]
And keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know
We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Beautiful you are but you're his by far
Coming by my way driving his fancy car
Making plans to be in my life forever
Tell me, tell me that we'll always be together

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ron Isley]
And keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know
We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know

[Outro: R. Kelly & Ron Isley]
Listen, babe, I won't whisper a word
How could you go, so low, so low
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Keep it on the down low

[Verse 1]
Girl I must have been crazy to say that it was over
I had to be a fool to yell out we were through
And now I'm all alone and feeling down and out baby
When I never meant for this to end
It was so, so crazy of me
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby
Bring your loving back to me

[Chorus]
I can't sleep babe
I can't think babe
I can't live babe
Without you in my life
I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothing if I, go away baby
And I can't do nothing if you're, not around

[Verse 2]
Though I must admit that things got out of hand
When you told me that he was just a friend
I should've had my trust in you
From the very start darling
Cause I never meant for this to end
How can we get it back again?
Oh sometimes a man can say things
That he really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby
Bring your loving back to me

[Chorus]
I can't sleep babe
I can't think babe
I can't live babe
Without you in my life
I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothing if I, go away baby
And I can't do nothing if you're, not around

[Bridge]
Baby, can we meet somewhere and talk about it?
Oh baby, can we work it out?
I'm not gonna let you go my baby
Before I let you know that

[Chorus]
I can't sleep babe
I can't think babe
I can't live babe
Without you in my life
I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothing if I, go away baby
And I can't do nothing if you're, not around
Smoke wax, hat low like a marine
The only way to describe the scene was serene
Serena Williams in the BM doing neck thrusts
I need that check cut laid on the deck getting sexed up, green Harley
The only way to describe the colour of the seat was Steve Harvey
Sleep hardly, rock a loafer to the beach party
My weed smell like when your niece farted
Throw acid on your cheek, oh man
Throw acid on your cheek, now you're a work of art
Beauties only skin deep, they'll still accept you
Stuff a quarter pound of drug inside the asshole of a German shepherd
My jacket made of Cuban leopard
My shoe's old habitat was the rain forest
Feed my family with the main harvest
I used to have a snake but that motherfucker escaped
His cousin not so lucky, got made into a bucket hat
I'm truly a classic, shooting dice with Ernie Anostas
Your team'll see gurnies and caskets
That's it, bastard
This shit I mastered
Do a backflip
Out of the black whip

[Michelle]
What is going on and it's Michelle LA's 97-01 radio is what you're listening to. First thing I walk in the door and right behind me here he is Kanye West

[Kanye]
What up

[Michelle]
How are you?

[Kanye]
I'm awesome

[Michelle]
I know you're doing a ton of interviews right now, this is the first time you've been to Amp radio, so I have to say thank you

[Kanye]
Okay, awesome

[Michelle]
This is pretty major and, I don't know, you probably have no way of knowing this, but the very first song I ever played on amp radio, about four years ago, was "Paranoid"

[Kanye]
Well thank you very much

[Michelle]
Absolutely we're huge fans around here

[Kanye]
Thank you, I appreciate that

[Michelle]
Thanks for coming in. So what's the story behind all of a sudden we're seeing you in front of us? Because you haven't done a whole lot of these kinds of interviews but now here you are, so we're thrilled to have you here. You just feel like going out and saying hello?

[Kanye]
Yeah, that's it

[Michelle]
That's awesome. I dig that. So you're out on the Yeezus tour right now which, first, your album is awesome. The live show sold out at Staples on Saturday night, you got another one and then you've got Anaheim on Friday, so tell me a little bit about what to expect at the tour stops, because like I just told you before we went on the air, I saw a little bit of the clips but I feel like it doesn't do it the justice of actually being there and experiencing the show in the moment

[Kanye]
Yeah even if I explain it...you know it's just like creativity central. It's an example of like what DONDA can do - that's my creative company - it's an example of what happens when you put amazing thinkers in a room together and eliminate what they normally do and all the cliches that people slip into and challenge everyone in that room to come up with something completely new, and that's what is, completely new. You know we we experiment with things, and they get better, and it's going to get better as it goes, but if I have an idea, I just do it. I just go for it

[Michelle]
Yeah that's cool, there's a certain fearlessness about you which I really dig. Do you feel like you get crap for that a little bit? The people misunderstand you?

[Kanye]
Yeah I'm not fearless, I just have courage, bravery. Like I have fear, but I overcome my fear. I know how to swim through backlash. I know how to float, I can tread water through backlash. I don't care about backlash if anything, because it's all given me power. Negative, positive, it's all energy and I can use energy

[Michelle]
What really inspires you? I know you're really creative in so many different arenas but what do you look for, what would spark you?

[Kanye]
God. Number one inspiration, God. How can you get something to the you know the greatest. He's the greatest creator of all time, so - if you're being creative - my greatest inspiration is God. He made our universe you know ? So you look that far and say, "if you gotta push hard to create on a more major scale," nothing is more major then the creator. He's given us the power of free will and the ability to create our own space, right

Sometimes people say like, "it seems like you're not satisfied with just creating music," well look at what Howard Hughes did, look what David Stern did, look what Steve Jobs did, look what Da Vinci did, look what Michelangelo did. I have this platform now at age 36 to really put out a lot a creative ideas. Certain people who are not giving me a shot or not backing me, and I can meet with all the billionaires in the world and people just look at me like it's not me, like I haven't created what I've created

So I had to apologize to all the guys in the world for my engagement because I turned up so much on it, but when you go on Jimmy Kimmel and say, "hey I'm a creative genius," I don't think people really understood what I was talking about. So let me make it so y'all can understand what I'm talking about when I say "creative genius" because that's my title

[Michelle]
Do you think you're misunderstood in that aspect? Do you think people just take things the wrong way?

[Kanye]
They just never heard it before. They never tasted that flavor yet

[Michelle]
I just think it's awesome because you have a certain thing about you that you say what's on your mind and your true to yourself and I think a lot of people don't know what to do with that because they're not.

[Kanye]
Yeah and that's what is. If I say, "hey I'm a creative genius," I don't know any other way to explain what I do and the way I think up things and the way I have to fight to get ideas out, had to fight to get my record deal, I'm fighting to be able to make clothes, I'm fighting to be able to make films. It's mixing creativity with the fight, like an athlete.

It's okay for athletes to fight and push it, but they want the creative people to shut up and be quiet. These are the people with the real ideas, that can actually change, can reorganize, can design cities, can restructure a curriculum, can can make life easier you know. That's the part of the game I wanna be in, the "making life more awesome" 

[field] because I'm so blessed.

I've had so many of my dreams come true. I'm getting married to my dream girl, I have a family, I have good friends around me, I've had some opportunities and what I realized is my greatest power...so, if you asked me a question before, "why am I coming, why am I speaking," I'm not a billionaire. I may not be the richest person on the planet, I might not be the most attractive guy, I might not be the most liked, but I - right now - because of "New Slaves" and because of the position I've always taken, have the most powerful voice by a mile and I'm going to use that. I have a trillion dollars worth of voice.

[Michelle]
And that's very very valuable. So you're talking about you're influences, with God and family and your life and enjoying life and, I was thinking just how much your life has changed even in the past six months to a year and how much has that changed your daily 

[life]. Does that mellow you out? Change your perspective on things?

[Kanye]
I hang out wit my the girl and my daughter everyday. There's no place I'd rather be, so now even when I was thinking about the things I'm creating or the things I'm doing in business, my biggest goal is to be able to get home to my family. So even, as I'm thinking about things I'm doing for the future, it's like how can I set it up so I can just be my daughter's soccer coach. How can I put myself in that position?

[Michelle]
I can't imagine you showing up at the soccer game, I just think that would be awesome.

[Kanye]
I'm going to be a soccer coach. Like, I'm going to design the uniforms, I'm going to have to redesigned the minivan maybe 

[laughs]. Maybe me and Elon Musk can design a new type of minivan.

[Michelle]
A new Kanye West mini van. See that's a partnership you could get on board with right there.

[Kanye]
Well DONDA, we want to create everything. We have a perspective on things you see, touch, taste, and feel, just the quality of life. We want to improve the quality of life. It is a product, experience, and content company. So, a form of content could be Yeezus. That is a form of content. Experience could be the concert you went to. A product could be the Yeezy's. Those are examples of things that a collective of creative people have put together

One thing I also want to stress is that the most genius thing about the way I create is to create with other geniuses. To get out of their way. It's not a matter of ego related to any ideas. It's just, who has the best idea? We, actually, are really not ego based in any way. These are things that people put up to confuse you or distract you from what it actually is. At this point it's Michael Jordan time, it's time to go six championships in and let people know this is what we're doing. We're creating at the highest level. I might not be the number one rockstar, but I will be and create the number one creative company. The post internet Disney. The post internet Ralph Lauren

Lay me down at your altar, baby
I'm a slave to this love
Your electric lips have got me speaking in tongues
I have prayed for a power like you
To see deep down in my soul
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower, a desert rose

[Pre-Chorus]
Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and Heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed

[Chorus]
This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all aglow
Like a feather, you make me float

[Verse 2]
Flying high as a kite on your love
Lost in sweet ecstasy
Found a Nirvana finally

Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and Heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed

Raised to fight for the underdogs

I'm a real G fuck a trilogy

[On tour merchandise featuring the Confederate flag imagery]

React how you want. Any energy you got is good energy. You know, the Confederate flag represented slavery. That’s my abstract take on what I know about it.

So I made the song “New Slaves.” So I took the Confederate flag and made it my flag. It’s my flag now, now whatchu gonna do?

[...]

It looks cool. I like at maybe 800 images a day. You know, I’ve been working on clothing seriously for the past 11 years.

It’s colorless also. It’s super, like, hood and super white-boy-approved at the same time. And that’s really what my style’s always been, because I lived in the suburbs, where, you know, I was known as the Black kid, and I lived in the hood where I was known as the kid who spent his summers in the suburbs.

My dad was a military brat, and he would be around white people back then when it was like, racism was really popular and people would be racist against him, and he’d get around Black people and they’d kinda discriminate against him because they’d say he acted ‘white’ or talked ‘white.’ So there are times when I’ll talk and you’ll hear some of that white--or what people call ‘white’--the suburb voice come through and it’s times you’ll hear some of that Chicago come through. I’m influenced by all those things.

I lived in China when I was in fifth grade with my mother, she’s an English professor, and she taught high-level English. And it was my hint at being a celebrity because they hadn’t seen Black people on TV, so people would stare at me all the time.

There will never be another Backstreet Boys, Not in this day and age. It’s gonna be artists like Lorde, singer songwriters, that are gonna come up. This is Instagram, this is the information highway. And I talk to these heads, you know, these older dudes that run companies, and it’s hilarious to me! I only listen to people who are younger than me! These are the only people with ideas. You cannot give me any advice! You can help me. You can support Donda. You can cut a check. But I have the ideas! No one older than me has a better idea than me because I’m the only 36 year old me! I’m the most relevant voice on the planet Earth, at age 36, post being the most hated. So don’t try to tell me anything! Help me! Help me, help other people.

[Do you talk to corporations like that? They don’t like being uncomfortable.]
We are uncomfortable. 500 kids are dying in Chicago a year. We are uncomfortable. Just because we’re being a gated community doesn’t mean that things are comfortable.

The thing is, we have the resources on this planet to have a human utopia, to have respect for each other, mankind. We have that. But we’re too concerned about getting the next Hollywood film on Netflix. We have the resources. There’s new billionaires everyday. You apply the right type of thinkers, like the Elon Musks, the people with the real ideas.

Like, politics is dead. It’s over with. These kids need some type of real truth.
Good Morning America: and we are so thrilled to have Kevin, Joe, and Nick here with us. Thank you all, you've always been so good to us, very good to your fans who always line up to see you. And the burning question - why now, why?

Kevin Jonas: Uhm I think it was time, and for us you know it took some time getting there but we feel like it's time for the Jonas Brothers to come to an end.

Good Morning America: Nick and Joe, I understand that you guys you know, initially were having problems with the new music and you were the ones that kind of started the conversation.

Nick Jonas: Yeah I was actually the one that initiated the conversation, you know we're family first and and that's always been our main priority and so honesty within that, you know within what we do with the group has always been important. So I came to the table with the guys just before we were prepping to leave for tour and I shared my heart with them.

Good Morning America: What did you say to them?

Nick Jonas: Um I think in a nutshell, I said 'look, I feel like we've had some complications within the group for a long time and without addressing them I think this train will fall off the tracks without really getting real with some of the concerns and and some of the limitations that we may feel as individuals in the group' and uh it was a tough conversation not going to lie, it was the first time we really had that real conversation that was a few days of working through it. Now we've all come to a place after a lot of time thinking about it and and talking about it together where where we feel like we're best suited to do our own individual things all things we're passionate about and choose to be brothers first.

Good Morning America: First and foremost, and you all had been going in the individual path to begin with. Joe, so when Nick comes and he starts talking about those complications can you tell us what those complications had been?

Joe Jonas: Uhm to just name a few, I mean I think for us as a band it was the music. For us we kind of held on to it for so long, that we kind of at one point a year later we still kind of felt like it was starting to get stale to us. It was just individual things that we were just kind of butting heads about, whether if it was a way to set up a music video to even just whatever even just personal opportunities and it just at some point we decided it was best to just finish this and support each other on our own ventures along the way

Good Morning America: Brothers first and foremost as you all keep going back to, but you did release new music this year, hits - "Pom Poms", "First Time"

Nick Jonas: Yeah pom poms, first time

Good Morning America: So are you going to complete the album?
Kevin Jonas: The album will actually not be completed but we will be doing something. We're going to release four of the unreleased songs from the album, uhm the rest of the album will be uhm never released, but then we also have gone back in the studio and finished recording, the live we put together  the live tracks from the last summer tour about ten songs as well. So We'll be actually be giving that to our fan club members as a gift just from us.

Good Morning America: So again, thinking of your fans. And Nick, I mean you're talking about the individual things, I mean we've seen you on Broadway again recently I mean what is, what does the future hold for each of you individually beginning with you Nick?

Nick Jonas: I think we're really in a season right now of being really excited about the future, but also there's a certain happiness about closing a chapter and understanding that you know we have the best fans in the world and have for our entire career so we thank them for that, and thank them for really understanding this move for us and you know I think that for me personally will be recording music, writing for myself and for other people. Some acting opportunity and maybe a return to theater at some point you know I love being in the city so close to all of you here.

Good Morning America: Yeah, thats where we, that's how we first got to know you in many ways. And you Joe?

Joe Jonas: It sounds a little similar to Nick, but music on my own and acting and there's a lot of other ideas, but uhm kinda jumping into it I mean this is the first time in a long time that we've have time to focus on ourselves, and support each other through that. And like Nick said, you know we know it it's gonna be sad for a lot of people, but for us we are, we are looking forward to the future and obviously like Nick said, there's a happiness that comes with talking about something like this.

Good Morning America : And you're going to be uncles soon to be, you know Kevin - you and Danielle and the reality show and having a baby coming soon.

Kevin Jonas: Yeah we are, we're having a baby and we're really looking forward to it and even beyond that as well I'm going to be going into my first passion which was you know the business sides of things and I'm in the first round of funding of entertainment fund that will position brands to target millenials and so I'm kind of pouring my passion into that as well as being a father.

Good Morning America: Any chance of getting back together down the road? Never say never.

Nick Jonas: Yeah, yeah. I think its impossible to say forever with anything you know but uhm I feel like we're playing it one step at a time right now and like we said rebuilding as brothers first and starting there.

Good Morning America: Aw well great, you have great folks good family jand just thank you thank you for sharing your talents and we're going to be hearing from you all again this isn't this is just so long for a little bit but thank you for coming forward and talking I know it means a lot to your fans.

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Something's burnin', I can't figure out what *sniffs* (Out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must
Just be the powder from the power of (Love!)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone (Ah!)
Is that my soon-to-be-spouse’s moan?
And the further I walk, the louder (Ah, ah!)
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
‘Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her (Ah!)
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts—brace!
Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo!"
‘Cause my head already goes to worst-case
Scenario, though in the first place (Ah, fuck)
But you confirmed my low-end theory though (Ah!)
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate (Oh!)
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
"No, (*slurp*) you don't (*slurp*) under— (*slurp*) —stand, (*slurp*)
I (*slurp*) don't (*slurp*) do this for (*hic*) anyone, (*hic*) ever (*slurp*)"
Yeah, that ain't what they all say?
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiancé
'Til you sucked on Wayne, André, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, JAY, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwamé?!
Guess I'm gettin' my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?
‘Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin' (Ha)
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin' the—

[Pre-Chorus: Wayne Fontana]
Game of love, love, love, love
La-La-La-La-La love

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I told that bitch, "I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick"
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on me—fuck you think, we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day!" (*Phone hangs up*) Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me? You cut me deep as Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home training
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin', "I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile you're chasin' her"
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with her

[Pre-Chorus: Wayne Fontana]
Game of love, love, love, love
La-La-La-La-La love

[Chorus: Both & Kendrick Lamar]
She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché
It's all my fault anyway, she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behaviour
Back together, but forgot today was her B-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' seventy-three, thank God there's an exit comin' up
What the mother-F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
Hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racin' at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, ‘cause she's layin' next to me in bed—directly aimin' a gat at my head!
Woke up again and jumped up
Like, "Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab"
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic
I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, "Hit the road", then after she left
I sent that bitch a text that said, "Be careful driving
Don't read this and have an accident"
She glanced to look at it and wrecked (*Car crashes*)
Too bad, thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oréal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin'
While the whore was yellin', "Rape!"
'Til her vocal cords were swellin'
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date though
Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of— (*Message sound*)
Wait, "dinner at eight"? I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the—

[Outro: Wayne Fontana]
Game of love, love, love, love
La-La-La-La-La love

[Intro: Mystikal]
Say it (Hit 'em), goddamn!
(Hit 'em) Goddamn! (Hit 'em) Goddamn!
Say it, Lord (Hit 'em), goddamn! Yeah
(Hit 'em) Goddamn! (Watch it, hit 'em)

[Chorus: Kai]
Where, where, where, where
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
(Who am I?)
Rec League, I ain't paying to ball
Y'all B-string like a broke guitar
And I still put it down like the family dog
Yeah, I murder some, murder one
Explain it all, Ferguson
We ain't gotta sing the same old love song
Cut a white girl with the same black gloves on
Yeah, what you saying to it?
Old money look, no money don't do it
Make 'em turn around in their lane like a U-ie
And I'm only looking back if I'm looking at her booty
(At her booty) What's the rationale?
They wanna smoke niggas when they black & mild
So we acted out—okay, cool

[Chorus: Kai]
Where, where, where, where
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Blue dream by the bouquet
'Til I'm blue-faced on a Tuesday-day-day-day-day
Can I have some? #NiggasBeLike
Put a +18 on an e-vite
And I said what I felt, no re-write
Nah, nah, they can't hold me
June, July—drop something
I double dare you, I'm Marc Summers
I scorch winters, I burn autumns
Gut niggas, so Kurt Vonne
Elle Varner, got a crush on her
I gotta wait in line for that
Ain't nobody got time for that
Ain't nobody gotta rhyme with that
Too true like it's 2 Chainz
Blue blood like he both gangs

[Chorus: Kai]
Where, where, where
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, where, where

Fire! Fire! (Hit 'em) Goddamn
(Hit 'em) Goddamn! (Hit 'em) Goddamn!
Where, where, where, where
Fire! (Hit 'em) Goddamn!

[Michelle]
I like that because I thought you're on the way to doing things differently, all the promotion around your album. It was really like just awesome to me, because it wasn't the traditional roll out that they do to radio where they send the single and then they're doing is they're doing that and, you know, you're doing an appearance on, you know, whatever TV show. But it was really cool. It was like when you showed in over 60 cities. You showed the-- you know, I wouldn't even call them videos. It was more of like a-- just an art exhibition that you did in these different cities. It is kind of, "What's spurred that, to do it that way?"

[Kanye]
I mean, we have dreams. We wake up, and we make them happen. I appreciate that my label allowed me to go unorthodox with that. And there's people at the label who appreciate it and there's people who don't appreciate that. It's like non-traditional in that way. But I have to push. And really, it's all practice to me. Being a musician is practice. Life is practice. You know, so it's not like a in go-- so I'm fine to make a mistake. I'm fine to, like, put out an auto tune album that no one understands. I'm fine to put out a complete punk new wave album that no one understands. I'm not trying to maintain, you know, some spot in the hip-hop charts on radio or something like that. I'm trying to open up people's minds. I want people to think more. I want people to feel like it's okay to create. I want people to feel like it's okay to make mistakes in front of people and follow what their dreams are and not feel boxed in. I want people to feel like, you know, awesome is possible. I want them to, you know, feel like, you know-- it's not a matter of just even what I'm doing at DONDA. It's the amount of people that are hearing me and now they're going to fight to get the best ideas out. Because the world will only be saved through good intention and design, It's not going to be saved is politics. The irony is, what holds things back? Politics! So how could that push things forward?

[Michelle]
I heard you say that you were trying to work out a deal with the Gap and politics held you back from doing that with your merchandise for the tour, and it may be just wonder what, sort of-- elaborate on that. What are you talking about when you say "politics?"

[Kanye]
I mean it, like, what would happen if I was able to design a collection and was like backed by the Gap? It would be awesome, right?

[Michelle]
It would totally be awesome, but then my question for you is, but you have-- you're not hurting. You're doing well, so couldn't you just do that yourself? You don't need the Gap.

[Kanye]
No, you can't. You need the infrastructure. It's not a matter of just having money.

[Michelle]
But you have a great staff set up in everything, I feel like...

[Kanye]
No, I don't have a great staff at all. That is a skill set that takes years and years of anything. If I wanted to get into the coal business and I had-- and also, "well-off" is that, that is-- what's the word I'm looking for? I'm trying to use the simplest word sometimes. Yeah, it's all relative. Because I'm not, because, okay-- I could make an amount that seems, like, really crazy to people, like 10 million a year, right? To open up a new fashion company might costs 15 million. So if I went and took all the money I had and I invested it into trying to do it like that, it could leave me 5 million in debt.

[Michelle]
That's fair enough, I get that.

[Kanye]
And then you're not well-off.

[Michelle]
That's-- yeah-- I'm sorry, I know it's not all about money, but I've just been saying that the team that you have at DONDA and-- I would think that you could hire anybody that may want to come and work for you.

[Kanye]
I'll-- now we are. Because of what we're doing. Because of the way we're turning up. Now we can get real designers, real infrastructure. But it's really hard. Just as much as, you know, getting a creative person is hard, it's hard to get the back office guys; the people that run the-- 

[?] who do the real work. Yeah, you get the Rihannas, the Big Seans, the Kanyes, but you need the Barry Weiss, the Steve Barlows and 

[?], and like these people, you know, all the people all the people who get mentioned on the Grammy speeches, and you just can't, that's-- what you're saying is like-- Okay, you're a major recording artist because you signed to a major label. Can't you just do independent clothing? The answer is, "No." Now, can't you just get a clothing deal from a major label? The answer is, also, currently is, "No." And that's the issue. That's the Truman Show wall. That's the glass ceilings. That's the Michael Jackson can't get his video played. Because everybody-- nobody is looking at what Obama is wearing. I'm the number one most influential person on the globe in fashion. 

[?] is a great designer. I love Saint Laurent and their $1 million dollar jackets and everything. I love it. But, I should have backing from one in the majors. Louis Vuitton group which is Bernard Arnault, Karen group, which is France Rapinoe, or Renzo Rosso, who owns Diesel and Margiela. Bottom line. And that's the only way it's going to be, because the thing is, when you try to go, you know, when you go less that, the level of the product is just isn't where should be. Yeah I'm doing T-shirts that are amazing. We put all our design into it, and so many people like T-shirts. And I love that. I get people T-shirts. But I also want to create entire gyms. Like gyms. Like I want to make a gym. I wanna make a store. I want to do apartment complexes. I want to build cities. I want to be involved with hyperloop when it comes to reality, with Eli Musk. That's the conversation I want to be in. So I will not be held into a box of being a musician, or that you get it somehow confused. I don't look like a rapper. Now rappers look like me, but when I started, I wasn't gangsta enough. You know what I'm saying? Like, I'm getting married to Kim Kardashian, and I've never played in the NBA.

(Laughter)

[Michelle
Oh my god.

[Kanye]
So, that's thought.

[Michelle]
You know, you raise a really good point here. If you just joined us, I'm Michelle and we're live on 97.1 Radio Los Angeles with Kanye West. You know, in creativity in rap music, do you think that, because I don't-- you definitely don't do things like everybody else. Do you think there's a certain lack of originality and creativity, not, you know, I'm not going to say that for all rap, but it seems like you do things a little differently. And a love that that; with music, I mean.

[Kanye West]
There's a lack of creativity in every field, because people are afraid. Because the powers control people. And the only place where people can be fully creative is in Silicon Valley. Everything else, there's an old regime. And oligarchs are controlling whether or not you're going to be able to feed your kids. So no one can say the type of stuff that I'm saying because they'll lose their job.

There is a a lack in creativity in Hollywood. There's a lack in creativity in clothing. There's a lack creativity in the education system. There's a lack in creativity on the globe period! @hen you look up and look at billboard ads, the majority of them suck. There's a lack creativity in advertising, in agencies. There's just a lack, because the person with the good idea needs to pay dues for 20 years before their positioned to say the idea, and they might not have the relevancy anymore. Right now, I have the relevancy and I have the perspective and I have the voice and I'm going to scream as loud as I can. And ain't nothing gon' happen to me except success.

[Michelle]
You're here to save it, man. At least, like, change it, which I love. Whoo! That heat, I love that.

There's so much passion because I share a lot of the same-- where the view is my passion, and I feel like people don't always get it. You know, and they're like, "Gosh, it's kind of harsh" with everyone. You've just got to be true to yourself. You know? I got to-- by the way, before I forget, you know with your clothing and your fashion, we were just talking about your merch line.

[Kanye]
Really quick, and don't forget your question, please. I wanna stop using the term "fashion," because Eve made Adam bite an apple. And since then, it's been illegal to be naked. I'm helping people follow the law in style. I'm helping people with their opinion on how to follow the law. This isn't about fashion. I'm creating new standards, things so you don't have to think about it. Fashion is too high of a skill set. It just needs to be easy. Easy as the hoodie and jeans that I'm wearing. And I'll do all the hard work. I'll figure out exactly where that collar goes and exactly where that hoodie sits and-- and how many times you can wash that fabric and stuff so that it looks better 5 years from now. I'll do the hard work for you. Fashion is forcing people to do all this hard work where you look back 2 years from now and say, "That looked crazy!"

There are certain things that are just standard. A suit jacket is a suit jacket is a suit jacket. A hoodie is a hoodie is a hoodie. Jeans are jeans are jeans. And a Michael Jordan sneaker is a Michael Jordan sneaker. Now, let's take our kids to the park. It's not about fashion. It's about life, and me helping it become more awesome...

(TO BE CONTINUED)

In the crew, nah nigga we don't know you
I pulled up in the old school and I been fucking up the Pro Tools
That brand new mixtape gon' make them haters fix they face quick
Put a hundred million on my bracelet and I done scraped off in the grey whip
In a grey whip, about eight clips, gon' be a long trip getting paid
Young Dre that be my name and I go hard like everyday, real shit
Last crown, nigga last crown, nigga back down, in my town
I'm the one nigga I'm on fire these old rappers need to retire
I say that shit cus I mean it, real shit man I dreamed it
Made it to reality, no more technicalities
K hit your face and that shit will make a tragedy
I spit flow so rapidly, I post up bout 80 deep

[Hook]
A young ass nigga on the grind, all that I got is this money on my mind
They asking bout the kid tell 'em I'mma be fine
28 inches make that thing rewind, one more time
X2

[Verse 2]
On the internet boys, they talking about the kid
They say young Soulja Boy Tell'Em is in the street making biz
Big business with them people in the business suits
We getting money everyday man salute to them troops
Shouts out to my people yeah we know we making it happen
Everyday we get that paper put that food on a platter
Man, we gon' work until this thing get better
We gon' go so hard, call me butter and clever
Call me smarter than ever I see, some people know it
I see, some people face it I see, some people blow it
Some people choose to ignore it but some people gotta face it
This shit right here is pure, going back to the basics
Taking it down, this the last crown
I put that shit on my momma two-thousand-twelve we're going down, down
Down, down two-thousand-twelve it's going down mane
Pass me the chopper I'mma load a hundred rounds mane

[Hook]

[Hook]
Is it because I'm black?
Somebody tell me, what can I do?
(Cause their ain't enough bars
To hold the the drama that we've been through)

[Verse 1]
Right here, right now, I do declare
That I'm more than a gangster, mack, pimp or a player
I swear I ain't never told on nobody
It started in '82 at a 'hood house party
Half Ded, Lil' Loc and my nephew D
Not knowin' what we do, but this is RTC
Heart sparked, puttin' flags in Tucane Park
I leave the house for school, but I come back after dark
You feel me?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
More power, more leadership - unifying Bloods and Crips
I used to smoke a pack a day, I used to have to pack a K
Now I've got brothers in suits in my faculty
Pushin' peace in the streets - North, West, South and East
Student of the game, yeah it's time to make a change
So I'm following, no more swine swallowin'
I'm gon' just walk the walk of a righteous man
Try my best to rewrite this plan
As-salamu alaykum, sir
Yeah, that's the plan...

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm down with Obama just to add a little drama
And I'm rollin' with the Nation, but I've been doin' that
Had a talk with my mama, had to let her know that I'mma
Make a change, and she said: "baby, go ahead and do that"
Farrakhan is a prophet and I know it cause he show it
And he told me, so I'm teachin' brothers how to be peace
What's wrong? We too strong, and if we all get along
They could never penetrate us, all they do is motivate us
Haters...

The enemy is always watching for leadership that will rise among black people because it is only by organizing effectively that you can change the reality under which we live

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Erick Sermon]
I'm like go, team Eric', I was born with dopeness, just why you inherit
This is why I'm hot
Playboy, approach me wrong, this is why I shot
Ball, I get the game from my pop
Till everyone know my name the game don't stop
So I keep pumping the block, until I'm big as Rihanna and Mason's rock
While you love Sosa, I'm over here, loving this RG3 redskin that's on my sofa
Her ass alone, man, bigger than Oprah
Puerto Rican and Dominican, first name Rosa
Anyway, let me explain one time
Foowzy, we up in here making the movie
Check slate, it's a wrap, I'm a bigger nigga with figure
You figure how's that

[Hook]
But wait, let me explain this
But wait, let me explain this
Say I'm the best
Little ass nigga, say It with your chest
Hey, hey nigga look real quick
Hey, hey nigga look real quick
Hey, hey nigga look real quick
Hey, hey nigga look real quick

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
My money bigger than homie, you funny niggas is phony
Tony told me just show me so I gotta get mine
Let me just slip into the back of the wide
Open your eyes, let your window down
Now you on the passenger side
Get in, now you get it, better yet, with it
One come test me now, tell 'em the line get it
And bit them off a chip or the block or the wood
Little homie couldn't rock if he could
Click cocking and pull, hip hoping over the lot of the bull
And yes, I am paid in full, for shizzle minizay
That's all I'mma here say, all kisses cause I'm too mean
Too cold, too slick
Hey, hey nigga look quick
That nigga Snoop about to take your bitch with no hesitation or explanation

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Like a room full of black, uproar heat
They see the flow back, getting all geek
It's like I'm Pete Charles, from Mall Street
They come and count money but talk cheap
But rappers walk quick and I'm all feet
Every line authentic, that's all me
My man son autistic, that's low key
That Wire I go and get it, I'm so G
That why with the fittest, so low key
Thats why killer critic with no fee
Then tell the judge I did it and go free
E, double E, my codeine, letst throw the book at em , what's your plea?
Guilty as charged, thats how it is when you're guilty or charged
Took a bunch of death artists and built me a squad
What's today's mad bill with the guard
We eat women in cars, lock the game down I'm givin it bars
What is life if you ain't living it large?
If you ain't living it large go get the price check it and get you a job
But wait

[Hook]

[Hook]
Groove thang, groove thang, groove thang...
Yeah, cause I be rockin' my two chains
And I do things, and I do things...
Yeah, cause I be all on my groove thang
My groove thang, my groove thang...
Yeah, just watch me now in my groove thang...
My groove thang, my groove thang...
Yeah, cause I be all on my groove thang
Yeah, just watch me now...

[Verse 1]
Too hippy to be cut-throat - hippies blow the best smoke
Rollin' up RAWs and living royal
All my and bays & jays is loyal, they won't leave me cause I spoil
The baddest of them all, the hash is why I won't fall
Molasses can't match my crawl, I'm higher than all of y'all
They sayin' they born to ball, I'm sayin' I'm Santa Claus
Funny jokes I tell all, always inhale fog
Nappy dreads, my hair long - Diamond 5-foot bong
Could never be a clone...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's a new thang and a new look
Kids be makin' our names in the book
Who you wanna be when you grow up?
The Broadus Boyz, we actin' up
We showin' out and we show up
We ballin', it's all we know, it's not an option
You see us, and yes, we poppin'
Standin' tall, we not fallin'
On top, and yes, we callin' shots
What you thought? I'm in charge and I'm the boss
Do a show and then we shop for the flyest gear
We up in here, dippin' and dodging, man, changing gears
This the life we chose, so you gon' hear this all year

[Hook]

[Intro]

[Chorus 1]
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes

[Verse 1]
Here are we, one magical moment
Such is the stuff, from where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean
Lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no colour
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement
From Kether to Malkuth
There are you, drive like a demon
From station to station

[Chorus 1]
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Making sure white stains

[Verse 2]
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
And oh, what will I be believing
And who will connect me with love?
Wonder who, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high

[Verse 3]
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love

[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is near

[Verse 4]
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her

[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here

[Verse 5]
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?

[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is near

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love

[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here

[Verse 4]
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her

[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here

[Verse 5]
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?

[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here
I'm eating sushi off a black hooker
Crushing numbers in the math booklet
She had the panties with the pussy cut out
Jewish holiday, she bake the bread
Then she twist my hash, I get her high, take her straight to bed
I'm diving in, I'm riding in that V-12 twin turbo on the Gaza Strip
Rocking Iversons with the ivory wheel
No practice, I'm classic, you bastards
I front-flip in limo windows, sip the limoncello
Somersault into a dismount off the uneven bars, then throw my hands straight up
Fuck around, sprain my ankle with the next maneuver
I'm one in a million, played the pavilion
Fuck around in the razor, get displayed to your children
We hire Asians for killings, ready, able, and willing
Getting paid in the building
It's me, on the ice cream truck
Bam Bam, Queens shit

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Yes...
Wake up in the morning 20 million in a safe
Bank account pulled up 

[?] estates
Lobster and a steak man I'm living by the lake
And I know a lot of love, and I know a few hate
But let me demonstrate, the skills of my character
And demonstrate a beast on the wall intellectual
Man on my schedule a whole lot of money-getting
So I hustle hard everyday and it's evident I'm relevant
I'm Soulja Tell'Em man I kill'em quick
I hit the microphone and I make a lot of sense
I spit a lot of skills I got the skills to pay the bills
I got the skills to make mills and let me tell you how I feel
Man I swear that I feel greater, giving thanks to all my haters
And then I say a prayer and then I get back to this paper
And honour to our father, and honour to my mother
My person who is not here, is Soulja Tell'Em my brother, except…

[Hook: Unknown]
Say to me, I'll say to you
Won't you believe in me, like I believe in you
After all the things, you put me through
Won't you believe in me, like I believe in you

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
If I only knew, if I only knew? If I only knew
Back then if I only had a couple clues
On the news, checking out who's who
The rich people in America, who are you?
What ya got, how much ya got, where ya live?
How much about, how much about?
Look, my bank is thick so my flow is too sick
I hit the block with a whole lot of fucking chips
I got more chips than a casino
My paper stack tall like Pringles
I'm classic like Al Pacino
Scarface and mandingle, your girl love it
In my house, wherever, in fucking public
It's nothing of it, I'm hot like I'm fresh out the oven
And I look better wherever I'm up
It's Young Beezy man I really gives no fuck
I terminate each track and it's no luck

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
Wealth, riches, what does this mean?
Living your dreams, or living someone else's?
Word around town man I really can't help it
This is an honour to express my blessings
And this here is a strong song, and the weak can listen
Take what I'm saying man I swear I'm not tripping
This right here is for everybody

[Skit]

Brown girl, brown girl
Turn your shit down
You know America don't wanna hear your sound
Boom boom jungle music
Go back to India
With your crazy shit, you're bombing up the area
Looking through your Instagram
Looking for a pentagram
All I see is poor people, they should be on ghetto-gram
You don't get our underground
Brofest or overground eat ham
Fist pump, even throw your dick around
Yeah you try to stick around
Do you do you bikram?
Let you into Super Bowl, you tried to steal Madonna's crown
What the fuck you on about?
Think about goin to France, quelle heure est-il
This ain't time for your terror dance
Eat, pray, love
Spend time in the Ashram
Or I'll drone you
Kony 2012
Now scram!
(Boom boom shakalaka) x12

[Produced by Party Supplies]

I got the '89 Firebird
Guns like Wyatt Earp
Before I do business
I want to know the buyer's worth
Fast forward '98, Mark McGuire shirt
I eat dessert while your bitch flirt (Uhh)
Ship work to a Mick out in Pittsburgh
When you're focused, strict terms are never misheard
Shift gears, schhherrp
Twist Earth
Lift the Nerf
Shit, I got a lot of nerve
Catch me on the run with a Nevada nurse
Rambo knife in the Escada purse
Lestor Diamond in the face, chase
I'm in the gray 8
Restaurant, I order rabbit like a Playmate
Suede snake, crocodile silk
Barely legal Brazilian mami all on the quilt
I twist a bitch like Wilt, built
I spit the shit the people feel, uhh, yeah
Let me take it out to Coney Island, uhh
Drinking 40's out in Rockaway, uhh
Jones Beach Field 6, uhh
Out in Deer Park, peel whips, uhh
Flushing Meadow Park shit, uhh
Barbecues with the Mexicans
Get my muthafucking drink, man
Damn, this is Bam Bam
This is about to be some shit
Blue Chips 2, bitch (Owwww!!!)
We so muthafucking out here (Owwww!!!)
I wear a bib all muthafucking day

[Sample]
Muthafucka, you knocked my teeth out!
Hey, Sticks, come on!

[Verse 1]
Catch me on Venice Beach working on my base, no blonde streak
Swimming trunk, 30K in arm's reach
I'm on the boat, in the water like a swan's feet
To show respect you kiss both sides of the Don's cheek
360 on the Seadoo in a tux
Call my homie, tell him meet me down in Lido Beach for lunch
Plácido Polanco crib, his bitch was black
She started purring, I kissed the cat
Aristocrat, wrist dancing like a disco bass
In the holster, same shit color as Sisqo's hair
635 slammed like a suplex
Cheat off a Chinese kid just like a school test
I'm on the hunt for loot, jump out the chunky coupe
Hold on, wait till it thunder, here's the gun to shoot
Beige leather to the calf, where my math at?
You gonna babysit my joint? Then pussy pass that

[Hook]
I'm getting paper regardless, I'm never facing no charges
I got your honor under the armpit
The gavel slam and I walk
Hammer dances on the porch, downtown gallivanting with a horse
Two different drugs to choose, I need the third thing
Oriental style shirt
Flapping in the wind like a bird's wing
I need that good green, ugh, motherfucker need that good green

[Verse 2]
I got the face like a grown lion, my people hold iron
Predict the weather by the wind like an old Mayan
Hold my son up, show him to the kingdom
While all his blood brothers became drug runners in England
Made in Queens, Handball courts and 40s
Shorties smoking blunts, spades in the corner
We moving white like David Spade in the sauna
All the money chronological, it look like callaloo
Provide the crew designer suits, exotic food
Erotic nude and polished shoes, impala smooth
Roll up, looking like Sinbad with the earring
Lightskin sucking my penis while I'm steering
I'm pro

[Hook]
Yeah
So give me that reason
I told you I loved you already, bitch, what the fuck?
Yeah

Shawl neck on the drunk lawyer
Coke shits in the toilet
Turkey sandwich in aluminium foil
The game been fixed
I don’t play that shit
I aim that shit
If she looking at another mother fucker than you leave that bitch
I don’t play that shit
Hear me
Left hand is steering
In a Amadu Diablo
Shit I got the urge to get a earring
Image in the rearview mirror like Timothy Leary
Don’t even come near me
I keep it thug with a gun near me
Your boy been eating on the run clearly
Clear the run-way
720’s on a one way
So much drugs, what would a nun say?
And its Sunday
Shit, I don’t really give a fuck
All I really want to do is see my people up
Up to no good again
She threw the condom told me put it in
I did, fuck
I nutted in like three strokes
Shit, now that’s no way to rep the East Coast
Every day I’m walking with my head up
Don’t let up ‘cause it’s a set-up
Like Albanian marriage go from Haiti to Paris
The bath was 90 degrees
Tapping Heinies with ease (shit,)
Bitch please I’m the bee’s knees
Shooting Deca-Durabolin three CC’s
Peep the landscape
You can catch me in the trees like the shit for the pancakes

[Intro]
Aw man, smoking in that rocking chair, uh

[Verse 1]
My past life I was a Rabbi, now I live the fast life
Drugs on standby in the circle by the campfire
Telling stories of yesteryear
Pull out the pocket mirror just to check my hair
Hit it with the comb again
The rap Dennis the Menace with Dennis Rodman's in Venice, inventive
She took a bump and started dancing like Elaine Benes
The big chain sway like I’m playing tennis
One man team, about to win the pennant
Now you can tell by my pendant that I’m protected
Direct descendent in the blue and orange Lexus watching ‘Se7en'
Land in Dublin
Pull me in the room and ask if its resin
I said no, they sent me on my way with blessings

[Verse 2]
I trained a dolphin to let the slammer off like Dolph Lundgren
That’s if your mouth running, you’ll get your couch sunked in
I’m rare like a fucking Asian playing hockey
My ocean view is due to Papi
Bitches call me Rodney
Bought my bitch a present hope I don’t spoil it
‘What is it baby?’
Face to face toilets
Toyota with the spoiler Ace of Base boiling
I play ball like Billy Hoyle
Now I need a Sidney Dean to help me start this brothel in the Philippines
I stay in Flushing like I’m Dillon Gee
You ain't gotta open the comic book to figure who the villain be
It’s me doing perfect dives in the Sicilian sea
You know I like my bitch with a Brazilian V
Bumping Bobby Brown
Cry when I’m not around
She always hold it down, pound under the seat
In that all white Jeep sleep, that’s if you wanna
I be schwitzing in the sauna
It's better than the piggies blitzing on the corner
Come in the crib every night, and I kiss my daughter
Same lips spit on the lawyer
*spitting noise

[Outro]
We out
It's me
Always forever

[Action Bronson]
Uh
Waxy
Smoking that Barbara Walters wax
Same fucking outfit twenty days in a row I don’t give a shit

[Verse 1 - Action Bronson]
You only came around ‘cause you thought I had some money for you
You got it fucked up
That’s for the kids
And If there’s anything left I’ll cop a crib
And If there’s anything left after that I’ll cop a six
How you think I got the art displayed on the dinner plates?
First course was from the Finger Lakes
Last course cinnamon ginger cake
She gave me head during the Laker game
I got her tatted, trying to erase her name
No, I caught her cheating, her pussy didn’t feel the same
She was probably with one of the Broncos
Or LeBron so I blew her car up
Soon as she try to start it up, nah
I can’t talk about that though…
Your chance is thin like the moustache of Puerto Ricans
Shooting guns with my daughter on the weekend
Smoke the budder same color as The Weeknd
Stashed under the sole of the sneaker *laughs
Fuck
Fuck man
Stashed under the sole of the sneaker
Smoke the budder same color as The Weeknd
Uh

[Verse 2 - Action Bronson]
Told the driver Lenny swing me by the garden I gotta talk to Pat
Hit him with stacks
Showed him the gat like ‘you gonna miss the finger roll right’
Fuck
I Told the driver Lenny swing me by the garden I gotta talk to Pat
Showed him some stacks
Then showed him the gat like ‘you're gonna miss the finger roll right?’
Yes Mr. Baklava
Then I cartwheeled into a aqua car

[Action Bronson]
*trails into laughter
Shit!
Its too crazy right?
Yo
Its just fucking nuts
We just talking crazy at this point

[Verse 3 - Action Bronson]
I told the driver Lenny swing me by the garden I gotta talk to Pat
Showed him some stacks
Then showed him the gat like ‘you're gonna miss the finger roll right?’
Yes, Mr. Baklava
Then I cartwheeled into and aqua car
Now I’m, sliding
Ma, your boy has made it, no more
Crying
The facial reminiscent of a lion
Fuck around I’ll send you back to zion
And I ain't even trying
Swing the wood wheel like lumberjacks
I remember back when they wouldn’t spend a stack on my rap
Now they want to wipe my ass in the crack after I shat
And I just had corn beef hash
Ew…

[Verse 4 - Big Body Bes]
Yeah
It’s me
Motherfucking Big Body
I’m back for the fucking sequel, man
You know I had come and to spice this shit the fuck up
Mr. Fuckin Sazon himself
I’m over here fucking wiling

Motherfuckers done came up
Whole lot of different motherfucking moves are being made
You know what time it motherfucking is
So my lifestyle done changed a little bit

Motherfuckers is out here spinning stupid shit
But you know me, man

Sometimes a little low but I get them back up, man
Fill them up like the fucking gas tank

Shouts to all my motherfucking Dominicans out there in the Heights
All of that, 172, 174
Wiling

Nah, I don’t even want a motherfucking ounce, B
Give me motherfucking 40 dimes
That’s how I want it
In a brown fucking bag
Yeah, tato Papi, that’s how we doing it, big fucking style, man
And I want that Chimi sauce dripping all over my fucking arm
That’s how I do it, man

Shouts to motherfucking Albania
Shouts to East New York
Shouts to Lindenwood
Shouts to motherfucking Flushing
Shouts to the motherfucking Bronx, man
All fucking day I’m out here wiling, man
Eagles up
Open eyes, light the joint, take a piss
Make two farm fresh scrambled eggs with the grits
Classic club soda, splash with the twist, lime
Placed on my wrist: custom Swiss time
Hit the slopes, custom case for the smoke
Lifted up, flour for the cake getting sifted up
Make it fluffy... poof
Bring your fucking buttcheeks here... boof
Man, I fucking stand on my own, pockets getting thick like Luthor
Hundred dollars all it takes to get a kid to shoot ya
Dip to the Red Roof Inn, have a sandwich
At 7:30, on the Greyhound back to Kansas
My life is written, you sittin' while you pissin'
I'm only sittin' if I'm shittin'
And I'm shittin' often, I'm a boss
Smokin' while I'm coughin'
50 piece, a mummy that was laid inside the coffin
Extract the blood from the mosquito
In the amber, Deion Sanders on my feet inside the Regal
My shorty tan, last name Esposito
And gettin' money every day my destiny though
You could mistake me for a truck driver
On the strip, paying 30 for a muff diver
She had the red pussy hairs like a brush fire
Peace to Jamaican big girl, 'nuff iyah

[Outro]
Girl, why you running from me? Bitch I adore you
Come back sit in the chair baby you're royal
No one above you, need you in my life
What I would do without you? I need you
Standby
Please don't go

[Intro]
That's right (sniff sniff)
Bam Bam in the mother fucking building
Queens, New York
Straight up
Drop that shit
It's me
I built this shit
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Let me begin baby, my name is Bronsoliño
All I see is C-notes, silk shirts at the casino
It's time to take those leather pants off, this ain't no dance off
I know your hands soft, you're on the menu like the lamb broth
This is a grown man's sport
And, dog, I leave a motherfucker laid out on the handball court
I never brag and boast, I'm fire out the dragon's nose
My words pronounced just like a camel toe
And every whip in the garage laced
Keep that thing in the guitar case, bait the cops into a car chase
Crash the mother fucking Jeep into the venue
You better pray to God it's straight to Heaven where they send you
Ah, why the fuck would I have a bodyguard
If I look just like the mother fucking bodyguard
Baby hair curls on my forehead, leave your whore dead
Hop out that four times, four door and draw lead
I'm underground and I need more bread
And I need more head from some bitches straight from Morehead
State your business cause I'm busy tanning naked
My joint is shaking while I'm wearing bracelets
Uh, your words are tasteless, your taste is basic
My taste in Asics will lead your fucking spaceship into Matrix
This place I made is quite spacious
And dog I'm not the one to fucking play with
Hear me?

[Verse 1]
Feel it come
I, I don't know how long it's gonna stay with me
Woah, I'll let desire be, desire go
Oh, dare I face the real world?

[Chorus]
Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for? Back and forth, every day
Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know, I'll get out
Won't have to check my watch

[Verse 2]
I, I don't have the verve to belong to this dead side
Woah woah, why I ever tried, I, I don't know
Oh, dare I face the real world?

[Chorus]
Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for? Back and forth, every day
Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know, I forget
Try to let desire be, desire go

[Bridge]
Feel, feel it come, feel it come
I...

[Verse 3]
Feel it come
I, I don't know how long It's gonna stay with me
Woah, I'll let desire be, desire go

[Intro]
Where all the good songs have gone
WCBS FM

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Rocking all green outfits, the budder look like Sun Chips
Suck my son's dick, we in the street like a bum's shit
Bury me on Kissena I'm riding low like a centipede in the Beamer
Million-dollar belt, precious facial features
Acid in the fucking headband, get the bedpan
I'm shitting on myself, and you're the one who gotta clean it
While I lay there, just to get some Ray-Bans? Shit
800 dollars just for play pants
Don't try to touch me with those AIDs hands
Raise my performance fee to 80 grand
Hipster bitches, they pussy smell like seitan
I'm glad I ate lamb

[Interlude: Action Bronson]
Smoke something
Got me fucking…got me hot in here, man
Fuck, bitch, ah
Shit, yo

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
The kid caught herpes from the Rabbi
Yacob from 165, with the bad eye
Drug deal transportation was a cab ride
Displayed on the mantle was a brass lion
Mass from Ireland, give you a casket to lie up in
While an Asian man play the violin
He was taught from age 2, never miss a note
Brought his sister in the bathroom to shit the coke out
I cop the Audi with the poke out
700 thousand dollars at the smokehouse
Drugs in my lungs…ah, fuck

[Bridge]
Fast money 'til we die, peep the resume
Hang-glide into the boat, get my cheddar notes
Keep the shotty in the leather coat
Motherfucker, better know
Fast money 'til we die, peep the resume
Hang-glide into the boat, get my cheddar notes
Keep the shotty in the leather coat
Motherfucker, better know

[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]
Many nights I shot dice in the drug den
My raps permeate from a thug's pen, and love when
I think about my purpose in life, keep soft mouths slurping precise
These bitches love us
We named Pit Bulls after hard liquor (Hennessy!)
Turn the knife in the wound, make it scar thicker
Shit, we still wear jean shorts
Veteran, playing these mean sports
What up Dab?
This ain't boom bap, homie it's doom rap
And your career shit couldn't compare with
Bronsoline and Laurenivici, write fly rhymes and sky dive from Mount Fiji
That's word to my parachute
Old money still flows, last chapter loot
Firearms and novelty beverages
Keep drama riddled with hemorrhages
We good though

[Intro]
I think I got 15...bullshit, this is nothing. Look, my feet hurt, I need DOPE. What are we gonna do Sebastian, cause I got, I need piles of money. Forget this shit...but a hit of crack will do for now

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yeah...through the eyes of a G
Through the eyes of a G, see me in the all white Eclipse
A husband pay me 10 stacks to fuck his bitch
Hand up her ass like a Muppet baby, it's crazy
While she do a buck-eighty in a mustard Mercedes
I move the mustard from Russia to Haiti
Forty-fives will kiss your neck like the touch from a lady
Fuck with my lunch and then the pump leaves you under the daisies
You know your bitch is just another cocksucker with rabies
I'm signing autographs in Spanish, I live with Michael Jackson's anguish
Hop in the Vanquish and vanish off the manor in a strange manner
Aim the hammer at your dame's bladder, like it ain't matter
I smoke 'til I got down syndrome
Tan gators, brown linen
Multi-color money, seven different kinds of cheeses
My silhouette resembles Jesus in all seasons
Take a ginger shot, doing concentration curls with the cinderblocks
Doing squats, hope the ox don't drop out
Don't make me have to slap the fire out your pop's mouth
It's me...uh
Through the eyes of a G

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Yo
Through the eyes of a G
A-B, utilize what you and I use to see
To move forward
Cause I get bored with niggas talking 'bout
Who they used to be, what they used to do
My homie headed to court, not for a 2-on-2
Ironically, I'll have you know we do it for the sport
Or at least to keep a little gold in this uniform
I'm abnormal like a unicorn that you could get on
Cows jump over moons when my nouns and verbs move
Etiquette of a veteran, still getting checks
You get a F for your efforts, we never trade techs
I tried to keep the peace but now I gotta keep the piece
I speak in synchronistic frequency with triggers squeezing
And one day I'll drop to my knee and repent to Jesus
'Til then I'm humping my lust demons for no reason
Soul-o ho, from Del Amo to SoHo, ho

Yo, yo, check, "you do not know me, no, no, no
You do not know me but I know you-"
I had to, I had to do it

Got money on my mind, I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building" (thank you!)
"Everybody hands go UP..." (Thank you, everybody!)

[Intro]
Come on this exodus

[Verse 1]
Do you want to come on this exodus?
If you got swag, fuck with us
And do you wanna ride like a crusader?
You ain't gotta Christian Dior (christ endour)
My blood type is no negative
But I'm positive that I'm too deep
Switch the light on when we hit the sheets
Truly what I see is all I keep
I see you stacked chicks their views are blocked in
When I help 'em you say broke in
I see you locked in you say I don't let you in
How come all this drama's still trending

[Chorus]
Baby you can have it all
Tell me what for
Baby you can have it all
Tell me what for

[Verse 2]
New frontier I got news from there
Let's sail it to a new frequency
I left the graveyard selling full of fancy
Bring your homie with transparency
My blood type is no negative
But I'm positive the dark ain't deep
Just switch your light on when we hit the streets
Truly what I see is all I keep
My sights are set in higher times
And my eyes can see in 3D
Make it bright and I see 360
I can get you, but you can't get me

[Chorus]
Baby you can have it all
Tell me what for
Baby you can have it all
Tell me what for

[Chorus 2]
Yeah you keep on telling me you wanna have it all
Tell me what for
Yeah you keep on telling me you wanna have it all
Tell me what for

[Verse 3]
Cash and Kashmir, gold in Zaier
I got a new want from over there
You can drink a mint tea by the Red Sea
As you're living out whose fantasy
Yeah the sun the moon are both
Hitting the hood and the heat's too hot to be cool
Yeah I'm sailing my bed to a better man school
And it's two in the afternoon
We already bullet-proof we got a big crew
And we're running on a force that's true
We don't fear you wear up-to-date shoes
Or fall for the point of view

[Chorus]
Baby you can have it all
Tell me what for
Baby you can have it all
Tell me what for

[Chorus 2]
Yeah you keep on telling me you wanna have it all
Tell me what for
Yeah you keep on telling me you wanna have it all
Tell me what for

[Outro]
What d'you want it all for?
What d'you want it all for?
Things do move like sound
Waves do move like round
It don't go up and down
It spreads circle bound
Running like a hound HA
Look at what I found
Where they threw me down
Where they threw me down

On ten we're on

They're an opening ceremony and we all start the same
Cells grow to cell phones
Some form cells
Some get put in cells
Sex fucking sells
Now you know the drill so
Hear me sound the bells
You use new keys to type old deeds
Set up by old needs
What world peace?
What was in ya read? Yeah what was in ya feed?
Where do you get to with the internet lead?
Things do change and change can have a range
Systems shouldn't operate by sticking me in a cage
Ain't Dalai Lama
Ain't Sai Baba
My words are my armor and you're 'bout to meet your karma

[Intro: Action Bronson]
Am I rappin' or what?
I can't hear the headphones, yeah
Turn me up in the headphones
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, alright

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Jump tumble
Front flips off the roof like a stunt double
My shorty doing kegels for her cunt muscle
Keep her shaped up
The M3 all green fly like a strange duck
My dad was right when he said I was a deranged fuck
Now every meal is calamari and boudin blanc
Saddam Hussein guns
Held by nuns who do drugs
While beige hard bottoms slide on the new rug
Pinky up
The joint thicker than Pinky's butt
Just as stinky
Nick Van Exel with the handle, Helsinki
Eggs Rothko
The handmade suit cloth hang out the sports coat
Twenty three and a half feet on the sports boat
Brown vest made of suede on my torso
Close my eyes, inhale deep, sail free
Blind fury, hoppin' out the braille jeep
Serve me snails to eat
No ham and cheese
I'm tanning
The 540i, color salmon
Smoke a cannon
Push the seat back
Put your feet up
Roll my weed up

[Chorus: Action Bronson]
Why's it feel like my life is movin' fast, yo? (I don't know)
Get your own, don't worry about my cash flow (Bitch)
Need a chick to hide the hammer in her asshole
I need that first class dough (You understand me?)
Yeah, why's it feel like my life is movin' fast, yo? (I don't know)
Get your own, don't worry about my cash flow (That's right)
I need a chick to hide the hammer in her asshole
I need that first class dough

[Verse 2: Big Body Bes]
It's me, Big Body
Who the fuck else?
You gotta pardon my absence, man
I just came back off of vacay, man
Just spent the whole fucking weekend up in Orchard Beach
Livin' the fucking life
I was out there wildin'
Had your moms on the motherfuckin' boogie board
Doing all types of stunts
But now I'm back though, ain't shit changed
Just came back, check my motherfuckin' emails
Got more motherfuckin' deals on the table
Don't even know what the fuck to do now
Shit
(Okay) Oh my God (Okay)
You can still see me though
Out there on Fulton Street, three in the mornin'
Bench pressin' a fiend
Ain't shit changed, still loiterin'

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Okay, okay
I'm relyin' on Viacom to keep my lights and fire on
Made a deal with Lucifer, said, "Give me the universe" (Every single planet)
It hurts kinda like losin' your first love
I saw the bright lights and started doin' the worst drugs (Woo)
Now, I'm backtrackin' and hash rappin' with Action
Throwin' hand grenades at paddywagons in passin'
Old fashioned soul grabber snortin' all the coke up
The type of shit to turn a World War into a Polka
Polo'd up, the double RL icon (Yup)
Steppin' out the limo, tuxedos made of python
Listenin' to Lionel Richie, fuckin' with the lights on (Ooh)
Rice on the table, have us goin' all night long (Again, and again, and again)
Rooftops, sippin' on some red wine
Start to realize I've been trippin', shit is just fine (Okay)
So, I read a passage out the Bible as I take a bath
Dry off, hit the Colosseum on Jamaica Ave (Yep)
'Bout to say, "Fuck it," and form a union
March up to city hall and protest pollution (Yes!)
Intro

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Live
Stare in the mirror I'm a changed man
Never, I'm just executing my game plan
Shit, I'm crunching numbers just like a rain man
And got the gray Lamb, interior was beige sand
I snap the button on the driving gloves
Pointy shoe like Aladdin on the flyin rug
I probably die from drugs or while I'm fucking
Fuck it, as long as she suck dick
You see me with a bitch like Vanna White at the benefit for battered wives
Lightly battered yam, a squeeze of lemon over lamb
Staring at the crescent while I'm laying on my back
Smokin' drug, you know the potent one
Put a half ounce of the crystal in the asshole of a shih tzu
Twist your bitch too, like Brazilian jujitsu
When I marry, cop a shower room that shits two
Sell your pussy if I called and had my chips, boo
It's Bam Bam and I'm feeling like my time is here, to take the world over
Sit A.C. Slater style on your girl's shoulder, then have a cold soda
If you ain't with me roll over

[Verse 2: Retchy P (Retch)]
My mind marinate in drug sauce
The private driver's name is Gustaf
The cuff links is like a slut's cough
So disgusting, english muffin
With the butter at the Yiddish luncheon
With my pimpish cousin
He sport the slick-back clean
And I inquired howd he get that
Paused and said a bitch is a bitch
I twist the spliff while I sit in the six
The classic LO sweaters sit on the prince
Thumbs in the belt loop, as i pose for the pic
My boyish element, I blessed your residence with elegance
Turning entire rooms into elephants
Stepped in the building
The doorman resemble Marcus Garvey
Ferrari cake at the party
Wheeled in by Steve Harvey
He had the freshest line in the building
He stunted on mine, it was my party
And he tarnished my shine  got mad and had him escorted out
"Vincent, get 'im outta my sight"
And Missy Elliot had started a fight
Busta Rhymes was on a molly
From afar you thought it was Kane, but it was Body
Catch a chokeslam if you try to try me
Monday night catch me wilin' at the bingo house
Just left the dog show, you know I brought Ringo out
He won a ribbon, brandished it on the side of his coat
I went outside and I was offered a smoke, I declined politely
I rock the Jordan sole that's kinda icy
My drug of choice you know is kinda pricey
Niggah

[Intro] x24
Lights they bend and

[Verse 1]
Lights they bend and jump and always move really fast
Colors emerge light box had me in their grasp
We be rocking, we be rocking rocking in the car
Lights in sky goddess bumping a sitar
These lights yeah, these lights yeah
Green colors looking nice yeah
Turn it up too loud all the lights will turn red
If you upstairs you can hear it in the bed
Rainbows in my vision move into the rhythm
Electic shadows in my ear got me dancing spinnin'
Northern lights on my mind all the colors rhyme
Loving me all the time keep that on your timeline
I keep my distance even though I shine
For me to tell you things you need to be the right kind
Even though it’s clear like a street sign
Some people don’t get it so I keep 'em in line
It’s good to take a minute and take it all in
It’s so important sometimes that I blow off steam
Got to get another sweater from my helicopter
Got to get a closer look at what they all stick at
Doesn’t need some lights that I used to trick out
I got them from a Chinese dude I went to check out
People need to get some and put some in your pocket
You might need some later when you finally unlock it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Lights on ring cameras and things
Flashing like bling love loving when I sing
Sparkles on the charcoal as a fire lit up
Headlights off a power in the city lit up
All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna do
Is roll through the city star gazing with you
Lights a selector, original nutter
I used to be a bad girl now I’m even better
I don’t keep on berreta
I don’t sell like a shotta
I don’t often twitter
They still see me as a threat er
I’m counter to the counter
Put your money on the counter
I’m standing at the counter say, "Hi!" to my hunter
I did as freaking Santa
I eat at benne hanna
I can make em feel good
I’m running youth centers
I’m aiming for the centers
Sending light beams to sender
I think we can make it
So sip a little winner

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Let me take the time to tell you
I already know whats on your mind
I wanna stick around and make you
Understand I didn’t commit crime
But you keep on thinking it’s
In some other chick
Makes me feel I’m better off
Goin' on a trip
You keep on thinking it’s
In some other bitch
That makes me wanna leave
And never call up 'til I’m rich

[Hook]
What you want come see me
I got bootleg love for free
I got Abdul in a taxi and
He’ll drop you down for free
Natsumi and Tsunami
They make love like origami
They put a flower on the lover
Give it good licky lick what
Good licky lick, good licky lick
We know it ain't right but we do it anyway

[Verse 2]
I think I wanna get a little active
There’s more to this than being your captive
New directions might need a little practice
I can make it a little less destructive
You putting guards up
Outside my shop
Get me with your swat what
And it don’t it don't stop
You putting guards up
Outside my shop
Get me with your swat what
And it don’t it don't stop

[Interlude]
Ay, ay, ay

[Hook]

[Outro]
We do it anyway, but we do it anyway (2x)

There's a star in the east on xmas morn
It will lead you to the place that the savior's born

Leave your ewe's and leave your rams
Leave your sheep, and leave your lambs

Leave your ewe's and leave your rams
Leave your sheep and leave your lambs
Follow, follow
Follow the star of bethlehem

Spread the word spread the word
Y'all Christ is born
The devil's rule over earth now is soon gone
So let the 

[??] burn y'all been warned
2000 years ago now the angels sound the horn
No crown of thorns, bow down praise him
New god flow? nah, but my style's amazing

[??] my army suit's my tuxedo
I'm a ghetto prophet to my people
A ghetto peace adonis
Criminal mind but at least I'm honest
So i seek what the savior promised
Then i climb where i can stand the highest
So i can tell it to every man woman and child what the time is
We sending this to all nations, the birth of Christ calls for celebration! yeah

[choir and MJB]
Rise up (x4)
Rise up shepherd (x6)

Me, I'm not a Christian girl
My blood type is no negative
But I'm positive that I'm too deep
Switch the light on when we hit the sheets

What d'you want it all for?
What d'you want it all for?

[Verse 1]
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for paths left alone
Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
It's the worst kind of pain I've known

[Verse 2]
Give up your heart left broken
And let that mistake pass on
Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost
And in time, you'll be glad it's gone

[Verse 3 - Bun B]
Well, it's our life and it's our time, and it's our place and it's our choice
These are all our thoughts with our views, out of our minds with our voice
It's our oath to this generation, they call it fake, we call it fate
You see, they don't like us or understand us, and they just hope we all fall away
But we won't stop, and we won't quit, and we won't settle for what they give
And we'll keep on standin', keep on fightin' no backin' down, that's how we're livin'
Our minds are made up and we're focused no more believin' what we've been told
Cause our bags are packed, there's no turnin' back, we walk alone on these winding roads

[Verse 4]
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love never end and if you need a friend
There's a seat here alongside me

May your love never end and if you need a friend
There's a seat here alongside me

[Verse 1]
Since the last time I seen you boo I been around the world
Drugs is gettin' twirled, while driving something absurd
Something you never seen, gold and forest green
Leanin', growl like a demon, the tires smoking when I'm leaving
Playing poker on the river boat
Hid the ace long rifle in my bitch's coat
Flip off the balcony, knife to the throat, ice in the coke
Coke on the table, wild n' out in Roanoke
Hall & Oates we at the benefit for wild owls
They had the freshwater bass served five styles
Flix with Ellen DeGeneres rockin' Perry Ellis
Been a degenerate cutting ribbons with senators
Knock on my door with balloons and that big check
I'm not surprised though still dippin the 5-0
It's all about survival, me and Supplies man alive on arrival

[Verse 2]
I got the drugs rolled perfect
The gold turkish, flow furnace
I been a earner, just call me earnest
Leave the logistics to attorneys, but if its money it concerns me
Yo wake the fuck up tell my bitch to pull the truck up
Had the marijuana rolled up bitch this shouldn't be a hold up
So much paper it don't fold up, grab the plastic it won't mold up
I'm on the boat smoking gold dust
I marry ya niece, cash me out in Paris for fleece
Shoot the back of ya knees, Gary Sinise
Speaking Arabic in Greece
Grown men turn the keys to cheese, as I water ski Belize

[Verse 3]
I seen a lot but I ain't seen it all
Dreams to ball but I ain't talking bout Seton Hall
Hot red Lamborghini, special seat and all
Plus the doors open up like a season whore
Now you motherfuckers are sour, wishin' you had the vision
Could've been doing division, stay in the coupe like a pigeon
Apartment is getting close to the roof ya boy is risen
Greek men, jump off the back of the boat for dinner
Barehanded snatch up a octopus I'm a winner
Grill it, hit it with olive oil and lemon
Then kiss my fingers, efharisto that was delicious

[Outro]

[Applebee's Commercial]

[Intro: SkeeTV Interview]

[Hook: Jeff Woods]
In the city of big dream and bright lights
What you see is what you get so motherfucker look twice
Hard times, just tryna get by
I remember a night when I was tryna get high
So much stress

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
New at the game but I learn quick
Everything I purchase I've earned it
You can catch me in suburban swervin'
Window half down think I'm German
Hit the tree's now I'm bent, use febreeze for the scent
Hide the G's in a vent so you see the boy wiggle the keys to the Benz
One and only, Bam Bam, Flushing, Queens represent
After we shoot we throw the tec out, at least 10 stacks when I step out
Through explanations from the chefs mouth
No more stress

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Tires screech for the iron I reach reclining the seat
Now you sleep, the shit is pure have you grinding your teeth
See a smile on ya face but you dying underneath
What it be? ain't nothing, stay stunting
Jewerly on the wave runner
Bronsolino smoother than some shea butter
Chillin by the mountains like a grey hummer
Ate dinner while they played the whispers
I had the fish it was the delicious, had hibiscus syrup
Trips to Europe, bitch I'm here cheer up
Have a beer, pull a chair up, there's some things we got to clear up
I'm the motherfucking man, dyke, big stack of money with the rubber band tight
Lie with the left, shake hands right
Thank you for coming good night

And you're sorbet
They got guns but it points the wrong way
Yeah I’m on it they cirque de soleil
They make big sounds with nothing to say
School of fakeness
I’m school of hard knocks
You're here to fool us
I’m here to take shots
Look-alike, copycat
Doppelgänger, fraud
They ain't got nothing on me
Now I’m getting bored
If you're gonna be me you need a manifesto
If you ain't got one you better get one presto
Yeah you got money we sell bootlegs only
When the shit counts our numbers way plenty
We started at the bottom but Drake gets all the credit
Paper route or life route yeah we be ready

[Verse 1- Childish Gambino]

Please text me, text me, and emoji me
Text me, just want emoji, just so I can see what you thinking
I don't know what you thinking
I texted you like five hours ago and I don't know what you thinking
Do you hate me? Do you love me? Do you think I'm stupid?
Are you saying we should be together; we should move in together?
Or should you say you have my babies?
And be my baby mama, I fell in love with you to be my baby mama
From a like a day and a half
I needed you when I asked
I'm grabbing you after class
We dancing together, we used to go out like every single Friday
Kissing you in your mouth, we make out in the hallway
I'm so in love with you
I think about you every day I'm so in love with you
Ain't no one above you
Ain't nobody telling me I'm acting like I'm feeling
When I'm freestlying out my mouth, and I don't know what to say
Every time I see your face, I don't know what to say
A lot of girls in the audience think I'm talking about Jhene
I don't think about (?)
Get it together my head, I'm doing what I'm doing
Screwing up from the top, man I'd like to make you mine

[Hook]

But, you're so far away
So far away
No no
And I'd wish you'd come back, come back, come back (x2)

[Verse 2- Steve G. Lover]
I be looking with a flashlight
Especially if cute with her ass right
I met her at the Drexel, spread it like a pretzel
You know Steve is the best though
Move it like I normally do
My crew, we so sick like we all had the Flu
That's swine, you know I be taking my time
I love a young lady and she (?) too fine
With a hat to the front that's cool, or glasses
You know me, I skip classes
But I'm still high, like high school
Still so fly, like flight school
I'm a young jet, plus a young vet
A nigga young (?) he go New York Nets
Royalty forever

[Hook]
Every time I see you girl, you're so far away

[Verse 3- Childish Gambino]

Bring it down for a second
Just bring it down a second
Bring it down for a second
Bring it down for a second
Talk about the movies that we hate
I used to kiss you and be like 'Pete's sake'
For Pete's sake, I got that money in my wallet like a fucking Philly cheese steak
I got a million and a half
They used to tell me I wouldn't get a million and a half
But you knew me back when I ain't have enough to ride the subway
Now you call me all day saying like 'why you saying that them girls or them girls'
I though we supposed to get married when we both turned thirty
And when you said that, that shit really kinda hurt me
Because, I made that promise. I broke that promise
I'm tryna get back, but that's behind us
But now I wanna see exactly where you going, or where you coming
Your boyfriend telling you that you be jamming

You're so far away
If you hold my hand, we can be together forever
But you don't wanna say that no more
You just wanna say I'm on tour
So now I'm sitting here on the floor
Because you're so far away
Yo, ayo but fuck that, you told me not to call you all the time
And now you mad I'm your mind and I'm on your mouth motherfucker, my god
Gonna kick that shit, pop that pop
Gonna get down till that drop
(?) bitch
You gonna talk that? Talk that? Talk that shit behind my back?
(?)
Told me that I'm not that but I'm on that, and I rock shit
(?)
But they know me here, walking around with your hands in the air

So. Far. Away. (x2)
I'm so far away

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yo, yo, my man Troy, he used to jump over his own foot
Jump into a spin and give a grin that left them hoes shook
At that time, my jeans were baggy with the hoody
Back on Main Street, the maxi-single, copped it at the Goody
Up in the room, writing graffiti for hours
Dreams of being in a tower with Nia Long in the shower
Sucking my dicky like a pacifer
Now it's 2009, pussy, so pass the fire
They get the bastard higher
5'6", 260, I'm a destroyer
Got it with class, Dali paintings inside the foyer
To keep it all kosher, I'm strictly Jewish on the lawyer
When it comes to my freedom, I can't trust it to a goyim

Yo, I can't leave it up to a goyim

[Verse 2: Solace]
Yo, yo, Bermuda Triangle beat black out
Black Hole flow deep, can't see back out
So once you in, you in
Niggas speaking clout or reroute
And keep your heaters out the pouch
Once you see what we're about
No doubt
The organs make a nigga feel it in his organ
Honor the slogan saying we're never gonna soften
Single momma's put into the coffin kind of often
Conducting business dirty, then turn you into an orphan
It's simple as that, detonate your own system
The accurate aim, contacts it won't miss him
The poem shift him off his feet
But the chrome lift him
For talking out the side of their mouth like a stroke victim
And four fifth him
And bounce with the knot up in the sock
And trade your four chrome rims for four cinder blocks
The mic maestro, precise knife flow
Why debate? Just bite the bait, nigga
You might strike gold
Nigga, what

[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]
I run with old school New York shooters like Greg Anthony
Second hand gun smoke can't cancer me
It's all good then
I'mma keep the same friends
Classic timepiece, hopping out a strange Benz
With dame, duckets, yeah, young cool mill
Stacks copped the salmon skin, silver DeVille
My mind's sick but my dress code's ill
Sneakers got AIDS, they need more than a pill
Self employed, shirts have Typhoid
Beefs annoy, don't get destroyed (what!)
By this New York menace
Cock Glocks, pop shots, turn your face to a blemish
I does this, once a back block apprentice
My work will numb a nigga's mouth like a dentist
Go and ask OG's how we rock
My rhymes come back, I don't re-rock
He hot, correct, if it's Meyhem Lauren
Flow like a 9, work like a 10
Shoe size a 12, main chick a 8
Side bitch a 7 but her pussy is great
Get it straight, outsmart you and stomp you
Intelligent ape
I'm a G you're a fake like a planned mistake
Lobster claw in my paw, other hand on steak
Polo Blue, Hennessy, yeah you smell me
My gun game's meaner than Leona Helmsley
Rhymes are crimes, 9's, AK's
An unused tech in the box that just sprays
.38's more special than Mavado
Medallion money, we call that helado
If my ? special, my .44 is like a brand new king conquistador
Mutha, yo, yo, ayo

[Verse 4: Action Bronson]
700 dollar bottle of that Montrachet
Far and away, extraordinary bar display
Gil Grissom, look beyond the Solar System
Draw it all into a square until you find what's missing
Take your time cause patience is your best friend
Simmering at the importance of it sets in
Prep your area, sterilize your work tools
Foul living, never seen up on the church stools
I'm still sporting my shorts until the dead of winter
The charismatic, the dope addict, The Shredder, Splinter
Roll the magic, feeling like I'm cuffed in the water
How the fuck I manage, roll in the quarter, slaughter
Many cattle, many times for pleasure
Modeling the skin while I'm searching for the treasure
Keep astute, sink your body deep into the coupe
Or they’ll soon to find you asleep in that suit
Shoot, the Big Dipper
The golden candy Caddy tipper
Close my eyes
Back in time trying to murder Hitler
My mind and rhymes aligned with the solar signs
Dinosaurs being, something, barrels holding wine
Layers of cake, fiends up in Okeechobee Lake
Freshwater pike be on a player plate
OM

[Verse 1]
I tick tick tick I collected my ticks
Top dog even though I didn’t speak no english
Guess I got Grit coz I suffer for my shit
Guess I came from the sticks and moved to the bricks
You can’t fix this coz I’m in the same mix
Guess I’m in the air you can smell me like Vick'ss
This chicks bringing back this
It’s my last wish
One snare one kick oh look at this

[Verse 2]
I freak in minds like
Giddy up Giddy up Giddy up
Come take a ride
Light the city up city up city up
You’ve got me fired up
Sound boy got me back up
I keep my head downbeat it up beat it up beat it up

[Hook]

Fuck 'em other bitches that try to be my ringer
This time I come as singer
Next time ill come as pain
I ain't talking money
But I can make it rain
Bitches try to get me with
Their witches on cocaine
Snitches turn to dust
And I wash em down the drain
Vitamins for your brain
Protein for your weight gain
Warriors in the dance
This is how we train!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Used to get bent, now I represent to the fullest
Pencil is full of insolent bullets
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'
Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken
I begin to spittin' like vintage Pac
Demented, demonic, sinister
Ever since the Doc' replenished me
The day he gave me that shot when I was just about to quit
So to not see him with me would be a shockin' image
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
‘Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxin' critics
Know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish
Eat me broccoli, spinach, cocky? Nope
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at
This and put emphasis on the "dope"
So when names come up, in that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow
You won't find anywhere
When it fires and I unload, my pen explodes
'Til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
Let insults fly every sixty seconds that go by, so you know I meant it
In school I was so shy, timid
Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member
Beggin' my mom for K-Mart MacGregors
‘Cause those were new, St. Vincent de Paul
Those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
But kissed them old days, adiós, I did it
They said I was a gimmick
Now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Now you fuckers don't wanna go startin' no argument
‘Cause you know I'll win it
Name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front

[Chorus: Buckshot]
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Rest in peace to Big Proof
You was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowin' through me
I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne
Better watch the fuckin' tone that you speak
Feel like I'm in the zone, I'm in a whole different league
On my motherfuckin' own, it's just me
No opponents can compete
And I've never been known to retreat
From beef, be beat, follow trends or wallow in defeat
I'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say "Bon appétit"
‘Cause I don't know what to eat
Fuckin' microphone or the beat
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
It's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown
‘Cause I rhyme like I'm still tryna get signed
Up in the Ebony Show-case
With Denaun screamin' "Who the fuck passed you the mic?"
Never asked you to like my shit from the get
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
I ever meet my match, I'ma strike that bitch first
‘Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
The real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills crackin'
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?
You don't like it? Suck a cock, almost forgot
Before I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down
‘Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck Loud
They jerked me around, so what's up now?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Rubbin' it in and holdin' some grudge now? But don't front

[Chorus: Buckshot]
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
But wear diapers, ‘cause you might leave a streak
I'm on a streak, windshield wipers couldn't wipe
It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump in tonight
‘Cause I'm hyper or somethin'
Needin' someone or somethin' is lightin'
This fire under me, it's breathin' new life
It's like I already died once
I guess some people only live twice, and it's funny
My days of being broke were so long ago
I lost all concept of money
But you dimes won't get a fuckin' nickle from me
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee
I'm havin' a stroke of genius—Elizabeth, I'm comin' to you, honey
From boy to man
And still make a whore moan, like a thyroid gland
I'm in another category, man
Don't group me up with them pop stars
I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
No offense? Yes offense
Precedents has been set that'll never get met
Middle finger pressed against Moby's nose
Shouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show
But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it
You can't take it, oh
Got a whole generation of rappers comin' up
That are nutty with the flow, but convince me you've heard
An MC since me who's as good with the fuckin' mincing of words
Without mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve
Who's as mentally disturbed
You might as well stick a knife in me and turn
It'll be like my skin bein' Indian burned, hah
Bitch, there isn't one, when will you learn?
Never been served, if memory serves
I'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words

[Outro: Buckshot & Eminem]
You know I got you open kid (Don't front), don't stop frontin'
You know I got you open, Word Life

[Big Body Bes]
Oy, Manuel
Yo keep the car runnin' man
I got some shit I gotta handle real quick man
Yeah, what the fuck is good
You know I'm back in the motherfuckin' room
Just stepped in, matter fact I just stepped out
Motherfuckin' 1996 Lincoln Town Car, baby blue
But now I'm over here making my presence felt once again
'Cus you know I'm a made motherfuckin' man
The first thing you do when you meet me
You should apologize to me straight off the top
Just because you're nothing like me
But fuck that, back to me

[Verse 1:]
Y'all niggas is some peep squeaks, pewees
Little league JV
We ball, B ball
Your small ball, T-ball
Pissy yellow jewelry, pussy don't piss me off
Severe nigga head off, cut nigga feet off
I'm wrote on like a dictionary when I take my shirt off
Down with the A-Team, Mr-T and Murdock
I'm the owner and star player nigga don't make me pull a hole out
I'm the MVP in new Lebron's, Zaytoven bring the Mo out
One championship pinky ring and this fire here won't go out
Grab my shotgun, all you hoods pink
You think I'm doing it to get out
Run with my little bad bitch in my Bentley whip my dick out
R.I.P. to double D but try Gucci, I'll pull the stick out

[Hook:]
2 AK's, that's a hundred shots (cutters cutters)
Cinnamon roll drums, they shoot honey buns (cutters cutters)
My AR – it got monkey nuts (cutters cutters)
Man 4-5 – that's her Berkin clutch (cutters cutters)
Man this Mack-90 could flip a truck (cutters cutters)
Five crystal fingers and they blow you up (cutters cutters)
We gonna be OG's when we's growing up (cutters cutters)
Now them OG's ain't even tough as us (cutters cutters)

[Verse 2: Plies]
I'm fucking R&B hoes nigga the rest of these year
And I ain't wrong none of them ho cause ain't none of them shit
It ain't a nigga I ain't done shot at nigga that ain't hit
It ain't a nigga that done lived to say took my shit
I'm tired of the motherfuckers asking, "Why I ain't at the awards"
Cause I ain't trying to be around that many pussies at once
Plus they searching at the door which means that I ain't gone
If I can't get in with the Glock homie, then I ain't showing
Guwop hit me and he told me that he need me on a song
I told him if he putting a fuck nigga on it don't send me the song
Everybody claim real 'til the weapons in drawn
And when them cutters come out, that when the bitch go to showing

[Hook:]
2 AK's, that's a hundred shots (cutters cutters)
Cinnamon roll drums, they shoot honey buns (cutters cutters)
My AR – it got monkey nuts (cutters cutters)
Man 4-5 – that's her Berkin clutch (cutters cutters)
Man this mack-90 could flip a truck (cutters cutters)
Five crystal fingers and they blow you up (cutters cutters)
We wanted to be OG's when we's growing up (cutters cutters)
Now them OG's ain't even tough as us (cutters cutters)

[Ma$e]
This song right here changed my life... come on, come on!

[Kanye West]
God show me the way, now the devil can't break me down

[Verse 1: Common]
Open your eyes, there's smoke in the skies
The Beast is holdin' a lies
Everywhere we move, motion denied
Emotion derived from posters of pride
Of African, cultures and tribes
Who live when we suppose they die
Laugh when we suppose they cry
The pain we holding inside
Cause all we really know is survive
Use that to remember we're kings
That's why we so addicted to diamonds and rings
And cutless supremes
Seen Diana Ross remember that my sisters is queens
The Lord is coming -- for now, he visit in dreams
For every mission it seems impossible
Speak to the gospel to remind me what God can do
When it's not logical
To those in hospitals and prisons
Low-income living
For them I say a prayer keep giving
Learning to receive
My heart is burnin' to achieve
Even when it's hard to breathe, I still believe that

[Hook: Kanye West]
God show me the way, now the devil can't break me down
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
And now I think there is something that I can say now that'll right my wrongs
I finally talked to God, I ain't afraid cause His love is so strong

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Jesus walk with me, he walk with the sinners cause I know I am
But I ain't no loser, I'm a winner and I know I can
Overcome the devil for he get the best of me
My daddy always said G-O-D gon' have tests for me
Illegally they told me to lie when they question me
But God sent an angel that said the truth will set you free
So in the midst of getting sued for more than my deal
I admitted I fell asleep at the wheel
Cause I realized I could've died, he saved me
Every single hit that got played he gave me
People ask me "Do you read your Bible?"
"It could help out when you need revival"
There's something about this beat that get me tranquilized
And when I play it at my shows I feel sanctified
And he give me direction when I can't decide
He is alive! How could you tell me that he ain't when I said

[Hook: Kanye West]

[Verse 3: Ma$e]
Before you take my name, take my fame
While you at it take my shame
Take my flaws, take my blame?
Feel my dirt, conceal my hurt
See my bruise, do this and you will walk in my shoes
You wasn't there when I was in deep thought
When I had two choice: kill him, or either leave New York
But I'm a truth teller, that's why I say what I'm saying
And the only thing the radio is playing
Is because you be paying
It ain't about who really hot no more
Beasts will knock no more
So who cares who flop no more?
I realize that most labels pay you for lies
And only law dudes can disguise
That your favorite artist (shhh)
I know you hear that (huh?)
You wanna fear that? (what?)
Your worst dream is that you was gonna hear that
Icon to rap is like John the Baptist
Prepared the way for what I came to say today
They deceived us, having thinking Jesus
Really didn't need us, when He loved the old days
He loved them boys in the hallway up in Broadway
Even those who be here for dope, every four days
To the strippers in broad day up in Norway
To the Detroit player gators in Marbres
With me, it's not just bars of music
I walk with God, I got the scars to prove it

[Kanye West]
God show me the way, now the devil can't break me down
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

[Outro: Ma$e]
Everybody out there
Just lift your hands right now
Just say this with me
Father, I thank you
For forgiving me of everything I've ever done
For Jesus walking with me
For dying for me
Raising for me
And all my sins have been forgiven
I'm a changed man
I'm healed, I'm delivered, I'm rich
And it's all because of him
Now walk with me
Walk with me, walk, walk, walk with me
Walk with me

[Verse 1]
It starts out like a murmur
Then it grows like thunder
Until it bursts inside of you
Try to hold it steady
Wait until you're ready
Any second now will do
Throw the door wide open
Not a word is spoken
Anything that you want to do

[Chorus]
And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know, and you know, and you know

[Verse 2]
Ah, don't you feel the same way?
Ah, don't you feel the same way?
But you don't know what to do?
No time for hesitatin'
Ain't no time for hesitatin'
All you got to do is move
They say you're feeling blue, well
I just found a cure
It's a thing you gotta do, yeah

[Chorus]
And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know, and you know, and you know

[Verse 3]
Now listen
Well you say your body's aching?
Well, I know that it's aching
Chill bumps come up on you
Yeah, the funny fool
I love the funny fool
Just like fooling after school
And then you ask for medication
Who cares for medication?
When you've worn away the cure?

[Chorus]
And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know, and you know, and you know

[Verse 4]
Go back to the country
Yeah, go back to the country
Feel a change is good for you
When you keep convincing
Ah, don't keep convincing
Well, what's that creeping up behind a' you?
It's just an old friend
It's just an old friend
And what's that he's got for you?

[Chorus]
And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know, and you know, and you know

[Outro]
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance
Ooh, medication
Medication!
Medication!

[Intro]
Back once a-motherfucking-gain
Come here mirror, bring yourself to me
I want you to see the beauty you've created

[Verse 1]
Caddy got the brown hard top just like the Créme Brulée
Crack it...I mean retract it
The bitches they think I'm attractive
That means I'm sexually active
Hang out with actors and chefs
Gray Beamer, swing the left, BBS's
Flip out the roof, land in a split
Handle my shit
Straight from Flushing, Queens
Where them hammers get gripped
A fiend will suck your dick
For a gram of the sniff
I been gorgeous, mid-August
Twin Porsches, three floor loft
Diana Ross, blow my nostrils with the tan cloth
Five in the mornin' drinkin' coffee smokin' Kents
With the teased hair, doggy everywhere we be's there
You can touch, like the coach and the gymnast
Baby I been this
Pouches of tuna, Ounces of Uma
The '89 station wagon, Mercury Sable
Forest Green, forest park, Horace Grant
It's me

[Intro]
I'm Rodney Ramen and I'll be your host this evening. (Hey, don't throw that shit on stage.)
Tonight we got a young gentleman all the way from uhh, Los Angeles
I like the way how that beat just rides...pause
The guy is making his way from Compton, California and uhh, the guy has a lot of swagger
You know, you might have seen him around, maybe never seen him before. But he has definitely got a lot of potential and he is here to show it tonight
Introducing Tyga Tyga

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Picture cash baby born how the duffel bag
How to ride a moment don't make my temperature mad (No!)
Flickin' my past admire all the shit that I done had
Thinkin' I'm really reppin' my city without a flag
Carry-ons, earphones, MCM bag
Elderlies mad as we all sitting first class
Look over shoulder laugh, family matter chatting, did I do that?
Imagine Urkel with a little swag
Barely grown and already these bitches gettin' old
Fettichini flow, let my words twist around the folk
Make you eat it like a dyke to a lesbian
Oh, the lady will get it after the show
Oh oh, protection for sexual, ah ah, thought you knew, nigga I'm passive
Proof, and you lookin' broke
Got for your diamonds same color cantaloupe
My life an episode so expect a fucking show

[Interlude]
("The potential" is repeated x5 while Tyga speaks)
I remember this one time though when i was like 11, and
Um i use to work with this one producer out here in LA
And he use to make me write shit over and over again
And I would be like damn. Like I use to feel like not
Good enough, like my bars wasn't ready. But it wasn't
That, they just wanted the potential that I had. You
Know what I'm sayin'? So they just like kept making me
Write it over and over and shit, you feel me?

Verse 2

Any minute I could lose the momentum
Lord forgive all my days I have spent sinnin'
Show my momma love, with a key and red ribbon
A freedom writer even niggas up in jail feel him
Pause, my miracle bars will leave your mind in prison
Now what you was thinking can't even think you can you nigga
New Orleans they scream for the beads on cameras
Up in the dorm hours before performance on campus
How could you not be famous? Too much managers can't even manage
Shout out to at money, he do the managing
While I fresh like Irish Spring
Obviously, I'm what the crowd came to see
Tyga not Tyrese
What you can sing, every melody and on a beat
Had the beach water money fold like laundry, honestly
Don't lie to me F
Uck around and write your will right In your drivers seat
Fucking with them G.E.D. boys

[Interlude]
So like, years years later they announce to me, that I
Got an opportunity and chance, and it was like, who
Wouldn't like it at first, and I thought all of that
Hard work was going to pay off, but it really didn't
Because people wasn't biting onto it, but I think they
Just knew the potential I had, but they just wanted
Better from me. But thank God for listening

[Outro]
Everybody make some noise. Come on clap it up! The guy
Has potential. I am Rodney and I'll see you next monday
Night

[Intro]
Overdrive

[Hook]
Girl say, girl say, girl say, boy say, girl say, boy say, girl say, boy say
In the car, in the car, in the car, out the car, in the car, out the car, in the car, out the car
I'm stylin', stylin', ravin', ravin', stylin', stylin', ravin', livin'

[Refrain]
Overdrive

[Verse]
When I was young my style was so different
I had already begun even 'fore I hit London
My housing project had the boys with the toy guns
But I already had real ones
So I found new ways for me to have fun

[Hook]
Girl say, girl say, girl say, boy say, girl say, boy say, girl say, boy say
In the car, in the car, in the car, out the car, in the car, out the car, in the car, out the car
I'm stylin', stylin', ravin', ravin', stylin', stylin', ravin', livin'

[Bridge: Scattered voices]
This location, there's more that keep walking by, one of them has a weapon
We don't make the money on the violence
That's why we don't do the silence
(See all those people standing down there)
We don't make the money on the violence
That's why we don't do
(Oh yeah)
We don't make the money on the violence
That's why we don't do the silence
(There's about 20 of them)

[Outro]
We're not sent by FBI or the KGB
Dancing is top priority
When mission complete that's when we feel lively
We will sit down and smoke an ounce of khalif
Now you know why they call ragamuffin "Rambo"
Now you know why they call ragamuffin "Rambo"
Vicki Leekx mixtape, two-thousand-and-ever

[Verse 1]
You are my hurt locker lover
Keep me walking on a wire
Don't know when you'll blow
So I tiptoe through your triggered mind
You fight me, but I'm on your side
Defeated, now retreating

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you tryna make me your enemy?
All we really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby, why the ammunition?
I don't wanna be the last one standing

[Chorus]
Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I am not fighting anymore

[Verse 2]
I've tried to pick off your red flags
While dancing on broken glass
Your mind games hit like grenades
Feel cursed, just like the Kennedys
But you somehow get me on my knees
Defeated, now retreating

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you tryna make me your enemy?
All we really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby, why the ammunition?
I don't wanna be the last one standing

[Chorus]
Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
No, I am not fighting anymore

[Bridge]
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby, baby
I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
I don't wanna fight no more, anyway, anyway
I am not fighting anymore

[Chorus]
(If you wanna go, then go) Choose your battles, babe
(If you wanna stay, then stay) Then you'll win the war
('Cause I don't wanna fight no more) Stop digging your own grave
(Baby, baby) When there's so much to live for
(If you wanna go, then go) Choose your battles, babe
(If you wanna stay, then stay) 'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
(I don't wanna fight no more, anyway, anyway)
I am not fighting anymore

[Outro]
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby, baby
I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go

[Chorus]
No I didn't think you would let me
Down that easy, oh no girl
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away like it was nothing baby

[Verse 1]
And that moment was so hard for me to breathe, yeah
Cause you took away the biggest part of me, yeah
Life was so unpredictable, yeah
Never thought a love like yours would leave me all alone, oh no
Didn't waste any time
But you had already made up your mind
No sympathy
Cause I was out of line, oh yeah

[Chorus]
But I didn't think you would let me
Down that easy, oh no girl
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away like it was nothing girl
It was a bad day, hey girl
I knew I was wrong, but you could've said goodbye baby
It was a bad day, now I'm like woah
It was a bad day, it was a bad day

[Verse 1]
Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare?
Is there still longing there?
Oh, I hate myself and I feel crazy
Such a classic tale
Current girlfriend, ex girlfriend
I'm trying to be cool
I'm being paranoid, am I seeing things?
Am I just insecure?

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby

[Chorus]
So, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume

[Verse 2]
I wanna fill the room, when she's in it with you
Please, don't forget me
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments?
I know you got history
But I'm your girlfriend, now, I'm your girlfriend trying to be cool
I hope I'm paranoid, that I'm just seeing things
That I'm just insecure

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby

[Chorus]
So, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory
So I, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume

[Intro]
I want everything I see, I wanna go in every mall, in every state, in every country, and buy shit
Whether I can afford it or not, nigga, I want bitches, I want cars, I don't give a fuck, I want it all, that's what the fuck we're here for

[Bridge]
They say, "Life is but a dream", nigga
I'm just tryna keep it real, nigga
They say, "Life is but a dream", nigga
I'm just tryna keep it real, nigga
They say, "Life is but a dream", nigga
I'm just tryna keep it real, nigga
They say, "Life is but a dream", nigga

[Hook]
It's just so many women, it's just so many chains
It's just so many watches, it's just too many things
I want
It's just so many trips, it's just so many bottles
It's just too many whips, it's just too many models
I want

[Chorus]
All I want is money
Money, money, money
(That's all I want!)
Big face hundred
Hundred, hundred, hundred
(That's all I want!)
That's all I want
(That, that, that's all I want!)
That's all I want
(That, that, that's all I want!)

[Verse 1]
Not a day goes by it ain't on my mind
I ain't gon' front, I ain't gon' lie
I'd rather have an M than an empty pocket
If hundreds ain't in 'em, them jeans ain't mine, aight
That's what I want, motherfucker
I'll never be a bum, motherfucker
You're talking 'bout like "it ain't about the money"
You just sound like a dumb motherfucker
A house on the hill by the lake
All real niggas can relate
You tryna book me for free?
But my rent is due on today
A better life is what we after
'Cause every dream I gotta capture
I always knew that I would blow up one day
Like a nuclear reactor

[Chorus]
All I want is money
Money, money, money
(That's all I want!)
Big face hundred
Hundred, hundred, hundred
(That's all I want!)
That's all I want
(That, that, that's all I want!)
That's all I want
(That, that, that's all I want!)

[Verse 2]
From the cradle to a label
From Decatur to the majors to the paper, no more neighbors
I used to say I never cared about the money
'Til I put food on my momma table
Followed the trail, coulda been in jail
The way that I lived, coulda been fatal
I must have had an angel
It's funny how I'm always on the screen
But as a teen, I never had cable
But now I want it all
The wealth, the ladies, the whips
I took a fantasy and made it exist
No one ever handed a shit
We took what we had and we made it the shit
That's transforming "dusty" to "luxury"
Being off in the cut, to cutlery
That's the gist, that's the summary
So if you feel how I'm feeling then fuck with me

[Chorus]
All I want is money
Money, money, money
(That's all I want!)
Big face hundred
Hundred, hundred, hundred
(That's all I want!)
That's all I want
(That, that, that's all I want!)
That's all I want
(That, that, that's all I want!)
All I want is money
Money, money, money
(That's all I want!)
Big face hundred
Hundred, hundred, hundred
(That's all I want!)
That's all I want
(That, that, that's all I want!)
That's all I want
(That, that, that's all I want!)

[Outro]
It's just so many women, it's just so many chains
It's just so many watches, it's just too many things
I want
UH OH you’re in trouble
I step up in the game and I burst that bubble
UH OH you’re in trouble
I step up in the game and I burst that bubble
UH OH you’re in trouble
I step up in the game and I burst that bubble

Bought up a baby in a bandana
I boarded a boeing eating a banana
Bounce on the bed
Battling with heads
It’s based on a story that nobody read

(people see me as trouble see me see me as trouble)
See me see me as trouble
UH OH
(people see me as trouble see me see me as trouble)
See me see me as trouble

COZ I got a reputation
GOT A GOT A reputation
And I got a reputation
GOT A GOT A reputation
Played in the park
Packed with piranhas
I jump in puddle
Singing NIRVANA
Passed by the past and I end at the start
Now I’m living the life and I’m gonna raise the bar
Do you know my name
Do you know my number
Do you know by summer I will make you a member
I know you're busy running round with Linda
If I don’t get you now then I’ll get you by december
You're dancing styles out dated like tinga
These girls in caps MAMI snap your finger
I drift in deserts from bumper to bumper
We can rock a dress or we can rock a jumper
You want that pain so I set you on fire
These girls are high but I take you lot higher
So get your beer it’s tiger or corona
We throw up heat like a bunsen burner!
You know my badman style
Coz I’m from Lanka
Eat up a falafel
Say danke danke
If I’m in street fighter
I’ll be like blanka
Roll like a ball and I’ll bleed you like a banker
Do you know my name name name name name name
MIA
Now I don't know if all boy scouts are gay
But they could probably "tie the knot" in like fifty different ways
I've got a safe full of cherries
‘cause I pop it and lock it
A girl's like a fridge
Once a week you should stock it
And girl, if your into a rimmin’
It's only safe if you’re swimmin’
But girl don't sit on that couch
‘cause I treat my objects like women
I spit fire like I just blew a demon
My shits so hot I’ll leave your toilet bowl steamin’
I'm gonna tarot like the cards of the gypsies
You'll bleed for so long you'll get monthly ellipses
If your pants are loose, I'll re-pleat ya
You're a first time vegan and it's nice to meet ya

‘Cause I'm Bo yo! I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you’re better? You're not
Don't need a sweater; I'm hot
I'm a real G that can really find your g-spot...
Go to a vagina orchard. Count 1, 2, 3
Spin that plant around and you've got a third world country
That's right! Consider yourself warned
I'm offensive and creative like handicapped porn
You’re playin’ with your breasts, excuse me, can I try it ma'am?
You’re pushin’ them together like a titty Venn diagram
Look at that crack! excuse me, can I buy a gram?
Right below your diaphragm, ass looks like you’re hidin’ ham

First base, we're making out
Second base, I'm getting faked out yo
Third base, I'm getting take out
And I'd try to take it home if I knew I'd take it out
But I just don't know
I said I just don't care
I said my flow is so cold (that)
I need a tampon from a polar bear
And you can spell and you can smell my stink
‘Cause B.O. lingers and it makes you think

‘Cause I'm Bo yo! I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you’re better? You're not
Don't need a sweater; I'm hot
I'm a real G that can really find your g-spot…
It was all a dream, I used to read a quick Nick magazine
Ren and Stimpy, Tommy Pickles and the games between
Watching TV in the dark
Every Saturday double dare with my main man Marky Mark
Summers, Falls, Winters and Springs
I've seen 

[23] sets. Cut me open count the rings
But I wish that I could be 8, 9, or 10
Wearing "Life is Good" t-shirts that made sense back then
You wanna know me? Well here's a list;
When I tried to hit puberty I swung and I missed
I like palindromes like "do geese see god?"
Or "go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog."
And I can do a Rubik's Cube in a minute twenty
Fast food and the Internet's plenty for me
I'm simple with one dimple
And a weird mole thing on my left nipple

I'm part of the fattest country on the global scale
And we’re “phat” with a ph on the ph scale
Because we're so basic

I'm a little kid in a cave, yo
Just starin' at my shadows and playin’ with Play-Doh
Oh hey yo, Aristotle, I got some Hemlock, let's share a bottle
Oh, too soon. I was Socra-teasin'
Let's drink hot chocolate, think, talk, reason
Oh my, oh me ah. I think I'll 'see ya
If I want a piece of Greece, then I'll pirate "Mama Mia."
Schwinn road kill - bicycle victim
Is that my dog? Yeah, I Michael Vick'd him
Put a pic of my nuts as my profile pic
And your girl clicked it, liked it, and licked it
My attempt is, check the tenses so the flow don't stop
In the future you'll be passed out like a present with a bow on top. Oh!

‘Cause I'm Bo yo! I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you’re better? You're not
Don't need a sweater; I'm hot
I'm a real G that can really find your g-spot…

Now, give us a house and a car and a kid
So we can raise it, praise it, blaze it up
And get Lasik to see how bad we fucked it up

We all had braces. Our smiles are fake
Another mother saw her hotter daughter's water break
The Miley Cyrus virus is as bad as it gets
And similarly as bad as simile Tourette's
Cause like it's like I like my right to like
But like I also have like a life to write, right?
Wrong. This is a road kill song
About a kid who followed the bouncing ball during the sing along
I'm a little teapot who’s steaming mad
Because the world’s not careful cause I'm hot...
(1, 2, Fuck You)

I take a stroll around the block to relax my mind
And then I walk by the clock just to pass the time
And rhymin', mathematical timin'
Syntax impacts the intact hymen
Trust me, you don't want to fuck with me
Check my record. Wrecked it on my SAT's
I got a 780 math, 730 verbal
Kick a Jonas brother and he'll fart out a gerbil

Voice so sweet, call me Mr. (Herbal) T
More deadly than Joseph Goebbel's pee
In a swastika Dixie cup
I’ve got a dick full of helium; I'll fuck you up!

Put down your fists ‘cause it’s a battle of wits
And if you bring your facts sis
Just the cattle with tits
And I'll get mad at their zits
And paddle their bits
With saddles and whips
And rattle their clits . . . that was rude

Yo, so girls are like donuts when I be bustin’ Bo nuts;
I can make ‘em cream-filled or give them a layer of glaze
I’m like Doug's friend Skeeter whenever I meet her
‘Cause I skeet her so hard you could call her Patty Mayonnaise
My girl is epileptic cause shes the one I'm jerkin with
Common you Asian child laborer show me what your workin' with...

Cause theres an inverse relationship between respect and sects
I'm talking about religious sects like a Mormon sect
That says you can't have sex with members of different sects
But you can't have sex with members of the same sex
So if the sects can't be different, the sex can be same
Then the only sex left is some left hand shame
And girl I left you ‘cause you left the game
And if that don't feel right then u can write my name

‘Cause I'm Bo yo! I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you’re better? You're not
Don't need a sweater; I'm hot
I'm a real G that can really find your g-spot...

Look past the skin and look to the lyrics
I run miracle circles around you like spherical lyrics
This isn't about ironic pigment
If you're imagining this then I'm a chronic figment

My junks so long that it hangs and swings
So at the nude beach people think I'm lookin' for lost rings
Play the skin flute while your big boy sings
And if you want to take it all wear African neck rings

Haters call me gay, but that ain't hatin'
‘Cause I'm not homophobic, my morals are straight and
If I'm in the closet then you are below me
Taking the b-a-t out of basement, homie

Yeah
Yo, yeah, what?
Cause I'm Bo, yo and I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you're better? You're not
Don't need a sweater-
I'm a real G that can really find your what now!
Oh, yeah!
Cause I'm Bo yo, yo, what?
I'm representing you
I'm representing the people from the 01982 yo
Oh yeah
What?
Yo, mother fucker
Tinkle
Yeah
I'm just looking for my thrown, where's my thrown

I just feel like I'm the hottest rapper ever
With my fucking Gucci Louis feathers
Soulja Tell'Em I am high
So high you can not turn me down from the fucking sky
I'm so high, yeah right now
And I'm so live like it's going damn down
And Soulja Tell'Em king of the goddamn town
And if you put me on the thrown I never back down
And SOD Money Gang is what I claim now
The tattoos all up my fucking neck now
And I show all this motherfucking neck style
It's Soulja Tell'Em I would never ever touch down
Cus I'm not a motherfucking football player
I'm up top, sitting in my fucking lair
And all y'all haters are over there
Soulja Tell'Em, put it in the fucking air
What's my name bitch?

I just feel like… I gotta prove why I say I'm the hottest rapper to ever touch the microphone
I don't mean no disrespect but I'm the hottest
Soulja Tell'Em bitch, twelve fucking shotty's
And I'm not talking bout the 12 gauge hitting stomach
But if you touch me I'm so hot you might just fucking vomit
Or you might just, fucking plummet to the fucking bottom
It's Soulja Tell'Em yeah I'm going full fucking throttle
And off the top of the head I go insane
Inside of my membrane
It's a million ways to get paid
Soulja Tell'Em, everyday I blaze the swisher
If you wanna get with me nigga take a picture
I'm not a baseball player but I'm the richest nigga
To ever touch a fucking mic bitch, under 18
Soulja Tell'Em he's the hottest nigga
I'm Soulja Tell'Em off the motherfucking top of full throttle nigga
You gotta me twisted like a fucking dread
I take five shots to the head, and I ain't even dead

I'm alive bitch, and I'm feeling better than ether -- feeling better than EVER -- no disrespect to any rappers but I'm the hottest rapper

And if you fucking disagree
Then come and battle me bitch, you is rest in peace
Your whole crew with their keys
Cus you tried to diss a G
You can't fuck with me, I'm holding twenty keys
But I'm not talking about a motherfucking piano bitch
It's Soulja Tell'Em I'm the hottest to ever fuckng spit
I gives a fuck bitch
Who the fuck you and your whole clique?
It's SOD bitch
And I mean that straight from the heart: I love music like I love my mom, I spit this shit from the heart, the realest nigga to ever walk the planet no disrespect to any other human but I am not human bitch… but I am the hottest rapper doe

[Verse 1: Jean Deaux]
Now can we place a bet
You love collect calls inside of your cigarettes
I still wonder why you can't seem to get it yet
If we go half then maybe we can spend another night, another day
Another chance for us to get right
Inside these walls we watch the tables turn
You say I should've had a mother and watch my navel yearn
There are things that I expect you know
How you gone plant a whole seed and not expect it to grow?
We just smoking too much weed, I'm still expecting to blow
Let's take a walk, don't forget your key, baby
Let's say a prayer, come on, get down on your knees, baby
Come on, get down on your knees, baby

[Hook - Glass Animals]
Please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha
Don't get up, don't get up, don't get up, don't get up
Please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha

[Verse 2: Jean Deaux]
There's no doubt, you know I want this just as much as you
What if you lying? Then I'm just stuck here like a fucking fool
I'll still be stuck even if this is the fucking truth
You say I'm running from my problems, but there's no other way
If you decide to keep it, I don't know if I'mma stay
My shoulders dislocating, breaking under all this weight
I'm just thinkin bout your lateness, it's a bad time
I want to be situated before I have mine
Let's take a walk, don't forget your key, baby
Let's say a prayer, come on, get down on your knees, baby
Come on, get down on your knees, baby
Come on, get down on your knees, baby

[Hook - Glass Animals]
Come on, get down on your knees, baby
(Please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha
Don't get up, don't get up, don't get up, don't get up
Please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha
Please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha
Don't get up, don't get up, don't get up, don't get up)

[Verse 1]
Bad fog of loneliness
Put a cloud
On my single-mindedness
I dream of sweet caress
From you

[Verse 2]
What makes tomorrow guess
What makes me take for me
And put aside the rest
I dream of sweet caress
From you

[Bridge]
So long woman I am gone
So much pain to go through
Come back maybe I was wrong

[Verse 1]
Bad fog of loneliness
Put a cloud
On my single-mindedness
I dream of sweet caress
From you

[Verse 1]
I'm on the corner, waiting for a light to come on
That's when I know that you're alone
It's cold in the desert, water never sees the ground
Special unspoken without sound

[Verse 2]
Told me you loved me, that I'd never die alone
Hand over your heart, let's go home
Everyone noticed, everyone has seen the signs
I've always been known to cross lines

[Verse 3]
I've never ever cried when I was feeling down
I've always been scared of the sound
Jesus don't love me, no one ever carried my load
I'm too young to feel this old

[Outro]
Here’s to you
Here’s to me
For all of us
Nobody knows
Nobody sees
Nobody but me

[Verse 1]
Jacqui loves her work, and her work is love
For there is no other
She says "God has given me a job"
Jacqui loves her work
There is no other
Jacqui's aiming for the stars but landed on the clouds
There is no other
Sitting in her corner too afraid to run away
Like a slave without chains

[Chorus]
The wonder turns to danger, spring turns to winter
God Bless the Girl
But I will treasure, treasure every single moment
God Bless the Girl
Fire turns to water, light becomes darkness
God Bless the Girl
And I don't wanna hurt you, just wanna have some fun
God Bless the Girl
God Bless the Girl
Yeah, I don't wanna hurt you, just wanna have some fun
God Bless the Girl

[Verse 2]
You don't need another friend, you just need a reason
There is no other
Jacqui loves her work, and her work is love
For there is no other

[Chorus]
The wonder turns to danger, spring turns to winter
God Bless the Girl
But I will always treasure, treasure every single moment
God Bless the Girl
Fire turns to water and light becomes darkness
God Bless the Girl
I don't wanna hurt you, just wanna have some fun
God Bless the Girl
God Bless the Girl
God Bless the Girl (God Bless the Girl)
I don't wanna hurt you, just wanna have some fun
God Bless the Girl (God Bless the Girl)
The years pass so swiftly
God Bless the Girl (God Bless the Girl)
Years pass so swiftly
God Bless the Girl (God Bless the Girl)
God Bless the Girl (God Bless the Girl)
God Bless the Girl (God Bless the Girl)
God Bless the Girl (God Bless the Girl)

[Verse 1]
My sandpaper sigh engraves a line
Into the rust of your tongue
Girl, I could've been someone to you
Would have painted the skies blue

[Chorus]
Baby blue
If you knew
Baby blue
Baby blue
Baby blue

[Verse 2]
Edging closer, you swing my way
Girl, I've got no chance and nothing to say
Girl, but stay here for a little while

[Chorus]
Baby blue
Baby blue
Baby blue

[Verse 3]
But if only you could see
My shadow crossing your path
It won't be the last, baby blue

[Chorus]
You are my baby
You are my baby
I was your slave, can't you see?
I was your slave, can't you see?

[Outro]
Bobbing on the problem
On the problem, on the throbbing
She was falling, I was bawling
My heart was stopping, she was throbbing, oh

[Verse 1]
I don't care about sunny days
Gonna keep it out of sight but under shade
I'm gonna keep it out of sight but under shade
It's gonna be like this
And that's alright
And that's okay
Is that okay?
Myself would beat these lines
In my head I'm getting dead tired of this shit you've caused
You fucking bitch
You don't know when to stop
You're a bunch of fat bitches, you motherfucking fat bitches
Fat bitches!

[Pre Chorus]
Well I don't wanna be trapped in the black of your heart
And now I'm gonna fuck things over 'cos that's a start
Well if I can't have her then no one can

[Chorus]
Oh, but baby what am I to do
I've given up on loving you
I know it's not nothing new
So please do what I ask you to
And please do what I want of you
It's just not fair
Baby blue, and girl it's true
One day I'm gonna have you
But for now I don't care
I still feel the pain
Of you not loving me the same

[Verse 2]
There was not much that I could do
Oh, not much that I could do
(Trapped in a lizard state!)
Well I got everyone on my back
But I'm not gonna crack like you cracked
You're a fucking pussy boy
Sipping up on my humblepie
You got no legs to get you near my height
So don't try and get near my hide
Don't try and get out the way yeah
I see what you gotta say
I hear your lizard state
If that's okay and if that's not okay
Say girl now what's okay

[Pre Chorus]
Well I don't want to be trapped in the black of your heart
And now I'm gonna make it clear and girl I'll tear you apart
From the inside to the out

[Verse 3]
But baby what am I to do
I've given up on loving you
I know it's not nothing new
So please do what I ask you to
And please do what I want of you
It's just not fair
Baby blue and girl it's true
One day I'm gonna have you
But for now I don't care
I still feel the pain
Of you not loving me the same
But girl what was I supposed to do?
Yeah I was so hung up on loving you
And girl believe me this is something new
‘Cause all I will do
Is girl whatever I have to do
They all knifed me in the back and girl I can’t believe
It’s slipping away like that

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Now you were standing there right in front of me
I hold on it's getting harder to breathe
All of a sudden these lights are blinding me
I never noticed how bright they would be
I saw in the corner there is a photograph
No doubt in my mind it's a picture of you
It lies there alone in it's bed of broken glass
This bed was never made for two

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll keep my eyes wide open
I'll keep my arms wide open

[Chorus]
Don't let me, don't let me
Don't let me go, 'cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me, don't let me go
'Cause I'm tired of feeling alone

I promised one day that I'd bring you back a star

Seems like these days I watch you from afar
Just trying to make you understand

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll keep my eyes wide open, yeah

[Chorus]
Don't let me, don't let me
Don't let me go, 'cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me, don't let me go
Don't let me, don't let me
Don't let me go, 'cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me, don't let me
Don't let me go 'cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me, don't let me go
'Cause I'm tired of sleeping alone

[Verse 1:  Blood Orange & Both]
If giving left me lonely
If giving was my friend
I'm keeping all the old themes
I'm keeping my loose ends
But now you're feeling empty
I tried my best last time
I'll leave you with your feelings
I'll leave you in your lies

[Verse 2: Blood Orange]
I'm nothing without subtle
Heartache at its best
Are you the one who breaks my
Heart out of my chest

[Chorus: Both & Caroline Polachek]
I'll never leave you if you're thinking that it's all the same
I'll never trust you if you're thinking that it's just a game
I see you waiting for a guy/girl like me to come along
Come along, to come along
Baby girl you're wrong
I'll never leave you if you're thinking that it's all the same
I'll never trust you if you're thinking that it's just a game
I see you waiting for a guy/girl like me to come along
To come along, to come along, to come along
Baby girl you're wrong

[Verse 1: Blood Orange & Caroline Polachek]
If giving left me lonely
If giving was my friend
(Giving was my friend)
I'm keeping all the old themes
(Keeping all the old themes)
I'm keeping my loose ends
(My loose ends)
But now you're feeling empty
(Now you're feeling empty)
I tried my best last time
(Tried my best this time)
I'll leave you with your feelings
(I'll leave you in your lies)
I'll leave you in your lies

[Chorus: Both & Caroline Polachek]
I'll never leave you if you're thinking that it's all the same
I'll never trust you if you're thinking that it's just a game
I see you waiting for a guy/girl like me to come along
Come along, to come along
Baby girl you're wrong
I'll never leave you if you're thinking that it's all the same
I'll never trust you if you're thinking that it's just a game
I see you waiting for a guy/girl like me to come along
To come along, to come along, to come along
Baby girl you're wrong

Wee-ooh, wee-ooh, oh, no, no, no

[Outro]
Someone gave you all my love, baby
All my love, all my love
Someone gave you all my love, baby
All my love, all my love
You all doin’ alright?...You okay?
*claps*
I’m not screamin at ya, I’m just askin you a question. Y’all givin’ me a clap.
A yes is fine (laughing) okay?
(voice from audience “I love that song”)
Thank you. Praise God.

I tell you, I know everybody’s in the same mess. I’m telling you.
We all are.
I, I, I know that, you know...
and I’m just, you know, I’ll be the first to tell you, you know,
I’m a mess and God is dealing with me everyday. And everyday I’m trying, you know, how I can be less of a mess. Cuz you know, he showed me, Look Lauryn, you know, You’re the problem, okay, I’m going to show you how you’re causing the problem, and now I want you to be the solution. And that’s what all of these songs are about, just, problem, cause and solution. Free your mind.

It’s like, we all think that the gospel is join and church building, and that’s deception, you know.
The real gospel is Repent, which means ‘let go of all that crap,’ that’s killin’ you.
Life was supposed to be a pleasurable experience, not this torment, you know.
And when I realized that I was tormenting myself, it was about my lust.
It wasn’t about things that I needed it was just, you know, all these security blankets. I mean, the more I acquired I became more of a prisoner. I mean, you know, forty people on staff, and you can’t do nothing, and now creativity is impossible because all you can think about is all these folks that you know, you’re supporting and carryin’ and you know, it’s not good. You know, everybody…
a friend of mine says that every tub has to stand on it’s own bottom, you know. And in that respect, we all get to do what our passion is.
See , that’s what praisin God is all about, is doing your passion.
You know, it’s not useless, worthless ritual, you know, monotonous ritual, where we just show up and can’t wait to see the game, you know. It’s doing your passion and fulfilling your passion. You know.
That’s how we’re thankful. That’s how we say we appreciate the opportunity to be alive.

And I’m just glad that I, you know, I don’t have to slave anymore. You know, cuz I, music was my love, and because of everything I thought had to accompany my music it became my burden. It just got stolen from me. I said, What is this? How did this thing that I love so much so easily and so quickly turn to something I loath and hate?
And so now, you know, I understand that it was because I was measuring myself or trying to compare myself to a standard that wasn’t reality. It wasn’t the standard at all, you know. T
here’s a scripture in the Bible that we, what does it say, it says ‘We compare ourselves amongst ourselves’ you know. That’s not the standard. You already are the standard. What are you trying to fit into a standard for? We were each created to be individual standards, you know. And we’re trying to fit into a standard? It doesn’t make any sense, you know.

So now I’m just, you know, after all that, I’m just ready to be me. And it’s a lot to work through, you know, because all of us have hidden in these little boxes purposely, because of parts of ourselves that we were unhappy about. And it’s because we didn’t understand, you know, because there’s all this social doctrine that says, you know, that
The infinite God, with all this expression,
who created every single one of us,
absolutely different,
On purpose,
wants everybody to fit into the same suit.
But like, you know, that’s deception.
That’s deception.

(Talking to someone offstage) Okay, let me just, I think this is the wrong one (laughing) I don’t think this is the right one.

We took…we were in, um, Florida this weekend and we took the kids to Disney world, and um, you know we were going, they gave us a tour. They escorted us through the back. And when they escorted us through the back, we got to see how, you know, there all these people workin all hard, and it was like, real dirty back there, and of course, in the front it was all immaculately clean.
And I said, I said, you know, People need to see the reality, they need to see, you know, how these people slave to maintain this illusion.
And it felt like my life. I said, If people only knew what it was.

It’s like, you know, a bunch of musicians, listen, bustin’ their ‘mm’ workin all hard to make it look easy. What’s the point? You know, Oh, uh, I just threw this together, uh…(audience laughs).
You know, it’s like, you know what I’m sayin?
I mean, you know.
Slaving.
Slaving to act like, you know, I wake up like this. And none of us do, you know, none of us do.
None of us do.
And reality is good cuz that means everybody could just exhale, let your belly out, you know, and chill. You know. But people get mad at me when I say, Look, let’s stop frontin’. And I’m saying, you know, that’s the blessing.
Now we can go around and look at each other and say, Oh, you got one too?!
And be free.

And we want to defend the curse. I’ll tell ya, that was not fun. Did it for a long time...

Too long.
(offstage) You didn’t find it? It’s another white one. But you see…in my purse. Or the, the other bag? Or the green one? Ghetto. You know, it’s reality, okay (laughing)?

One time, it came to me, you know, I was just told very concretely.
You know, it was like that voice, the right one, said to me,
he said, Lauryn, You know the real you is more interesting than the fake somebody else.
I just want you to know that.

Because we always thought we could get, you know, we could get reality by just putting on the clothes and wearin’ the face and you know, lookin hard in the video. But, you know. Reality is..it’s like I’ve always told to my husband, it’s like, look, you know, we look at Bob Marley, you know, and we say Okay, let’s just grow locks and wear the clothes and have the band and we have no many idea how many years of struggle and pain and suffering that made that content. You see what I’m saying?

You can’t get it from the outside in. Truth is from the inside out.

You know, and the way we’ve been trying to heal and be healed is with these topical, surface, superficial, temporary solution. And I’m telling you, true healing is from the inside out. You know, we’ve been told to protect our outer man while our inner man is dying. (offstage) Oh, this is the one.

Boy I’ll tell ya, God made him for me. I’m something to put up with. And to endure that is amazing. I’ll be the first to tell you, trust me. Y’all could clap cuz that’s some real work (more clapping). I was in there in the room, you know, before we came out here, and he said to me, I said, Ro should I change? And he said, Yeah. So I looked at him, I said, Why did you tell me to change I was comfortable, man. But I asked him the question. So I went in the room and I tried on all these clothes and I was like, I feel like an idiot. So I pulled out all these clothes and I’m sayin, ok Ro, you know, Pack the bag neatly, you know, Could you put the clothes back in? And he’s like, Alright. So he’s trying to do this but then I’m like, No! Now take this out! Now put that back and take that out! Put that back, hold that, take, that, put, The orange shoe! The orange shoe! So I’m like. And then after awhile I just said, Ro baby, could you leave? Please get out the room. And I just put back on the clothes I came in. Okay, I was like…I’m just not there anymore. Nah, I’m telling you. It’s like, uh (laughing). Hey you know he’s learned. Because before we used to just beef and now he’s like, Okay…I’m out. It’s real. God gave us a brand new relationship, man, I mean, one in truth, you know.

It’s like, we date people, like let’s say, you know, we’re interested in somebody and we put on the perfume and dress up and then we do things that we will never ever ever do again! You understand what I’m sayin? It’s like…And that’s why so many marriages end up in divorce. It’s because people wake up next to a stranger.
They say, Who the hell are you? What are you doing in this bed?
Where’s that man that used to do ‘du, dua, and du.’
And I’m sayin let’s give them reality from the door because: you’re going to attract love,
and the one that really loves you. And then you don’t have to pretend and falsify, and you know, keep that posture.
You know, you know, I can’t, I’m just like...I’ll never forget when I first met him I said to him, it was like, he saw me eating in front of him, and he told me, he was like, You eat like a man, you must not like me. You know, because, women, usually they keep that posture. And I said, Nah. I said it’s not even that, you know. It’s but, this is reality. This is, you know, and that’s it, man, I mean, I’m just telling you, it’s so wonderful to finally find…

And trust me, it’s a work in progress, it’s not something that happens overnight.
We all have to be introduced to each other.

I’m telling you, I know that I’m up here and you see, Lauryn Hill, you came to see Lauryn Hill.
But this is the first time y’all meet me. You see what I’m saying? Don’t think you met me before, okay. And as I grow, you’re going to meet me a little bit more. You’re gonna be exposed to the real me a little bit more. I can tell you I had to reintroduce myself to everybody I know. My mother my father. Listen, y’all never knew me. I want to introduce you to me. I’m just getting to know me. And you know what, anything that’s not growin' is dead, so we better be changing.

You know, people would say to me, they would hold me hostage. And they, seriously, emotionally hostage, and they’d say, Uh, she’s changing. The money’s changing her. And I’d say Listen, the money’s not changing me, God’s changing me. I’m changing, because that’s a natural part of life. We’re all supposed to change. Who wakes up and is the same way tomorrow and the day after that? Nobody is. Let the experience teach you and be real, man.

And, um..there’s gonna be warfare involved. Because there’s some people who prefer deceptions, see. They say, uh, I don’t like this new expression, and I say, what, you want two-thirds of me to stay outside? I’m a whole person. You can’t say, you know, two-thirds of Lauryn, come in here. Only two-thirds is acceptable. I’m a whole person. You know. And that’s everybody.

You always talk about spiritual warfare and we didn’t realize that it was in relationships. It’s emotional warfare. Being able to tell the people we love the most the truth about ourselves. And when they say, Hey that doesn’t fit into our box for you, we say, well, I ain’t in no box. Don’t try to put me in one.

I’m going to play a little bit of guitar with this one, but I might stop it’s cuz I really want you to listen to the words, so if I stop, you understand why. I want you to really hear the words…

[Hook: SimonSayz]
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I don’t wanna be here by myself
But I’m just like you, and you don’t wanna be here by yourself
Wanna put my name on it, but don’t wanna end the friendship
'Cause that’s a declaration, of independence
Would you lie for it? Would you die for it?
Put fireworks all inside of that sky for it?
Would you wait for me, then get away from me?
Wait ‘til I come outside, hop inside the ride and floor it
Tell her, she’ll be safe with me
To the tellers in the safe with me
When the shootin' starts, don’t go with them
You should stay with me
'Cause in the race of hearts, that’s the place to be
'Cause the finish line is exactly where you start
So I’ll run around this whole bitch, just to end up where you are
Now that’s real shit, treadmill shit
I’m Treadstone but I feel shit
That’s Bourne knowledge, yes you are, you just gon' have to believe
That we 'bout to go to work so these niggas gon' have to leave

[Hook: SIMON SAYZ]
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now you all business, started up yourself a small business
And we all in this, no half-steppin', we high heel
All inches, high yield, small interest, hell yeah
That’s a loan and we owe some
But we pay the bank back out the same sack, same money we just stole from
That’s real, that’s a steal
Like four to two, I look forward to you, lookin' down on the field
And you look 4'2", look forward boo, don’t look down at your heels
Don't matter what's at stake, just let it burn, don't e'en look down at your grill
Either way we gon' ball, look around at your wheels
Even the baby gon' ball, look around at your wheels
This ain't my shit, this our shit
Look around what you build and that's great and shape
And you should look inside how you feel
You look and sound like you trill, you look inside for that feel
Or just look and sound how I look and sound
'Cause I look and sound like I kill niggas
And you just gon' have to believe
And babe, I'm 'bout to go to work so these niggas gon' have to leave

[Hook: SIMON SAYZ]
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
She don't want no soft nigga, she just don't want no false nigga
Daddy can be a gangsta, just can't be no lost nigga
If you a senior, be a senior
Don't be runnin' 'round like some frosh niggas
Snapback is great, but you're 'bout to graduate
Take your hat off nigga
Tiger did 'cause Tiger could
But if Tiger couldn't then Tiger wouldn't
That's a billion dollars off golf, nigga
She my fast money, my cash money, take a loss with her
And let's move slow and make a million dollars off cough syrup

[Hook: SIMON SAYZ]
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?

[Verse 1]
I caught you knockin' at my cellar door
I love you, baby, can I have some more?
Ooh, ooh, the damage done

[Verse 2]
I hit the city and I lost my band
I watched the needle take another man
Gone, gone, the damage done

[Verse 3]
I sing the song, because I love the man
I know that some of you don't understand
Milk-blood to keep from running out

[Verse 4]
I've seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
But every junkie's like a settin' sun

[Intro: Big Trigger]
Yea Ya'll know what it is
Rap City presents Em360
Slaughterhouse, Eminem, Big Tigg, Just Blaze!
On the 1s and 2s, oh-oh

[Intro: Eminem]
Yo Tigg, get in the not booth
And spit the truth, to the young youth

[Verse 1: Big Trigger]
Aight, ay, Amex don't leave home without your cards
But this Hip Hop, so don't leave home without your bars
And for some of these rap stars, that's just too bad
Cause you can't bring out them bars, that you ain't never had
It's Eminem and Slaughterhouse, yeah you know we the truth
And ohh the game is out of order, since we closed the booth
Yes indeed original, beats the replacement cause
The back room will never be what the basement was

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
I'm the realest mo'fucker that I know
Wasn't always the case guess the figure had to grow
I do it for the love I don't do it for the dough
But I know these sucker figures will so they keep me on my toes
What's sad is I couldn't tell you what I'm hated for
And them painkillers didn't murder the pain they gave me more
These fans on my head now they say they want the old Joe
I grew up mature y'all can't see that this the old Joe
Want to see me lose every battle of depression
No matter what it do to me, no matter my regression
They want to see me fall, want to ruin my regiment from the start
Want to cut the beat off soon as I let em in my heart
I'd be the first to admit it, lost focus for a while
Sendin' unsolicited dick pics to dimwitted thick chicks
Was so high I lost track of my ways
Then I fell in love with a baby and got mad at her age
The way she act and behave, was it an act or a phase
How you trife when I gave you life
You was lacking in wage
You don't want say hi or speak to me
Bet you makin 200 dollars by weekly
Try to help the world out, bring some reparation
And forget being humble in a state of desperation
Ain't gotta ask what to help with no hesitation
And for me to deal with it I might need some meditation
I love you but its best we stay apart, segregation
And to cope with the feeling I might need some medication
Trust me I don't never want to see that side of Joe
It would kill us all slow, one reason I'm the realest mother-mother I know

[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9]
Its Nickle, riding round in that Maserati four seat
Symbol on the grill looking like Tony Stark's goatee
Best rapper alive and you know me
The most distinguished shooter that's coming up out of the D since Joe D
I take mines at lead point
At the risk of having to shave my garlic clove in a razor inside a fed joint
Hip hop is alive, but the rhymes died
Only fear I have is "world star" being yelled from my blind side
Don't get me wrong it ain't like I ain't never lost a fight
But these days I'm more like a lyrical artiste
I'm outlining everybody in chalk white
The off-beat deceased version of Dr. Narcisse
This ain't blueprint, your idolizing
You tryna jump fast that's foolish of you in my drunk past and handing me my pilot's license
That's plain stupid, your boy's a star
Sitting in that drop top fish bowl and the doors ajar
It's ironic I remember when I couldn't afford a car
And now it's back and forth
The black one or white one I call 'em Macklemore
And Lord Jamar, first we defyin' the odds
We not a group, we more like a circular firing squad
This not a booth, this is our house and we won't stop
We killed the cypher two times already
What you gon' give us an award
But we won't stop for shutting down the internet
Now tell ya momma hi, and tell Rihanna we ain't finished yet

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
When we step in that booth, that's when the flame enters
Best spit, make any set trip, yeah its the gang members
Waving that shady flag, navy jag
Matching the yank' fit, with the polo brief showing, due to the lazy sag
I'm in a crazy kind of place
I got this thing right on my waist that'll leave tears on your baby mommas face
So chill, I'm in a crazy kind of place, I got this thing below my waist
That'll leave kids on your baby mommas face, for real
The flow gets cracked, as it came in capsules
Your cap just started snapping
My starter caps was snapping
When cross color was cracking
And my cane was half full
With the half moon park, hope you rap dudes smart
Don't piss me off like the bathroom mop
You don't want it with me
If I'm throwing hooks at you, that don't mean the chorus for free
So save your jabs its way better
If I start throwing jabs I'm talking Zabs first three round against Mayweather
Yeah I'm a crook from the brook, that mastered how niggas shook turned notebook
Broke cook, I'm so dope look
Bring the beat back with no hook just bars
Just a thing of ours that make their pants drop, make em open up their bras
Move g-strings like guitars, that's nothing, that's something light
Like Riesling at the bar
Y-A-O-W-A, if y'all ain't saying Yaowa by now you got nothing to say
This like NWO vs NWA, y'all like the rockers versus the ROC
Full of nothing but Jays
Check the rocks its nothing fugaz'
But don't get stupid my Cooper clique will throw shots for a couple of days
Make it horny when we out, Amityville horror, y'all don't want it with the house

[Verse 5: Crooked I]
Slaughter season, y'all the reason
Real dudes I'm bringing some more in
Like a Polynesian
Sick with the llama squeezing
Bullets flew and the chopper sneezing
Got your body and legs torn, but before you was airborne
You was bob and weaving still getting hit till your nos' is weezing
They set you deep in your coffin sleeping
I'm gone off the deep end, I'm a wolf, this industry my sheep skin
I'm out here hunting with my ink pen
I'm living like a kingpin
Doing it for my g's in the pen
Dreaming about two-piecing a police chief's chin
You rappers something candy coated, I don't like suckers
I'm Iron Mike, I don't like Busters
You looking for em' fly dudes like Orville and Wilbur
You got the Wright brothers
No bright jeans, no bright colors
I'm the second coming, the one that Pac predicted
Islamic, Gnostic and Christian, the flow so godly you got to listen
I backed you in a dodge a minute
Like MC Eiht in a L.A. hat, these rappers straight tryna dodge a menace
I'm looking at your videos, look like your watching tennis
Brothers dressed like Maria Sharapova wearing yoga pants
Meanwhile Big Poppa was rocking linens
I guess that era's over man, hold on
I'm splitting atoms when the scientific spitting is getting at em'
I give em' different patterns, they didn't fathom, they stealing my styles
Before me you didn't have em'
You rappers made in my image like when God was inventing Adam
Stab em in the abdomen when its crunch time
I truly flip like Mayweather pissed of at a movie script
Too many punchlines
Family I'm amongst mine
I keep the peace like a monks mind
.357 fade your favorite barber
Leave you in an old bush like an unshaven Barbara
Don't stop what we doing
When you see L.A. your team will be ruined
This game need a new villain, I'm the kind to murder you on vine, ooh kill em'

[Introduction: Big Trigger]
Ladies and gentlemen
Now introducing the man, the myth, the legend
Mister Marshall Mathers AKA (chicka-chicka) Slim Shady

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Ayo, can we cut this beat off?
I might need to do this acapella, yo
Role model?
I'll roll a model down a hill over broke bottles of Coke products
If she don't swallow, and tie her to the bumper, hit the throttle
While I'm tryna hit the potholes, I'll freaking take Madonna to McDonalds
Any ho'll end up horizontal gettin' fondled, I don't cuddle, I don't coddle
Only motto that I follow's everything I drive, whether it's a Navajo or a Tahoe
It's got a ho in it
Nah, ho, I don't got no freaking bronco
You looking for a buck, get a horse, fuck Tonto
I got a rusty Hondo with some bondo
And a box of condoms, little blond ho
Fuck me? Fuck you too, like I'm at Bonnaroo booing Bono
And I ain't from this planet so nanu, nana, nanu
I'm intolerable, too volatile, screw it
I don't gotta make the honor roll to be on a roll
I don't know much, what I do know I do it pronto though
So knock it off, all these knock-off-me's,
The last thing the world needs is another me
But if you think this is part two to Recovery
Or "Love the Way You Lie" part twelve
Or something heart felt, you 'bout to make a discovery
Like you found Christopher Columbus' compass
Ain't dumbing shit down for you dumb motherfuckers, so suck it
I took your best punchline like a punch in the stomach
That punctured a lung, punk, and I'm still functioning from it
Chump
It was nothing
Now watch while I fuckin' one up it and toot my own horn
Once I think of something to trump it
And I don't need a fucking instrument to sound off
Like the trunk of an elephant; the triumphant
Return of the ether spitting retard, reborn
But chances of you having another re-birth, slim to none
Like a skinny Mother Teresa, give a fuck if it's Easter, so kiss my keister
'Cause that's the only thing I'll turn the other cheek for

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Exhale the fucking essence, absorb me
Peace to Lonnie Londell
Everything is mar-vel
Kid, on this side we shine like the sun
Though the night brisk on the night shift
Peep the tight lips
Cause muthafucking loyalty is priceless
Fly bitch blow me harder than a vuvuzelo
My mood is mellow
Catch me hopping out the Cougar, yellow
Brew the Bustelo, Brosonlino
Smooth as Othello in convertible Z3's bruising the pedal
Chief of command, it's hard for you to try to see me
Your team ain't ready to win a war like Mussolini
Harsh as a Russian winter
Still we dining at Lupa right there on Bleecker and Thompson
Eating a custom dinner
Wine served, about a third of the glass filled
Premium rap skills, lounging in the Catskills
Let me end this with a kiss from my bitch
One love, Bronsonlino, signing off
Who better than this, kid?

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]
Luxury sports apparel is what I rock to cover feet
I feel like everyday is Thanksgiving
That's how we usually eat
Rep the street, my flow is heat
Queens made me complete
When we outside deep
It's like a Double L retreat
You know my status, everything's mar-vel
Hard shell shots will tear you up
Now you scar well
Bizarre hell, I'll take you there
Never fear nothing, not me
Shellfish specialist, I'll eat it if it's from the sea
Action Bronson is in the building
So it smells like half a key
He's usually smoking marijuana in a jacket past his knee
Yeah, we live this, still crispest
Back to business, fuck bitches
Most of ya'll were living blind until I hit the light switches
Peace to my dress code and my way of life
Super trife, slay your wife
Ask about the way Lauren can lay the pipe
Never duplicated, wordplay is custom made
Niggas know my steez
Catch me in Queens covered in suede (word up!)

[Verse 3: Shaz Illyork]
The fine fabric delegates
And Peter Pan Posse
This the finale, Youtube is where the fans watch me
High definition, Lo religion
Loving Scottie Pippen's
Switched it from Jordan Dream Team
It hurt the slutty women
Love to collab, I used to dabble in a couple of things
Facelift the Team, Outdoors, where the Mens will be
Cop Killer Queens, the Upper East, we need a gallery
We unscripted, real drama, never no fallacies
I might party like a rock star for a couple of days
A couple strays tag along taking bumps of K
I keep a Buddha, little liquor, make me triple stack
Ideal wifey, small titties and a lot of ass
They call me Shaz, before it was my government
Unholy convenant, could never get enough of it

[Verse 4: Fonda]
So pay attention when this rich bong's broken in half
And don't get left behind to choke on my gas
Ginger ale, juggle, Gen Pop, pockets intact
Prime king in the booth
I got it like that
But wait, audible react
Don't get caught in the trap
Real recognize real
And see it's part of the act
I break hearts, surround sound
With the sermon I spit
And leave behind a trail of permanent drips
In a room full of douchebags burning their lips
And bugging out about the right amount of water to mix
The freebase specialist, I dug him a ditch
Struggling with that addiction's a son of a bitch, fucko
I'll give you something to fix, get sober
You'll understand when you're older
The rap Al Bundy got the handicapped boner
Hot breath and the ice cold shoulder
So, give me room so my set can breathe
I'm from the Up East, plus I got connects in Queens
So how you want it?
Bent, skeed or straight blunted
My rap good like Deer Park in your stomach

[Verse 5: Machine]
Incredible Hulk, flash the villainous smile
He trying to stay young, he's never going out of style
Fresh to death like the corpse out the morgue
The new slang stay stiff, pause
No shirt when he record
Stay zoned, known to kick rap through payphones
Mighty Healthy set the tones
Spread the wealth through fly poems
Well known rap flesh
Keep it tight like close homies
And never known to flip like a Solid Gold Cody
Known to keep it scummy like a Sunday at Jones Beach
Known to keep it bummy like a Sunday at Centre Street
Known for having fun, blacking out, that's the motto
@toechamp, twitter game you should follow
US Weekly with the centerfold
A thousand tapes pressed up
A thousand tapes sold
Kids screaming out, "when the mixtape coming?"
Streets is fiend out, yo, they really need something
Understood, no matter what
Shine like the sun
Remember one thing
? rap and number one

Don't want you ringing my bell
It's too late for you to be my honey

[Chorus]
Ooh, it's my love
Ooh, it's my own true love
Ooh, it's my love
Ooh, it's my own true love

Follow the line, you better follow queue

[Chorus]
I say, ooooh, it's my love
Oooh, it's my own true love
I say, ooooh, it's my love
Oooh, it's my own true love

[Verse 3]
I could sail a river run dead, but I know it's dead
I could I wish for a million, yeah, but I know it's dead
I could cry within the darkness, I sail away
I save a lifetime forever
But you know, you know, you know what I say

[Outro]
And I say Ooh, it's my love
Oooh, it's my own true love
Yeah, gimme some gangsta shit curr
Some of that hood shit
Coming up
How that sound ?

I've been doing this shit since day one
Yeah nigga, day one, day one yeah

Let me, let me tell you what your worth is
Wake up in the mornin with a purpose
Only you can make me happy, surface
East side long beach baby, the turf shit
The place where I lurked at
13 on the scene getting bent back
With a whole lotta snake venom
Used to steal annihilators out the highway center
Up early getting shit started
Back flippin', trippin', tippin', Crippin' cold hearted
Way before I got high man
Both double up 15s from the pie man
Heat out the motherfucking frying pan
Little kids love Snoop, fuck IronMan
I'm a vet on the set I ain't lyin man
Let me show you how fly I am
Play in the school, lay in the pool
And I stay in the cool
Young loc I ain't playin with fools
Reset, repeat
Unlock and recock
The heat and it gets so fast
Spend yo cash
It will get in yo ass
Now the question is this for now
Are you really in love with that bitch yo?
Another man's trash is another man's treasure
What's your pleasure?
Looking at you straight from a falcon eye
On my balcony, asking how can I?
How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me

Curr I used to run with struck out gon' away
Cold things is he called me on the phone today
Told me he was up for release
Its been about a dub since cuz seen the streets
Yeah loc, shit don' change
Long Beach don' flipped crazy durange
Everybody sellin' out, word of mouth, the OG's tellin' now
I drove there the other day
To chop some game with my big homie Donald Ray
Its sort of hard for me to run away
Step out my car no gun today, underlay
I press my luck, if I get stuck, well then thats whats up

How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me
The true definition of that mixtape

How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me

Somebody pass that piff, grow it up
Thats My Work, 2
We active

[Intro]
God feel me
God feel me
Ride low
Feel me
Feel me
Weezy-F where you at?

[Verse 1]
Look, A straight up Compton nigga til Im 6 feet
Like Iverson be
Ride and die for mines
Its just me
No side on mines
Because I don’t need niggas switching sides on mines
Childhood friends become enemies
Don’t pay’em no mind
Do your mind like they did Kennedy's
Closed casket
Ghetto boys world where we make the murder bracket
High shore taxes
High by the dead beat daddy’s and the mama’s who can smoke the rock the fastest
So he tote llamas middle finger to ya
I never fuck hoes with no condom
Not a high school graduate
Hustlin is where his passion is
Hit the blunt then passin it, hit the bottle then passin it
Hit the gas, hit the brake, hoppin out, blastin it
Where da cash, where da safe?
A robbery’s taking place
Give it to him willingly; he’s killing you anyway because it thrills him
You can almost see his adrenaline pumping
Hey young world we are the children

[Hook]
It’s a young boys world out here
We gotta dredge-it up and down these blocks you got to know
It’s a young boys world out here

[Verse 2]
I swear to god you gotta feel me
Look..standin on the corner with crack rocks and marijuana
Burner glue, dough and I’m duckin police
In California state penitentiary livin
Feelin like the whole fuckin world don’t love him
So fuck yall
Keep thuggin til the casket drops
Gangsta down to the socks
Wankstas betta beware tryin to be what you not
Just look at his position and the city he live in
Bang the hood like a head on car collision
Bang his tool like a mechanic up under the engine
Knocking on they doors telling neighbors mind they business
Cause 9s can finish off any eyewitness
Don’t call the lieutenant miss Parker he meant it
I’m the author of these delinquents that got you timid
See to you he’s a menace but to me these my niggas
I do this shit for my niggas locked up in that system
Jason head hold ya head
Jewel keep written sentences
Maybe these jail sentences nothing but a young boys demise
And a reminder every time you walk outside

[Hook]
Feel Me, feel Me
Real Talk, what's up

[Verse 3]
Look, my nigga just had a daughter
Only way to feed his daughter
Said he hustlin harder hope no charges get brought up
Tryin to stay out of gunplay so he see her tomorrow
Back inside the gunplay soon as his homies call him
For that mission again on they mission again
Pop another blue pill then feel relentless again
Waking up in cold sweats see the image again
Nightmares of his victims keep on visiting him
Plus his people keep telling him use your common sense
So he tell’em retaliation is commencing
That’s all they know as a Compton kid
Living only for the moment fuck a consequence
His accomplishments lies deep within
The black heart that hoes be hatin violence
Use violence as his defense so in his defense remain militant
I’m the voice of hell that we livin' in
So when the devil got they tongue, I be speakin' for them
Talk to me, 

[Hook] talk to me

I’m the voice of hell that we be livin
So when the devil got they tongue I be speakin for them
Yung boys

[Hook 2]
It’s a young boy's world out here
I said I'm out here baby I said I’m out here baby
If you livin in this life blessed one day at a time
It's your world young boy you can heal or destroy
Make it wrong or make it right
It's your world you decide
Said it's yours young boy
Said it's yours young boy
Oh oh oh hey hey yaya baby yaya baby

[Intro]
I, I can't really explain what is is she does
But um, yeah, whatever it's um, it is
Whatever it is It's simply amazing

[Verse:1]
Her head is on my chest
The sun comes rolling in
We're lost in these covers, and all I feel is skin
I slowly kiss your face, beautiful in every way
You are, you are

[Hook:1]
See I'm a man, that don't believe in much
But I'll be damned if I don't believe in us
And how we play fight up in the bathroom
Next thing you know I'm making love to you
Girl, promise me you'll never change

[Chorus]
She ain't perfect, but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me, and it's simply amazing (you are)
Simply amazing (you are) simply amazing
And she loves me, and it's simply amazing
Amazing amazing

[Verse:2]
The girl's a work of art, and I can't help but stare
Got the smile like the sunset, and the ocean is her hair(ooh)
What she do ain't fair(ooh)
And she know me better, than I know myself,(mhmm)

[Hook:2]
See I'm a man that don't believe in much
But I'll be damned if I didn't believe in us
Like when I said I love you for the first time
And the tears dropped from your eyes
Girl, don't you ever change

[Chorus]

[Verse:3]
There is nothing, in this world
That can keep me away form you
And ain't nobody,(hey)
Who could ever compare to you, (whoa, oh)

[Chorus]

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Gravity's my enemy
It grabs at me like I'm money
The stars are bangin' close to me
As I'm floatin' in a life odyssey

[Chorus]
My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in space odyssey
My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in a space odyssey

[Verse 2]

It's got color waves following me
And I still judge it week by week
And I'm 'head of time, so you'll never lose me

[Chorus]
My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in a space odyssey
My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in a space odyssey

[Bridge/Breakdown]

Can I take a minute or two
To introduce my point of you
I need to spend some time with you
There's nothing more new on the news

[Chorus]
My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in a space odyssey
My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in a space odyssey

[Verse 1: Toro y Moi]
I don't know how
How we're gonna get out
But I'm not scared
Of getting point to point

And I won't care
Leaving everyone behind
Cause I've got them all
Leaving with me in my mind

[Chorus]
You know I can't do everything that is best for us
Leaving our home, makes us grow, then I'll go with you
Then I'll go with you
Then I'll go with you

[Verse 2: Toro y Moi]
You know I'll be alright
With whatever it is
Our choices aren't too bad
It's the distance
I know I push it over
And I'm sorry for that
Don't mean to make this hurt
When we haven't started yet

[Intro]
(G.O.O.D.) (Press play, press play, press play)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I bounce back in this bitch like a reflex
It’s obvious they trying to stop Sean like an eclipse
I’m laughing out loud to the point I might cry
Cuz nobody blocking mine like a nigga 9-9
See I am a phenom, you are a feline
You are a bitch, boi! Sweeter than key lime
D-Town
The bullets and the people seem to ménage
Hit you in your shirt, now your chest look like a collage
This is not a fairy tale or facade
Niggas tripping to the point, nowadays I’m yelling “Bon Voyage”
So in and so forth, I go in and go hard
And when it’s time to go on, bet everybody go off
Yeah, I know you niggas can’t stand my city
How they feel to hear a “Big” this good still living?
I came from the bottom
Remain at the bottom
So long, I probably made a stain at the bottom (at the bottom)
Yeah it floods when it rains at the bottom
But my dynasty reign bitch, rain till we drowning
And you’re broke until you realize something
That money’s like fucking, yup, money’s like fucking (ok)
You grind hard enough then bitch’ll keep cumming (yeah)
I’d rather keep coming in the set and see nothing
They like how he make something, when they ain’t give him nothing
How he stay proactive and kept the shit bumping (yeah)

[Verse 2]

I hop on top of tracks and just start Forrest Gumping (Gumping)
Label full of stars like the fucking flag or something
Everytime we do a show it’s like a hip. hop. summit
A beast ontop of beats, bitch my studio is haunted (is haunted?)
Please believe me boy, cuz I will ghostwrite your shit like a Ouija Board (yeah)
You hang with niggas draped in Louis Vuitton
I hang with the niggas who make Louis Vuitton
We running this shit with a baton, I promise (what)
Ima bring it home, designated driver
And all we want was money and power
Some niggas moved powder, baked, without flour (without flour)
Till they see our money rose like flour
Resort to violence cuz we can’t afford Islands (Amen)
Damn reverend we need money and a blessing (a blessing)
Just call it Creflo Dollars
Missed church service (uh huh)
My grandma say I’m reckless
She mad that I’d rather rock Jesus on my necklace (Amen)
Big cars, big cribs, big bills
Always was a big deal way before the big deal
And that’s real

[Pre-Chorus]
You won't give me no more
You won't give me no more
You won't give me no more
You won't give me no more
You won't

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same?
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same?

[Verse 1]
I've been comin' up for a while on ya radar
I know I made it just by countin' up my haters
I got a speedboat, get away, like later
You better have a load of chedder if you ain't got data
(Give me no more, you won't)
Cause you can live it up, pull it up, start reelin'
Start throwin' hands up like you're mad at the ceilin'
You can make a killin' but don't forget the feelin'
People stealin' money and down with double dealin'

[Pre-Chorus]
You won't give me no more
You won't give me no more
You won't

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same

[Verse 2]
You can take me Courthouse
You can take me Jail
You can take me anywhere
But you can't get me there
You can ask me where I'm goin' and I'll tell you, crazy
But when I get to where I'm goin', you should come with me
You've been stayin' up, pull me up, start reelin'
I'm throwin' up my hands like I'm mad at the ceilin'

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same?
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same

[Bridge]
I got roof on my head
I got food in my pot
And the old ways are dead with the new ones we got
There's water in my pot and I'm half and half not
And the old kind is broke
With the new kind we bought
I drink alcohol, know the words to Wonderwall
I rewrite the code while I do my time on road
Ohhhh
Ohhhh
Ohhhh

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same?
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same?
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same?

Don't look now

[Verse 1: Far East Movement]
I saw you dancing on that speaker box, girl what's your name?
(What's your name? What's your name? What's your name?)
I see you texting on that BBM, can we exchange?
(Can we exchange? Can we exchange? Can we, can we, can we?)
I got two glasses at my table, can I show you the way?
(Can I show you the way? Can I show you the way?)
(Come on, girl)
Tonight's the night to let it go, go, girl it's okay
(Girl, it's okay, girl, it's okay, girl, it's okay, girl, it's okay)

[Verse 2: Far East Movement]
Yeah, I'm not looking for no strings, you're not looking for a ring
If you're ready for this fling, then meet me in the back
I never knew it'd be like this, such an unexpected twist
Started off with just a kiss, I don't know how to act

[Pre-Chorus: Keri Hilson]
Dear heart, I know I promised you I'd take it slow
Dear love, I know I swore on everything I own
But I can't resist
How's just one kiss?
But don't look now

[Chorus: Keri Hilson]
You've got me goin', I'm goin', I'm gone
Don't look now
You've got me goin', I'm goin', I'm gone
Don't look now

How's just one kiss?
Don't look now

[Verse 3: Far East Movement]
Yo, my heart is pumping like that bass before I pick you up
The way we stole each other's hearts, we playing Stick-em-up
I take a shot of Cîroc to get me in the zone now
She took a step out the door, from head to toe she's all "wow"

[Verse 2: Far East Movement]
Yeah, I'm not looking for no strings, you're not looking for a ring
If you're ready for this fling, then meet me in the back
I never knew it'd be like this, such an unexpected twist
Started off with just a kiss, I don't know how to act

[Pre-Chorus: Keri Hilson]
Dear heart, I know I promised you I'd take it slow
Dear love, I know I swore on everything I own
But I can't resist
How's just one kiss?

You've got me goin', I'm goin', I'm gone

[Bridge: Far East Movement]
There's somethin' about this girl

She's got me doin' things I never did before
Damn, there's somethin' about this girl
She's shakin' up my world
She's got me out my zone, I'm losin' all control
There's somethin' about this girl
She's shakin' up my world
She's got me doin' things I never did before

[Intro]
Hey, girl, it's not a question if you're sexy
The only question it is ‒ what you know about these stereotypes?
C'mon

[Verse 1]
So innocent, you can tell by the clothes
College girl with a 4.0
Good girl by day
Damn, who would have known?
But when the lights go (Lights go) down
And she's out on the floor
The freak comes out
And she loses control
The way she moves got me begging for more (For more)

[Pre-Chorus]
She's dancin' like there's no one else in the room
Private dance for two
'Cause in the dark, it's like she's someone else

[Chorus]
She owns the night
She owns the night
She owns the night
She owns the night
She owns the night, night, night
I'm talking to you... and you
She owns the night
She owns the night
She owns the night
She owns the night
She owns the night, night, night
I'm talking to you... and you

[Verse 2]
Shawty like when the bass vibrate speakers
Her body's hypnotic
The fellas all wanna meet her
Can't leave without saying goodbye to your angel face
Fly me home under your wings, baby, wings, baby, wings, baby
We can go back to my crib
First time, I'll blindfold you
You can't know where I live
I'm kidding, girl, it's your world I'm living in
Me, I'm just visiting
Why don't you put on a show for me?
Baby...

[Pre-Chorus]
She's dancin' like there's no one else in the room
Private dance for two
'Cause in the dark, it's like she's someone else

[Chorus]
She owns the night
She owns the night
She owns the night
She owns the night
She owns the night, night, night
I'm talking to you... and you
She owns the night
She owns the night
She owns the night
She owns the night
She owns the night, night, night
I'm talking to you... and you

[Bridge]
She owns the night
The night is hers
Make reservations
To view them curves
She speaks that body language
Ain't got to say a word
All eyes on her

[Chorus]
She owns the night
She owns the night
She owns the night
She owns the night
She owns the night, night, night
I'm talking to you... and you

I'm talking to you... and you

[Intro]
I wanna see (Your body)
I wanna feel (Your body)
I wanna touch (Your body)
I wanna kiss (Your body)
I wanna freak (Your body)
Wanna sex
It's nothing like (Your body)
(Your body)

[Verse 1]
It's like a jungle atmosphere
And we're two monkeys baby
It's like we're on a vine
The way we're swinging it baby
See, you're a tiger girl
The way you're scratching me
I'm a lion
In this jungle, I'm a king
Girl, I got you so wet
It's like a rain forest
Like Jurassic Park
Except I'm your sex-a-saurus baby
You and me hopping
Like two kangaroos
Rattling and moaning
Out here in these woods

[Bridge]
Ooo ooo ooo ooo, aaa aaa aaa aaa
Those are the sounds I wanna hear
When you're moaning in my ear
Girl, you're singing to me
Ooo ooo ooo ooo, aaa aaa aaa aaa
You got me locked up in your cage of ecstasy
And I don't wanna be free 'cause it's

[Chorus]
Wild like a zoo
And that's the way I like it, baby
Crazy me and you
Making love like we was just two heated animals
Baby come and lay with me in my jungle

[Verse 2]
Ooo, I swear I'm about to go
Turn your body around and beat the skins like it's a bongo
A thousand birds up out the tree
Girl, like a swarm of bees
That is how it's gonna be
Climaxing you and me
Touch the root of your soul
Let Mother Nature take control
Over us is rain and leaves
So come on girl
Let's plant these seeds, yeah

[Bridge]
Ooo ooo ooo ooo, aaa aaa aaa aaa
Baby, those are the sounds I wanna hear
When you're moaning in my ear, singing
Ooo ooo ooo ooo, aaa aaa aaa aaa (oh yeah)
You got me locked up in your cage of ecstasy
And I don't wanna be free 'cause it's

[Chorus]
Wild like a zoo
And that's the way I like it, baby
Crazy me and you
Making love like we was just two heated animals
Baby won't you come and lay in my jungle

[Bridge]
Y'all don't understand
Like two cheetahs running free
African butterfly to me
You're my safari fantasy
Girl this is heaven to me
Baby, we are like coconut and banana trees
(It's a tropical)
Tropical chemistry
Like the wildlife
I'm doing you baby
(I'm doing you baby)
You're doing me, baby
(You're doing me, baby)
It's you and me
(It's you and me)
Going wild

[Chorus]
Wild like a zoo
And that's the way (Oh baby) I like it, baby
Crazy me and you
Making love like we was just two heated animals
So baby come and lay with me in my jungle
(I don't wanna break free 'cause this is)
Wild like a zoo
Just the way I like it, baby
Crazy me and you
Making love like we was just two heated animals
Girl come and lay with me in my (lay with me) jungle
(Girl I like it 'cause it's)
Wild like a zoo (Wild like a zoo)
Crazy me and you (Crazy me and you, Yeah)
Heated animals (Heated animals)
Girl come and lay with me in my jungle

[Outro]
And the whole jungle goes
Ooo ooo ooo ooo, aaa aaa aaa aaa
Ooo ooo ooo ooo, aaa aaa aaa aaa
Ooo ooo ooo ooo, aaa aaa aaa aaa
Ooo ooo ooo ooo, aaa aaa aaa aaa

[Verse 1]
I've been known to flip on niggas, spaz on bitches
One state of mind, I'm out for the riches
I've seen good crack, uncle stuck in the kitchen
Now behind prison, phone calls can't visit
Seventeen, half of my life has been explicit
Rated R content, no supervision
With you talking nonsense, I'm not trynna listen
I'm a point guard, small forward, play your position
Before you wind up in the lake with the fishes
On a blind date with a crocodile, vicious
I switch the flow so you say that I sound different
But the flow is the same reason my dick kill bitch kissing??
And that's the same reason your not in my competition
Cause I swear right now that none of yall existing
Fall off is probably what you wishing
But I can't stop, won't stop, young gunning you niggas
I've been known to have stash for the burnnin
And break a bitch down to the point that I learn them
And when I get dough, I'mma let you know, throw the cake in your face like Ike Turner
I turn a schoolgirl into a dick smuggler, sex publisher, rated X government
See me in the hooptie boy, it's not a cover up
See I'm a young black boy who don't give a fuck, what
This that gangsta shit that make you wanna grab your shit
Cock back and blast some shit
Empty, reload the clip
You won't find nothing hotter than this
Whatcha know about it
This that gangsta shit that make you wanna blaze this spliff
Get drunk, grab a fifth, open it, guzzle it quick
You won't find nothing hotter than this
Whatcha know about it
I'm the kind of guy
Who lives life on the edge
The kind of guy you'd wonder
"is he messin with my head"
You're tired of going places
You can't scream and shout
Tired of someone saying
When you can and can't go out
And i'ma show you how
It feels when it's good
You know i do it better than
You're boyfriend ever could

(Bridge)
Then your boyfriend ever could
Then your boyfriend ever could
I'ma do it better then your boyfriend ever could

(chorus)
I'ma make you love me baby
Baby i'ma show you how
I'll make you love me babe
Baby you gon' want me now
I'ma make you love me baby
Baby i'ma show you how
I'ma make you love me baby
Baby you gon' want me now..
I can reach your mind
Fantasies in your head
You could look at me
And see that i'm the man
I'll put a little romance
And some action in your pleasure
You wanted mr. big
Mr big is in your hands
And i'ma show you how
It feels when it's good
You know i do it better
Than your boyfriend ever could

(Bridge)

(Chorus)

And I want you
And how I want you to want me
I want you
And yes I want you to want me
I want you
And how i want you to want me
I want you
And yes I want you to want me
I know you've been kissin'
The back of your hand
What you need to do
Is try it on a real man
Put the towels in the dryer
So they warm after the shower
I'm like big foot
The man your momma said don't exist

(Bridge)

(Chorus)

I'm like big foot
The man your momma said don't exist
I'm like big foot
The man your momma said don't exist
I'm like big foot
The man your momma said don't exist
Don't exist, don't exist

[Chorus]
Over you I've been goin' crazy
I wanna buy a ring and make you Mrs. Sexy
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next G
Tell me I can't finesse this R&B

[Verse 1]
Me and JAY-Z were coolin' at La Esquina
Seen a all-world cover girl
"Hey lady, I'm sorry if you're in a rush
Don't let me hold you up or intervene or interrupt, but
You got the look, I wanna get to know you better"
I had to let her know, but yo, I couldn't sweat her
'Cause if you would've seen what I was seein'
Almost looked Korean, but European
When she spoke, her accent was self-explanatory
Even her body language told the story
Her name was Mahogany, twin's name was Ebony
I said my name was Rob, and this is JAY-Z

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, yeah, ah yeah, yeah, yeah
I want you to be mine, ah yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Over you, I've been goin' crazy (I've been goin' crazy)
I wanna buy a ring and make you Mrs. Sexy
(Make you my girl)
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next G
(Make your, make your, make your money)
Tell me I can't finesse this R&B
Over you, I've been goin' crazy (I've been goin' crazy)
I wanna buy a ring and make you Mrs. Sexy
(Wanna make you my girl)
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next G
(Let's make some money, baby)
Tell me I can't finesse this R&B (Mmm, child)

[Verse 2]
It's funny how time flies when you're havin' fun
We got close and it was almost one
She kissed me slow but you know how far a kiss go
Fuck around and miss the show
So I told her "Hold that thought real tight
We'll finish where we left off later on tonight"
In a rise, I knew that she wanted my agony, agony, agony in her body

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, oh yeah, yeah
I want you to be mine
I want you to be mine

[Chorus]
Over you, I've been goin' crazy (I've been goin' crazy)
I wanna buy a ring and make you Mrs. Sexy
(Wanna make you my girl)
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next G
(Let's make a family)
Tell me I can't finesse this R&B (Over you)
Over you, I've been goin' crazy (I've been goin' crazy)
I wanna buy a ring and make you Mrs. Sexy
(I wanna make you my girl)
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next G
(I wanna start a family)
Tell me I can't finesse this R&B (Mmm, child)

[Bridge]
Showed her some sights then I took her to the condo
She's pipin' hot but don't know me so well
She asked me how come I don't smile
I said everything's fine
But I'm in a New York state of mind, baby
Yeah, I said everything's fine but I'm in a New York state of mind, baby
Oh yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Over you, I've been goin' crazy (I've been goin' crazy)
I wanna buy a ring and make you Mrs. Sexy
(Make you my girl)
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next G
(Make your, make your, make your money)
Tell me I can't finesse this R&B (Mmm)

[Verse 3]
As we reached the kingdom she said
"Bring some champagne, I'll entertain, then sing some
Sentimental songs real gentle"
It hit the spot and you know where we went to
As we embraced, I felt our heart pumpin'
She was in the mood for somethin'
So I laid back on my back and relaxed
It wasn't the Perignon that made me collapse

[Chorus]
Over you, I've been goin' crazy (I've been goin' crazy)
I wanna buy a ring and make you Mrs. Sexy
(Wanna make you my girl)
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next G
(Make your money)
Tell me I can't finesse this R&B (Here to make you my woman, baby)
Over you, I've been goin' crazy (I've been goin' crazy)
I wanna buy a ring and make you Mrs. Sexy
(I wanna make you my girl)
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next G
(Let's make some money now)
Tell me I can't finesse this R&B

[Outro]
Hey, hey
I want you to be mine
I want you to be mine
I want you to be mine
I want you to be mine
I want you to be mine
I want you, I want you to be mine
To be mine

[Verse 1: Robin Thicke]
I lost my way, I did so much wrong
God, I need a friend to help me get along
I need my baby, gotta get her back
I need lady luck to get her from where I'm at

[Chorus: Robin Thicke, Jazmine Sullivan]
Gotta make it rain (Oh, oh, oh, million dolla baby)
Make it rain (Oh, oh, oh, million dolla baby)
Make it rain (Oh, oh, oh, million dolla baby)
Luck be a lady, luck be a lady tonight

I'm playin' for hours, I'm bettin' on even
The waitress is rockin'
I need some more booze please
I'm doubling up, I have money to spend
And I look at the dealer, thinking, "Should I hit?"
And I'm shaking my hands
And I could see I better go now

[Chorus: Robin Thicke, Jazmine Sullivan]
I make it rain (Oh, oh, oh, million dolla baby)

Instigators, like putting fire on propane
The wrong thing, they be worrying about
Ooh you know females and how they like to run they mouths

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna be, wanna be just like talk like, you
Like you, you, like you
Misery, misery loves company
Don't let 'em change your mood

[Chorus]
They try to get at me (they try to get at me)
Behind your back (your back, your back, your back)
They tryna tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad, all bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad, so mad, my bad
No I ain't all bad

[Verse 2]
Between us, they wanna come in
Your worst enemy, so they try to be your best friend
Perfect, ain't saying that I am
Proven, at least I've proven that I give a damn

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna be, wanna be everything I oughta be
To you to you, to you
Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you
That's what they do

They try to get at me, they try to get at me
Behind your back, your back, your back, your back
They tryna tell me that I'm just like the others

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci got it going on, bout to roll one a mile long
Walking through Hell with gasoline drawers on
Niggas saying the 'wop falling off, they got me all wrong
Bullshit on top of bullshit, it get piled on
I'm a OG, you better get your child, take your child home
You'll be long gone, all gone, no one to call on
Big diamonds on my bezel, damn near bigger than rhinestones
GuWop, 1017, 'nother milestone!
(Hello, hello, hello, I'm painting everything red, no more yellow
I'm pulling double headers, wish I never met her
Rihanna, Umbrella, Gucci, 

[?], I'm like "fuck a Cinderella")
Puchanella, Puchanella wearing cashmere sweater
This year I'm doing better so my paint mo' wetter
And she can't trick you less you let her, my Jordans patent leather
I want your bitch, I go get her, smashed her, now can't get rid her

[Bridge: Young Thug]
Puchanella, Puchanella, give me that pussy, don't let up
I chase that paper, don't let up (x2)
Kiss that little girl one time, then I'll never let her let up
Kiss that little baby one fucking time, then I'll never let up

[Hook: Young Thug]
100k spent on my rings, 100k spent on my jeans
100k spent on my..., 100k, throwed on her spleen
100k, fucked all her team, 100k spent on her...
100k spray through my team, we chase paper, Charlie Sheen

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I guess them bezzie, my wife, done slaughtered them
I'm not Casino but I just be killing it, killing it, killing it
The bitch say she wanna fuck on Young Thug because he the real-i-est
Ah! Bitch, I'm attending the party, these niggas are jeal-i-ous
I done po'd a eight inside a fo', I'm po'd (slow up)
I done spent my last thousand with mojo
I'm so easy to rob, I'm always at the store
I could treat her like cray cause I keep big ol' bowls
Ah, she got that "come back", she got that "hum-tam"
She got that Bill Clinton, she got that YSL
She got that "skrr-skrr", she got that "ooh-wee"
She got that bomb, lady, she say I'm ugly

Illy-girl, illy-girl, illy-girl
Illy-girl, illy-girl, illy-girl
Illy-girl, illy-girl, illy-girl
Illy-girl, illy-girl

[Verse 1]
Daddy can be rough, that's why I can be tough
Thick skin even when it comes to little bit of love
Around doing stuff, police put me in cuffs
Ain't a victim but I am a diamond in the rough
(I'm illegal, fuck your law!)

[Chorus]
Illy-girl, illy-girl, illy-girl
Illy-girl, illy-girl, illy-girl
Illy-girl, illy-girl, illy-girl
Illy-girl, illy-girl

[Verse 2]
Shirts, tops, tees, I'm always in tight jeans
I know Billie Jean, I know Bruce Springsteen
I also know Palestine and Mujahideen
Playin' Tekken on the weekend, eating mangosteen
(I'm illegal, fuck your law!)

[Chorus]
Illy-girl, illy-girl, illy-girl
Illy-girl, illy-girl, illy-girl
Illy-girl, illy-girl, illy-girl
Illy-girl, illy-girl

[Verse 3]
Lean-mean-machine kinda stream with my team
I'm from England, from Mitcham near Cheam
Have you heard my dream? Even Martin Luther's keen
So I put it down on my track, explain what it means
(I'm illegal, fuck your law!)

[Outro]
(I'm illegal, fuck your law!)

[Verse 1]
I'm just a rock star stabbing away
I'll take the, I'll take the leave for another day
A modern scholar, just let me know if I sing too much
When you're head over heals and the magic is there
But impossible

[Pre-Chorus]
Possible
Impossible
And when the police take me away
Possible
Impossible
It wasn't you it was mothers' day

[Chorus]
Let's get this show on the road
Let's get Atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get Atomica

[Verse 2]
They protect you from the voices
Protect from the visions
Protect you from the silence for another day
These modern people sure know how to live
When you're head over heels and the magic is gone
It's impossible
Impossible

[Pre-Chorus]
Impossible
Impossible
That we should swim in a covered up pool
Impossible
Impossible
By the white trees dressed in purple tulle

[Chorus]
Let's get this show on the road
Let's get Atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get Atomica

[Bridge]
I hold myself like a god
Like a god
I hold myself like a god
Like a god
I hold myself like a god
Like a god
I hold myself like a god
Like a god
Like

[Verse 3]
I'm just a pop star jumping away
I leave the, I leave the sins for another day
A little puny, and just let me know, if I talk too much
When you're head over heels and the magic is there
But impossible

[Pre-Chorus]
Impossible
Impossible
That we should swim in a covered up pool
Impossible
Impossible
By the white trees dressed in purple tulle

[Chorus]
Let's get this show on the road
Let's get Atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get Atomica
Let's get this show on the road
Let's get Atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get Atomica
I took the call, I packed the bag
I ride the train to the pick-up point
I’ll be telling myself
There was no other way
That you brought it on yourself
Now my heart’s aflame
At the end of your life
It's the end of your life

I’ve got a pool of blood
On this bathroom floor
The mirror’s broke
There’s a crack in the door
There’s a broken window
That I’ll be crawling through
Then I’ll change my life
And we won’t have you
We won’t have you
No, we won't have you

Good or evil
Saint or whore
The mythical public
I don’t recall
You were on the ledger
Your name was double crossed
You were a prime assignment
So help me Christ
I’ve got major questions
About the Lord above
About Satan below
About the way we love
About the rule at the top
And the people coming up
And I still don’t know
What we were looking for
But it wasn’t you
No, it wasn’t you
No, It wasn't you

It wasn’t you
No, it wasn’t you

[Intro]
Born in a UFO
She was born in a UFO

[Verse 1]
I come to the glade and watch the saucer land
She glided through the mist in an a-line skirt
Booted her shoes like hooves in the dirt
Her clutch bag reflected the sun and steel
The 50's movie, so many squealed
There’s no direction home she pleads
She cornered me against the trees
I was home I thought, my life could start

[Chorus 1]
She was not like the other girls
I was born under a stone
We were born with a single voice
She was born in a UFO
Born in a UFO

[Verse 2]
My friends sit around at the end of town
With their heads in their hands in the cool twilight air
I can see by their eyes that they’re bitching sore
I’d rather be dead than fool around here anymore
She was all courage, geometric face
Electric skin, plastic and lace
Silver hair, trapezoid flanks
I was so in love with her lavender vest

[Chorus 2]
She was not like the other girls
I was born under a stone
We were born with a single voice
She was born in a UFO
Like outer space

[Chorus 1]
Born in a UFO
She was born in a UFO
Born in a UFO
She was born in a UFO

[Verse: M.I.A.]
Got myself a calling card, America is free!
It's 10 cents a minute after 59, free
30 minutes spent on calling baby daddy
I got 10 spent of haters with the lawyers after me
10 by my rapper friend called Nicki
I had 9 left for somebody to talk to me

[Sample: Nicki Minaj]
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka

[Intro]
But anyway, I wanna thank you very much once more for coming. This is my favorite thing to do to perform, uh- and you coming allows me to do that and I really, really do appreciate that. Uh, honestly and genuinely. Um, I will now recede back into my stage persona. I just blacked out for ten seconds
Love songs used to be so beautiful, you know?

"Let us go then, you and I
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table."

- T.S. Eliot, beautiful. Love songs nowadays, just as beautiful, guys! If not more. Justin Bieber, One Direction, Usher, you know them. You know their love songs, beautiful, complex love songs but these new artists, the J Biebs, the One D's, the Ushers

They've- they've done something very strange to the format and the structure and the purpose of love songs, and I tried to capture how they've changed it with this love song.  I hope you enjoy it and most importantly, mark the differences

Jason DeRulo

[Verse 1]
I love your hair, I love your name, I love the way you say it
I love your heart and you’re so smart ‘cause you gave away it
I love your sis, I love your dad, I love your mum
But more than all of that I love the fact that you are dumb enough
To not realize everything I’ve said has been said before
In a thousand ways, in a thousand songs, sung with the same four chords
But you’ll still love it, and let me finger you!
YEAH, FINGER YOU! FINGER YOU!

[Bridge]
Oh, girl, I hope you don’t think that I'm rude
When I tell you that I love you, boo
I also hope that you don’t see through
This cleverly constructed ruse
Designed by a marketing team
Cashing in on puberty and low self esteem and girls desperate need to feel loved

[Pre-Chorus]
America says we love a chorus
But don’t get complicated and bore us
Though meaning might be missin'
We need to know the words after just one listen so

[Chorus]
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I love my baby and you know I couldn’t live without her
But now I need to make every girl think this song’s about her
Just to make sure that they spread it like the plague
So I describe my dream girl as really, really vague like
I love your hands ‘cause your fingerprints are like no other
I love your eyes and their bluish, brownish, greenish color
I love it when you smile, that you smile wide
And I love how your torso has an arm on either side, now
If you're my agent you might be thinking, “Oh, no! Sound the alarms! You’re not appealing to little girls who don’t have arms!"
But they can’t use iTunes so fuck 'em, who needs them?

[Break]
Oh girl... oh hello, Satan!
*Eats microphone*
Satan, you taste so good!
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, everybody!
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, come on, louder, I can't hear you!
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff

[Pre-Chorus]
America says we love a chorus
But don’t get complicated and bore us
Though meaning might be missin'
We need to know the words after just one listen so

[Chorus]
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Yes, repeat it
Repeat it till the day that you die

[Bridge]
I’m in magazines full of model teens
So far above you
So read them and hate yourself
Then pay me to tell you, "I love you"
I love you
And the parents will always come along
Because their little girl is in love
And how could love be wrong?
How could love be wrong?

[Chorus]
When you repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, I am a vessel, 666, Illuminati, Freemasons

[Outro]
Ohh, we know it’s not right
We know it’s not funny
But we’ll stop beating this dead horse when it
Stops spitting out money
But until then, we will repeat stuff

[Verse 1]
I licked envelopes wrote a letter to the pope
He never gave me rope in the times I couldn't cope
He never gave me rope in the times I couldn't cope
They cleaned up the dope and censored my scope
The writin' on the wall's been beaten to a pulp
The writin' on the wall's been beaten to a pulp

[Hook]
All I ever wanted was my story to be told
All I ever wanted was my story to be told

[Verse 2]
I never got struck by someone in my core
I never took back that joint I rolled
What happened now to the truth that I told?
Do they all roll over and die in the cold?

[Hook]
All I ever wanted was my story to be told
All I ever wanted was my story to be told

[Verse 3]
A skateboard rolled, a lighting bolt
It's droppin' on em but it ain't their fault
It's droppin' on em but it ain't their fault
And maybe I am floored but it needs to be told

[Hook]
All I ever wanted was my story to be told
All I—all I ever wanted was my story to be told, ah

[Verse 1]
It won't be in vain
To swallow all your pain
And learn to love what burns
And gather courage to return to

[Hook]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

[Hook]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

[Verse 2]
The light will shine through the rain
And heaven will hear them call your name
And home will feel like home again
Corruption will fill your brain

[Hook]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

[Hook]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

[Verse 3]
They will parade upon your victory
They will parade upon your victory
You'll put a smile upon their faces
The world will be yours for the taking
The story you birth will be ageless
Just learn to love pain and be patient

[Hook]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

[Hook]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

[Verse 1]
Poor Peter Parker was pitiful
Couldn't have been any shyer
Mary Jane still wouldn't notice him
Even if his hair was on fire
But then one day he went to that science lab
That mutated spider came down
Oh, and now Peter crawls over everyone's walls
And he's swingin' all over town

[Pre-Chorus]
La li la, li de da
La la, li le la da dum

[Chorus]
Sling us a web, you're the Spider-Man
Sling us a web tonight
Cause we're all in the mood for a hero now
And there's evildoers to fight

[Verse 2]
Now Harry the rich kid's a friend of his
Who horns in on Mary Jane
But to his great surprise, it seems she prefers guys
Who can kiss upside down in the rain
"With great power comes great responsibility"
That's the catch phrase of old Uncle Ben
If you missed it, don't worry, they'll say the line
Again and again and again

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, la la la, di de da
La la, di di da da dom

[Verse 3]
Now Norman's a billionare scientist
Who never had time for his son
But then something went screwy and before you knew he
Was trying to kill everyone
And he's ridin' around on that glider thing
And he's throwin' that weird pumpkin bomb
Yes, he's wearin' that dumb Power Rangers mask
But he's scarier without it on

[Chorus]
Sling us a web, you're the Spider-Man
Sling us a web tonight
Cause you're brave and you're strong and so limber now
But where'd you come up with those tights?

[Verse 4]
It's a pretty sad day at the funeral
Norman Osborn has bitten the dust
And I heard Harry's said he wants Spider-Man dead
Aw, but his buddy Pete he can trust
Oh, and MJ is all hot for Peter now
Aw, but Peter, he just shuts her down
Mary Jane, don't you cry, you can give it a try
Again when the sequel comes 'round

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, la la la, di de da
La la, di di da da dum

[Chorus]
Sling us a web, you're the Spider-Man
Sling us a web tonight
Cause we all sure could use us a hero now
And we think that you'll do all right

[Verse 1]
Been trying to think of something colourful for the season
Pull the wool over the gullible for no reason
You are all I have these days, shake it up and run away
With the night squabbling behind you

[Chorus]
From the smoke in your hair
To the blood in your bruise
And the bows on the shoes you kicked off
I'm joining the dots
I'm joining the dots

[Verse 2]
I thought I heard them talking in their sleep yesterday
And I tried but I just can't believe a word they say
Hurry up, they'll be here soon, sleeping in the afternoon
While the rain is trying to prove a point outside

[Chorus]
From the smoke in your hair
To the blood in your bruise
And the bows on the shoes you kicked off
I'm joining the dots
I'm joining the dots
I'm joining the dots

[Bridge]
Those people make me cough
Can't the flame come up to the moth for a change?
And darling, if it's all the same to you
I'll have you to myself

[Outro]
I'm joining the dots
I'm joining the dots

[Spoken]
Have a listen to it, I don't know...

[Intro]
When I'm on the phone
I get no reception here

Miss, would you be interested in switching your
Internet service providings to a provider that provides
A better service of internet service
Providing than your current provider?

...Uh

[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street
And the billboards seemed to stare
And then the purses seemed to date
With dated what they did wear
And the buildings on the bankquet
You dresses it so here
When I'm on the phone
There's no reception here

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't understand me
You don't know my game
I say "What's the malfunction?"
You say "Internet connection!"

[Chorus]
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down

I crashed again last night
I was on there surfing out of my mind
I crashed again last night
I was on there surfing out of my mind

[Verse 2]
The system shutted down
They tried to take what I found
I'm holding shit around town
Trying to hold me down
I'm standing at the station
In need of education
It's the medicated nation
We can't be more patient

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't understand me
You don't know my game
I say "What's the malfunction?"
You say "Internet connection!"

[Chorus]
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down

[Post-Chorus]
I crashed again last night
I was on there surfing out of my mind
I crashed again last night
I was on there surfing out of my mind

[Verse 3]
Do something
Do something
Do something, do
Do something
I'll date you
I'll take you while I'll peck him on the lips
I'll take him on my hips
These geeks are just freaks
And I got 'em on my flip
I'm getting off the computer
I'm going to do something
Yeah, something

[Chorus]
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down

[Post-Chorus]
I crashed again last night
I was on there surfing out of my mind
I crashed again last night
I was on there surfing out of my mind

[Outro]
You got the beat, turn it up
You got to give it to me
You got the beat, turn it up

[Verse 1]
It could be worse
I could be alone
I could be locked in here on my own
Or like a stone that suddenly drops
It never stops, no

[Verse 2]
I could be lost
Or I could be saved
Calling out from beneath the waves
Beaten down by this ocean rain
Never again
Never again

[Chorus]
Screaming out from the crests of waves

[Verse 3]
It could be worse
Bitter or sweet
It could be snapped from the jaws of defeat
Or like a light lit up on a beach
Wear your heart on your sleeve

[Verse 4]
You want to stop before you begin
You want to sink when you know you could swim
You want to stop just before you begin
Never give in
Never give in

[Chorus]
Screaming out from the crests of waves

[Bridge]
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Except life and the love you make

[Chorus]
Screaming out from the crests of waves

[Outro]
Screaming out from the crests of waves
You're longing to be saved
Screaming out from the crests of waves
You are longing to be saved
Screaming out from the crests of waves
That's a record

Uhhhh...
Huh

Yeah, I kick it root down
I put my root down
I kick it root down, I put my root down
So how we gonna’ kick it?
Gonna’ kick it root down
Yeah, how you wanna’ kick it?
Gonna’ kick it root down
So how you gonna’ kick it?
Gonna’ kick it root down
Gonna’ break it on down, gonna’ kick it root down

It's not a put down
I put my foot down
And then I make some love, I put my root down
I’m like sweetie pie by the stone alliance
Everbody knows I'm known for dropping science
‘Cause I'm electric like Dick Hyman
I guess you'd expect to catch the crew rhymin'
Never let you down with the stereo sound
So, Mike, get on the mic and turn it out
We're talking root down, I put my boot down (boot down)
And if you want to battle me, you're putting loot down (loot down)
I said it’s root down, it's time to scoot down (scoot down)
I'm-a step up to the mic in my goose down (goose down)
Come up representing from the upper west
Money Making putting me to the test
Sometimes I feel as though I've been blessed
Because I'm doing what I want so I never rest (yeah, Mike it, Mike it)

Well, I'm not coming out goofy like the fruit of the loom guys
Just strutting like The Meters with the “Look-ka Py Py"
Cause downtown Brooklyn is where I was born
But when the snow is fallin’, then I am gone (oh weee)
You might think that I'm a fanatic
A phone call from Utah and I'm throwing a panic
So break it to the root when we kick it on down
Jimmy Smith is my man, I want to give him a pound

I kick it root down, I put my root down
I kick it root down, I put my root down
So how you wanna kick it?
Gonna kick it root down
Cause how we gonna kick it?
Gonna kick it root down
So how we gonna kick it?
Gonna kick it root down
Gonna break it on down, gonna kick it root down (yeah)
Well, Adrock (huh)
Don't stop, come on
Just get on the mic with the tic and the toc

I'll fill you to the fuckin' rim like brim
I'm walking down your block and you say that's him
There goes the guy with the funky sound
The Beastie Boys, you know we come to get down
Because I've got the flow where I grab my dick
And say “Oh my god, that's the funky shit!
So I’m-a pass the mic and cause a panic (yeah)
The original nasal kid is doing damage

Every morning I took the train to High Street Station
Doing homework on the train, what a fucked up situation
On the way back up, hearing battle tapes
Through the underground, underneath the sky scrapes
Like Harlem World Battles on the Zulu Beat Show
It's Kool Moe Dee vs. Busy Bee
There's one you should know, (yeah)
Enough of that, I just want to give some respect due
MCA, grab the mic and ma bell will connect you

Bob Marley was a prophet for the freedom fight
"If dancin' prays to the lord then I will feel alright"
It feels good to play a little music (music)
Tears running down my face ‘cause I love to do it (love to do it)
And no one can stop this flow from flowing on
A flow master of disaster with a sound that's gone (yeah)
I'll give a little shout out to my dad and mom (yeah)
For bringing me into this world and so on
I kick it root down, I put my root down
I kick it root down, I put my root down
So how we gonna kick it?
Gonna kick it root down
Yeah, how you wanna kick it?
Gonna kick it root down
So how we gonna rock it?
Gonna rock it root down
Break it on down, gonna kick it root down

Yeah, that shit's on down

And that's a record, that's a record cause of Mario
And that's a record, that's a record cause of Mario
And that's a record, that's a record to Mario

Awww, now that's a record, buddy

[Intro]
I won't change

[Verse 1]
I'm try'n to keep the options near
I want you home, I want you here
The last you saw across the track
The rest are never coming back

[Bridge]
If anybody wants to know
Our love's getting old
Light in the cracks in the road

[Chorus]
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
(I won't change, you know that)
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
(I won't change, you know that)

(I won't change, you know that)

[Bridge]
If anybody wants to know
Our love's getting old
Light in the cracks in the road
You carry me

[Verse 1]
On a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
Well, it's quite not London
Or the south of France
Or an Asian Island
Or a second chance

[Chorus 1]
Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by

[Verse 2]
You're a distant memory
You're an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I can't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress

[Chorus 1]
Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by

[Chorus 2]
Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July

[Bridge]
And it's safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star or two
Change a southern night for you

[Chorus]
Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by

[Chorus 2]
Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July

[Outro]
Going back to Nashville
I'm going back to Nashville
Going back to Naaaaahh....
Going back to Nashville
What's the use of wondering why?

[Verse 1]
What is there to say
When in front of you there lays
A strong path that paved your way
Now shattered lost shades of grey
I guess I missed her
This overgrown sister
With no cement in the mixture
Well let me paint this dark picture
They weren't men
They were duds
There was blood
Fed and thugs wed her calm heart
And now she’s laying in the dark
In a pool of filth
I found a body in the dark
I found her body in the dark

[Chorus]
I guess it’s my turn to burn through
The rest of these funny days
I stress when my turn to
Earn you a better life runs astray
I can’t say what’s right
But understand the pain that enslaves
It hasn’t hit me as easily
As some might say

[Verse 2]
We all find a day
To slip away
You pour your heart, your aching soul
Where I stay bold
Look for the times you took to hold
My naked soul
Deep sea diver
Born skiver
Two month fiver
I’ve hurt everyone but you
I see things simple
But it only rekindles
These dark shades of blue
It’s the darkest shade of blue
It’s the darkest shade of blue

[Chorus]
I guess it’s my turn to burn through
The rest of these funny days
I stress when my turn to
Earn you a better life runs astray
I can’t say what’s right
But understand the pain that enslaves
It hasn’t hit me as easily
As some might say

[Bridge]
It hasn’t hit me in the same way
It hasn’t hit me
There was not much else to say
It hasn’t hit me but I still feel the pain
It hasn’t hit me
There was not much more to say
Has this hit?

[Verse 1 - M.I.A.]
There's main stream
With the main dreams
But waterfalls start with a little stream
Even Kubrick started with a small scene
Before it became The Shining
If you're coming from the hood work on getting knowledge
If you're from the frontline then you wanna survive
I didn't choose the battles but the battles chose me
When the bullet first hit my cousin Willsie
I been in the game now 5.3
Lil shorty but got shorties after me
I stay humble cause the shit I've seen
Cause I already know there's only one me

[Hook - Blaqstarr]
I really would like see the star shine
But the light getting covered up in hard time
Oh, oooh, I need to let loose
And the water ran dry, fill it up with juice
Oh, they need a believer

[Verse 2 - M.I.A.]
There's no mean and there's more mean
Every tree started with a little bean
Everything you go through at 17
Will it still count at 70?
If I'm coming from the streets then I'm getting money
But my deeds in the bank are worth plenty
I didn't choose the music but the music chose me
The art of hitting your speakers making it bleed
I've been thinking about what effects me
And the will to survive is always in me
Every glass of water grows what I be
And every glass of liquor gets me tipsy

[Hook - Blaqstarr]
I really would like see the star shine
But the life getting covered up in hard time
Oh, oooh, I need to let loose
And the water ran dry, fill it up with juice
Oh, they need a believer

[Verse 3 - M.I.A.]
It's about people, not money
Light up parliament, turn a car key
I could be a genius, you could be a cheat
It's a thin line, I'm fucking with it
I didn't choose the struggle but the struggle chose me
I'm bouncing on the rubble permanently
I'm cut from the cloth that you ain't made me
Driving down the alley these cats know me
If it's not cool, then we bring heat
If there's no heat then it's discreet
If it's got your feet then, it's on N.E.E.T
Anything on N.E.E.T. has got that beat

[Hook - Blaqstarr]
I really would like see the star shine
But the life getting covered up in hard time
Oh, oooh, I need to let loose
And the water ran dry, fill it up with juice
Oh, they need a believer

24/7, 365, Kendrick Lamar is always right on time

Oh, you thought you had me all figured out?
Take it from the horse's mouth, you'll never understand me

I told you the plan B was to win your hearts before we win a Grammy

These days ain't shit changed, different toilet - same shit
And I drunk a whole gallon of laxatives by accident just to shit on you has beens

Had it been for my past tense I wouldn't be rappin'

But now I'm here, GQ, man of the year
Reminder that you can click the images for more annotations.

Every member of rap's Mount Rushmore dropped new albums in 2013—Kanye, Jay Z, Drake, Eminem—but it was another MC altogether who stole the crown, and he did it with just a handful of verses: Kendrick Lamar, the latest—and possibly greatest—rapper to come straight outta Compton.

We are 10,000 feet above Compton in a private jet, and Kendrick Lamar is explaining to me what happened to him yesterday, when he vanished. We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided, cue-the-G-funk-synth Star Maps tour of his neighborhood, the one he still more or less lives in, starting at his parents' house a couple of blocks from his old high school, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, he went AWOL. The whole day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby Death Row Records that originally signed him, could track him down. Kendrick was gone.

It turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his "little bro"—a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to Kendrick's parents' house. He held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds.

So today, here on board this Challenger 300 seven-seater, en route to New York City's fall Fashion Week, a destination filled with people Kendrick isn't sure whether he wants to impress or fuck with, he's telling me about Chad. "It all happened when I was overseas," he says. "I had to talk to him over Skype on the hospital bed before he passed."

It's been a strange year. When it began, Kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerds—one of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers ever—and since then his legend has spread fast.

It actually began late last year, when Kendrick's major-label-debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city,dropped, to universal acclaim. The album—about a day in the life of nerdy Compton teenager K.Dot and his homeys as they run around in his mom's minivan chasing "that crazy-ass girl Sherane"—is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man, simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster rap's violent tropes and a celebration of its signature, slow-rolling sound. On good kid, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. He's the game's most linguistically cerebral MC, but also its realest—the one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dude's house—and it's this polarity that makes listening to King Kendrick feel like you're putting on the illest 3-D glasses in hip-hop. The music nods at influences far beyond the West Coast—Beach House samples, Dungeon Family lushness—but throughout, his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street:If Pirus and Crips all got along They'd probably gun me down by the end of this songGood kid, m.A.A.d city sold an industry-shocking 241,000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer. Then, in August, Kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse into his buddy Big Sean's song "Control"—a guest spot on a song that didn't even make the final record. After Big Sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit, Kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe, calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game: Drake; A$AP Rocky; J. Cole; Tyler, the Creator; even Big Sean himself. The dude slaps Sean on his own song. He also proclaimed himself "the king of New York," which to certain East Coast ears sounded like a Greek dude strolling into Troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of Hector.

"Control" leaked on YouTube late in the day on August 12; for a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar.

Kendrick's career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. Chad Keaton's memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Next it was on to Vegas to perform at a pool party. He only made it "back to the set" to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. "It can be complicated and confusing," Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. "From my perspective, it's not just I'm famous—I still live in this world." And when someone back home needs something, "I still gotta get that phone call."

It's clear the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small guy, just five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, it felt like I was talking to a wizened rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break, and he lay down on the couch to rest. Just kind of curled up with his back turned.

A bit later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: "When the cameras stop rolling, it doesn't mean real life will follow." Instantly it had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000. Then he tweeted a picture of Chad: "Rest N Heaven my Lil bro. Watched u become a man. U fought bro. The city stole yo life, but not your legacy."
On the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over "Control" was peaking, I tailed Kendrick through the backstage maze at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. At one point, he ran into Drake, and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. It was their first encounter since Kendrick called him out on "Control," and of all the slaps in that verse, this one felt the most personal, because Drake had helped break Kendrick, handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album. After Drake's VMA performance of "Hold On, We're Going Home," Kendrick made his way back to the greenroom, crooning the hook: I got my eyes on you.... He caught mine and smiled. "You watch," he joked, "I'm going to be singing by my fifth album!"

I asked if this meant things were cool between him and Drake. He paused. "Pretty cool." Shrugs. "And I mean, I would be okay if we weren't."

A month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not cool. After Drake's new album dropped, he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the "Control" thing: "You can't just say that and then see me and be like, 'Yeah, man, what's up?'—pretending like nothing ever happened." Seemingly in response, during the BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher a few weeks later, Kendrick freestyled: Nothing been the same since they dropped "Control" / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes.

I got Kendrick on the phone after the BET taping, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzy's public lash-out—"Control" named names, sure, but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers Kendrick actually gives a shit about. Most of them took it in that spirit. Not Drake. "Yeah, I guess he took it as a dis," Kendrick said, downplaying talk of a beef. But he was also clear that he doesn't look up to Drake, doesn't see him as any kind of creative influence. When I asked if Drake was a mentor or a role model, he replied quickly, "No—peer. If anything. We all peers."

When Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before you roll your eyes, Lamar wants you to know that he's not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-Nitrian-Desert, vision-seeing type. He knows how this sounds.

"I was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on Mom's couch. I'm 26 now—it wasn't that long ago. I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking to me. Weirdest shit ever. I'm not huge on superstition and all that shit. That's what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, 'Don't let the music die.' Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like he's right there. Just a silhouette."

The visit from Pac changed Kendrick's connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. "It wasn't just about money, hoes, clothes, drinkin'," he explains. "I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that there's people out there that can't really connect to that lifestyle. They're in the struggle."

Much of Kendrick's music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his household's chaos—some of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Compton—and over his neighborhood's warped commitment to adolescent pride. It's an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. Kendrick doesn't smoke weed or drink booze. In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. "When I ask OGs why there's so much division in the streets—nobody never really knows," he says. "But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman."

A few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendrick's hotel room and everybody was in a lull, staring at cell phones, waiting for news about afterparties. A plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by Diddy at the Dream Downtown hotel. But one of Kendrick's Top Dawg boys leaned back and said, "Aw, man, I can't go to no club."

Kendrick spoke up.

"We have to go."

"Look at you! We have to go. You're never we have to go."

"You know me," Kendrick explained. "I only go when there's a point. Usually the point is just niggas drinking. But walking through the club the week after I released the 'Control' verse? That's a point!"
Twenty minutes later, Anthony "Top Dawg" Tiffith, basically TDE's Suge Knight, asked if I had had a fun day. I said that I had and that I was surprised by their discipline. "You guys seem so calm," I said.

"Well," Tiffith told me, "we're going to have to call it a night with you, because we about to get uncalm. You understand."The gossip from Diddy's Ciroc Amaretto Launch Party/VMA Afterparty sounded like it fell out of a massive tear in the mid-'90s West Coast-East Coast time wave. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at Dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminati—Jay, Bey—mouths agape as a wasted Diddy, incensed by the "King of New York" boast, attempted to pour a drink (Ciroc Amaretto, presumably) over Kendrick's head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z acolyte J. Cole, who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos. Naturally Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. "It was all love at that party," he told me on the private jet.

After we land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I catch a ride with Kendrick into Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week kickoff party in Chelsea thrown by industry doyenne Jenné Lombardo, and in the car he goofs around, imagining the horror he and his Compton homeys could inspire: "We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K.Dot and them Piru niggas."

By the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty fucked-up. There's chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call-and-response for "Swimming Pools (Drank)," a song about his family's dark relationship with chemical dependency—Head shot. DRANK. Sit down. DRANK. Stand up. DRANK—a wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. There is something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent Fashion Week party.

It's hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will step into Top Dawg's booth again, and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. "I don't know," he says. "It depends on where my emotion is. How angry I'll be, or how happy I'll be, or how confused I'll be."

At one point on good kid Kendrick raps, "I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew life can be dangerous". The biggest change in Kendrick's life is the inversion of rap's consummate observer becoming the observed. How will all eyez on him affect his art? Because he's already 10,000 feet above Compton, and rising.

[Hook]
Zane Lowe: Welcome back to Radio One, Maida Vale studio 4 here we are. Part of the reason we're here obviously because its the BBC but also because we have Studio 3 around the corner and you've got the band set up and going to perform some songs as well.

Eminem: It's super exciting to be here. I was trying to figure out how I was going to top the publicity of yours and Kanye's interview so I decided I was going to walk in here, pee on the floor, and leave. I'm peeing right now. Alright see you guys later!

ZL: Seeing you with the band, and seeing you perform the other night at the awards show and seeing you on the mic, it was, I don't think I've ever seen you more alive on the mic. It was full of energy and in the moment. What I noticed was as well was spitting live with the band behind you seemed to free you up a lot more. Are you feeling that way?

E: I think performing has gotten a lot different, it's gotten better with the band because there's just more elements to it and being it is a live show, there's more places you can go with it. There's things you can do with your hands, it's really cool, it's different. I think it's better.

ZL: Spitting Rap God that just puts everything into perspective I think for everybody else. When you wrote that and you got that one down and recorded it...

E: I didn't write that, I freestyled it, off the dome, 1 take.

ZL: Absolutely ridiculous. I mean, the song is ridiculous it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

E: Thank you

ZL: When you get to perform that live that must be, I saw at the end once you finished that, that's a challenge for anybody. At the end you must feel like 'Wow'. That's a lot of rhymes to get through, it's like 5 or 6 minutes non-stop.

E: Um, Yeah the other night I don't think we did the whole song. We did kind of a Deadly Medley.

ZL: I don't even know how you would cut that up and make a shorter version of that because it's such a stream of consciousness through the whole track.
E: Yeah I don't know. I wouldn't even want to begin to think of that, because I think it is a... stream of consciousness. Nice stream of consciousness, running down my leg.

ZL: The album itself has been so well received by everyone including fans across the world. Because in my opinion listening to it now it's kinda the perfect combination of the venom and the danger that existed on the 1st record but also what you've been through and what you've learnt over the past 5 or 6 years. It's kind of like the combination of the two. Is that fair do you think? The first album that feels like it's slightly grown up, but also going back to some of those subject matters and dealing with that stuff.

E: It's grown up and down. I mean some of the themes and topics and things like that are revisited on this album, but at the same time I feel like its kind of a 2013 version. All my albums I think, for the most part, pretty much tell where I'm at, you know at each one at that time period, whatever. So this is kinda like, there's a lot of reflecting and things like that back on everything that was happening during that time, you know. And it's kinda like me reflecting on it and getting to the point where I am now with it.

ZL: Settling some scores as well, and burying the hatchets and dealing with stuff once and for all. Do you feel like this album has allowed you to do that?

E: I mean some stuff, yeah. But for the most part I just felt like it might be fun to just revisit that, the overall vibe of that album. Just because it started to go there in the recording process.

ZL: So when did that begin like you were going down that road?

E: I had started making a few records for it, and it just sounded like the tonality of it, the tones of the records kinda were heading towards that way. And I figured out what direction it should go in, kinda started gearing everything that way. And alotta times, making an album, I dont always have the direction or concept early on. Sometimes it doesn't come until the middle/towards the end of a record to figure out where I'm actually going with that... that's just a culmination of songs, and depending on what the vibe is. Sometimes I do a songs that is so left field one or two of them its like Oh Shit where am I going to put these songs and now what am I going to call it because its not going to make sense to go, let's say Recovery or whatever. But with this one I feel like I kinda got an earlier idea for a concept.

ZL: That must be nice actually to be able to sit down and carve it out as it was going and have that end result in mind, to piece it together that way.

E: It was, but it wasn't, in the sense of-- I had to record a lot of songs for it because I felt like if I'm going to call it that, I want it to make sense.

ZL: And the stakes are high as well. I was talking to someone about this before and they were saying, "Eminem would never consider one of his albums to be a classic" he's not that way inclined. But you know how people feel about the Marshall Mathers LP, it speaks volumes. And then the critics, every layer of it, it is considered a modern day classic album. Did you consider the expectation of calling it that and what it would mean to the record overall?

E: Yeah, I had kinda known that going in. Once I kinda knew what direction I was going, I knew that I needed certain songs to be able to call it that, and like I said to be able to make sense. But, I just wanted to make sure that I had the right ones, and in other words, I knew that, obviously Stan off the first Mathers LP was a big topic. And I had heard a lot of chatter around the time doing the Recovery record that I should do Stan 2 and why doesn't he do Stan 2, and all I kept thinking was Stan's dead. You know what I'm saying, he died in the story. So in the back of my mind I kinda had an idea of who could be left from the story, but I needed to get the right beat and be able to...

[plays song]

ZL: As soon as it starts as well. Did you know immediately this would be the beat for this concept?
E: Yeah, as soon as I heard the words to the chorus... I got this beat, this beat was sent to me and had those words on it. And sometimes for me it's like- I like making my own choruses and its also fun for me to take someone else's words and interpret them my own way.

ZL: For sure, when you hear that chorus I'm sure initially... it's a 1st person scenario or self hatred scenario, but its tied into- there's layers to that. Being bad is good I hate to be it but here I am and I'm back again. And then you got to deal with the story, and at the end it's taking everyone to the end when you couldn't be facing down any more of the criticism both self and by others that you faced throughout your career. I mean it's the ultimate type of acknowledgement isn't it?
Meeting your maker almost really, is that the inspiration behind it?

E: It's kinda like saying, if you're going to go down this road, then you're going to call it this, and this is going to be the title, and this is all of these things coming back on me.

ZL: It's an amazing opening to the record and it's really ambitious as well. So you set the bar really really high and from here we go to Rhyme or Reason, and I love that beat and love the big samples and first time you reference Rick Rubin as a producer on the record. When did you first have the idea of working with Rick?

E: I've always been a fan of Rick's, and my manager Paul had been talking to him and Rick had expressed that he had interest in working with me. And when Paul brought it to my attention I was like super excited, honored at the fact that he was even thinking about it. I had my reservations just because I felt like I'm a super fan of Rick, and I'd probably be a little nervous and wouldn't know what the vibe would be because I would be wanting to impress him. It was very much the feeling that I got early on with Dre.

ZL: Had you met Rick before?

E: Nah, I'd never met him. So I was like nervous to meet him and you know, even more nervous to work with him.

ZL: Same thing with Dre, all the way back, same kind of experience when you walked in the studio and saw Dre that time..

E: Yeah I'm still always trying to impress Dre too to this day at the same time. But I just kept thinking if I got in the studio with Rick, what if we're not able to come up with anything. I had all these things in my head, and then when I met him, the guy's so laid back, it made it easy. And his vibe in the studio is very much like... "Try whatever", don't be afraid to try whatever, even if the idea in the beginning is stupid. Because a lot of ideas in the beginning stages, not mine of course, mine are just insane from the moment I think of them- but sometimes ideas are not always the greatest.

ZL: Don't be afraid to fail to get somewhere else, to get on the journey.

E: So if you say one thing that's going to spark another thing to lead to a better thought, that's kinda how it went. We started going through old break beats and I was trying to tell him I kinda had the idea, I kinda had a notion that I was going to call it the Marshall Mathers LP 2, but I didn't want to say anything yet to him because I wasn't 100 percent sure- and I wanted to make sure that I had enough songs to even play for him that would make sense. I love the sound that Rick gets when he does hip hop. Even from early on, Beastie Boys- it's incredible. And that's what I was kinda hoping to get.
How can I make the record sound nostalgic, but subliminally nostalgic. So it reminded you of maybe 13 years ago when you first heard me but its overs beats that are even older, but you're not sure why you feel this way. Tried to create a feel, so we started messing with old samples and break beats and things like that- cuz Rick is super talented and mastered of every other genre of music as well. The way he dips in and out of just different genres is crazy to me. Like I said, I was hoping to get what I got from him.

ZL: The first time I saw Berzerk as well, I was so happy to see the way that you came through, and the video the way the colors were so reverse Beastie Boy style- it was fan boy stuff for me. To be able to go out in a beanie like the Ad-Rock thing and it was cool, I love that.

[Verse]
Standing outside that venue, passing out fliers
No record labels calling, no buzz, no fire
Burning in my lungs if I kept on writing
One day I'll be discovered and somebody might sign him
Naw, naw, now saying that I'm pop 

[?]
Before I was on anybody else's iPod
Sleeping on couches and praying to my God
I'm making that money to eat at a IHOP
Give me twenty people, turn them into believers
Booked my own shows in two-hundred-seat theaters
Searched my whole life on this podium, I speak for my hard work
I deserve this arena
When you work your whole life on the verge of defeated
Do it for yourself because nobody out there believed it
Record label, naw, we show the world you don't need 'em
The people want to see change, I so happen to speak it
And me, I'm like, "Who are you?"
God damn it, I'm myself, and I know the truth
And I released that shit when I was in the booth
Shoutout to my family in Syracuse

[Hook]
Everybody say oh-oh! (Oh-oh!)
Say oh-oh! (Oh-oh!)
Say oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh! (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!)
Say oh-oh, oh-oh! (Oh-oh, oh-oh!)
Say oh-oh, oh-oh! (Oh-oh, oh-oh!)

[Outro]
It goes, "Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people say true," I said
"Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful, all my people stay true"

[Verse 1]
Deep in the play
I see you as you are lookin' over
Friends in my way
You never could've been a good lover

[Verse 2]
Watch what you say
Could never mean a word and still hurt you
Look the other way
Just tell me that I'm wrong
So wrong

[Chorus]
I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

[Verse 2]
Forty-nine days
Surely I should be feelin' whole lot better
Ways and ways
You keep on comin' back
I keep lettin' you in

[Chorus]
I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough
I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

[Instrumental]

[Breakdown]
I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

[Chorus]
I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough
T-Pain is working on a comeback plan. In April, Pain—real name Faheem Rasheed Najm—started by cutting off his signature dreads and revealing the title of his fifth studio album, Stoicville: The Phoenix. The album title signifies his “happy place,” or his moment of Zen where he can go and nobody will judge him. Given the talks of the Tallahassee native being on a hiatus, he’s using his free time to perfect his craft and explore his roots again. The fans won’t have to wait much longer for his rebirth.

“I went off for a little while trying to reinvent myself and try

[ing] to do different music and stuff. Everybody was saying that you need to switch it up,” Pain tells XXL on the phone while on the way to the studio in Atlanta. “That was the Revolver album, and it didn’t do as good as I wanted it to. People like familiarity. People like to know what is happening. It was only right that I go back to what made me the T-Pain I am today.”

Pain’s referring to “Up Down (Do This All Day)” featuring B.o.B and produced by the purveyor of ratchet, DJ Mustard, which he released in August. The twerk-ready anthem—the first official single from Stoicville—is a return to form; with his trademark Auto-Tune vocals and lyrics about the strip club, T-Pain isn’t afraid to venture back into his comfort zone.

Right now, T-Pain is focused on putting the pieces together for the album, slated for 2014. “This is really going to be what’s on my mind and what’s me,” he says. “I’m doing this album like 

[how] Quentin Tarantino makes movies. Everybody always asks Quentin Tarantino, ‘Who you make movies for?’ He don’t make movies for anybody. I make movies for myself and hope to God that there’s somebody out there like me.”

T-Pain isn’t your typical rapper-turned-singer. Throughout the mid-2000s, he gained massive success for guest appearances on hits like Kanye West’s “Good Life,” Jamie Foxx’s “Blame It” and Flo Rida’s “Low.” His solo songs, too, were instant party-starters and catapulted him to the top of the hip-hop food chain. These days, Pain has to fight to reignite his hot streak, mainly because a certain Auto-Tuned crooner/rapper has dominated his lane. Rumors have circulated about his alleged feud with Future, but Pain’s more concerned about how rappers have used the technology he studied and popularized for the mainstream than any hip-hop beef.

“I changed music completely, so it is good to see that, but it’s terrible to see how horrible everybody sounds with it,” Pain admits. “I studied my craft, and I make sure I know how it works. I know where it comes from. I knew how Auto-Tune got invented. I studied the technology of it. Everything. Then I used it. But everybody else is slapping it on their voice and saying they got a smash.”

His frustrations with Auto-Tune are just a small part of the larger picture. Next in Pain’s rise to prominence is a methodical approach to making music, while being mindful of what is truly missing in the game now. Pain hopes to bring more diversity and feel-good records with Stoicville. “I want to get back 

[to] when people were actually moving in the club. You go overseas, they still play every goddamn song from the ’90s,” he says. “We come over here, just shoot a nigga, and kill a nigga. ‘Fuck this. Fuck that. I’m a dope boy.’ Goddamn, dude! Not everybody 

[is] singing this shit.”

T-Pain’s strong opinions about today’s landscape only fuel the fire for his second coming. He lives in the studio, laying down infectious hooks for anyone who requests them. He is returning to rapping again, confirming that there will be multiple rap songs on the album. And he has decided not to drop a mixtape in order to have a full body of work that’ll leave a lasting impact. Everything is going according to plan—even his new career goals.

“I want to make it like everybody else,” he says. “I don’t think I made it yet. Until I get to Jay’s status, until I get to Diddy’s status, I don’t think I made it yet.”

Until then, T-Pain is out here grindin’.
How, may I ask, did you get so you,
you beautiful true-to-you doer?
I've met many today but can honestly say
that I've never met anyone you-er.
I almost forgot about you today. A sizable spill of coffee shot me to my feet, holding up my mocha-soaked notebook like an unclaimed child. A dozen eyes found me at once—a security measure meant to bring shame to a klutz breaking his social contract. Attention for shit living. When the pain receded I stood in place and imagined you brushing your teeth.
Let's fuck in the woods, sweetheart.

Wood to wood, ass to grass,
hands clasped, limbs grasped,
humping parts while nature sways,
licking butts where reindeer graze.

Let's toil, uncoiled in the soil, soiled.
Broiled in baby oil (tree sap's foil).

Let's flirt with the earth,
with rubber to avert birth
and darkness to assert girth,
no shirt or skirt, just squirting in dirt.

Let's fuck in the woods.

[Verse 1]
Thirty blocks to Fordham Road
That’s a bad neighborhood
Crack house on the corner
I know I shouldn’t do what it is I could

[Verse 2]
The stone Mary in the garden
She let me know she watching
And she said I better get walking
I better walk away

[Chorus]
I don’t know why it is that I wanna stay
I don’t know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I’m not gonna do what I hear me say
I’m just gonna walk, I’m gonna walk away

[Verse 3]
I catch a dollar in the wind and I
Buy a cup of coffee
There’s a place on Valentine
That still charge ninety cent
I keep on walking in the daytime
And in my eyes, it’s always nighttime
And I like it when it’s me at night
‘Cause that’s when all the stars come out
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh

[Chorus]
I don't know why it is that I wanna stay
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say, oh
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away

[Bridge]
It's the greatest, it's the greatest day
It's the greatest, it's the greatest day, oh

[Outro]
I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away

[Intro: Madonna]
And the beat goes on, I'm a happy girl
It's my birthday song, in my happy world
I know it's gonna be a good day
Oh yeah, today is my birthday, huh

[Chorus: Madonna, M.I.A.]
And the beat goes on (And the beat goes on)
I'm a happy girl (I'm a happy girl)
It's my birthday song (Oh yeah, it's my birthday)
In my happy world (In my happy world)

[Verse 1: Madonna, M.I.A.]
Light my candles, got to make a wish
Wrap up the present and seal it with a kiss
Give me a spanking, start the day off right (Woo-wee)
Because it's my day, you are going to sing my song tonight

[Chorus: Madonna, M.I.A.]
And the beat goes on (And the beat goes on)
I'm a happy girl (I'm a happy girl)
It's my birthday song (Oh yeah, it's my birthday)
In my happy world (In my happy world)

[Post-Chorus: Madonna, M.I.A.]
I know it's gonna be a good day
Oh yeah, today is my birthday
I'm a happy girl (I'm a happy girl)

[Verse 2: M.I.A.]
My type of party, there's no hangover
So grab your things, you better come over
We get high and we still stay so-ber
We throw it down and then we going to start over
My type of party there's no hangover

[Chorus: Madonna, M.I.A.]
And the beat goes on (And the beat goes on)
I'm a happy girl (I'm a happy girl)
It's my birthday song (Oh yeah, it's my birthday)
In my happy world (In my happy world)

[Verse 3: Madonna, M.I.A.]
I want a diamond, don't give me a fake (That's what I said)
I'll let you lick the frosting off my cake (Yeah)
Give me a spanking, start the day off right (Woo-woo)
Because it's my birthday, you'll be singing my song tonight

[Chorus: Madonna, M.I.A.]
And the beat goes on (Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
I'm a happy girl (Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
It's my birthday song (Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
In my happy world (Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)

[Post-Chorus: Madonna, M.I.A.]
I know it's gonna be a good day, oh yeah, today is my birthday
(I'm a happy girl) In my happy world
I know it's gonna be a good day, oh yeah, today is my birthday
I'm a happy girl
(It's my birthday everyday)

[Outro: Madonna & M.I.A., M.I.A.]
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na (Gonna sing my song tonight)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na (Gonna sing my song tonight)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na (Gonna sing my song tonight)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na (Gonna sing my song tonight)
"Happy birthday!"
Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you,
I love you and I hate you at the very same time

See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now this is an emergency

And she claim she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurtin' me
I'd never do that to you at least purposely

We breakin' up again
We makin' up again
But we don't love no more
I guess we fuckin' then

Have you ever felt you want to kill her
And you mixed them emotions with Tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights you have a bad fight
And you talkin' about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say motherfucker your mama's a bitch
You know, domestic drama and shit
All the attitude
I'll never hit a girl but I'll shake the shit out of you
But Ima be the bigger man
Big pimpin' like Jigga man
Oh I guess I figure it's

Bittersweet,
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and I hate you at the very same time

See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now this is an emergency

And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinkin' it
this relationship even got me back to drinkin' and this Hennessy
Is gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you havin' my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
Coz every time that I try you will question me
Sayin', "You fuckin' them girls, disrespectin' me?
You don't see how your lies is affecting me
You don't see how life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up to what you was supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them hoes'll be."
And this the first time she ever spit her soul to me
I fucked up and I know it G
I guess it's bittersweet poetry

[Intro: Jay Z]
We gotta sell these bitches the dream, my nigga
Niggas like Walt Disney around this bitch

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
You're in the presence of the real
Can't fathom where I'm at, baby, pop another pill
In a whole 'nother realm
If you want to make a movie let me know
It's a whole another film
I suggest you get your dress for the Golden Globes
What you know about Tim
Top down, the Aventador, 4 AM
On the sunset strip
Trying to get high at the sunset, baby don't trip
Hollywood lights, Miami nights
I'm on a motherfucking binge
Just might go and buy a Benz
Or trade a car for your friends
Oh yeah, we playing with them M's

[Hook: Timbaland]
Ridin' down Collins with my entourage following
Just left SoHo headed to the Go-Go
Lap dance for the girls
Let me put her hands on her curves
You ain't about that life, you scurred
Ah, baby, you scurred—like skrrt to the crib
What you know about the kid?
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing

[Verse 2: Drake]
I just got back home, 40 days on vacation
No one killing the game, shit is all for the taking
What the fuck did I stutter? Am I being mistaken?
I'm a s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-star in the makin'
Who you said was the man? What the fuck is a deal?
Really do it the best, I'm DJ Khaled for real
Got my thumb on the pulse, got impeccable timin'
If they forgot about my worth, I got a check to remind 'em
Got some things on the wrist, Cartier with the diamonds
If this was 10 years ago nigga would've went diamond
I been singing and rapping, I make a killin' in both
If I had to choose a Jackson man, I'm feelin' like Bo
Fresh down to the socks, team look like the Raiders
I don't take this shit for granted, I'd like to thank my creator
I'm coming b-b-b-b-b-b-b-back on you haters
I'm 'bout to put this bitch on her back and get back to you later
Man, what's up?

[Hook: Timbaland]
Ridin' down Collins with my entourage following
Just left SoHo headed to the Go-Go
Lap dance for the girls
Let her put her hands on the curves
You ain't about that life, you scurred
Ah, baby, you scurred—like skrrt to the crib
What you know about the kid
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Imagine straight from work to the plane
Ain't no baggage claim
Don't need to change your clothes, girl, or your last name
Motherfuckers want to act like I'mma call
If you want to be a star, girl you need a co-star
Got some bitches we can call up, babe
Now they want to know who you are and how you got there
Girl, I can try to care, oh, get you out of here
You and all this gold on me
On a plane going home, not as you want
What you motherfuckers know about me?

[Verse 1]
I can dim the lights and sing
You songs full of sad things
We can do the tango, just for two
I can serenade and gently play
On your heart strings
Be a Valentino, just for you

[Chorus]
"Ooh love, ooh lover boy
What're you doing tonight? Hey boy"
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good
Old-fashioned lover boy

[Verse 2]
Ooh, let me feel
Your heartbeat (Grow faster, faster)
Ooh, can you feel my love heat? (Ohh)
Come on and sit on my hot seat of love
And tell me how do you feel right after all
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish
Is my command

[Chorus]
“Ooh love, ooh lover boy
What're you doing tonight? Hey boy”
Write my letter, feel much better
I'll use my fancy patter on the telephone

[Bridge]
When I'm not with you
Think of you always
I miss you
(I miss those long hot summer nights)
When I'm not with you
Think of me always
Love you, love you
Hey boy where do you get it from?
Hey boy where did you go?
I learned my passion
In the good old-fashioned
School of lover boys

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine o'clock) precisely
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style
In my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours
That will be fine (Come on and get it)

[Chorus]
Ooh love (There he goes again)
Ooh lover boy (Who's my good)
(Old-fashioned lover boy? Ooh ooh)
What're you doing tonight? Hey boy!
Everything's all right, just hold on tight
That's because I'm a good old
Fashioned (Fashioned) lover boy

[Verse 1]
When the world starts to get you down
And nothing seems to go your way
And the noise of the maddening crowd
Makes you feel like you're going to go insane
There's a glow of a distant light
Calling you to come outside
To feel the wind on your face and your skin
And it's here I begin my story

[Chorus]
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

[Verse 2]
It was time that I opened my eyes
I'm leaving the past behind
Nothing's ever what it seems
Including this time and these crazy dreams
I'm stuck like a moth to a flame
I'm so tired of playing this game
I don't know how I got to this state
Let me out of my cage cause I'm dying

[Chorus]
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

[Bridge]
I just wanna get in my car
I wanna go fast and I gotta go far
Don't ask me to explain how I feel
'Cause I don't wanna say where I'm going
Turn down the noise and turn up the volume
Don't have a choice 'cause the temperature's pounding
If leaving this place is the last thing I do
Then I want to escape with a person just like you
Buzzing around like a moth to a flame
I'm so sick and tired of playing this game
We gotta have fun if it's all that we do
Gotta shake up the system and break all the rules
Gotta turn up the radio until the speakers blow

[Chorus]
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

[Outro]
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
There's something you don't need to know
Just let me turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Just let me turn up the radio
Just let me turn up the radio

[Verse 1]
For you, there'll be no more crying
For you, the sun will be shining
And I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright, I know it's right

[Verse 2]
To you, I'll give the world
To you, I'll never be cold
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright, I know it's right

[Chorus]
And the songbirds are singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before

[Bridge]
And I wish you all the love in the world
But most of all, I wish it from myself

[Chorus]
And the songbirds keep singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before

[Outro]
Like never before
Like never before

[Chorus]
I fucked up, I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take it back, but I can't

[Verse 1]
I'm so ashamed
You're in so much pain
I blamed you when things didn't go my way
If I didn't, you'd be here
If I didn't fight back, I'd have no fear
If I took another path, things would be so different
But they're not

[Pre-Chorus]
I coulda just kept my big mouth closed
I coulda just done what I was told
Maybe I should've turned silver into gold
But in front of you I was cold

[Chorus]
I fucked up, I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take it back, but I can't

[Verse 2]
I thought we had it all
You brought out the best in me
And somehow I destroyed the perfect dream
I thought we were indestructible
I never imagined we could fall
You wanna know how to make God laugh?
Tell Him your plans

[Bridge]
We coulda bought a house with a swimming pool
Filled it up with Warhols, it would be so cool
Coulda gone riding stallions in the countryside
With a pack of Great Danes, racing eye to eye
We coulda toured the world in a private jet
Gotten naked on the beach, all soaking wet
We coulda climbed the mountains, seen the perfect sunrise
Written our names across the sky
We coulda gotten drunk and driven on the Autobahn
We coulda got ourselves arrested in St. Germain
We coulda lived life crazy 'til the day we died
Instead I made you cry

[Chorus]
I fucked up, I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, je suis désolée
I wish I could take it back, but I can't

[Outro]
I fucked up, I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, I'm not ashamed to say
I wish I could have you back, maybe one day
Or not

[Verse 1]
Like the sun, like the light, like a plane
Like the storm, I'm born through everything
Like a bomb in the night, like a train
Thundering through the hills, let it rain

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah, ooo-woo, ah, ooo-woo)
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
(Ah, ooo-woo, ah, ooo-woo)
I'm a sinner, I like it that way

[Chorus]
All the boys, all the boys and girls
Wanna be like us tonight
All the boys, all the boys and girls
Ride the magic bus tonight

[Refrain]
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way

[Verse 2]
Like the moon with no light of my own
Surfs the sky for a place to call home
I woke up with my head in the fire
Get my kicks when I'm walking the wire

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah, ooo-woo, ah, ooo-woo)
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
(Ah, ooo-woo, ah, ooo-woo)
I'm a sinner, I like it that way

[Chorus]
All the boys, all the boys and girls
Wanna be like us tonight
All the boys, all the boys and girls
Ride the magic bus tonight

[Refrain]
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
Praise the Lord and I like it that way

[Bridge]
Hail Mary, full of grace
Get down on your knees and pray
Jesus Christ, hanging on the cross
Died for our sins, it's such a loss
Saint Christopher, find my way
I'll be coming home one day
Saint Sebastian, don't you cry
Let those poison arrows fly
Saint Anthony, lost and found
Thomas Aquinas, stand your ground
All those saints and holy men
Catch me before I sin again

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah, ooo-woo, ah, ooo-woo)
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
(Ah, ooo-woo, ah, ooo-woo)
I'm a sinner, I like it that way

[Refrain]
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner, I like it that way

[Outro]
You're a sinner, you're a sinner
You're a sinner, you like it that way
We're all sinners, we're all sinners, we're all sinners
I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner
I'm a sinner
And I like it that way
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with me
Hail Mary, full of grace, your love is with me
Full of grace

[Verse 1]
Dark eyes on a dangerous face, you are a beautiful killer
We pass by the same old place, you are a beautiful killer
You don't have a life, you have blood on your hands
You can sleep at night and I don't understand
I don't know much about you are a wanted man

[Chorus]
You can call my name and I'll be around
Maybe I'll let you shoot me down
'Cause you're a beautiful killer, with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer, and you won't leave a trace

[Verse 2]
Do you know the reasons why you are a beautiful killer?
Hurt yourself but you never die, you are a beautiful killer
I like your silhouette when you stand on the street
Like a samurai, you can handle the heat
Makes me wanna pray for a haunted man

[Chorus]
You can call my name and I'll be around
Maybe I'll let you shoot me down
Cause you're a beautiful killer, with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer, and you won't leave a trace

[Post-Chorus]
Can't really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe that's what you've been dreaming about
Cause you're a beautiful killer, with beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer, and I love your disguise

[Bridge]
(Beautiful killer)
You've changed the past
Good guys always finish last
(Beautiful killer)
What happens now?
I need to know how the story goes
Are we together?
I love you forever

[Chorus]
You can call my name and I'll be around
Maybe I'll let you shoot me down
You can call my name and I'll be around
Maybe I'll let you shoot me down
Cause you're a beautiful killer, with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer, and you won't leave a trace

[Post-Chorus]
Can't really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe that's what you've been dreaming about
Cause you're a beautiful killer, with beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer, and I love your disguise

[Outro]
You're a beautiful killer
But you'll never be Alain Delon

[Verse 1]
Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

[Verse 2]
She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer, your life knows no answer

[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

[Refrain]
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

[Verse 3]
She rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

[Refrain]
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

Taken by, taken by the sky
Taken by, taken by the sky
Taken by, taken by the sky
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind

I remember when I met you, baby
You were on your way to be wed
You were such a sexy thing
I loved the way you walked, the things you said
And I was so nonchalant
I didn't want you to be misled
But I've got to have you, baby
I got to have you in my bed
You said:
"But I'm just a virgin, and I'm
On my way to be wed
But you're such a hunk
So full of spunk"

[Chorus: Prince]
I'll give you head 'til you're burning up
Head 'til you get enough
Head 'til your love is red
Head, love you 'til you're dead

You know you're good, girl

You married me instead

People, they come for
Want a piece of what I got
Got the key in my coat
Got a secret, you want more?
Pick a home, pick a door, pick a lock
Pick a club, pick a fold, pick a show
Pick a hair, pick a coat, pick a car
Pick a fuck

[Bridge]
Watch me go in, watch me go in
Watch me go in, watch me go in

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
They all know how I go
When they see me, they want more
What you see is what you get though
We're hitting that smoke from the hydro
What you see is what you get though
How we do it is same as the next bro
In a war where we put up where we get though
How we do it is the same as the next bro
Pick a home, pick a lock, pick a door
Pick a club, pick a flow, pick a show
Pick a hood, pick a curb, pick a car

[Bridge]

[Hook] x2

I got the key, I got the secret
I got the key, I got the secret
I got the secret, I got the secret
Secret, secret, secret, yea se-se-se-se

[Bridge]

[Hook] x2

[Intro]
You know I know y'all American niggas got all your high cities and states that you rep, my nigga
But I got a whole country on my motherfuckin' back, my G
Canada all the way to the death
TO let's go my nigga what

[Verse 1]
I'm stunnin', got a bitch cummin'
I'm stunnin', got a bitch cummin'
I'm stunnin', got a bitch cummin'
Whip doors peel like a motherfuckin' onion
Know a nigga higher than the whole Grand Canyon
Break a tree down like my name Paul Bunyon
Rude broad with me gotta try new things
Lil nigga fly like I tried two wings
Playground pussy, try to ride new springs
And I made her sit on it like my new swing
Do that, bitch nigga, you that
I be gettin' brain, you be tryna pursue that
That my old book and you be tryna renew that
Fuck nigga who that? Know it ain't me though
Lookin' for a husband, you know it ain't me hoe
Tryna get the green but no it ain't Cee-Lo
Stuntin' is a habit
Diamond carrot like a rabbit
Niggas and these bitches ratchet
Got your bitch inside my basket
Man I'm a fuckin' G, a motherfuckin' G
You can be the one I'm fuckin' but you still can fuck with me
My life A plus and my chicks a double D
And I'm reppin' SLS 'til the death, nigga we be
Stuntin' in the mall
Tints on the back from the front, a nigga bald
Bitch on my back, I'm a beast I'm a dawg, fuckin' warthog
This a feast, this a ball, let a nigga ride
This that east side, west end shit niggas crave on
Let a nigga guap raise on 'til the day gone
Niggas at the top better have they game face on
I be at the hot spot, swave with the lace on
Let a nigga be though
Everythin' big from the dick to the ego
Hatin' niggas tryna send shots, reload
Homie, you can have her, I don't touch stee hoes

[Verse 2]
Skeet skeet skeet
Niggas cheat cheat cheat
And I'm movin' these hoes like beep
Money so long, man, this a nice streak
Waiter in a thong, tell her bring the iced tea
Talk on the road is that's your wifey
Talk on the road is that she like me
Knickers got that Cocoa like they Ice-T
How you fuckin' niggas tryna be they wifey? Huh
Bust that pussy open like a bad one
Send them hoes home when the cab come
Tell them sleepin' niggas take a nap, son
Y'all ain't shootin' to kill, half done
Baby, say I'm better than the average
Claimin' she'll be better than my last bitch
I told her you can't be my fuckin' lady
'Cause right now I'm fuckin' swavey

[Outro]
I'm fuckin' swavey, nigga, you dig it?
I'm so swavey that your bitch wanna date me
And I'm lookin' like a lazy motherfucker on my couch
Bitches like ouch, come and let a nigga eat nigga cheese like a mouse
Bitches on my dick and I'm all in they house
All in your fridge 'cause I need a sandwich
Back to the neverland ranch
Back again with a tuna sandwich
And I ain't talkin' money like who the man is
That's it, nigga
That was my lil freestyle like the end of the motherfuckin' song, nigga
Just so you niggas know I'm on that Ignant Shit
Shout out Sunny Diamonds man
Sincerely Tory, March 26th, nigga
You better hide in a motherfuckin' hole nigga when that shit come out, nigga
'Cause it's gon' be catastrophic
SLS 'til the death with your bitch ass

[Verse 1]
Won't somebody let me out?
Don't want to stick around no more
I'm sick of lookin' at you strange
I'm sick of stickin' to the floor

[Chorus]
Not one of you has got an ounce of style in ya
Said, not one of you, no

[Verse 2]
Well, fuck it all and break your nose
If they keep on pushin' you around
If they keep on steppin' on your toes
And pick you up when you fall down

[Chorus]
Not one of you has got an ounce of style in ya
Said, not one of you, no

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Not one of you has got an ounce of style in ya, no
Said, not one of you, no
What I wanna do, let me see right here, yo

Not many people that I label
Would be able to display table
Manners but my plan this
To make this beat rock like scanners
And make the fans just go bananas
Yo, get our Planters
That means our nuts for the sluts who don't understand this
Yo, my clan is
Yeah right, and y'all gon' stand there
And act like you don't understand it
Like my name is Janet, my titty fell out and I ain't plan it
Check, check this out
And if you're rockin' with your necklace out
That's my breakfast now
I'mma snatch it, yo my style is rechid, you can't fetch it
No you can't stretch it
And yo, it doesn't really matter
Cause your name I can't even pronunciate
You're the sa-same type-a mo'fucker
To go and suckerpunch Dre at the Vibe Awards
But he right behind the boards the next day
So, kiss an ass
Or kiss a dick, lick a dick
Eat my ass
Whatever you wan' do, it's on you
Big Proof comin' through..

[Maurice Grant]
The Shelter
Let me get up in this nigga like smashin'
With a red beam Johny blastin'
Evil is the rhyme assassin
Get a guy runnin', like haulin' ass
Bury you pink rabbits for askin'
Closed caption nigga don't say a word
When these flames get to burnin' up
Burnin' you down
Leavin' you ground tore up
From the pressure
Wanna frown
Don't want the nigga known pullin' triggers
Hoist this fool on my neck back-break this nigga

[B-Rabbit]
Yo
Check it out
Look, look
Yo, I gotta flow
I'm from the Mo, you ain't Detroit, hoe
Talkin' about seven mile, change your style
I read your bio, you're really from Ohio
I'm vile
This guy's so fuckin' fat I can't even see his eyes when he smiles
Yo, listen to this
Motherfuckin' rhyme, yo chicken, we can do this
As a matter of fact have another beer
I'll be right back, dawg, I'ma set the mic right here

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Cheeya cheeya
I paid, paid a lot of money for that
I'm fucking around man, shout out real Mike B
Chicken talk one time for them, let me think, let me think, okay, okay

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I paid twenty thousand dollars for this beat just to bang in the club(huh)
Five thousand dollar for a chopper, man, I'm gonna shoot someone up (hah)
BURR

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My Wonder Woman bracelet match my He-Man watch
My Batman car made Catgirl stop
This Spider-Man kush is sticky as a spider web
And it's so loud that you can smell it in Fort Lauderdale
Three X-Men fell victim to my 40-cal
Little Smurfs trying to act like they were Gargamel
I'm Gat Man, Gucci know I keep a joker gun
The AK, nigga, loaded, shorty, REDRUM
It's a bird, it's a plane, no, that's Superman
Girlfriend, please, no, that's just Gucci Mane
My swag change like I'm rapping with another brain
I go hard, SpongeBob, nigga, you a lame
Like Garfield, homie, Odie, nigga, I'm a dog
And what you call that? Man, I call it "chicken talk"
Like Bugs Bunny, big money, got a lot of cash
I shotgun like Elmer Fudd to kill these dirty wabbits

[Bridge: Gucci Mane]
Hah...Chicken Talk 2, nigga
It's Gucci, nigga
Feels like I'm in down-south 50 nigga
I feel like I'm east-side Busta Rhymes right now
Two chains on, three bracelets, nigga
In my two-seater, nigga
Copped it off the showroom floor, nigga
What's up, Marquis Daniels I see you, nigga
Ball player money like I play for the Pacers with you, nigga
What's happenin'?
R.I.P. Pimp C, UGK, bitch!

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I smoke purple weed, purple, that's a barney, dog
That crack rock done turn your mama to an Olive Oyl
That cat with the pack mixed with an Isotol
The Grinch stole Christmas, Gucci just stole 80 pounds
If I could change a cartoon, I would change once
I made Jerry chase Tom with a handgun
Fifty-five tweety bird’s in my white truck
I'm still pissed cause my cousin stole my last blunt
I still got it like that nigga with that weak kush
Short temper, throwing fists like I'm Heathcliff
Selling babies in the six, call them Little Bills
Twelve-fifty for a baby, that's a good deal
A Transformer Benz sittin on some sick wheels
Bright yellow rims, same color my Bart Sim
I say “Go-Go Gadget!” then a car brakes
Go stand there pussy nigga, step up to scar face

[Skit: Bigga Rankin]
Ayo, Gucci Mane...listen
I've got bad news, and I've got some good news
The good news is...your album sales just tripled
You got shows goin' overseas
Shit'll be poppin', nigga
The bad news is...your best friend's snitching on you
What are you gonna do 'bout that, my nigga?

[Skit: Gucci Mane]
Shit, everybody's snitching on me, nigga
I don't even keep no phone, nigga
My hoes can’t even keep up with me
It's Gucci, nigga

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
See I'm a junkyard dog, not a Scooby Doo
I got that white girl, true, I'm talking Betty Boop
A hundred gallons of that yellow talking that Winnie da pooh
So if i pull this hummer over I'mma make the news
The way I'm spittin' on the mic it's like I'm Daffy Duck
And I ain't Richie Rich, bitch, but I'm rich as fuck
Got Shawty Redd on the track, that's a lot of change
Then, man, this beat's gonna bang for a hundred days
Strip club, dance club, every DJ
Gucci Mane and Shawty Redd fucking let it play
Throw some money in the air, we gon' make it rain
Rotten niggas get sprayed trying to make a name
I stack it long, King Kong, then I took his chain
But I gave it back cuh, cause our diamonds weren’t the same
See you can keep it, man, I'm gonna step it up a tad
It's Gucci Mane and this song is Nickelodeon

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
Shawty Lo, I know you ain't gonna let these niggas steal your sound
Broke ass niggas swag steal
Twenty-thousand in the city now
My nigga hate to pay to see ya
I was screamin "five more minutes" and now its five more...

[Verse 1]
She puts on her best dress her closet can provide her
It ain't much but she makes it work
And he puts on the best cologne
His paycheck can provide him
It ain't much but it'll take the work
And they talked about nothing for a while
Lip stick on a Corona
He decides he loves her right there
But she can't understand, no

[Hook]
And it was almost beautiful
And it was almost beautiful

[Verse 2]
She takes off her best dress
He helps her with the back zip
But he seems a little bit too good at it
She rethinks the whole thing, puts back on her jacket
Left em, she was never to good at it
He wonders if he said something wrong
He was never a smooth talker
And he decided he hates her right there
So he rolls up a joint

[Hook]
And it was almost beautiful
And it was almost beautiful

[Bridge]
We're all searching for some place to disappear (to disappear)
We're all searching for some place to disappear (to disappear)

[Hook]
And it was almost beautiful
And it was almost beautiful
And it was almost beautiful
And it was almost beautiful

[Outro]
Fucking bird chirping this whole song
Shut up!

So after walking through here I decided that I wanted to make sure for anyone that didn’t have tickets tonight that you all could have tickets to the show. So anybody who wants to come tonight, you can have tickets for the entire office!

But I just wanted to tell you guys: I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to actually be “architected.” And this is the reason why even some of the first DONDA employees were architects that started designing t-shirts instead of buildings. But just to see the work actually be actualized.

If I sit down and talk to Oprah for 2 hours, the conversation is about realization, self realization, and actually seeing your creativity happen in front of you. So the reason why I turn up so much in interviews  is because I’ve tasted what it means to create and be able to impact, and affect in a positive way.

And I know that there’s more creativity to happen. And I know that there’s traditionalists that hold back the good thoughts and there’s people in offices that stop the creative people, and (who) are intimidated by actual good ideas.

I believe that utopia is actually possible—but we’re led by the least noble, the least dignified, the least tasteful, the dumbest, and the most political. So in no way am I a politician—I’m usually at my best politically incorrect and very direct. I really appreciate you guys’ willingness to learn and hone your craft, and not be lazy about creation.

I’m very inspired to be in this space. Tonight, this show, if you come see it—um, I’m a bit self conscious because I’m showing it to architects. So the stage does have flaws in it. It’s an expression of emotion so give me a pass on that. And that’s basically all I have to say so thank you very much.

At a Clippers game on the courtside (Side)
Watch a nigga shoot like a four-five (Five)
They mad at me too, I got more fire
Why these bitches see you? "Go home, Roger"
(Go home, Roger)
Tia and Tamera in my bed, I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid (Nah)
Hits on my list, check my archive
I'm something so immaculate, instead of asking what's happening
Rather blast a Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura
Acting blacker than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys, and Akon
The girls that you brought, man, where are they from?
Where are they from? We were playing PlayStation
Why you standing there? Say some'
Girl, say some', no, this ain't a vacation
This is my house, my house, all she needed was some

Bought a new bath, 8K, nigga
Wanna take shots? AK, nigga
When I ball, I'ma ball, King James, nigga
Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, nigga
And I'm out of this world like Tang, nigga
That's a space bar (Yeah), man, I hate y'all
You only come around when you wanna play pool or my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage
I had a ménage, I murdered the vag'
But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck
'Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up
I-I-I-I, I need a minute, cold water to the face
I-I, I couldn't finish, got the Uber from her place
On my porch smoking vapor, hit with the Sunday paper
Listening to the neighbors

[Chorus: Nina Simone]
Birds flying high
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Yeah, I'm a new man, baby
Your other men probably should follow my blueprint, baby
Strap on your seat, and get ready to go
You know I've been filling BeatPort
3 million feed up in the sky full diamonds
I'm only beginning and I get the feeling
I'm behind the beat for the nighters
I got a few Miami Viaces
I don't ever look at the prices
My super bowl tickets are priced less
You know who the king of the night is
Beautiful music for you to go lower
And when girl go work, this for life
I think I'm bipolar

[Chorus: Nina Simone]
Birds flying high
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
What a feeling I get when I throw up my pistols
From party, and bigger than life
50 bottles of Luminis
24 kick, pop my dollars, wake up for the night
Cameras flickin', I see me
You're fixing, I'm fixin' my color
My natural height
She can get it, my whole click wit it
No question, we are on the champion flight
This is how I ride, my passenger fly
We take off in London, end up in Dubai
This is a marriage, the music my ride
My life is so lavish, you don't recognize
So let's toast to a new day approachin'
80 million, they still rollercoasting
What's the recipe to this devotion?
I got the melody, sober like couches

[Bridge: Flo Rida & (Nina Simone)]
(Oh-eh-oh) Who told y'all the party's over?
(Oh-eh-oh) Well, it ain't over til I told y'all
I feel my cup runnin' over
Tomorrow I  might be sober
But oh, tonight, I'm like...

[Chorus / Outro: Audra Mae & (Nina Simone)]
Birds flying high (Ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)
Sun in the sky
It's a new day
And you know how I feel

[Verse 1]
Well, I heard some people talkin' just the other day
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf
But let me tell you I got some news for you
And you'll soon find out it's true
And then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm already gone
And I'm feelin' strong
I will sing this vict'ry song

[Post-Chorus]
Woo hoo hoo, my my
Woo hoo hoo

[Verse 2]
The letter that you wrote me
Made me stop and wonder why
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right
Just remember this, my girl, when you look up in the sky
You can see the stars and still not see the light
(That's right)

[Chorus]
And I'm already gone
And I'm feelin' strong
I will sing this vict'ry song

[Post-Chorus]
Woo hoo hoo, my my
Woo hoo hoo

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Well, I know it wasn't you who held me down
Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free
So oftentimes it happens that we live our lives in chains
And we never even know we have the key

[Chorus]
But me, I'm already gone
And I'm feelin' strong
I will sing (I will sing) this vict'ry song
'Cause I'm already gone
Yes, I'm already gone
And I'm feelin' strong
I will sing this vict'ry song
'Cause I'm already gone

[Outro]
Yes, I'm already gone
Already gone
All right, nighty-night
Already gone
Already gone
Already gone
“I’m not gonna mention him no more, I’m past that,” Yeezus said of the president on Philadelphia station Hot 107.9. “That’s out my thoughts. That’s lowering my priority of thinking at this point.”

“Oh, you talking about how he use to come and visit me and my mama and tell me he’s about to run for president?” Ye' replied when asked if he would ever "break bread" with the president and continued, “I just think that we’re pop icons, and the president likes to use that type of thing just to be down. People was fine with me being everyone’s punching bag for about five years — ‘This is the person we love to hate, so if you want to distract people from everything that’s going on … just say you hate Kanye and there’s going be 30 other people who say they hate Kanye.’ That was kind of my position in culture and he kind of used that too — ‘Oh, he’s a jackass’ — because that’s how the world felt."

“I don’t care if someone’s the president or not,” Kanye finished. “I care about thoughts and how you helping people and what you bring to the world.”
Its Been A Week Since The Carnival, Which I Have Now Realized Was The Greatest Day Of My Life. Seeing Everyone I Care About There Was Crazy. No, Thats Not Even The Part That Got Me Excited. Seeing What Some Stupid Little ideas Can Turn Into Is What Shocks Me. The Little Stupid Cats And Graphics I Made On Photo Shop Out Of Boredom On Flags And Murals; Seeing That Donut I Drew When I Was 15 On Stages And Everyones Bag; 10 Thousand People Came To A Place Called ‘Camp Flog Gnaw’, Wow

I Remember When I Came Up With That Name Summer 2011. I Never Been To Camp And In My Head, I Created A Place That I Figured Would Never Exist, But That Changed. Just Fliping The First Letters Of Wolf Gang Turned Into Its Own Separate Thing. Seeing All Different Races From Skinny To Fat To Everything All In One Place With Something In Common Was Mind Blowing. The Zipper Is My Favorite Ride In The World. Not That You Care, But That Fact That I Figured Out How To Get That Thing And Ride It For As Many Times As I Want Without Waiting In Line IS Fucking Amazing

I Have An Amazing Team With Me. No Matter How Crazy And Offensive Or Weird My Ideas Were, They Put Their Trust In Me And Allowed Me To Move Forward.Like Dude, We Threw A Fucking Carnival In The Middle Of Los Angeles With 10k Plus People. We Didn't Have Any Crazy Sponsors And I Didn't Have To Suck Up to Anyone Or Any Of That Shit, WE Did It. And The Skatepark? Did You See That Skatepark? I Was Up Till 2 Am Painting That Bitch! Growing Up In Hawthorne At The Dirty ( skatepark) And Seeing My Old Friends From There Getting Clips Was Prolly The Craziest Shit Ive Seen. How Far Ive Came With Every Little Idea that I Believed In No Matter Who Did Or Didn't. Walking Around Seeing Kids In EXACT Things That I Wear Is Mind Blowing. Something That I Just Naturally Like And Put On, Its Some Kid Out There That Studies Every Article Of Clothing That Was Put On And Emulates That. Thats Crazy To Me. I Used To Do That With P, So Know That Someone IS Looking At Me The Way I Look At Him Is Really Amazing To Me

I Didn't Think I Would Change So Many Lives. Someone Retweeted An Old Tweet Of Mine From Feb 2012 Yesterday And It Read ’ I Had A Dream That Kanye Invited Me To Perform LATE With Him. I Wish’. Kanye Came To The Carnival And I Performed Late With Him. My Favorite Song By Kanye, AN Album Cut He NEVER Does, Was Performed Not Only With But During My Set And My Carnival! No Matter if You Hate Me Think Im Stupid Untalented Annoying Or Whatever, I FUCKING WIN AND YOU CAN SUCK MY WHOLE SHIT. We Did This, OF Did This, Coming From Actually Jack Shit And Turned That Jack Shit In Something. I’m Just Blabbing Now. I Just Want Who Ever Reading This To Know That Anything Is Possible, No Matter How Crazy It May Seem, Anything IS Possible You Just Have To Figure It Out. Get Your Self Esteem Up And Like Yourself, Then Like Your Ideas. We Live In A World Where People Dont Even Like Their Own Ideas, That Why You Have People Copying One Thing Thats Working So Much, Then Everything Gets Over Saturated With The Same Shit, And That Goes With Fashion, Music And All That. If People Actually Loved Themselves And Believed In Themselves More You Know How Many More Crazy Things Would Be Created? There Is No Fucking Limit To Anything! ( Except Elevators)

Its A World Of People Who Dont Give A Fuck About The Mall Or The Radio Or None Of That Shit, Who Dont Care About Race Or If Someone Is Gay Or What Not. Thats What I Was Trying To Say On That Arsenio Interview. I Prolly Came Of As An Idiot Tho. Im Really Passionate About Everything I Do. From Music To Clothing To Videos. I Love Make Videos So Much. I Just Want Some Millionaire To Throw Me Money To Be Creative And Get Shots. I Remember Kids In School Always Thought I Was Weird, Not Just Cause How I Dressed Or The Music I Liked Or That Fact I Was Just Different Overall( in comparison to them), But Because I Was So Open With Future Goals. I Would Always Say The Grammies Im Gonna Get, And The Number 1 Movie Im Going To Write And Direct, And Just Random Shit Im Gonna Do. Now Those Same Dude Who Shut Me Down Are Paying Shitty College Debt Doing Something They Hate, Because They Didn't Go Full Throttle On Their Own Dreams And Quickly Shitted On Mines. And Im Not Knocking Anyone In College, Please Get Your Education, Im Just Saying, Do What You Love And Be Happy, Dont Live For Anyone Else. I Dont Like The Color Black. I Dont Know What That Has To Do With Anything But I Like Colors, Bright Colors, Like Flowers. It Brings A Great Energy

Ok Im Just Talking Again. Its Prolly A lot Of Typos In This But Im Just Going Off Of What Ever Is Coming To My Head. This Photo Of Na-Kel Smith Skating In Front Of The GOLF Mural At The Skatepark Means So Much To Me. The World Is Yours Little Nigga, And I Mean That. They Are Them, We Are Us, Fuck Them All! OFWGKTA
{Intro}

[Verse 1]
I'm scared to say I love you
Afraid to let you know
That the simplest of words won't come out of my mouth
Though I'm dying to let them go
Trying to let you know

[Verse 2]
I have to say I'm sorry
Don't feel sad for me
But the beautiful birds won't fly out of their cage
Though I'm trying to set them free
Trying to let you see, how much you mean to me

[Bridge]
I remember the first time we met
Tears in our eyes reflecting
Something connecting from so long ago
It might have been told in the stars maybe that's what it was
It doesn't matter because

[Verse 3]
I'm still too scared to tell you
Afraid to let you see
That the simplest of words won't come out of my mouth
Though I'm dying to set them free
Trying to let you see, how much it means to me
How much you mean to me
How much you mean to me now

[Verse 1]
I've got a great idea
Losing my sense of where
Trading the silent ones
I'm sure you know it's wrong
Take it and keep it shut
Unholy triptych of
My sweet un-careful friends
Waiting for April's men

[Verse 2]
Not like the other girls
Go home and wait for me
I'll be there after five
The others got that V
I'm everything you need
Put all you need in me
I don't need anything
I don't need anything
I don't need anything

[Bridge]
Does this feel easy 'cause it's all you get from me
Do you have reason to think I'm just what you need
I won't complain if you don't tell me what you see
Does this feel easy 'cause it's all you get from me

[Verse 1: Dave Longstreth]
You won't hear my name I can't watch you throw it all away (away)
You are playing games, I'm done trying to help you run down, escape (escape)

[Chorus: Dave Longstreth]
But you look away, and I look to you
That's where we are, and what we saw was you
On your own, and I'm on my own
And we were wrong, there's no right thing

[Verse 2: Blood Orange]
I've been you've been my everything
And i've seen your worst baby
This is what it comes to
Knowing we're broken

I've been changing my whole scene
You need somebody different
This is where we got to
Knowing that you're the wrong thing

[Chorus: Dave Longstreth]
But you look away, and I look to you
That's where we are, and what we saw was you
On your own, and I'm on my own
And we were wrong, there's no right thing

[Bridge: Samantha Urbani]
But you can't see me, when you're pushing me away
You can't see me, when you're pushing me away
I'm the one who sees you, I'm the one who needs you
You can't see me, when you're pushing me away
You can't see me, when you're pushing me away
I'm the one who sees you, I'm the one who needs you

[Chorus: Dave Longstreth]
But you look away, and I look to you
That's where we are, and what we saw was you
On your own, and I'm on my own
And we were wrong, there's no right thing

[Verse 1: Blood Orange]
I've kept it open
And wanted nobody to be my friend
I've wasted moments in the Bowery light
And lost it all
So, are you smoking?
Don't tell me, baby, you can't work this out
I've wasted moments in the Soho nights
And lost it all

[Chorus: Samantha Urbani]
Time will tell if you can figure this and work it out
No one's waiting for you anyway so don't be stressed now
Even if it's something that you've had your eye on
It is what it is

[Verse 2: Blood Orange]
On your own worries
I'm nothing even when I'm with my friends
But you make me think that I'm alive
When I'm alone

[Chorus: Samantha Urbani]
Time will tell if you can figure this and work it out
No one's waiting for you anyway so don't be stressed now
Even if it's something that you've had your eye on
It is what it is (And it keeps on running back)
Time will tell if you can figure this and work it out
No one's waiting for you anyway so don't be stressed now
Even if it's something that you've had your eye on
It is what it is

[Bridge: Blood Orange]
Why wasn't it real?
Why wasn't it real?

[Verse 3: Blood Orange]
Talk me through the stages before I go home
Why wasn't it real?
Roxy got me twitching and I'm home alone
Taking it for granted that you're here with me
Just tell me the truth
Am I just a lonely fabled obsessive?
That ain't got no clue
I just got started yeah my nigga feeling fuck who want i have 100k to look at me swag boy loking for ijust gtaot srted dont mess with me cause i know you gay ifuck who

[Spoken]
It was the last weekend of September
I stayed up all night long
Waiting for the fire ache in my heart to subside
It never happened
He was the most beautiful boy I'd ever seen
Most beautiful boy I'd ever met
My favorite books
Around the clock scars of my knee
I see him behind my lids in a bright grey shirt
I see him tripping running and falling, covered in dirt
I see a lot of these things lately I know
I know none of it is real

[Verse 1: Blood Orange]
It's in the way that he moves but I don't want to choose

[Verse 2: Blood Orange & Samantha Urbani]
Another day and I'll lose, but i don't want to choose

[Chorus: Blood Orange & Samantha Urbani]
Face to the ground, change the sound
Time in your mind, make it right

[Verse 1: Blood Orange]
It's in the way that he moves but I don't want to choose

[Verse 2: Blood Orange & Samantha Urbani]
Another day and I'll lose, but i don't want to choose

[In background]
Baby, let me take you home

[Hook: Dev Hynes]
I've been doing all the things you don't want me to do
Lay me down, sit right next to me, baby
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you, baby

[Verse 1: Despot]
Devil barely in a dress, painting the town red
I'm watching it dry while I wait to take her to bed
I'm bored out my mind at my table paying her rent
By the time I take care of the check she be moist as a towelette

She told me she only got eyes for me
I know she ain't blind though
Who she see when she got lonely

Which one of them reached in her thighs
Birds and the bees in the hive
Trying to creep in disguise, show me

Im only one of her one and onlys
Grass on the other side is so green
And sorry won't cut it so try a knife or dont be
While time goes slowly
On the rose gold roley

Fine prized ponies
All racing for dollar bills
Get your bitch a collar, chill
Chances are she probably will

Once she got all oochie wally off a molly pill
Woke up in a bonneville
Missed that new bugatti feel

Roof goner than the tooth on a toddler
And the sun shining through
As if it knew im his father

New mantras if the goose out the bottle
I dont need no excuses for the smooch on the collar

And i dont know
If this the edge of my seat or it's the end of my rope
So whats it gonna be?
Either love or leave it alone

Asking me how i sleep at night
When you know that i dont
Trying to keep from dreaming about seein you on your own
Being who you being and leavin me here at home
Hear the streets are speakin
I got the block in a choke
I ain't feelin the city breathing
Im squeezing down on its throat

Used to be a dime
Now she's on the house
You made your bed now lie in it
Or sleep on the couch

It ain't you its me
Its ok boo, i quit
It takes two to tango
It takes one to dip

[Hook: Dev Hynes]
You never seem to tell me
What you want to be
But every time your eyes look
Dooown..

[Chorus: Blood Orange & Samantha Urbani]
I can only disappoint you, cause I always let you down
I can only disappoint you, always

[Verse 1: Samantha Urbani]
I traveled from Dublin
You said you'd change the world
You sing like Sinatra, always
You pulled them for miles now, like Garbo in Berlin
You played them for zeroes, just like always
Tonight some bitch is hassling me
And tonight it feels so good feeling cheap
I can only disappoint you

[Verse 2: Samantha Urbani]
You turned a man cuckoo
Half animal half grace
The chick was a teaser, always
Tonight their hips will swivel and turn
So we drove to the place where we first met

[Chorus: Blood Orange & Samantha Urbani]
I can only disappoint you, cause I always let you down
I can only disappoint you, always
I can only disappoint you, cause I always let you down
I can only disappoint you, always
I can only disappoint you, cause I always let you down
I can only disappoint you, always
I can only disappoint you, cause I always let you down
I can only disappoint you, always
I can only disappoint you, cause I always let you down
I can only disappoint you, always
I can only disappoint you, cause I always let you down
I can only disappoint you, always

[Refrain: Blood Orange]
Tell me if you caught my lie
My heart's not true
Tell me if we're on the line
Are we there, oh?
Tell me if you're in my life
Don't go, baby, are we on the line
Are we through?

[Chorus: Blood Orange & Samantha Urbani]
Baby, are we on the line
Tell me, baby, are you mine?
Is our love on the line?
Tell me, baby, are you mine?
Look and tell me what I'd find
Tell me, baby, are you mine?

[Refrain: Blood Orange]
Tell me if you caught my lie
My heart's not true
Tell me if we're on the line
Are we there, oh?
Tell me if you're in my life
Don't go, baby, are we on the line
Are we through?

[Chorus: Blood Orange & Samantha Urbani]
Baby, are we on the line
Tell me, baby, are you mine?
Is our love on the line?
Tell me, baby, are you mine?
Look and tell me what I'd find
Tell me, baby, are you mine?

[Bridge: Samantha Urbani]
So baby, is it all you got?

[Chorus: Blood Orange & Samantha Urbani]
Baby, are we on the line
Tell me, baby, are you mine?
Is our love on the line?
Tell me, baby, are you mine?
Look and tell me what I'd find
Tell me, baby, are you mine?

[Intro: Blood Orange]
Racing down Ilford Lane going home
Thinking about should I try to fake a fall
You seem to think that you're all alone
And nothing ever could change it all
Think about the words that you said

[Verse 1: Skepta]
Yeah, silence on my estate
Cassette player chewed up my cassette tape
Blisters from the control pad
Cause I was on the Mega Drive more time

[Chorus: Skepta]
If you're feeling me put your Pinot Grigio high
This ones for my G's in the North side (Racing down Ilford Lane going home)
All my G's on the East side
This one for my G's in the West side (Thinking about should I try to fake a fall)
My G's on the South side

[Verse 2: Skepta]
The late king Michael Jackson doing the moonwalk on the telly
And I was like "who's bad?"
Sitting there smoking, sipping MD 20/20
Thinking I was the man
Mum's upset because I haven't given her a penny
But I just got a 20 bag
Mum don't stress, you know I told you already
I'mma do it for you and dad
So I was out on the grind
On the 279, trying to show my songs to the world
Inspired by the streets
Fell in love with the beats, I never had time for a girl
I never really cared about a hair cut
I was in the club doing the 2-step
Wishing it was me on the decks
Wanted to do it for the love, it took some
Perseverance and discipline
Couldn't wait to get the whole world listening
I remember when I first went radio
I couldn't believe it was in the kitchen
Your mixing and reality kicks in
Smoking to calm my nerves and settle me down
It feels like I'm in a crystal maze
Somebody give Richard crystal and get me out
In 1 mile I've seen 2 fights
Blue tape, blue lights
Single mom struggling with the push chair?
She had a bad mouth but she had good hair
Stole a phone in the shop getting looked at
Barbershop, hairline's getting pushed back
Guys looking at me like they wanna fight me
Just another day on the high street
Yeah, and now I'm back on the estate
My CD keeps skipping when I press play
Four memory cards full of music
Cause I was on the PlayStation more time

[Chorus]
If you're feeling me put your Pinot Grigio high
This ones for my G's in the North side (Racing down Ilford Lane going home)
All my G's on the East side
This one for my G's in the West side (Thinking about should I try to fake a fall)
My G's on the South side

[Hook]
La la la la laaah
They ain't got nothing on me
Hey hey
La la la la la la la
They ain't got nothing on me

[Verse 1]
The lil engine that could
This lil nigga is good
Rappers claiming they sick I heal niggas for good
Cause homie I’ve been ill
Since Hilfiger was hood (ha-ha remember that? Hilfiger cargoes’)
Won't admit it but if you was a real nigga you would
And now I got your chick nigga
She'll get out the hood
And no I would peck her but she peck on my wood
And she do it so good
I gotta thank her
I got her ass clapping that’s how I congratulate her
She like to roll the dro up in the bed go higher
Pepsi cola Michael Jackson and her head so fire
I love this lil redbone Maya
She be getting louder than a set of Dr Dre head phones try her
If you ever need her
She got a man that don't never see her
And when his phone ring he looking like "this better be her"
This unrelated but I wish I could have met Aaliyah
And when I get to heaven, homie I better see her
But what you think it's really like behind the pearly gates
No murder rates all the bad shit we heard of race
And can we still do the fun shit we did love and if so
Then do you think some angels work in strip clubs
Well if so I be trying to get my dick rubbed
Make it rain filling up their tip cups
Throwing ones...

[Bridge]
Yeah nigga I'm the one
(Hey hey)
Say I’m the one
Yeah boy I'm the one
Hey yeah
Now I'm the one thus meaning no one must try
No two no three no four, no why?
Cause I'm the one
Yeah nigga I'm the one

[Verse 2]
Now every nigga keep talking keep walking
This the Ville where the real killers don’t speak often
But leave you leaking on the concrete police talking
My flow Nieman Marcus
You're so flea market so don't be starting cause Cole retarded
I be shitting on my niggas and my dough be farting
They won’t even say excuse me
Usually the groupies don't amuse me
Just wanna say I rate the tape my paper my loosely(?)
But can I take a lil dip in your Jacuzzi
Now I ain't Biggie but I got you feeling +Juicy+
Ohh she feeling like she never before
I bet she never forget me like an elephant won't
And yeah my name J.Cole I got a hell of a flow
I guarantee I'm gon sell em if you ever been poor
Or if you're trying to be rich
And this economy shhh if anything making money man
It’s probably this
Boy I'm the one...

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Third Verse]
The lil engine that could
This lil nigga is good
Rappers claiming they sick I heal niggas for good
A couple of yall ain't took a field trip to the hood
Ay me I'm Fresh Prince, I'm Will Smith to the hood Baby!
Ain't sayin names but we not the same
All that money and the fame don’t change the fact that u lame
Might wanna grab you a chain wanna tip up your hat
Might wanna purchase some game homie your shit is so wack!!!
I got my finger on the trigger tell that nigga hold datt
Boy I’m picture perfect baby you can check the Kodak
Hey so anything you can do I can do better
And any chick you can screw I can get wetter
I’m young black get to live my life on the run!
Bet ya bottom dollar before I’m done
They say that I’m the one
Yeah nigga I’m the one HA!!

[Bridge]

[Verse 1]
You there
You always seem to get what you want
You, you always seem to get better
And I'm dreaming, you're bleeding, depleted
And I'm bouncing off the floor of your ceiling
This feeling, gets demeaning
You know, you know, you seem to get better
And I still lie outside

[Chorus]
Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you (Find you)
Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you (Find you)

[Verse 2]
So go and take a little bit if you want
If you want to go and take a little bit if you want to
You're bleeding, depleted, gets demeaning
You know, you know you seem to get better
I, I am the prince of the Tyne
Guess you wouldn't know cause you sleep on your side
An' I guess you wouldn't know, I guess you wouldn't know
You seem to get better

[Chorus]
Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you (Find you)
Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you (Find you)
Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you (Find you)
Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you (Find you)

[Break]
(Well this car moves faster)

[Chorus]
Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you (Find you)
Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you (Find you)
Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you (Find you)
Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you (Find you)

Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you (Find you)

[Outro]
(Moves faster)

[Verse 1]
Step one, I can be your man
You can call me daddy when we're fucking in the sand
Step two, let's go for a ride, baby
Gotta hold the stick, I'll drive, baby
Step three, I be in these streets
Throwin' up the West Side, chuckin' up the Ps (Woo!)
And they can't take away my pride
They just can't take away my pride 'til they bury me

[Pre-Chorus]
Look into my eyes and see what I see
You're a mind reader, it's just you and me

[Chorus]
I'm ready to go to war for ya (War for ya)
I'ma be a warrior (Warrior)
I'ma make sure you're safe with me
I been smokin' that Cali
And baby, me and you can fly
Think it over one more time (Yeah, haha)
Just one more time (Okay)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm just a little nigga from a small town
I try to keep a small circle, but these fuck niggas always tryna come around
Bad bitches on deck, I'm 'bout to bring 'em out
You niggas writin' bad checks, I make her booty bounce
15 years old, I was ridin' in a Lamborghini
Now I'm 24, got a bigger fuckin' Lamborghini
Two doors up, like I'm two floors up
It's kill or be killed, nigga, either you or us
But I keep it movin' like a U-Haul truck
This adolescence had me stressin', I was too fucked up, I'm gone
What's the point of you havin' a crown if you ain't got a throne?
If you king, you need a queen
I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Look into my eyes and see what I see
You're a mind reader, it's just you and me

[Chorus]
I'm ready to go to war for ya (War for ya)
I'ma be a warrior (Warrior)
I'ma make sure you're safe with me
I been smokin' that Cali
And baby, me and you can fly
Think it over one more time
Just one more time

[Bridge]
I just need it one more time, do it
Can we do it, baby, one more time? Do it
One more time (Oh-oh)
One more time
Baby, if we do it, its gon' change our lives
It's kinda late, get some sleep, I'll drive ya
All around the world

[Chorus]
I'm ready to go to war for ya (War for ya)
I'ma be a warrior (Warrior, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I'ma make sure you're safe with me
I been smokin' that Cali
And baby, me and you can fly
(We can fly and just go, we can fly and just go)
Think it over one more time (Fly and just go)
Just one more time (Oh)
I'm ready to go to war for ya (War for ya)
I'ma be a warrior (Warrior)
I'ma make sure you're safe with me (Oh-oh-oh)
I been smokin' that Cali
And baby, me and you can fly
Think it over one more time (Whoa)
Just one more time (Whoa)

[Outro]
Oh yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Oh mother, sweet Caroline
Feels like you shot me with a .38 or a .45
And my heart's bleeding, baby
Can't feel my legs I'm paralyzed
I know you just in it for the moment, so I'll enjoy the ride

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Eyes start rolling in back of my head, girl, I'm already gone
I can see all of nothin', what's happenin'?
Can't even look at your face, girl, I'm fadin' away
Girl, your drug is automatic

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Higher than a fan, one sip of that, lights out
I'm just floating above the clouds, it really feels like life
Sweet love of mine, oh-oh
You're my sweet Caroline (Woo), my sweet Caroline

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Ooh, baby, I'm down
As long as you do the same, I'll try the same shit right now, right now
Baby, tell me when you start to feel it (Yeah)
Got me dead, oh (Oh), yeah, baby (Yeah)
Just let go of all the emotion, all the emotion
Just let it out, fly with me

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Eyes start rolling in back of my head, girl, I'm already gone
I can see all of nothin', what's happenin'?
Can't even look at your face, girl, I'm fadin' away
Girl, your drug is automatic

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Busta Rhymes]
Higher than a fan, one sip of that, lights out
I'm just floating above the clouds, it really feels like life
Sweet love of mine, oh-oh
You're my sweet Caroline (Woo), my sweet Caroline
Breezy, let me make sure Caroline understands somethin'

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Here I go, when I step up in the spot like another block
When the nigga drop stop, you ain't even got a clue
Regularly, man, a nigga that need to be seen
Medically, tell me what you really wanna do
Generally, niggas think they better than me, boo
Niggas really tryna put they foot up in my shoe
That's when I make a panic, I don't really understand it
That's when I lay 'em down, they tryna get a better view
Genuinely see the way I regularly choose
Whack niggas switch, I'm up to legendary view
Somethin' from benal, they already really knew
Instead of tryna fuck you, need to get a better crew
Lactose, switch, I came up back close
Better know I back those, I don't wanna let it go (Ooh)
Damn folks, shawty wanna stand close
When a nigga bang those panties, and I let it blow (Boom)
He didn't really wanna do it
Then what it gets a nigga that be flowin' like a fluid
And I be damagin' everything every time a nigga get up on it, it's nothin'
We know that they already do it and ain't nothin' really to it
Pull up, stop, how 'bout a drop top?
Then I'm unlocked, I got my Glock cocked
That's how we do it over here
Do not hop on the mic on a wrong block, not
Y'all niggas know what it is
Yeah, you know the way I put it down for 'em
That's right, got 'em loose
Ain't no buggin', baby girl, you can see the grab on 'em
Now y'all don't really want to get a better blow
Fireworks nigga, now we givin' 'em a show
Let me chill, at the party, I met a pretty little ho
Make it bounce for me, but a nigga gotta go

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Higher than a fan, one sip of that, lights out
I'm just floating above the clouds, it really feels like life
Sweet love of mine, oh-oh
You're my sweet Caroline (Woo), my sweet Caroline

[Chorus]
Birdie, told me, I must get over you, somehow
And she told me, never to think of you, right now

[Bridge]
But it's hopeless to say
How can I forget the way she used to love me
I think about her in my time
Know in my mind, it's over

[Verse 1]
Looks like falling
Heaven is calling my name to me
Funny faces loving the traces, memory

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Outro]
Birdie taught me, how to get over you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It's your fantasy (Yeah) and you got, you got me
Wanting to do it, I'm 'bout to prove it
Baby, I want to know can you love me?
You know I'd do anything, girl
I don't wanna waste your time
I'll put my heart on the line for you

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
It's the middle of the night, we in the middle of life, baby
So let your hair down, nobody's around
We're making love, just listen
Girl, right now I feel you
Can you hold me closer, baby?
This shit right here
If your looks could kill
Baby, go crazy, I'm gon' control it

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I love the way you throw it, I love the way you throw it

Bring that ass right here, bring that ass right here

Girl, it's a dream but you're not asleep
Tonight we're making history 'cause it's your...

[Chorus: Chris Brown]

Wanting to do it, I'm 'bout to prove it
Baby, I want to know can you love me?
You know I'd do anything, girl

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Girl, I know you wanna play (Stay with me)

Oh girl, I can't wait, I can't wait
We 'bout to sweat off your make-up
I'ma take my time
So baby, you don't have to worry
I got you for life, oh baby

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I love the way you throw it (Yeah), I love the way you throw it (Yeah)

I'll put my heart on the line for you

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Let me tell you what I wanna do
I wanna lick, lick, lick you from your head to your toes
And have you beggin' all night for mercy (Yeah)
Lookin' like a tall glass full of water in a hundred degrees
You got a nigga so thirsty (Ah)
Let me taste that, let me chase that
Lay back, way back, like Diddy, baby, take that
Get you wetter than the great lakes
Take a vacay to place where your booty, you can shake that (Woo!)
Ain't a race
Henny gettin' all the stress in your mind knowin' you my one and only (Only)
Take off everythin', but your boots
Saddle up, ride it like a pony (Pony)
Girl, you, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know what-what’s your fan-ta-ta-sy?
Luda!

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It's your fantasy (Yeah) and you got, you got me
Wanting to do it, I'm 'bout to prove it
Baby, I want to know can you love me?
You know I'd do anything, girl
I don't wanna waste your time
I'll put my heart on the line for you

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My bank got bigger, the kid got richer
Multi-millionaire but I'm the same old nigga
Never find a nigga with a watch more sicker
Or a rapper nigga spit this game mo slicker
That's yo tender after I hit her
Heard that she broke up with ya own Twitter
I love to suck dick till her face turn bitter
Try to cut her off but I can't get rid a her
Use a ban for a bed, use a brick for a pillow
Bag on yo head, best friend turned killa
Riding in the foreign, steering wheel in the middle
Car jacker, bet to reconsider
Diamonds on my wrist, I'm a hand it out the window
Presidential endo, smell it when the wind blow
4's on my Charger, I drive it like an Enzo
When bricks touch down I'll be dancing in the end zone
6 months gone, would've thought I would've been home
Keep the Barney with me like my last name Flintstone
Never disrespect the street shit that I pimp on
Put a tune out, now yo ass gotta limp home
Squares came in and they move with Benito
Run up on the kid then yo ass is finito
Easy to me, shoot yo ass like a free throw
2 Glock 9's up under the peacoat

[Hook: Travis Porter]
This pack right here, strongest in the town
VVS diamond cost a couple thou
Checker board gear hard Louie down
Always showin out when we be steppin out
This chick right here? Baddest for a while
How much we spending at Onyx? A couple thou
We pull up in them foreigns, I'm smashing out
Then spend a grip in Phipps, bitch I'm cashing out

[Verse 2: Travis Porter]
20 packs, 20 days, 40K in diamonds
Shawty got her shades on, still see me shinin
Pack touched down, I'm a bust it down asap
Rocky ass wrists so you know I gotta stay strapped
Always stay in Louie bitch, like i get it wholesale
Swerve up to the trap, tell em throw an O on the scale
Yeah - I'm international
Old school Chevelle, I'm skatin out or a national
You's the type a nigga love a bitch and take her to your place
I'm the type of nigga wake up in the morning 100K
Count it up, Louie sneakers on it, you should see the lace
Bezel cost a couple K, I just got this shit yesterday

[Hook x2: Travis Porter]
This pack right here, skrongest in the town
VVS diamond cost a couple thou
Checker board gear hard Louie down

How much we spending at Onyx? A couple thou
We pull up in them foreigns, I'm smashing out
Then spend a grip in Phipps, bitch I'm cashing out

[Chorus]
Go on with your song, bird
You can't go wrong bird
You will go on and on, bird
Like you did before
Though your wings are broken
The sky is so wide open
And the wind is waiting for you
Like an open door

[Post-Chorus]
Though you go so far away
Your voice will still be heard so well
You'll never really ever know
How beautiful you are
When the moon is on the rise
I'll try to make my songbird fly
I wonder if he ever will
And if he really did, how far

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]

[Outro]
Go on with your song, bird
You can't go wrong bird
You will go on and on, bird
Through the open door

Go on with your song, bird
You can't go wrong my bird
You will go on and on, bird
Like you did before

Like you did before

Smoking alone drinking syrup it's highly concentrated (Leeanin')

Smokin' Khalifa kush with Wiz that's just what it is

[Verse 1]
I feel unique
Not yet complete
And your steaming eyes fall on me
Poor me
Poor you
Poor us
A fuss, a fight
So I sat outside, outside

[Chorus]
I am not your savior
I am not your savior, baby girl
I am not your savior
I am not your savior

[Verse 2]
One, two, three, Fort Greene
We meet, I'm incomplete
And your freezing thighs warm me
Poor me
Poor you
Poor us
What's wrong with a little touch?
I am just a boy
I'm so lonely

[Chorus]
I am not your savior
I am not your savior, baby girl
I am not your savior
I am not your savior

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Kiss my lips and taste the Sauvignon
I wrap the vines around your thighs
I can see the kind of tip you're on
There's no confusion in your eyes

[Hook]
Let's unwind together
Together
Ease our minds together
Together

[Verse 2]
Taking sips to push the moment on
But it's just the bottle that's run dry
Lose the watch cause we got nothing on
And I'm not keeping track of time!

[Hook]

[Break]
Together
Together
Together

[Outro]
Ease our minds together (Repeated)

[Intro]
Why do we argue?
Why do we scream?
I wish it was better
I don't want you to leave

[Verse 1]
I'm tryna make peace, babe
These tears run down my face
So I close my eyes, but we both cry
And you say this is it, baby, baby
She say she tired of my shit, she wanna quit
The funny thing, I've been good to her, not doing shit
But she think that I've been fucking with Keisha, Latoya, and Lisa
Dirty Diana, Nicki, and Amber
Gotta be out of your damn mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what's the deal with you?
There's something wrong, I feel it too
We hardly see each other and now you wanna talk about space
You changed, you wanna leave me now but you can't tell me

[Chorus]
Why do we argue? Why do we scream?
I wish it was better, I don't want you to leave
So sick and tired of drinkin' this bottle
Contemplating a pill overdose
I think this one shot (Baow) will stop the pain (Baow)
Now I'm sleeping (Baow), I just wanted you to love me

[Verse 2]
Got myself on speed dial, 911
I got a hole in my heart, one bullet in the gun
Belly full of pills, running out of time
Sitting here waiting, just to say goodbye to my love
Farewell, I'm gonna miss you
You'll always go back to that day when I said, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what's the deal with you?
There's something wrong, I feel it too
We hardly see each other and now you wanna talk about space
You changed, you wanna leave me now but you can't tell me

[Chorus]
Why do we argue? (Why?) Why do we scream? (We scream)
I wish it was better (Better), I don't want you to leave (Ooh, babe)
So sick and tired of drinkin' this bottle
Contemplating a pill overdose
I think this one shot (One shot, baow) will stop the pain (Stop the pain, baow)
Now I'm sleeping (Baow), I just wanted you to love me

[Post-Chorus]
This is a love to remember
Yeah, this is a love to remember
Don't cry, don't cry
We'll meet again once upon a time
This is a love to remember
(Want you to love, want you to love, want you to love)
Yeah, this is a love to remember
(Want you to love, want you to love, want you to love)
Don't cry, don't cry
(Want you to love, want you to love)
We'll meet again once upon a time
(Want you to love, want you to love)

[Outro]
Yeah
(Why do we argue?)
Yeah
(Why do we scream?)
Yeah
(I wish it was better, I don't want you to leave)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(So sick and tired of drinkin' this bottle)
(Contemplating a pill overdose)
(I think this one shot will stop the pain)
(Now I'm sleeping, I just wanted you to love me)

Baby, I just had a long day
I know you done seen my missed calls, I done called you a thousand times
I guess you out clubbing, baby
I'm not gon' trip, not gon' say shit, she gon' ask me why
She know I'm hiding all this pain inside, but she'll never see a nigga cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Back and forth with the games, girl, you played me

She say she only wanna party
'Cause she in love with everybody

[Chorus]
I said, "Baby, look what you do to me"

I said, "Baby, look what you do to me"
Girl, I go crazy
And you just got me waiting

[Verse 2]
I'm on a 101
Lamborghini speeding on the highway, that's suicide
I'm tryna find you, I'm scared
You with your girls, it's your night out
Stressin' got me lookin' like a night owl
You a star now, all up on TV
I made you famous 'cause I put you in the streets

[Pre-Chorus]
Back and forth with the games, girl, you played me
This ain't what I wanted
She say she only wanna party
'Cause she in love with everybody

Girl, I go crazy
And you just got me waiting

[Bridge]
I don't want you to leave, baby, sit down and listen
Let me love you, that's all I ever wanted to do, oh-no-no
And I made you cry a thousand times when I went missing
Sorry, I hurt you, I just want you to know that, I love you, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Back and forth with the games, girl, you played me (Oh)
This ain't what I wanted
She say she only wanna party (Party)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I woke up workin' like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Bitch, I do what I do, I feel how I feel
Got my drink on the rocks, got my house on the hill
Got the girl of your dreams yep I pop her, for real
And I'm thumbing through bill after bill after bill
After bill, but I still pay respect to my city
So much man you thought I was in debt for real
Every day is a chase, every night is a thrill
I feel sorry for whoever's not in the will
G.O.O.D music or die ho, shout out to Ye-Ye
Dumped all my other hoes, shout out to Nay-Nay
I start my day with a prayer and vagjayjay
I'm higher than Day-Day, no off day just pay day
Boy, since I was a baby I swear I was OG, you was a no G
Textin' these hoes that you love 'em and shit, prolly using them Emoji's
When you was a OG, bitch, I'd still be more G
Fuck you know about night terrors, nightmares and night scares
About not gettin' that white money 'fore a young nigga get white hair
And I done dropped "Control" just to show you hoes who done got controlled
You saying that I changed, yep, changed like I supposed
While you at the same crib still wearin' the same clothes
Going to the same club, taking the same pose
Pillow talkin' with the same hoes
All day about how Em ain't the same Em
And Hov ain't the same Hov
Some niggas never grew up, boy, they only grow old
I guess that what coming up in Detroit do
Finally famous is a Detroit crew
Fuck with me and you Detroit food
End up on the fuckin' Detroit news, better off in the Detroit zoo
Everybody got haters, I swear we been through this
Martin had Malcolm, Caesar had Brutus
Fuck am I sayin', man, Jesus had Judas
I guess I'm alright though, if I just got you, bitch
You gon' pull up friend to friend, I'mma pull up Benz to Benz
While you and her are cheek to cheek, me and her dick to chin
That's the difference between a 9-to-5 and a 10-to-10
Sean Don

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I woke up workin' like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
They done fucked up now, ha-ha
Mastermind...

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
My kilos on ice, my sneakers snow white
I got a place at the Trump, just to pray for advice
My new bitch is Hispanic, got me speaking bilingual
Some call it trickin' cause this bitch thicker than Trina
Anybody wanna motherfuckin' die? Come try me then
You ain't real till you fucked your dawg's ho
Seen a brick and had to buy a Benz
Comin' through and I don't fuck with niggas
Bitch you wish you wanna fuck a nigga
Good chance she done fucked a nigga
Turned around and said, "Fuck a nigga"
Stack on my belt, double M we a cult
Mastermind's in control, so nigga fuck what you thought
16's of coke, all my verses be dope
Fuck XXL 'cause I'm the source to these quotes

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I woke up workin' like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
I've been up from ten to ten, (Oh God) swear I won't sin again
Raising Hell in my residence, godly presence with presidents (Straight up!)
My day job ain't made me shit, public housin' ain't got no fence (La Flame!)
And college ain't make no sense, niggas whole home invaded quick (Straight up!)
I done work, I done pay my dues, I'm induced, now I'm overdue
One hit one, call this voodoo, don't want apes to jump out the zoo
I got one mountain, one problem
Plus the issues, I can't solve them (Straight up!)
But it's nothin', and I'm still in the club on the couch still fuckin' up somethin' (La Flame!)
Nigga, please!
Mama please, I'm never comin' home 'til I make a hundred G's (Straight up!)
Scratch that, 'til I make a hundred million, then
I'ma stretch that 'til I make a hundred trillion (Straight up!)
Who knew one day your son would grow up and learn how to be the boy (La Flame!)
Did songs with Hov, now hallelujah, fell asleep the real McCoy
God damn, oh God, how you do that?

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I woke up workin' like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

[Verse:]
When the roll is called up yonder
I hope you see me there
It's in the water, it's where you came from
It's in the water, it's where you came from
When the crowd begins to wonder
And they cry to see your face

[Chorus:]
It's in the water, it's in the story, of where you came from
Your sons and daughters, in all their glory, it's going to shape her
And when they clash and come together, and start rising
Just drink the water where you came from, where you came from

[Bridge:]
So the roll it was called from yonder
Never sold yourself away

[Chorus:]
It's in the water, it's in the story, of where you came from
Your sons and daughters, in all their glory, it's going to shape her
And when they clash and come together, and start rising
Just drink the water where you came from, where you came from

[Outro:]
It's in the water, it's where you came from
It's in the water, it's where you came from
And when they clash and come together, and start rising
Just drink the water, where you came from, where you came from

[Produced by Felix Snow and Pat Lukens]

[Verse 1]
I would die, and say
I been wasting, all of my life
On this, moment
Like we, go all day
Fly away, you go and I
For it
I'd rather be with you tonight
I'm tired of the truth, just lie to me
I wanna run away!
I wanna go home!

[Chorus]
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go there
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go go, go there
Go to church if you're scared

[Verse 2]
I lay formless
Hands tied in my sheets
Star signs say I'm rare
Chosen
By who
I-I-I-I-I
I wonder who's watchin'
Who's wing I'm under
Sweep me up and I'll go
No questions take me
I'll go!

[Chrous]
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go there
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go go, go there
Go to church if you're scared

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Put the herb in the air, take control of your life
Get them leeches out your ear, nothin' but leaders over here
We ain't drinkin sprite
I can quench your thirst, I can dim the lights
You can cum first, shit you can cum twice
Long as you coming baby, you ain't gotta hide
You ain't gotta lie
We can lay together, No more lonely Septembers
Cold and stormy weather, I know you remember
And whether or not we decide to tie a knot or not
I rather had than had not
Don't be afraid

[Chrous]
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go there
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go go, go there
Go to church if you're scared

[Outro (x3)]
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light

[Snippet from "Brainless"]
"Who can say for sure? Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
Society will reap a great benefit."

[Zane Lowe]
Let's talk about your work on the record as a producer, because I know on Relapse you did nothing, on Recovery you got back into it, I've always said to you as long as I've know you or you've been making beats how much of a fan I am of your particular music, your production for others as well as just for yourself.

[Eminem]
Oh, thank you.

[Zane Lowe]
And so to hear you back making beats again on some of the standout beats on the record was a real thrill. So, I mean, how was that getting back into the producer's chair and deciding to wear two hats again?

[Eminem]
Urm, I mean that was fun, it was fun to, to be able to, just mess around with beats from scratch again and, you know, sometimes, like, I think Recovery was the first time that I ever got really super-open to, urr, working with a lot of other producers, you know that was the most I had ever done, and, you know, aside from working with Dre. You know, so, on that album kind of opened those doors a little bit, so that's kinda how early on, we started approaching this record, or this album, and sometimes, like I may get something in my head like an idea or the mood of something that I would want and I'm not always gonna get that by going through, you know, different tracks if other people have made, they don't know what's in my head, you know what I'm saying, so it's also a good way to, ur, I think maybe it helps with diversity a little bit too, with the sound and all that, you know, I would get something in my head and wanna be able to lay that idea down from scratch.

[Zane Lowe]
It just sounds like your being inspired by rap, in a big big way, I mean...

[Eminem]
Absolutely

[Zane Lowe]
I mean, I know you've always been that way, we've known each other for a long time and I've met you at various points throughout every album and I know that it's...

[Eminem]
I just met you, out there I thought... It's all good man, I'm still peeling the floors. (Laughter)

[Zane Lowe]
Um, you know and the music reflects your head space, it's always been pretty honest, not just lyrically but also musically I mean there was a time when the beats you were making were all very kind of minor key and lots of strings and lots of, kind of, a lot of Drama. The beats on here are fun. I mean, they're fat, big and rap! Like inspired by hip-hop!

[Eminem]
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty much all I do, and all I wanna do, you know what I'm saying like, so it's fun for me, like I'm still, you know, like I'm still passionate about hip-hop, and every aspect of it, so, making beats and producing, you know, is definitely, it's fun for me.

[Zane Lowe]
What is it about rap that you love? I mean I'm a huge, I mean I grew up on hip-hop and it forms pretty much every sort of thing I've ever done in my life pretty much to some form, and what I wondered, you know, being someone who is considered one of the greatest of all time, what is it about rap the art form, if you can even trace it back to when you first discovered it, to how you feel about it now and what are your most rap-heavy records?

[Eminem]
You know, just a lot of rap.

[Zane Lowe]
A lot of rapping on there, a lot of words?

[Eminem]
Yeah

[Zane Lowe]
What is it about it that you love, if you can put it into words?

[Eminem]
Hmm, I dunno, I, urm, I love the fact that you can, I love the expression of it. The fact that you can, you know, just, I don't know, I love the, I love beats and rhymes and I love the fact that you can express yourself in a rhyme and lay it down and it can be therapeutic, and you've got it off your chest, and then you could go on to the next thing, I don't know, there's so much shit that I love about rap, you know, I'm in it for like, I love to watch what's going on in the game and keep my finger on the pulse of that, you know, and it's exciting to watch as a fan, for me too, you know, just being a fan of hip-hop, urm, and watching as it, you know, the evolution of it, and, you know, how it moves from each year to year, you know what I'm saying, the direction, and...

[Zane Lowe]
Are you sort of relieved that you can be that now, you can be a contender for the world's greatest rapper along with a selection of your peers and it can be a really amazing rap record and to a certain extent, I hope you take this the right  way because I know your strong career, very popular, number 1 in 80+ countries, huge, but the pop stars kind of did, you know, in the sense of what people expect from you these days, isn't it, you don't have to be that guy any more, you can just be a rapper and make rap records if you want. Is that a relief?

[Eminem]
Well, yeah, I think so, urm, it's one of them things like, as far as like, being a pop star or whatever like, I never, never intended to be any of that, you know wha I'm saying, like, all I ever wanted to do was get respect from, you know, my peers       and other rappers, and, urm, all the other stuff that came with it was just, you know, confusing to me, it was, I don't know, like I don't feel like I ever set out to make a pop song or a song that was gonna be some kind of crossover song or whatever... is that for me?

[Zane Lowe]
Yeah, if you want it.

[Eminem]
Thanks man, appreciate it. Urm...

[Zane Lowe]
And then boom, you did! And it didn't stop for years!

[Eminem]
Well boom, it happened but at the same time, like - I never wanted to - when things did did keep happening and when certain things kept hitting the radio and things like that, I mean, I don't think I'm stupid. I'm not stupid. Like, I know when a song has a certain particular sound and sounds like "well maybe this could possibly be a radio record", or when I'm going "fuck, shit, ass!" you know what I'm saying, and I know "this will never go to radio". But at the same time, if a song starts heading that way, cause a lot of times I may even think, I may even think certain things when I'm writing it, like, maybe what person this might connect with, you know what I'm saying like, and who I might connect with with this song. But I never, in making any song I have made, I never wanted to compromise lyrical integrity, yeah, you know, and I always wanted to make sure that if I was rapping on a beat that had some kind of appeal to it and was catchy, that I was at least doing my job as an MC, and you know what I'm saying...

[Zane Lowe]
Oh that's the struggle!

[Eminem]
And doing what I feel like I need to do.

[Zane Lowe]
That's tough man, because you want to give as much quality as you possibly can through your music, you're not going to hold yourself back in case you get successful, but at the same time like you say it's never been on the agenda, and I guess in a way that was part of what caused the problem in the first place that just manifested over that time, huh, like, how do I do both? How do I be good and not court this, not be this guy that everybody expects something from?

[Eminem]
Yeah, urm, I know that early on I went through a lot of that with the "Hi, my name is" record, and it was, urm, like I never understood, like I understood that the record was funny, and i understood that it was a little, urm, how you say, kitschy, or whatever, and maybe the hook was, the whole record was tongue-in-cheek. You know what I'm saying, like I'm still doing a lot of records like that to this day, with the tongue-in-cheek, but that record in particular was just like, it was my, it was almost like my anti-pop song cause it was like my hello to the world but it was my "fuck you" to the world at the same time. So I never understood, like, when all that started happening, like holy shit how did that become a, you know, I guess pop song.

[Zane Lowe]
So when did the penny drop and you realized the more you say "fuck you", the more people are gonna say, you know, "hi, we love you"?

[Eminem]
Urm, I don't know, I mean...

[Zane Lowe]
Probably around the Marshall Mathers LP right, cause that's when it really started to, to blow up again?

[Eminem]
Yeah, I think, I think there was a lot of that, and I think that just, coming from being an underground MC and being an underdog and things like that kinda gave me that attitude I think, you know, I think that had a lot to do with it, and then, you know, watching NWA and other people, 2Pac, you know what I'm saying, like, it was like, he's not going to, him or they, aren't going to kiss your ass to make you like their music.

[Zane Lowe over snippet from "Survival"]
Yeah, that's exactly what they want to do, let things slide a bit, you know. Now, you kind of talk about that on this song here, on The Monster (plays snippet from "The Monster"), and I think this is the one where you really address it in the most eloquent way about like, it's the gift and the curse, you know, I'm aware of the trouble it can get you in, I've been through that, you know. Number 1 album, number 1 movie, number 1 this number 1 that, not really in a position to really, kind of, really, be able to absorb that, yet, it's intoxicating, isn't it?

[Eminem]
Yeah, it was like, it was this thing, where, and I'm not gonna lie, I still wish it today, that it was like this thing where I want this attention for this music, but then I wanna be able to go in public, and I wanna be able to eat a fucking sandwich, you know what I mean, and be left alone. So, it was like "man, if I could...", because, I'd never been an attention seeker, and it seems like a hell of a career choice, you know, but, I don't like attention, that's not just why I do it, just to get attention, I don't like to be in public and walk around and be, like, here I am, you know what I mean, like, it's not what I want, I just wanted, my dream was, my dream was for like, fuck man, to be able to one day, like hear rappers that I look up to on the radio, like "yo, what if Jay Z, whoever, what if they heard of me, what if they thought I was dope? You know what I'm saying like? That was where my mentality always was, was with it. So when it all went crazy it was really hard to wrap my head around, you know, a lot of it still is, but especially back then.

[Zane Lowe]
Yeah. You know, you have done something which very few people have done now, you've actually been at the center of the world, the center of that storm, and you've emerged out of it, you popped out of the other side of it, I mean. Elvis didn't do that, you know, Michael Jackson didn't do that, Whitney Houston... a lot of people who have been in the public eye to that extent, unfortunately the list of various reasons, I'm sure personal to them, is too long, who didn't make it through. You have, and what does the world look like to you, when you've come out the other side of that, and you're 5 years sober and you're looking on that chaos for some perspective?

[Eminem]
Urm, I don't know, I mean I'm definitely thankful, you know what I mean, I know that could have certainly took another path...

[Zane Lowe]
And gone that way, yeah.

[Eminem]
Yeah, I could have went another direction but, I don't know, I mean, I think that, I feel like, like I'm probably able to see it, I'm able to be more focused now than I've ever been, urm, but I'm also able to I guess put it in perspective. The problem is I can't put a lot of perspective because I don't, there's a lot that's, you know, gone, there's a lot that I don't remember, and maybe that's cool, too, you know what I'm saying, where...

[Zane Lowe]
Probably a good thing?

[Eminem]
Yeah but, I don't know man, I know, I know that, there's so many addicts in this world, you know, and people who have problems like that, that don't make it, you know what I'm saying so I, I'm thankful for that, but urr, you know, I think that's one thing that really helps me, urr, through, and just, keeps me pushing forward is the music, is the passion for that and, and, and, you know.

[Hook]
Add it up, add it up
See ya homie tatted up
If used to make uou mad, it's gone make you madder

[Outro:]
If you listenin' to this it's the movie

Pull the cars out turn the sound up
Clear the bars out for a gangsta
I got off the phone with this one dude. I guess he used to run a multi-billion dollar company or something like that and he had some advice for me, right. He said, 'I don't approve of your methods in your interviews lately.' He said he only saw one person before who ever really pulled this off and that was Muhammad Ali. But he said if he could just give me some advice, he doesn't approve of the way I'm going about things as of late. And when anybody that's supposed to have a lot of money talks to me and they give me advice, I call that free advice, because they're trying to tell me what to do and they ain't cut no check yet. If I look to the side of me, or the other side of me, or if I look to the Internet or if I'm reading, and I don't see somebody that 36-years-old that made it this far with nobody that told they couldn't do it this much. Because the people that give me advice... I don't see them rocking for 15,000 motherfuckers in Brooklyn tonight. And I don't know if y'all have heard of 

[Nikola] Tesla, and I'm not talking about the car, I'm talking about the inventor. Or if y'all ever heard about 

[Alejandro] Jodorowsky, the director who made Holy Mountain. But there's so many amazing creative inventors who weren't recognized in their time. And if I've got the voice and I've got the opportunity to turn up in these interviews, I just have to look and say, 'What do I have to lose?' What do I have to lose? We only have everything to gain. So don't ever let them make you think for one moment that I'm going insane. Because I sit back and see shit and think 'Am I the only one that's not crazy?' But every celebrity is so goddamn scared of losing everything, that they won't ever say nothing to you. And y'all see that shit too. I gotta keep it so true for you... Because when I say 'creative genius,' I'm not saying that as a compliment to myself. I'm saying that because it's a burden to myself when these ideas keep me up at night. When you wanna give the world more and your ideas keep you up at night. When you wanna give the world so much more, so much more. And then nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. And nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. They'd rather see the headline and be on some bullshit than to give me one little chance. Than to give me one little, little, little chance. Than to give me one little chance despite the advance out of Tesla's basement, despite the advance out of me saying Jodorowsky's name and ya'll don't know who the fuck he is when everybody copied off of him... And there's gonna be motherfuckers in this arena in a few months dancing all sloppy off of him...I love y'all so much you don't even understand. Because y'all help me to talk all this shit. Because when I be on the phone with these people that used to run companies and they're trying to tell me how to be me, y'all give me the power to talk my shit. And I swear to you, this is only the motherfucking beginning. And anybody who 

[says], 'Oh, he's the best of rap.' That's racist. And that's pigeonholing. That's pigeonholing. That's pigeonholing and putting motherfuckers in a box. And putting creative niggas in a box. If you believe you can do anything, please raise your hands up tonight. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands in the sky. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands so high. And I wish you could see my tears right now. Put your hands up high. I wish you could feel my pain right now. Cause these dreams keep me up at night. Cause these dreams keep me up at night. These dreams keep me up at night. Dreams keep me up at night

[Verse 1]
You got a face like the Madonna, cryin' tears of gold
Been pumping gas at the Texaco, road to road
You're on the run, oh, baby, yeah
You're on the run, oh, baby

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm not a trick, but I'm a trick for you
You gimme butterflies; heart's skipping one, two
I know you're sick, boy, I wanna get the flu
I'm runnin' temperatures thinkin' of your love, boo

[Chorus]
Brooklyn, move my soul like this
Kissing my stilettos
Move your mouth up to my lips
Come on over, ghetto baby
(He said, "show me what you got, girl")
Come on over, ghetto baby
("Drop it like it's hot, girl")

[Verse 2]
I know your lips say that you wanna, but your heart's a no
But boy, your hips say that you're gonna when you hold me, hold me
You're so fun, b-baby, you are too much fun, b-baby

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My local rock star, the Willy B. crew
I'm feeling you, boy, you likin' me too
I'm clockin' chicks left and right just to get to you
You're out there on the grind
Now come home to your queen, boo

[Chorus]
Brooklyn, move my soul like this
Kissin' my stilettos
Move your mouth up to my lips
Come on over, ghetto baby
(He said, "show me what you got, girl")
Come on over, ghetto baby
("Drop it like it's hot, girl")

[Chorus]
Brooklyn, move my soul like this
Kissin' my stilettos
Move your mouth up to my lips
Come on over, ghetto baby
(He said, "show me what you got, girl")
Come on over, ghetto baby
("Drop it like it's hot, girl")

[Bridge]
We're a match made in Heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em
If they don't think we're good together, baby just forget 'em
When he's bad, he's bad
But when he's good, no one's better
Cause we're a match made in Heaven
And this kind of love's forever

[Chorus]
Brooklyn, move my soul like this
Kissin' my stilettos
Move your mouth up to my lips
Come on over, ghetto baby
(He said, "show me what you got, girl")
Come on over, ghetto baby
("Drop it like it's hot, girl")

[Chorus]
Brooklyn, move my soul like this
Kissin' my stilettos
Move your mouth up to my lips
Come on over, ghetto baby
(He said, "show me what you got, girl")
Come on over, ghetto baby
("Drop it like it's hot, girl")

[Verse 1]
When you were born, the angels sighed in delight
They never thought they'd see such a beautiful sight
You took the breath and the world was right again
Tears were shed, how we had been blessed

[Pre-Hook]
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right, oh
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You got a light inside, light inside

[Hook]
God made you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
God made you beautiful, beautiful, you're beautiful

[Verse 2]
Well look at me, you were brought into my life
I kiss those little feet and watch for your perfect smile
And when it comes, the world stops in your eyes
I found love, I found peace of the purest kind

[Pre-Hook]
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right, oh
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You got a light inside, light inside

[Hook]
God made you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
God made you beautiful, beautiful, you're beautiful

[Break]
Thank God, I get on my knees and pray
Thank God for giving me a life
You're beautiful, you're beautiful, too beautiful
God made you beautiful

[Hook]
God made you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
God made you beautiful, beautiful, you're beautiful

[Hook: 2D]
Oh stylo
Go forth, blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love
When the mako flies
Up from the bottom in your eyes
Then I know the twilight skies
Are not so broken hearted

(About to go down)

[Bridge: 2D]
Stylo, stylo
Stylo, stylo
Stylo, stylo, stylo
Elec-lec, electric is the

[Hook]
Oh stylo
Go forth, blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love

[Verse 1: Bobby Womack]
There's only one way
Let it pray a little while longer
It's got a way of passing through man and woman
In another world, in another world, in the universe

[Verse 2: Yasiin Bey]
Love, electricity, shockwave central
Power on the motherboard, yes!
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on
Yes, the lantern burn, burn that easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

[Bridge: 2D]
Stylo, stylo
Stylo, stylo
Stylo, stylo, stylo
Electric, electric is the

[Verse 3: 2D]
Sing yourself
Out of depression, rise above
I'll be searching if I know your heart
Electric is the love

[Verse 4: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, uh, I'm overwhelmed, like my poem reveals
I found my love electric flow in myself
Frozen my hell, my soul's in a shell
My opponents have failed
Haters undetected like a soldier with stealth
Pray for a happy ending, play my role in the film
That's the emotion we feel
Oh Stylo, let your love shine brighter than some white dough

[Bobby Womack]
Here's what we got to do

[Verse 5: Yasiin Bey]
That's what I'm talking about
Love, electricity, shockwave central
Pummel on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep it all together
Yes the lantern burn, burn that easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

[Outro: Labrinth, Tinie Tempah & (2D)]
Electric (oh stylo, oh stylo)
Electric (oh stylo, oh stylo)
I found my love electric
Electric (oh stylo, oh stylo)
Electric (oh stylo, oh stylo)
I found my love electric
Electric is all you need
So follow me to the light
I found my love electric
Electric is all you need
So follow me

We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh wonderful Christmas time

[Verse 1]
And the rain will fall, it falls for you
And the clouds will break into tears
You should be here standing so near to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Cept I know you should be sad
But give me time alone to get it out of my mind
Though I say, I know it's only the weather
Cause every time it rains, you are gone
And I'm blue
Then I wake up, then I wake up

[Chorus]
And the sun will shine if just for you
And the trees will talk to the skies, whispering lies
Heaven will pass to me, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Trains walk by and the birds disappear
But why am I still here without you by my side
So I cry your name and love
Cause love to me is life and I live
Then I wake up, then I grow up

[Outro]
And the rain will fall
It falls for you
And the clouds will break
It should be near
And the sun will shine
If just for you
And the love....
Yeah, I'mma rock that
Yeah, I'mma fuck that
Yeah, I'mma feel that

Just do ya, do ya, do ya

Yeah, how you ride that?
Yeah, how you be that?
Yeah, how you do that?

Just do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya

Let me hear ya try and mack
Let me touch ya front and back
Let me grab ya like a gat

Just do ya, do ya, do ya

Let me break you at the sack
Take your tic to my tac
Do my dance on ya lap
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya

Get me books to read me
Get me films to show me
Get me food to feed me

When I do ya, do ya, do ya

Make me scream so freaky
Make me dream so freaky
Make me freaky-deaky

When I do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya

Let me sway like gypsy
Let me sip 'lot a whiskey
Let me talk that Hindi

As I do ya, do ya, do ya

Sexy roxy-roxy
I get juicy-juicy
Can you film me, film me

As I do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya?

[Verse 1]
Motel sex, fast food, marriage
Nine months, got a baby carriage
One year, your stuff's in the storage
My love is just your...

[Pre-Chorus]
Water under the bridge
Water under the bridge, what!
Water under the bridge
Water under the bridge, what!

[Chorus]
Every day I love you less and less
It's clear to see that you're obsessed
I've got to get it to the press
That every day I love you less and less
Every day I love you less and less
I've got to get it off my chest
The doctor says I need the rest
Since every day I love you less and less

[Hook]
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna let you know my mates love me
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna let you know my folks love me
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm gonna let you know my girls love me
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm gonna let you know your mates love me

[Verse 2]
Cocoa butter made by Palmer's
Used to love me in my pajamas
We used to share our lamb shoulders
When it rains, it pours like...

[Pre-Chorus]
Water under the bridge
Water under the bridge, boy!
Water under the bridge
Water under the bridge, what!

[Hook]
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I wanna let you know my girls love me
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna let you know your boys love me

[Bridge]
What?
Pow, pow, pow, pow!

[Chorus]
Every day I love you less and less
It's clear to see that you're obsessed
I've got to get it to the press
That every day I love you less and less
Every day I love you less and less
I've got to get it off my chest
The doctor says I need the rest
Since every day I love you less and less
Every day I love you less and less
It's clear to see that you're obsessed
I've got to get it off my chest
Every day I love you less and less
Every day I love you less and less
It's clear to see that you're obsessed
I've got to get it off my chest
Every day I love you less and less
Every day I love you less and less
I've got to get it off my chest
Every day I love you less and less
Every day I love you less and less

[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oi

[Outro]
Boy
Pow, pow, pow, p-pow!
mind is pretty blank right now. i’m sitting in my kitchen listening to age of consent by new order. i like this song.. i fuck with that gwen stefani song ‘cool’ too, i never knew 3000 played keyboards on it- sounds like some teen coming of age movie. i used my birthday week pass to stay in my apartment for too long.. sit still and catch up on some information. i saw that movie ‘glengarry glen ross’ and ‘bottle rocket’, ‘pi’, ‘blackfish’ (sea world is the devil), ‘this is the end’ (hahaha), ‘the purge’(smh), some funny horror movie i forgot the name of ‘…’ . my homie in aussie suggested that i read ‘mr. norris changes trains’.. the writing was really nice. i read ‘the new jim crow’ it made me not fuck with humans for an hour. oh and ‘diffficult men’ which talked about great tv ..dexter, the wire, the sopranos, breaking bad and whatnot. i didn’t watch any news or read it …figured all that shit was gonna happen either way. i’m back to work these days.

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I like the way your sparkling earrings lay
Against your skin so brown
And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight
With a billion stars all around

[Chorus]
'Cause I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
On the ground

[Verse 2]
And I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul
Aw, but she can't take you anyway
You don't already know how to go

[Chorus]
And I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
On the ground

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I get this feelin' I may know you
As a lover and a friend
But this voice keeps whisperin' in my other ear
Tells me I may never see you again

[Chorus]
'Cause I get a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
I'm already standin'
Yes, I'm already standin'
On the ground

[Outro]
Whoo oh ooh

[Verse 1]
And I hate to say I love you
When it's so hard for me
And I hate to say I want you
When you make it so clear
You don't want me

[Chorus]
I'd never ask you 'cause deep down
I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say "I'm sorry, believe me, I love you
But not in that way"

[Verse 2]
And I hate to say I need you
I'm so reliant, I'm so dependent, I'm such a fool
When you're not there, I find myself singing the blues
Can't bear, can't face the truth

[Bridge]
You will never know that feeling
You will never see through these eyes

[Chorus]
I'd never ask you 'cause deep down
I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say "I'm sorry, believe me, I love you
But not in that way"

[Outro]
You'd say "I'm sorry, believe me, I love you
But not in that way"

[Verse 1]
We were inseparable
Everything I had to do, I did it next to you
And the memories we made were so incredible
Then our love was interrupted by my schedule

[Pre-Chorus]
There was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby, you got used to

[Chorus]
Being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to
Being alone, all alone
Ooh you got used to being on your own

[Verse 2]
I saw it happening
But I didn't accept the truth, I couldn't fathom it
There was so much going on you couldn't handle it
Could have divided my time, I should have rationed it

[Pre-Chorus]
There was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby, you got used to

[Chorus]
Being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to
Being alone, all alone
Ooh you got used to being on your own

[Intro: Casey Veggies]
(We on tour right now) It's Young Veggies right here
You know what I'm sayin'? We in the studio (Yeah), Chi Town
I got my niggas with me (Ah yeah)
I got my people with me (Ah yeah)
Mac Meezy (My boy), Mikey watchin' this shit too (

[?])
You know I'm sayin'? (Swag, yeah, swag, swag, yeah, swag, swag, yeah, swag)
Your swag's shit (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
It go rock-a-bye baby
What if I'm fuckin' with my butterfly lady
In the backseat of the 'Cedes, or the Saleen
Somethin' that I cop, made in the eighties
I've been lost inside this puzzle
Rearrangin', keep on sayin' I'm a goddamn fool
Tell me, "Quit playin'," I'm like, "No can do"
Been through this bullshit
Actin' foolish as a dude that's hit with Cupid's doings
Music is the key to everything I keep pursuin'
Bitches used to do the friend thing, now they ask me what I'm doin'
Tryna give me head before the show
Go while I'm interviewin' with a student newspaper
Maybe with the radio
Curb Your Enthusiasm, ho, the Larry David Show
Was somethin' that we probably watchin' while we be gettin' high
Step aside if anybody think they lookin' fresh as I am
With my Daily Bread hoodie and a floral hat
This shit these rappers talkin 'bout
I'm gettin' bored of that

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Sir Michael Rocks]
This, or that, and a wiffle ball bat
Make a million dollars, then I give it all back
These rappers talkin' shit when they shit is all wack (Ayy)
Yeah, I said it on wax
Yeah, I'm pullin' stars from the sky
Live large, get high
Women lie, men lie, but we always fly
At the end of the movie, dubs always cry (Michael)
Pullin' stars from the sky (Michael)
Live large, get high

[Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks]
It's all live, baby (Baby)
Golded up like Tut, It make guys hate me (Uh)
But I ain't givin' a fuck, I tell 'em, "Drive safely"
How dare a man lift his hand at me like I'm gon' flinch?
I'm not no bitch (Uh-uh)
With the concreature concrete monuments (Monuments)

[?] prolly pack his bag if he tryna trip
Nick Bruno, Boldy James kinda shit
It's like The Godfather, y'all gotta honor this (Honor this)
Tryna split the money up like communists (Okay)
You should shake the person hand that put you on to this
Hold up, that's the swag you would kill for (Kill for)
What the fuck you tryna chill for? (Wake up)
Are you alive or a stillborn?
'Cause you really ain't livin' 'til you get yours
Sky's the limit, we could build doors
Open 'em up, nothin' gon' be closed, I'm sure

[Chorus: Sir Michael Rocks & Mac Miller]
This, or that, and a wiffle ball bat
Make a million dollars, and then give it all back
These rappers talkin' shit when they shit be all wack
Yeah, I said it on wax
We pullin' stars out the sky
Live large, get high
Men lie, women lie, but we always fly
At the end of the movie, dubs always cry
Pullin' stars out the sky
Live large, get high, ha

[Hook]
My baby mama trippin' and she on some bullshit
I heard them niggas snitchin' and they on some bullshit
Better mind your own business if you on some bullshit
Cause you can turn up missing if you on some bullshit
My baby mama trippin' and she on some bullshit
I heard them niggas snitchin' and they on some bullshit
In the club with my niggas, yeah we on some bullshit

[Verse 1]
It's hidden under my jacket and I ain't even playing
All my homies makin' that racket, and they ain't even banging
My baby mama keep shopping, still be complaining
Get your manicure out of my pocket, cause you ain't get naked
Got a new whip, new bitch, guess I'm on my new shit
She ain't cool with it, what love got to do with it?
And she thinking I don't love her no more
Just cause I got a new ho

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Y'all riding around them AK's, and won't shoot nothing
Your whole squad they all bitch made, y'all niggas fronting
Y'all swear to God that y'all hustle hard, where's ya money?
We cash out, we don't front at all 

[?]
We treat 'em bad, send 'em home after we fuck 'em
Y'all fall in love with them hoes, and I don't even trust 'em
'Cuz I just wanna fuck 'em for one night
Now you can have her faster, you can really treat her right

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Springtime, and the acacias are blooming
Southern California will see one more day
Dreamland, and bus'ness is booming
The birds are a singing as I drift away

[Verse 2]
She looks another year older
From too many lovers who used her and ran
But some nights, oh, she looks like an angel
And she's always willing to hold you again

[Chorus]
So give her this dance
She can't be forsaken
Learn how to love her
With all of her faults
She gave more than she's taken
And I'll go down doing the Hollywood Waltz

[Verse 3]
Springtime and the lady is grieving
The lovers just stand there with nothing to say
They got what they wanted
They're packing and leaving
To look for another to love the same way

[Chorus]
So give her this dance
She can't be forsaken
Learn how to love her
With all of her faults
She gave more than she's taken
And I'll go down doing the Hollywood Waltz
The Hollywood Waltz

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Lemme 'splain the difference 'tween you and I
Hot in Miami but you know I keep the coolest ride
Stop like yeah ragged rockin' 

[? ]
Pullin' up on the side is a suicide
Aye, you just a run-of-the-mill nigga
Here's the difference man I run with the mills, niggas can't eat I ain't done with the meal
See dem niggas that's grinnin' man they have fun with da steel
"Pharrell, you a cool nigga. Let me shake your hand. You wear tight pants, you wear black bands, you wear long Vans, crib in the sky and
I heard you got a crib in Virginia, on the sand."
Not you, you ain't a Robb Report nigga
Nigga, yous a perjuror, you lie in court nigga
You prolly snitchhy snitchy and proly bitchy bitchy
I don't wear them big chains no mo' because they itch me
Drop my girl off, pick up the enzo
Ridin' through Hileah, ride through Kendall
Ride through Carol City, ride through Overtown
Where they leave dat ass on the ground
But you say that they know you now
But the difference is when dey see ya, will they hold ya down
See P grew up with a heroine pedal?
They made fun of me cause I was a odd fellow
See I was half skate park I was half ghetto
But you cut me open then u seen my bones made of metal
Here's my DNA yes it was essential
Unlike your aftermarket Roley Presidential
Look at my Audemars, three hundred something
Barack inspired (why?) the black one comin'

[Pre-Hook: Lil Wayne]
Pu-Pull up in that new thang all mellow

Whisper in her ear give her thigh lip chills
Young moolah yeah I know you like dat baby
And she wanna be in the mix like a white-black baby
Weezy a.k.a. which one of ya'll girls want me
High-definition tv in the front seat

Cause our money longer than the nose of da bitches?
And, and for my shows do ya know what I'm gettin'?

[Verse 1]
Met you in front of a diner and you had blue hair
You were so nice
You were from L.A. but you were all there
You were all right

[Chorus]
So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather

[Verse 2]
Met you in front of a diner and you were so sweet
Made my heart beat, oh, my, my, my, my, my
I met you with your mother and she had green shoes
She was so cool, it was fine, fine, fine, fine, fine

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You were sorting pictures and you gave me one
Of a nun who was playing the drums
She was crazy, her name was Katie
I think you're so fun

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You don't think I'm that strange, you're so weird
That's cause you're so queer
But who's not these days?
You wear purple socks and you still like Purple Haze

[Chorus - variation]
So many people think that you have it together
But they don't see you crying in the shower
Bet I can make you better
Cause you make me better
Yeah, you make me better
Yeah, you make me better
These social drugs 

[x3]

(Verse 1)
Afraid to address the reality before me
To proud to confess that I'm addicted to a lie
So I seek temporary feeling
To replace reality
Though the truth is telling me I have died

But I've been taught to numb it
Sedated, don't confront it
I hate it when I find out
That I can't get what I wanted
This emotional tantrum
Has become sort of an anthem playing every time I need to take a little trip

To hide this condemnation
I'll find a combination
Of man-made stimulation
To deny my situation
Now this unreality
Is distorting what I see
Reporting back to me
A sense of false security
So in my imagination
I must find a recreation
Desperately in search of ways
To alter my sensation
There's no equilibrium
Inebriated till I'm numb
Intoxicated until I'm dumb
To avoid confrontation

These social drugs
Messing with my mind
These social drugs
Telling me I'm fine

(Verse 2)
Now this chemical analogy
Is our emotional reality
These political, traditional
And ethnical stimulants
And social etiquette
Won't let us be too upset
With the way things really are
You're told to camouflage regret
In a religious structure
Tells us God wants us to suffer
To support a situation we all know is obligation
And if you shun the complication
They'll just gun your reputation
Like mob intimidation
To enforce participation

See they need to keep us fiends
To their lies and broken schemes
And if you find another means
You're told you're being too extreme
And if you wanted to get clean
They'll just pull those social strings
Holding up their social nose
Defying noble things

Now we're all stuck in tradition
Unable to state opposition
Too afraid to contradict
The expectations of the system
Oh and the harsh reality
Is they made grace for you and me
Instead of saving you and me
They're just enslaving you and me

These social drugs
These social drugs
These social drugs
These social drugs
Know what I mean
Know what I mean
These social drugs

These social drugs 

[7x]
Know what I mean

These social drugs
Messing with my mind
These
Telling me I'm fine
These
Messing with my head
These social drugs
Wanting me dead
Know what I mean

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I see ya, I see ya
Girl I wanna love you long like Eva
I know you want that pita
Girl I say I know you want that pita
That banana like Chiquita
I'ma hit it like Derek Jeter
The neighbor's gon' think I beat her
I'll throw that dick much deeper
Come be my wide receiver
I'll give that girl a seizure
She forget her boyfriend, amnesia
She wanna ride it, I let her have it
She better ride it like Danica Patrick
I get behind it, and move her
Like the Heimlich maneuver (OW!)

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I don't know about you (chea)
But I'm really, really fucked up (chea)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Bounce that booty like a basketball
See, I'm a ball-hog; I don't pass at all (ha-ha)
And now she wanna put her sister on
Now I got twins like "The Whisper Song"
And you could call her Mrs. Me Too
I say I'm on a strict diet, I can only eat you
Lick it lick it, lick it, lick it; I like to
Lick it lick it, lick it lick it..(ha-ha)
I got that Goose in my system
Somebody gon' be my victim
I got patrone in my system
Somebody gon' be my victim (OW!)

[Hook]
I don't know about you (chea)
But I'm really, really fucked up (chea)
No more liquor in my cup (chea)
I think it's time for us to, time for us to, time for us to fuck (let's go)

I think it's time for us to fuck (let's go)
I think it's time for us to, time for us to...

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Come free yo' mind, on this dick that I have
You ain't gotta be my wife, but you need dick in yo' life
We gon' fuck all night long, I got kush in my bag
We can blaze one, and when we done
Go back to your man
I think I'm in love (love)
Oh, love (Oh love)

[4x]

SIKE!

[Hook]
I don't know about you (chea)
But I'm really, really fucked up (chea)
No more liquor in my cup (chea)
I think it's time for us to, time for us to, time for us to fuck (let's go)
I think it's time for us to fuck (let's go)
I think it's time for us to fuck (let's go)
I think it's time for us to, time for us to...

[Verse 1]
Go, bright light, scout the forest
Through the night, searching for a
Sign of life; memories of
Fears and strife keep his legs from

Turning blue; broken bones and
Muddy shoes, running through the
Fields I knew, join the ranks of the
Favored few; what have I...

[Chorus 1]
...Become?
Before the day is
Done
Now that we have...

[Verse 2]
Got what's left, lost my rights when
I was young, taken by the
Ones I trust, long before
I knew of love, all the things
I understood, fighting for
The greater good, now tell me why
This feels so wrong, feels so wrong
To hold this gun; now look what I've

[Chorus 2]
Become
Before the day is
Done
Now that we have won...

[Bridge]
The cold wind, you notice
The sky
It blows in to show us
The sign

It falls down before us
It lies
The cold wind, you notice
My eyes

[Outro]
Yeah!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

[Intro]
Fourteenth of February, eighteen-ninety-nine
The British ship Veronica was lost without a sign
Baa baa, black sheep, you haven't any wool
Captain Richardson left himself a lonely wife in Hull

[Verse 1]
Cherub, I lost the ship in the Baltic Sea
I'm on an iceberg running free
Sitting, filing this berg to the shape of a ship
Sailing my way back to your lips
One passing ship gave word that
You have moved out of your old flat
You love the Vicar more then words can say
Tell him to pray that I won't melt away
And I'll see your face again

[Chorus]
Odessa
How strong am I?
Odessa
How time goes by

[Verse 2]
Treasure, you know the neighbors that live next door
They haven't got their dog anymore
Freezing, sailing around in the North Atlantic
Can't seem to leave the sea anymore
I just can't understand
Why you just moved to Finland
You love that Vicar more then words can say
Ask him to pray that I won't melt away
And I'll see your face again

[Chorus]
Odessa
How strong am I?
Odessa
How time goes by

[Outro]
Fourteenth of February, eighteen-ninety-nine
The British ship Veronica was lost without a sign

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Na na na na na na na na na
Paper mache and telegraph poles
Things go dead in the night
Make enough noise to make enough noise
To make you want to jump with fright
Elephant's tusks and autograph books
People you don't meet
Haven't got a bed to lay my head
Shoes to fit my feet

[Hook: Barry Gibb]
Don't be scared
You're better off then nothing
You're answering to no one
Paper mache

[Verse 1]

[Hook]

[Post-Hook]
All of a sudden it happened
When you did what you said you'd do
And you broke my heart in two
Like paper mache

[Bridge: Robin Gibb]
All of a sudden it happened, oh...
You came into my life
Like paper mache you broke my heart
Like paper mache, paper mache
Like paper mache

[Verse 1]

[Outro: Barry and Robin]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Jimmy had a bomb and the bomb went bang
Jimmy was everywhere
Jimmy had a bomb and the bomb went bang
Jimmy was everywhere
No, they're not the new Death Row



Because TDE did it completely different than Death Row did it. Death Row did it with a gangster approach. We...we were smashin on niggas, we was fuckin people up. We was..determined to be the hardest, meanest, baddest, coldest, roughest toughest in the game. That was our mission. Uhh..TDE. Rappers. They're peaceful, they love, they get down. They got rappers from everywhere and they represent hip-hop and they don't represent negativity and violence. And tryin to mash and disrespect it. So it's like, that how Death row came.. We came out disrespectin' Eazy E and anyone who had a problem with Dr. Dre.



That was our first get down. It was "fuck dem niggas up first". That's not TDE mentality. Their mentality is cool with everybody. Kendrick Lamar flipped out on everybody. That's that Death Row influence, that may have cause him to backslide and feel a certain way. Which I support fully and his thoughts in what he said...Cause I'm from the West Coast, fuck errbody who got a problem with it.



But I don't feel like TDE and Death Row are the same thing in any way. I feel like Death Row paved the way for TDE...To do it in their own way... So they can stay around 20 years from now.



Can ya dig that?

[Verse 1]
Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

[Pre-Chorus]
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young (Ya know)
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them

[Pre-Chorus]
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Outro]
If I ain't got you with me, baby
Ooh, ooh
Said nothin' in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Sexy girl on a plane
Why you crying? What's your name?
Who you running from?
Teddy bear, pink room
Fresh out of high school
Sweet like the evening sun
Mama says, "Don't you think you're special"
Daddy says, "You're my queen"
She's afraid, she's going nowhere
Locked and lost between

[Chorus]
But oh, lonely girl don't you worry, babe
How can you get by?
Lonely girl, don't you live your life
Through someone else's eyes
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Egg faced boy on a train
Why you sad? What's your name?
Who you running from?
Packed house, shared jeans
Front porch, moonbeams
He's gotta get out of this town
No more Bible, he will travel
He'll learn so much in school
Daddy drinks himself into courage
Says "Fuck you, I'm no fool"

[Chorus]
Oh, lonely boy, don't you worry, baby
How can you get by?
Lonely boy, don't you see your life
In someone else's eyes
Lonely girl, don't you worry, baby
How can you get by?
Lonely girl, don't you see your life
Through someone else's eyes

[Bridge]
Oh, dream on
Oh, dream on, dreamers
Oh, keep on dreaming
Oh

[Verse 3]
Beautiful mom, can you smile?
Can you glow? Can you sing me my favorite song?
Got fever, warm clothes are clean, kids are gone
What to do, she's a sleeping sun
She says birds fly out her window
She watches jealously
She says she's too old for new things
But mama, you've got wings

[Chorus]
Oh, lonely girl, don't you lose your dreams
In someone else's cries
Lonely girl, don't you see your life
In someone else's eyes
Lonely world, don't you find your faith
In someone else's lies
Lonely world, don't you live your life
Through someone else's eyes

[Outro]
Oh, oh, dream on
Oh, ooh, ooh, dream on, dreamers
Keep on dream on
Oh, ooh, ooh, dream on
Oh, dream on, dreamer
Oh, keep on dreamin'
Oh, keep on
Oh
Oh
home. i put my bag down. leave my shoes where they land. pull my shirt over my head. hang it on the ironing board. fall into this white nautica comforter my mom bought from marshall’s when she came in town to see me last. home is currently in beverly hills. a well executed renovation project not far from wilshire theatre. i like this place. rent’s two grand. expensive. refrigerator’s stainless. countertops are granite. living room floors are travertine. bedroom floors are hardwood. it’s a nice space. beige walls with nothing on them. but an ignorant television or two. a mural i did by hand when i was heartbroken and a completely arbitrary photo of odb in the bathroom above the toilet. my favorite piece. i got one closet and more articles of clothing than i need or wear. options are good. i’ve never been notably organized or tidy. so a large percentage of my wardrobe is usually strewn across my bed or that aforementioned ironing board. i keep my bathroom clean. kitchen too sort of. i eat out so much that the only issue i really have is perishables perishing in the icebox. oh and my fish died recently. i still haven’t emptied his tank. damn. a nice lady named mayra comes by a couple times a month and cleans up for me. it’s the best eighty dollars i spend everytime. i built out a project studio in my living room. the mess of wires is starting to become a nuisance though. i’ve probably recorded at home less times than i can count on my hands. i have made a couple beats though. beats which i’ve played for no one but frank. i’m reading three books at once. well not really. but you get it. which one i pick up at the end of my night sort of depends on my mood. i’m furthest along in the one about an african kid who moves to america after his family is killed and his country is destroyed by civil war. his story is hardly imaginable. i appreciate the relative calm in my life by the time i put it down. i used to be addicted to cnn. nowadays my tv is either off or being used as a monitor for my mac in the living room. except on sunday nights when entourage is in season. i read magazines a lot. they’re my favorite. i have no subscriptions. last time i counted i had near a thousand bucks worth of magazines stacked next to my sofa. newsstands must love me. i’m impulsive as fuck. damn. that’s bad. i’m gonna try and subscribe online somewhere or something. i’ve got a lot of music here too. lately i’ve been going to amoeba and buying oldies but goodies that i’d never heard before. i must admit those have been my most wise purchases this summer. smarter than my car note for sure. sade’s love deluxe might indirectly buy me a g550 one day. a house to park it in front of too probably. no bullshit. i’ll sleep now. maybe i won’t wake up till morning. maybe i’ll wake up shortly. either way i’ll pray. and i’ll dream.
i was raised christian. only had a few friends from different religions growing up. these days i’ve got family from agnostic to islam. my grandmother was pentecostal evangelical. she brought much of that fire and brimstone back to her household. my uncle tony said the other kids teased him and his siblings, called them “holyrollers”. so as you may or may not expect, my mother was, and still is, less than imposing when it comes to a particular system of belief. i was a practicing catholic for a short time. me and moms started going to separate churches when i was like 13. i never sang or played in the church though, unfortunately. i remember being kind of intimidated by the idea of it actually. church was the hood julliard to me. all the coldest musicians came out of there. the lady in the video…summa cum laude.

[Verse 1]
Wake up tasty treats, your quilts are incomplete
Lover, stay in bed, ambivalence your head
Distancing to breathe as this Mongrel lost his keys
Owner, set me free, so the ocean cleans my feet

[Verse 2]
Please, this can't be true?
Oh, don't be my undoing
Mother sure will cry when she sees our spark has died
Chapel on the hill, the freeway unto will
Wedding clothes all gone, my Cadillac won't run

[Verse 3]
I keep on trying
All I can be
What you wanted wasn't me

[Verse 4]
I'll never want to go out
I'll love you ever always
I'll never want to go out
I'll love you ever always
Just say you'll let me in your heart
I'll love you ever always
I'll never want to go out
I'll love you ever always

[Verse 1]
If all it means
We lost you down the stream
(Where are you?)
Underground, and wasting thirty-two
I just don't know
What the hell is wrong with you?
Take revenge on those who are doing wrong with your life
Wisely choose a victim driven to strife
I just don't know what the hell is wrong with you
With you

[(Verse 2) / Verse 1] (2x)
(So I lost the truth in my own mind
It's scheming, kills completely
All I wanted was the dream of being young inside
This light, I must belong to you)
If all it means
We lost you down the stream
(Where are you?)
Underground, and wasting thirty-two
I just don't know
What the hell is wrong with you?
Take revenge on those who are doing wrong with your life
Wisely choose a victim driven to strife
I just don't know what the hell is wrong with you
With you

[Verse 1]
What's in this for me?
Please get the funk out of my house
And stay in your own
In violent trespass, I've often wondered what to do
Nothing for you

[Refrain]
Dream aloud, and tell your friends where to go
I know you know you've wasted everything in life

[Verse 2]
What's new? Don't tell me
I know your band has gone quite far
I don't care, I don't hear
You're talking smack now
And you're getting rather old
What's left to do?

[Refrain]
Dream aloud, and tell your friends where to go
I know you know you've wasted everything in life

[Verse 1]
If love was a bird, then we wouldn't have wings
If love was a sky, we'd be blue
If love was a choir, you and I could never sing
'Cause love isn't for me and you
If love was an Oscar, you and I could never win
'Cause we can never act out our parts
If love is the Bible, then we are lost in sin
Because it's not in our hearts

[Chorus]
So why don't you go your way and I'll go mine
Live your life and I'll live mine
Baby, you'll do well and I'll be fine
'Cause we're better off separated

[Verse 2]
If love was a fire, then we have lost the spark
Love never felt so cold
If love was a light, then we're lost in the dark
Left with no one to hold
If love was a sport, we're not on the same team
You and I are destined to lose
If love was an ocean, then we are just a stream
'Cause love isn't for me and you

[Chorus]
So why don't you go your way and I'll go mine
Live your life and I'll live mine
Baby, you'll do well and I'll be fine
'Cause we're better off separated

[Bridge]
Girl, I know we had some good times
It's sad, but now we gotta say goodbye
Girl, you know I love you, I can't deny
I can't say we didn't try to make it work for you and I
I know it hurts so much, but it's best for us
Somewhere along this windy road, we lost the trust
So I'll walk away so you don't have to see me cry
It's killing me so, why don't you go?

[Chorus]
So why don't you go your way and I'll go mine
Live your life and I'll live mine
Baby, you'll do well, and I'll be fine
'Cause we're better off, so much better off
Go your way and I'll go mine
Live your life and I'll live mine
You'll do well and I'll be fine
'Cause we're better off, so much better off...

[Outro]
So much better off
Separated
I'm sorry we didn't make it

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino & Problem]
Watching haters wonder why Gambino got the game locked (Yeah?)
Half-Thai thickie, all she wanna do is Bangkok (Yeah?)
Got her hair done, French braids, now she A$AP
Bino so insensitive, she askin', "Why you say that?"

Rich kid asshole, paint me as a villain (Ma!)
Still spitting that cash flow, DJ Khaled

Hip deep in that Pepto, I got five on her like Ben Folds
I got more tail than that PetCo (What?)
You faker than some Sweet'N Low (Why?)
Yeah, you got some silverware
But really, are you eating though? (Yeah)
Are you eating though? Nigga, are you eating though?
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner's for beginners, you ain't even know

Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a piano
My architect know Japanese (Yeah?)
Your girl, she jockin' these (Yeah?)
No hands like soccer teams and y'all fuck boys like Socrates
You niggas ain't coppin' these, niggas ain't lookin' like me (Nah)
Nah, I ain't checkin' I.D. (Nah), but I bounce 'em with no problem
Tell 'em, Problem (Problem!)

[Bridge: Childish Gambino & Problem]
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (What?)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (What?)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (What?)
Rich kid, asshole, paint me as a villain

[Chorus: Childish Gambino & Problem + Problem]
What?
Don't be mad 'cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad 'cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad 'cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you
Fuck it, what you gon' do? (What?!)

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Different color, my passport
Instagram my stack load
Hashtag my daywear, and your girl drank my daycare
And I'm born rich, life ain't fair, it's silver spoon coon, ho
Ain't nobody sicker in my Fisker, “vroom-vroom,” ho
Ain't nobody—
(Fiskers don't make noise when they start up, just so you know)
Top of the holy totem
Ri-ri-ri-rich forever, a million was not the quota
My father owned half the MoMA and did it with no diploma
Year off, got no rules, trippin' off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods
And I'm too fly, Jeff Goldblum
Got a glasshouse in the Palisades, that A-K-A
White hood, white hood, O-K-K-K
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
Show Maserati, you whippin' a Kia
Spendin' this money, it's longer than Nia
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia
Wakin' up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dopeman, help a nigga re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her
"Err-eh-err-eh," onomatopoeia
Ohh, I got my cool on (Tailor-made)
I'm winnin', so they had to dump the Gatorade
And I don't give a fuck about my family name

[Chorus: Childish Gambino & Problem & Problem]
What?
Don't be mad 'cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad 'cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad 'cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you
Fuck it, what you gon' do? (What?!)

[Intro]
Come here
I don't know what happened

[Verse 1]
Where did they go?
Nights like this don’t happen anymore
I need to know
Is it me and did I lose control? (Slow it down)

[Pre-Chorus]
Lonely overseas, only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go, baby, they don’t know
What we had before, but it fell before our eyes

[Chorus]
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

[Verse 2]
It's been difficult
I'm just happy there's no flights no more
But it's nights like this that I never ever missed you more
There's a reason what this happened for, yeah (But I can't help but feel like)

[Pre-Chorus]
Lonely overseas, only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go, baby, they don’t know
What we had before, but it fell before our eyes

[Chorus]
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

[Bridge]
Bounce

[Pre-Chorus]
Lonely overseas, only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go, baby, they don’t know
What we had before, but it fell before our eyes

[Chorus]
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

[Intro]
Where are you? I love you
Where are you? I love you
Where are you to keep me warm?

[Verse 1]
I had a dream of a place far away
I followed a river where the dead man would play
And I'm leaving in the morning
And I'm leaving in the morning

[Chorus 1]
And I won't die, so don't cry, I'll be home
Those big black diamonds that lie there for me
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea

[Verse 2]
I knew a man, who was tall as the sky
Followed a river where thousands had died
And he was leaving in the morning
Oh no, he was leaving in the morning

[Chorus 2]
Said, if I come home and my woman has flown
Oh, big black diamonds that lie there for me
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Say goodbye to auld lang syne
Say goodbye to auld lang syne
Say goodbye to auld lang syne

[Verse 1]
Watching every day go by, living in a foolish game
Just the way I feel today living my life without you
Never hear a single word, living in a lullaby
Praying every tear I cry living my life without you

[Bridge]
And everywhere you go I fly
(I love you with a special feeling)
And darling till the day I die
(Baby never stop believing)

[Chorus]
I'll be reaching out, I'll be reaching out
Reaching out
(There's a woman goin' through me)
I'll be reaching out
(Got a chance to hold you to me )
Everything is lonely and I need you
Living my life forever, forever

[Verse 2]
Watching every day go by living on the one I love
What I got is not enough living my life without you

[Bridge]
And I believe in yesterday
(Yesterday was once tomorrow)
With love, with love wide open every way
(Baby you're the light I follow)

[Chorus]
I'll be reaching out, I'll be reaching out
Reaching out
(There's a woman going through me)
I'll be reaching out
(Got a chance to hold you to me)
Everything is lonely and I need you
Living my life forever
I'll be reaching out I'll be reaching out
Reaching out I'll be reaching out
Living my life forever

[Outro]
Reaching out, I'll be reaching out
Reaching out, I'll be reaching out
Reaching out, I'll be reaching out

[Intro]
Now that's real simple
(Pancho, beat that up, man)
If you off that, it means you don't mess with it
(Psyche)
But if you love that
(Afrojack)
That means you mess with it
Let me tell you what I mess with

[Verse 1]
Skateboarding, I'm off that
Label execs, I'm off that
A&Rs, I'm off that
But DJs, I love that
Popping bottles, I'm off that
VIP, I'm off that
Making it rain, I'm off that
But DJs, I love that

[Chorus 1]
I'm off that, but I love that
I'm off that, but I love that
I'm off that, but I love that
I'm off that, but I love that
I'm off that, but I love that
I'm off that, but I love that
I'm off that, but I love that
I'm off that, but I love that

[Verse 2]
Being broke, I'm off that
Hanging on the block, I'm off that
Weak bass blow, I'm off that
Stop car go, I'm off that
Ducking dt's I'm off that
BTs, BTs
Pink Pony, scarlets
Tootsies, I love that
Studio gangsters, I'm off that
Internet gangsters, I'm off that
Young fuck, you can't trust
That never bust, I'm off that
Bad bitches, I love that
Bobo heels, I'm off that
Her hair a mess, toes a mess
Nails a mess, I'm off that
She kiss n' tell, I'm off that
She Instagram, I'm off that
She bring her friends, I'm about that
The more the merrier, I love that

Why ain't we living, living together
Instead of being so so far apart
Why ain't we living, living' together
Instead of being so, so far apart
Why ain't we living' together, living together
Instead of being alone
Why ain't we living together, living together
Instead of being alone

[Verse 1: Robin Gibb]
I lay my heart on you and you can show the way
I give my everlasting love until my dying day
Take this lonely soul, the water or the wine
A chance to make you mine, I lay my body on the line

[Hook: Barry Gibb]
Why ain't we living, living together
Instead of being so so far apart
Why ain't we living, living' together
Instead of being so, so far apart
Why ain't we living' together, living together
Instead of being alone
Why ain't we living together, living together
Instead of being alone

[Verse 2: Robin Gibb]
My life was emptiness until you came along
I nearly fell apart, you took my heart and made me strong
And I need all of you to get me through the night
A chance to see the light, I lay my body on the line

[Hook: Barry Gibb] x3
Why ain't we living, living together

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
If you're happy and marching forward in your band
Holding hands together, I will understand
In my life I'm together on my own
With my own private eggshell and my phone

[Pre-Hook: Robin Gibb]
If your mind is in the darkness, could you know
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow?
Will you show me someone who may treat me kind
Or is this world I live in just a frame of mind?

[Hook: Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb]
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home
If you're living in Chicago, you're alone

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
If you're happy living down on the ground
Where the crippled and the blind alone can see
I got a feeling God is still around
And if I'm right, there must be more then this to see

[Pre-Hook: Robin Gibb]

[Verse 3: Barry Gibb]
And as soon as you discover where you're goin'
Can I walk along the way, along the way?
I'm lonesome and I need somebody knowin'
Just a few nice words to get me through the day

[Pre-Hook 2: Robin Gibb]
If your mind is in the darkness, could you know
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow?
Will you show me someone who may treat me kind
Or is this world I live in just a frame of mind?

[Hook: Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb]x2

[Outro: Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb]
If you're living in Chicago, you're alone
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Ooh, you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live

[Chorus]
Oh, you're the best friend that I ever had
Been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine
And I want you to know
That my feelings are true
I really love you
(Ooh) Oh, you're my best friend

[Verse 2]
Ooh, you make me live
Ooh, I've been wandering 'round ('Round)
But still come back to you
(Ooh, still come back to you)
In rain or shine, you've stood by me girl (Girl)
I'm happy at home
(I'm happy, happy at home)
You're my best friend

Ooh, you make me live
Whenever this world is cruel to me

Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live

When things turn out bad
You know I'll never be lonely
You're my only one
And I love the things

[Bridge]
Ooh, you make me live
(Live, live, live)
I'm happy at home
You're my best friend

Ooh, you're my best friend

[Verse 1]
There were the trees, see the grass, a Pinkerton spy
Said "This is the place I will try," and he did
Stood in the dark, sat a man who beckoned him in
But leaving his grass was a sin, but he did

[Hook]
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home
He saw the light in the cellar reflect in his eyes
Yet early that morning was he to receive a surprise


Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home

[Verse 2]
Said "Are you leaving or are you receiving my friend
Doest need any money till then" and he did
He said "I'm the owner,not you, and this is my stead
So give it to me now I'm dead, and he did , said:
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home

[Verse 1]
I walk the lonely streets
I watch the people passing by
I used to smile and say hello
Guess I was just a happy guy
Then you happened, girl
This feeling that possesses me
I just can't move myself
I guess it all just had to be

[Chorus]
I can't see nobody...no
I can't see nobody
My eyes can only look at you...you

[Verse 2]
I used to have a brain
I used to think of many things
I watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing
Don't ask me why, little girl
I love you and that's all I can say
You're every, every breath I take
You are my nights; my night and day

[Chorus]

Every single word you hear
Is coming from this heart of mine
I never felt like this before
A love like yours so young and fine
And now as I try to forget you
It doesn't work out any way
I loved you such a long time ago
But in my eyes you'll always be
Every single word you hear
Is coming from this heart of mine
I loved you such a long time ago
Don't know why
And I don't know why
Baby...

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 1: Robin Gibb]
Look at me I'm riding high
Don't know what's wrong with me
Can't you see I'm not the guy
That I pretend to be

[Hook: Robin Gibb]
Though I know I will be lonely
But our love will never die
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes
Ah......

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
The more I try the more I fail
I'd like to run away
But if I try you pass me by
I know that I can't stay

[Hook: Robin Gibb] x2

[Outro: Barry Gibb]
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

[Intro: Robin Gibb]
Many years have passed, it seems
And now I am all alone
I've sent the children far away
To some obscure unknown

It's so sad, so sad

[Chorus: Barry Gibb]
Close another door
Listen to my eyes
Close another door
You're much too old to work
So won't you run away?

[Post-Chorus: Robin Gibb]
When I was young, I used to say
That age won't bother me
The life I had was very sad
It all went out to sea
So so sad, so sad

[Chorus: Barry Gibb]

[Post Chorus 2: Robin Gibb]
And though the sun is in outside
The rain is in my hair
Now all my life is lived inside
My home is there in my chair

So so sad, so sad

[Chorus: Barry Gibb]

[Outro: Robin Gibb]
Let me go, send me flowers
And put me on a plane
I've paid before
So I've been told at least I'm still alive
Fly me young, fly 

[?]
And get me up
I been working so, so very hard
At being young but now I'm out of time
I'm out, take me home mama
Said I'm worth it, worth it, worth it
I survive

[Hook]
Now, I found that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday

[Verse 1]
Living tomorrow, where in the world will I be tomorrow?
How far am I able to see?
Or am I needed here?

[Hook]
Now, I have found that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday

[Verse 2]
If I remember all of the things I have done
I'd remember all of the times I've gone wrong
Why do they keep me here?

[Outro]
Now, I have found that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday
Now, I have found that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday
Now, I have found that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday
And now, I've found that the world is round
Excuses are the tools of the weak and incompetent. They build bridges to nowhere and tunnels to nothingness…. Those who excel in them seldom do in anything else, therefore there are no excuses.
living. it’s a plain difference from dead. seen a dead body this afternoon. the people who felt they had that body in their lives, have to let it go. the memories of the life that used that body are just as finite as the bodies of those who remember him. the woman or man that enjoyed that mans body, will only have the thin almost holographic recollections for as long as they live. then again, who knows how long we live, and if life goes on after these heartbeats stop. who knows where life went when it left that body. who knows if it went anywhere, not you. matters of faith, are matters of faith and faith is not knowing. what i know is that when i see a body without life, i feel sort of childish. a kid in a big complicated existence. a game with no rules and no point of winning other than for the sport of it. like the things i know and have learned mean nothing really. a feeling of confusion about the point. a bone chilling awareness of my mortality. still i wanna live. live and bring other lives into this world to live and die as well. some would say we are one consciousness divided. i would say we’ll find out. but we do not know that. eh. life. where’s my fuckin lighter.

[Verse 1]
My mind is open wide
I'm on the other side
Though you remember my name
And if you go away
I'll get it off somehow
I'll leave it all in the air, no, no

[Chorus]
Turn me down, turn me down
Turn me down, oh, how I've tried
Really and sincerely I've tried

[Verse 2]
There is a song
I hear it all around
But I don't hear a sound
If you were with me now
I'd let you know my mind
Love is so easy to lose, no, no

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Turn me down
Turn me down
Turn me down
Turn me down

[Verse 1]
I do not need you
Nor do I listen to the words you say
Strongly I heed you
But every promise seems to fade away

[Bridge]
Who is the clown
That walks in the steps of my shadow?
Is it the man
Who does what he can but never does it right?

[Chorus]
How can I prove?
There is no reasoning or asking why
Only to prove
I love you deeply with the sun in my eyes

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I love you deeply with the sun in my eyes
I love you deeply with the sun in my eyes

[Verse 1]
Feel I'm going back
To Massachusetts
Something's telling me
I must go home

[Chorus]
And the lights all went out down in Massachusetts
The day I left
Her standing on her own

[Verse 2]
Tried to hitch a ride
To San Francisco
Gotta do the things
I wanna do

[Chorus 2]
And the lights all went down in Massachusetts
They brought me back
To see my way with you

[Verse 3]
Talk about the life
In Massachusetts
Speak about the people
I have seen

[Chorus 3]
And the lights all went down in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts
Is one place I have seen

[Outro]
(I will remember Massachusetts)
I will remember Massachusetts
(I will remember Massachusetts)
I will remember Massachusetts
(I will remember Massachusetts)
I will remember Massachusetts

[Verse 1: Robin Gibb]
If my life gets like a jig saw
With the pieces out of place

[Hook: Robin Gibb and Barry Gibb]
Come on over
Put a smile back on my face

[Verse 2: Robin Gibb]
And if all my bad days came at once
You would know just what to do

[Hook 2: Robin Gibb and Barry Gibb]
Come on over
Baby, you will see me through

[Verse 3: Robin Gibb]
And if you think I need you
Come on over

[Verse 4: Barry Gibb]
Bring your love around
You can dry away my tears

[Hook 3: Robin Gibb and Barry Gibb]
And if you think I need you
Come on over

[Post-Hook: Barry Gibb]
Lay your body down
You know I will be here
So bring your love around

[Verse 5: Robin Gibb]
When I cannot see in front of me
And I know my darkest day

[Hook 4: Robin and Barry]
Come on over
You can take it all away
And if you think I need you
Come on over

[Post-Hook 2: Barry Gibb]
Bring your love around
You can wipe away my tears

[Hook 5: Robin and Barry]
And if you think I need you
Come on over

[Post-Hook]

Come on over
This night won't end in time for me to see in you a warning
So close down and find your heart in the pit of your existence
You will see sense at some point

Nothings in your mind
In this space in time
So you took a ride
Now we meet inside

It's been showing me up
I've been loosing my touch
They aren't that far from here
Find the last piece is broken
It's what we need to be awoken
And our whole worlds been stolen
And our whole faith is swollen
And I probably need to hold on
So stop and think and stroll along
There was a time and place

That was alive in faith
But just as time to pray is to eliminate the afraid to participate in a play
Well I guess I stayed too long
Well I guess I stayed too long

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
We must have lost the road
Don't you think it's getting late
Maybe if it's colder
We can stop and wait

[Verse 2: Robin Gibb]
We must have lost the words
All the little things we said
And now the world is frozen
Only you in my head

[Hook: Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb]
Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road

[Verse 3: Robin Gibb]
We must have lost the tune
Where did I step out of line
I'll search for the melody
That calls you mine

[Hook]

[Outro]
Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road

[Verse 1]
Send out your invitations
There's gonna be a party going on
We'll meet you at the station
You know the race has just begun

[Chorus]
If you don't think that I was born to hold you
Then I'm gonna tell ya loud and clear, 'Baby, I love ya'
Every second
Every minute
Every hour
Every day
Of every year

[Bridge]
Now, we're gonna climb a mountain
No one is gonna stop me now
My love is like a fountain
I'll take your hand and show you how

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day of every year
Every second, every minute, every second, every minute
Every second, every minute

[Verse 1]
There was a time I was one of a kind
Lost in the world, doubting me, myself and I
Was lonely then
Like an alien
I tried, but I never figured it out
Why I always felt like a stranger in a crowd
Oh, that was then
Like an alien

[Chorus]
But the stars in the sky
Look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
And we're not alone, not alone, not alone
You're not alone, not alone, not alone

[Verse 2]
Crossed through the universe to get where you are
Travelled the night, riding on a shooting star
Was lonely then
Like an alien
Had to get used to the world I was on
While yet still unsure if I knew where I belonged
Oh, that was then
Like an alien

[Chorus]
But the stars in the sky
Look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
And we're not alone, not alone, not alone
You're not alone, not alone, not alone

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
But the stars in the sky
Look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
And we're not alone, not alone, not alone
You're not alone, not alone, not alone

[Outro]
(Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone)

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
I've been thinking, just sitting thinking
On why I love you and all the reasons
And if I lost you, boy, if I lost you
I'd lose myself, and I wouldn't feel the way I feel now
You bring me zen, yes, you bring me zen
And you make me feel like a million billion
I'll let you in, but don't you break my heart
Don't you rip me apart, oh, don't you rip me apart

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Baby love, it should be easy
It shouldn't be complicated
It should be easy
I don't know how else to say it, say it, say it, say it

[Drop: will.i.am]
I don't know how to say it

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
I've got visions, boy, I've got visions
Of me and you happily just livin'
I know they're out there, them beautiful men
But you my future, baby, you my right now
If there was a scale from one to ten
My love for you is a million billion
Boy, I'll love you 'til the day I'm dead
So please don't mess with my head, please don't mess with my head

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Baby love, it should be easy
It shouldn't be complicated
It should be easy
I don't know how else to say it, say it, say it, say it

[Drop: will.i.am]
I don't know how to say it

[Bridge: Britney]
La-di-dee, la-di-da
It's the only way you love
La-di-dee, la-di-da
It's the only way you love
(I don't know how)

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Baby love, it should be easy
It shouldn't be complicated
It should be easy
I don't know how else to say it

[Outro: will.i.am]
La-di-dee, la-di-da
It's the only way you love
La-di-dee, la-di-da
I don't know how to say it

[Verse 1]
If they told me it's over, I wouldn't believe it
Because you know we both care
But we gotta get over, over the mountain
We can't keep standing, standing there
Let's move on and be stronger
Even though we can't go let go
Can't hold on, when love's broken

[Chorus]
This is going to be our last goodbye
Our love is gone, but I'll survive
Hide my tears and dry my eyes
You don't need to see me cry
Pack my bags, can't take no more
Adios, I'm out the door
Hide your tears and dry your eyes
'Cause I don't want to see you cry

[Post-Chorus]
Don't cry, don't cry, cry, cry
Don't cry, cry, don't cry
Don't cry, cry, cry

[Verse 2]
In the beginning, we were both crazy
We were crazy in love
Now that it's ending, we are just crazy
Because we love with no trust
Can't go on any longer
Babe, we gotta let it go
Move on, can't hold on, when love's broken

[Chorus]
This is going to be our last goodbye
Our love is gone, but I'll survive
Hide my tears and dry my eyes
You don't need to see me cry
Pack my bags, can't take no more
Adios, I'm out the door
Hide your tears and dry your eyes
'Cause I don't want to see you cry
This is going to be our last goodbye
Our love is gone, but I'll survive
Hide my tears and dry my eyes
You don't need to see me cry
Pack my bags, can't take no more
Adios, I'm out the door
Hide your tears and dry your eyes
'Cause I don't want to see you cry

[Post-Chorus]
Don't cry, don't cry, cry, cry
Don't cry, cry, don't cry
Don't cry, cry, cry

[Intro: Myah Marie]
You, you, you

[Verse 1: Myah Marie]
I laughed so much that I cried
I danced so much 'til I was tired
I drank some red wine
And now I'm walking on the sky
I had the time of my life
And you know

[Pre-Chorus: Myah Marie]
And you know I, I'm feelin' alright
'Cause I don't got to worry about a thing
And you know I, I'm feelin' alright
'Cause I don't got to worry about a thing

[Chorus: Myah Marie]
When I'm with you, I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
When I'm with you, I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
When I'm with you, I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
I'm chill

[Verse 2: Jamie Lynn]
I sang so loud that I smiled
I made it worth my while
I drank some white wine
Now I'm walking on the sky
I had the time of my life

[Pre-Chorus: Myah Marie & Jamie Lynn]
And you know I, I'm feelin' alright
'Cause I don't got to worry about a thing
And you know I, I'm feelin' alright
'Cause I don't got to worry about a thing

[Chorus: Myah Marie & Jamie Lynn]
When I'm with you, I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
When I'm with you, I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
When I'm with you, I'm chillin', I'm chillin'
I'm chill

[Bridge: Jamie Lynn & Myah Marie]
Every day, every day, every day
Chillin' with you
Every day, every day, every day
Chillin' with you

I'm chillin' with you, I'm chillin' with you
I'm chillin' with you, I'm chillin' with you
I'm chillin' with you, I'm chillin' with you

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
You got sex siren in your face
Let me get up on it, let me get up on it, let me get up on it
Talk dirty to me, babe, every time I want it
Every time I want it, every time I want it, every time I want it

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
Baby, make me tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, boom

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Turn it
Come here for a minute, let me taste you, baby
Light your fuel detonate you, baby
Got my brain have you going insane
My dynamite stick known to drive shit crazy, baby
I want you laying up in the bed with your feet up
Right there in my wife beater
She like the way I eat her, beat her, beat her
Treat her like an animal somebody call PETA
Put a little bit of this inside a margarita
Then put your thing have you running like a meter
On a cab in the city, where the girls are pretty
Find me in the club, where the girls get busy
With a flat stomach, fat booty, nice shaped titties
My wrist so froze you could ice skate with it
Give it to you til you curl your toes
Get your ass out your clothes, sit back and behold the explosion

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
Baby, make me tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, boom
Tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik
Baby, make me tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, boom
Not too slow, not too quick
Baby, make me tik, tik boom
Tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik boom
Tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik
Baby, make me tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, boom
Not too slow, not too quick
Baby, make me tik, tik boom

[Verse 1]
I can't let go of control
I can't let go and not know
Don't know the way ahead of me
One day at a time is all I need
There was a time without trust
There was a time without love
But it took you to show me
I could hand over the keys

[Chorus]
I'll let you lead the way now
'Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map, without a map, without a map

[Verse 2]
So, let's take a walk and get lost
Let's take a chance on finding us
I wanna see the world with you
Every step feels so brand new
It's hard to jump with no net
But I've jumped in, got no regret
My co-pilot, yeah that’s right
Now, I can just enjoy the ride

[Chorus]
I'll let you lead the way now
'Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map, without a map, without a map (Life is beautiful)

[Bridge]
And now we're finally falling
'Cause I was giving you half now I'm all in
My hand's in the air while you're driving
This is living, this is living, this is living, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll let you lead the way now
'Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map, without a map, without a map

[Chorus]
I wanna dance 'til my body ache
A little bit longer
Turn you on, make you radiate a little bit stronger
I wanna dance 'til my body ache
Show you how I want ya, show you how I want ya
Show you how I want ya, show you how I want ya
'Til my body ache

[Verse 1]
On a whole 'nother level
You got a one way ticket
I got you out on the curb
You wanna kick it, kick it
Start up a riot, riot
We going downtown
I'm all up on ya, on ya
You want it don't ya, don't ya?

[Chorus]
I wanna dance 'til my body ache
A little bit longer
Turn you on, make you radiate a little bit stronger
I wanna dance 'til my body ache
Show you how I want ya, show you how I want ya
Show you how I want ya, show you how I want ya
'Til my body ache

[Verse 2]
I know you feel my fire
Draw you into my flame
Tonight we take it higher
What I got ain't no game
Won't stop 'til you breathe heavy
There won't be no turning back
I'm all up on ya, on ya
You want it don't ya, don't ya?

[Bridge]
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache
You make my body ache

[Chorus]
I wanna dance 'til my body ache
A little bit longer
Turn you on, make you radiate a little bit stronger
I wanna dance 'til my body ache
Show you how I want ya, show you how I want ya
Show you how I want ya, show you how I want ya
'Til my body ache
'Til my body ache

[Verse 1]
I'm blind from the tears that fall like rain
So lost, ever since you went away
Sometimes our lives forever change
My heart's never gonna be the same

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you came and you gave me a place
Place to lay all my pain
Why'd you take it away?

[Chorus]
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never, you never, you never, you never
You never know what you got 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
'Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone

[Verse 2]
I try every night, to turn the page
But daylight can't confine me to a cage
In my mind, the life we had replays
Now everywhere, I turn I see your face

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you came and you gave me a place
Place to lay all my pain
Why'd you take it away?

[Chorus]
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never, you never, you never, you never
You never know what you got til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's, 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone

[Bridge]
All the memories, I'm saving
So your love is never fading
Holding on my heart is breaking
Can't let go

[Chorus]
You never know what you got 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's, 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's, 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's
Got 'til it's, got 'til it's, got 'til it's gone
Verse 1 

[J.ReaL Hip Hop]

Something about this morning got me up high/
Like I'm up 3 stories floating & I'm not falling out the sky...I...might...just/
Take a walk around the clouds, jump down, then say "Hi!"/
How are you? Can I just say that I feel like I feel off of the bedroom's right side...Um...I/
Don't know what it is, or just what I did to get me on this level/
But I like it! I'm so excited! I might need to settle down a bit/
Nah, don't think that's happening captain! Put this down, I can't dream it! Beaming!/
Shining down, all around this town, I hope that you're seeing this! Greetings!/
And I open with season's greetings! Oh, oh, I'm pleased to meet cha'!/
Hopeful & peaceful feelings! Swinging so low, I'm reaching ceilings!/
And I'm solo, but we just chilling! Roll slow & keep it wheeling!/
We lending them some time, to keep it kosher & keep it le-git!/
Don't know if I need a reason, but I fo' sho believe I'm winning!/
And my whole home got season tickets, seen me get it, keep the vision/
Green & lemon, pink & lime & gold & silver, opal, yellow/
Focused! Peeling back the colors of my mind & throw em' here/
And there! And anywhere that I care to do it! I'ma share the love!/
Give it up! Live it up! Living lush & wonderous!/
Wondering what's next, but no matter what it is, I'mma be on that job!/
Cause I'm down for a minute, and I'm really gonna feel it the minute I get inside of that vibe! Nah!/
Put me up in that ride! Riiight! Turn me up on that dial! I'll...!/
Put you on to my style! While, you hook me up with your wildside!/
Blasting out that sound! Now, jump around in that crowd! Oww!/
Showin' up & show out! Get a little bit hype then bounce around, bow!/
So what you wanna do now? It's always looking up, whenever we get down!/
Watch me feet then watch my smile! Keep that head up, ain't no frowns!/
There's shadows or black clouds! No bad news around for miles!/
If you see some take em' out, on a date & meet the Mom!/
Ahh! I feel so the bomb! Blowing up, right on time!/
And the stuff I pack inside, probably make you lose your mind!/
And the new one you will find, hopefully, is just like mine!/
That's a whole different kind! Enjoying bliss & being kind! My!/
Hope that no one minds I remixed this instrumental/
And I grabbed my pens & pencils and went mental just to give you something/
That can make you giggle, dance & jump & skip when you feel crappy!/
In conclusion, I'm J.ReaL & God is good! Feel happy!/
Blue Monkey./

[Bridge x2]
Bring me down
Can’t nothing bring me down
Your love is too high to bring me down
Can’t nothing bring me down
I said...

[Hook x2]
Because I’m happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I’m happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I’m happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I’m happy
Clap along if you feel like that’s what you wanna do

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
If ever you got rain in your heart
Someone has hurt you, and torn you apart
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
And let it be like they said it could be
Me loving you girl, and you loving me
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

[Chorus: Robin Gibb and Barry Gibb]
Run to me whenever you're lonely. (to love me)
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then, you need someone older
So darling, you run to me

[Verse 3: Barry Gibb]
And when you're out in the cold
No one beside you, and no one to hold
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

[Verse 4: Barry Gibb]
And when you've got nothing to lose
Nothing to pay for, nothing to choose
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I've never been alone
And I've only seen the sky
Still I know the reason why
I've been thinking it over

[Verse 2]
I've never climbed a tree
But that's natural for me
And you don't know my name
So I'm thinking it over

[Chorus]
And every day I'm learning
The things that are concerning you and I
And if you were beside me
You'd know what's inside me so tell me why
Give me inspiration to clear the situation we've known too long
And if we end up crying then one of us is lying so tell me -

[Verse 3]
Never rode a plane
And I never will again
So 'til then I'll drink the rain
While I'm thinking it over

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I kick a funky friendly conversation that keep they mind racin'
You can't complain about the flow I got
I let my thoughts space out with the astronauts
Like the white boys say, "Pass the pot"

Let me smoke for a minute...

As god as my witness, I never abuse this hip hop
I'll never pretend to be something I'm not
Giving you something to rock to other than hardcore rap, possible
You ever been under hypnosis I mean literally
Not being focused with your eyes open
They say 90% of humans don't even notice
Now can you imagine a couple of minutes passing without you knowing what happened
Without you knowing people was laughing at you
They say the worse scenario is when they have to catch you
You wake up out of your mind, your whole thoughts is baffled
You're doing things like trying to touch your shadow
Now here's some realistic, is it something that can happen or is it just a gimmick
You never know until your bear witness
Bear witness...
Bear witness...

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You woke up in the morning, took a shower
Call some bitches over, want them to be over in one hour
She came over, you fucked
She left and you hopped in the truck, you
Took your shirt off cause outside was burning up, you
Skirted off turned your beat up but your gun was tucked
Under the seat, you headed to Long Beach
Hop on the 710 the carpool lane
Only cause you got black tint and they can't see a thing
Your check engine light popped up, its feeling like bad luck or what not
You tried to maneuver all the way to the call box
But one lane before you got there your car stopped

Stop

If your was listening for the past two minutes
Then you just made accurate 90% hypnosis

[Verse 1]
Maybe you talk too high, man
Maybe I talk too slow
But you've got to live a little bit faster
Cause you've got a little less time to go

[Verse 2]
I ain't lost and I ain't searching
But then you know me very well
And I can't change the wind and make it blow the other way
I'm a fool and I can tell

[Bridge]
That I'm alive and that's all
That I can get up just as fast as I fall
And I can walk and run but I'll never crawl
And in the end it doesn't matter at all

[Chorus]
I don't know about the people that I read about in books
And the Kings and Queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks
I know I should be going somewhere, I just can't arrive
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive, alive

[Verse 2]

[Bridge]

[Chorus 2]
I don't know about those people that I read about in books
And the Kings and Queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks
I know I should be going somewhere, I just can't arrive
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive
I know I should be going somewhere I just can't arrive
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive, alive, alive

[Hook]
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know

[Verse 1]
Last night was the worst night
Beginning of the end
Or maybe it began before and here we go again
Things got so dramatic
Things got out of hand
We said words we couldn't imagine
I don't understand, oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There you go with the same old thing
When things go wrong, oh, you always seem to blame me
Now I would like to find what secrets hide in your mind
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know?
Heaven only knows

[Hook]
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know

[Verse 2]
Make this night the best night
It's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we can start to dance
Sometimes when we're talking
Words get drowned out by the sound
Let's get back to touching and we'll get back on solid ground

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let's hold hands
Like the young romance
Let's first kiss like the moment we first did
Can we make love like way back in the day, love?
We can lose control, baby don't say no
Heaven only knows

[Hook]
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know

[Bridge]
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Make this night the best night
It's time for a second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we could start to dance

[Hook]
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
alrite. alrite. let’s get this out in the open. the only songs that i, myself, frank ocean, have ever released are…’pyrite’, ‘acura integurl’ & of course the songs included on ‘nostalgia, ultra’. all other songs are on the internet as a result of record industry email hacks/leaks that happened some years back. several of these songs i had no hand in writing. i only laid reference vox on em because i was being paid. the rest are incomplete ideas, reference songs that were sent out for placement on other artists. records that were never intended to represent me. notwithstanding, i am a chill bro. as well as a sage/zen master in training. so im not angry or anything. i just had to let it at least be known. enjoy.
currently on a long ass plane ride. going through my own little existential crisis. i wish i could talk to you all as friends. & im tempted, but the truth is you’re a mixed crowd. so i’ll spare the details… for now. unfortunately this emo shit is running concurrently with the most progressive weeks of my career so far. i’d like to enjoy the success more. but.. i am experiencing success. which is more than many could ever say. i don’t have any noteworthy or overwhelming gripes about this business. i may call certain people/institutions out for their bullshit from time to time. but the way i see it i make a decent living doing exactly what the fuck i want. how could i not be grateful? besides, i’m not famous. maybe a little popular. i do think social networks can make you feel a little bit more poppin than you actually are though. hahaha. anyhow, im gonna get a dog soon. i know it might not make sense.. i mean i’ll be/have been traveling a lot more frequently than i’m used to. but the companionship just might keep me off the proverbial ‘ledge’. what do you think of this guy?

[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, oh baby
I know I've been gone
I know it's been so long
And girl I hope you missed me
Cause you know I've been missing ya baby, missing my baby
Yeah we talk on the phone everyday
But that just don't do it for me
I need you around me
I can't do without you
Shawty, my plane just now touched down
I'mma send a car to come get you from your house
So be ready in a hour
Just be ready

[Hook]
We only got one night
The suns gone be setting in a while
(Be ready, be ready)
We still got moonlight
I'm down for whatever right now
(Be ready, be ready)
Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
Sweet love, we'll be making, oh
Just tell me
(You ready, ready?)

[Verse 2]
Open up the door
Girl you got me throwed off
Cause whenever you kiss me, girl
Can you feel my heart beatin', oh
Look into your eyes, pretty waves of brown
If you only knew what I'm thinking about
But now you're right here, oh
And now it's so real
Shorty my plane leaves at nine A.M tomorrow
But between then and now we can go far
Oh

[Hook]
We only got one night
The suns gone be setting in a while
(Be ready, be ready)
We still got moonlight
I'm down for whatever right now
(Be ready, be ready)
Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
Sweet love, we'll be making, oh
Just tell me

[Bridge]
Ayo, we got one
Yo, we got one
Yo, we got one, ayo
Oh baby, I'mma take it slow
I don't wanna let you go, never let go
Oh, I know you been patient
Been waiting for this moment
Right here, right now

[Hook]
We only got one night
The suns gone be setting in a while
(Be ready, be ready)
We still got moonlight
I'm down for whatever right now
(Be ready, be ready)
Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
Sweet love, we'll be making, oh
Just tell me
(You ready, ready?)

I wanted to take white trash t-shirts and make it a video. I wanted to make it as phony as possible. I wanted to show you that this is the type of imagery that has been presented to us for years, and the only difference is a black man in the middle.
DMX:
Uhh, uhh

If Im lookin for somethin its probably a fight
If Im goin fuck bitches then they better be tight
If thats dead, then the head better be right
If I gots to play ima play til I win
Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty can't stand shorty friend
Cause honey friend fuck many many men
Stay wit the rats cause the rats is real
Wanna fuck, then we fuck, already know the deal
Shit, fuck what you look like, just show the real
And I keep A spot that we can go to chill
I love my, get down for the hoes
Only reason I come around is for the hoes
Pipework - I lay it down for the hoes
Hit em off with that dark brown, you know?

2Pac:
Watch me clown
Give me loving when I'm high
I'ma outlaw baby I'll be thugging 'till I die
In drop-top double r
Life as a rap star
Hustle like a crack fiend
'Till they catch me
Go ask somebody to your show
Watch them niggas out the sight of mah night scope
Cooking white dope
Got mah nigga 25 to life stretched out
Trying to have all the better things in life
Well Makaveli
A born leader 10 millimeter
Changing niggas future like a schizophrenic palm reader
Heeds from out the bible I read
See the meek shall inherit the earth
And the strong will lead
Hittin' weed like it alright
I'm in the studio
Making music all night
My enemies cry whenever I rise
They hated 'till death
Try to beat me out my last breath
What cha gonna do?
DMX:
Uhh, uhh
What you niggas want? cause I got it right here
Yall niggas front, then I hit you right there
Not really impressed by what niggas wear
Faggots talk shit but I really dont care
Im the type of nigga thatll die for the cause
Fuck what you heard, I will die for my dogs
Ain't scared of shit - will ride in the fog
Same thing but a bigger size than yours
I fuck with drag-on, cause he spits the flame
Drag-on motherfucker dont forget the name
And we all takin over ain't shit the same
If you ain't out that mob nigga quit the game

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
He made electric lights to read
He gave us light today
He gave us cylinders to please
When Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay

[Verse 2: Robin Gibb]
Edison set the world on fire
He really made their day
Station to station, many wires
Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay

[Chorus: Barry Gibb]
Oh, how, look at us now
We've still got a lot to learn
But it's someone else's turn
Edison's here to stay
Edison's here to stay

[Verse 3: Robin Gibb]
All of the world can taste his glory
All of the people say
"You be the man to write his story"
Edison's here to stay
Edison's here to stay

[Chorus: Barry Gibb]
Oh, how, look at us now
We've still got a lot to learn
But it's someone else's turn
Edison's here to stay
Edison's here to stay

[Verse 4: Barry and Robin]
He made electric lights to read
He gave us light today
He gave us cylinders to please
When Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay

[Interlude: Robin Gibb]
You be the man to write his story
Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay

[Outro: Robin and Barry]
All of the world can hear his story
Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay

[Verse 1]
Every single word has been spoken
It's much too late to change your ways
Far too many vows have been broken
You can't expect a soul to stay

[Hook]
You think that you can stand and lie
It makes me laugh, you got no friends
It took a thousand years to find out why
You'll never see my face again

[Verse 2]
You know that you've been left before this night
It's come my turn to make it over
I wish that every thing was colored white
I wish that I could be a rover

[Hook]

[Verse 1]

[Hook]

[Outro]
You'll never see my face again
You'll never see my face again
You'll never see my face again
You'll never see my face again

[Verse 1]
Who is the girl with the crying face
Looking at millions of signs
She knows that life is a running race
Her face shouldn't show any sign

[Hook]
Melody fair won't you comb your hair
You can be beautiful too
Melody fair , remember you're only a woman
Melody fair, remember you're only a girl

[Verse 2]
Who is the girl at the window pane
Watching the rain falling down
Melody, life isn't like the rain
Its just like a merry go round

[Hook]
Melody fair won't you comb your hair
You can be beautiful too
Melody fair, remember you're only a woman
Melody fair, remember you're only a girl

[Verse 1]
Who is the girl with the crying face
Looking at millions of signs
She knows that life is a running race
Her face shouldn't show any sign

[Hook]
Melody fair won't you comb your hair
You can be beautiful too
Melody fair, remember you're only a woman
Melody fair, remember you're only a girl

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I'm locked up I wanna be free
Out in the courtyard and over the wall then
My friends are waiting for me

[Hook: Robin Gibb and Barry Gibb]
Sixteen people are waiting to get me
Hoping to take me outside
I hear the sound of the snub nose behind me
I went along for the ride

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
Wind in my face and my bones they are aching
My soul must weather the storm
I must run till my back it is breaking
Desperately I must keep on

[Hook: Robin and Barry]

[Post-Hook: Robin and Barry]
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I went along for the ride

[Outro: Robin and Barry]
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I saw a new morning
I saw a new morning
I saw a new morning

[Verse 1: Robin Gibb]
It's too late to turn back now
There ain't no space back there
And how did I begin to lose my self control
How did I begin to lose my self control

[Verse 2: Robin Gibb]
There ain't a thing that you could give me
With the love forever with me
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul

[Hook: Barry Gibb]
I don't wanna be the one
Remember it was only fun
Two strangers touching in the sun, it had to end
I don't wanna be the guy to tell you things that make you cry
You know as well as I know , you're my only friend

[Verse 2]

[Hook: Barry Gibb]

[Outro: Barry and Robin]
I don't wanna be the guy to tell you things that make you cry
You know as well as I know you're my only friend
You know as well as I know you're my only friend
You're my only friend
My only friend
My only friend

[Verse 1]
You say that you need my love
And you're wanting my body, I don't mind
Baby, all I've got is time
And I'm waiting to make you mine
You say you wanna stay the night
But you'll leave me tomorrow, I don't care
All of your moves are right
We can take it anywhere

[Chorus]
This physical attraction (Physical attraction)
It's a chemical reaction
It's a physical attraction
It's a chemical reaction, yeah

[Verse 2]
Trying hard to get away
But I can't seem to fight the way I feel
Even though you're not for real
Your touch is driving me
Crazy, and when you smile
It's just making me want you more and more
Baby, won't you stay a while?
It could be such a fantasy

[Chorus]
This physical attraction (Physical attraction)
It's a chemical reaction
Ooh, it's a physical attraction
Sweet satisfaction, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe we were meant to be together
Even though we never met before
We got to move before the sun is rising
And you'll be walking slowly out the door
Out the door

[Spoken Bridge]
You're confusing me
'Cause I don't know if you want me
But I know that I want you
And that's nothing to be ashamed of
What are you gonna do?

[Verse 3]
Well, you say that you need my love
And you're wanting my body, I don't mind
Baby, all I've got is time
And I'm waiting to make you mine
You say you wanna stay the night
But you'll leave me tomorrow, I don't care
All of your moves are right
We can take it anywhere

[Chorus]
This physical attraction (Physical attraction)
It's a chemical reaction
It's a physical attraction
Sweet satisfaction, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe we were meant to be together
Even though we never met before
We got to move before the sun is rising
And you'll be walking slowly out the door
Out the door

[Chorus]
Physical attraction (Physical attraction)
It's a chemical reaction
It's a physical attraction
It's a chemical reaction, yeah

[Outro]
Attraction, reaction (Physical attraction)
So much satisfaction
Attraction, the action
So much satisfaction
It's a physical, a physical, a physical attraction
A chemical, a chemical reaction
A physical, physical attraction
A chemical, a chemical reaction
A physical, a physical attraction
A chemical, a chemical reaction

[Verse 1]
Something in the way you love me won't let me be
I don't want to be your prisoner, so baby, won't you set me free?
Stop playing with my heart
Finish what you start
When you make my love come down
If you want me, let me know
Baby, let it show
Honey, don't you fool around

[Pre-Chorus]
Just try to understand (Understand)
I've given all I can
'Cause you got the best of me

[Chorus]
Borderline
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love
Over the borderline

[Post-Chorus]
Keep on pushing me, baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy?
You just keep on pushing my love
Over the borderline

[Verse 2]
Something in your eyes is making such a fool of me
When you hold me in your arms, you love me 'til I just can't see
But then you let me down
When I look around
Baby, you just can't be found
Stop driving me away
I just wanna stay
There's something I just got to say

Just try to understand (Understand)
I've given all I can
'Cause you got the best of me

What does it take to make you see?
You just keep on pushing my love
Over the borderline

[Verse 1]
Don't put me off, 'cause I'm on fire
And I can't quench my desire
Don't you know that I'm burning up for your love?
You're not convinced that that is enough
I put myself in this position
And I deserve the imposition
But you don't even know I'm alive
And this pounding in my heart just won't die
I'm burning up

[Chorus]
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
For your love

[Verse 2]
You're always closing your door
Well, that only makes me want you more
And day and night, I cry for your love
You're not convinced that that is enough
To justify my wanting you
Now tell me what you want me to do
I'm not blind, and I know
That you want to want me, but you can't let go
C'mon, let go

[Chorus]
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
For your love, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Do you wanna see me down on my knees?
Or bending o
