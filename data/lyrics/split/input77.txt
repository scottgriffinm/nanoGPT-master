 country
Back in the barn again

Now when we hit the road
Big buses and trucks unload
After the curtain falls
Load up and then we all

Get back to the country
Back where it all began
Get back to the country
Back on the road again

When I was a younger man
Got lucky with a rock 'n' roll band
Struck gold in Hollywood
All that time I knew I would
Get back to the country
Back where it all began
Get back to the country
Back in the barn again

[Intro:]
Uh, uh, uh, we got the...
(Oh my God! Is it real?)
Oh, we got the...
(Oh my God! Is it real?)
A one-two, a one-two
(Oh my God!)

Yeah, uh...

[Verse 1:]
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you (Baby)
You'd be like heaven to touch (Huh)
I wanna hold you so much (Yeah)
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive (I'm alive, yeah)
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

[Verse 2:]
Pardon the way that I stare (the way that I stare)
There's nothing else to compare (What?)
The sight of you leaves me weak (So weak)
There are no words left to speak (words left to speak)
But if you feel like I feel (Yeah)
Please let me know that it's real (It's all real)
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

[Chorus:]
I love you baby, if it's quite all right
I need you baby, to warm the lonely night
I love you baby, trust in me when I say okay (It's okay)
Oh pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I've found you, stay
And let me love you, oh baby let me love you, oh baby...
(It takes two to make a thing go right)

[Verse 3:]
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive (Thank God, what?)
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

[Chorus:]
I need you baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you baby, to warm a lonely night
I love you baby, trust in me when I say it's okay (Check the jewelers)
Oh pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I've found you, stay
And let me love you (What?)
Oh baby let me love you, oh baby...
I need you baby (It's a conspiracy)
I love you baby (It's like... uhl...)
I need you baby (I want you)
Trust in me when I say it's okay
Oh, oh pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, oh baby let me love you, oh baby...

A one-two, a one-two
A one-two, a one-two
A one-two, a one-two
A one-two, a one-two
A one-two, a one-two...

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, ya'll
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, ya'll
It's a... it's a conspiracy
Read the papers!
Yo, 'cause it's all propaganda

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, woah
Woah, woah
Oh
(You good, T-Minus?)
Oh

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, circumnavigate the globe as the cash grows (Grow)
Get a nigga whacked like you get the grass mowed (Mowed)
I'm talkin' slick when I'm with the Big Slime, nigga (Slime)
Could hit your bitch, you could never hit mine, nigga (Mine)
In my DM, they electric slide, nigga (Huh, slide)
No catfishin', this is not a fish fry, nigga
Never switch sides on my dog
Catch a contact, hitch a ride, go to Mars
Everybody sing
How could you come up out your face
And say I ain't the hardest nigga you done ever heard?
I left a flock of rappers dead and buried
A verse from me is like eleven birds
Just did the math, that's like two thousand dollars every word
I'm on the verge, I'll beat the charge
I killed some niggas and I walked away from it
Then I observe, just how you curve
Then told the nigga that they gotta wait for it
"I know—I know you in high demand"
I'm ballin' on a pussy nigga like Juwanna Mann
I'm drownin' all inside the pussy like I never swam
Ayy, fuck your IG, I put somethin' on your sonogram
I'm the man, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Pimp talk, church talk, I can make a brick walk (Woo)
Up north, down south, Bankhead to Rachel Walk (Ayy)
Hit it with a little water, stretch it like a vocal cord
STD, I run my ward, fuck a fed and his daughter (Let's go)
I'ma run the compound (Yeah)
I supply the cigarettes and bread (Woo)
I got a main and she gon' ride (Uh-huh)
She took a quarter and she fled (Uh)
I'm in the Lamb', so she gon' ride (Yeah)
I see the pain in shawty's light brown eyes (Ooh)
I'm at The London with some big thots
No fries, she eat steaks with the fish sides
Didn't your mama tell you when something on fire, stop, drop and roll? (Aw yeah)
I've been on the road like a pair of spinners at Stop-N-Go's (Yeah)
I could charge 'em like a Dodge Hemi Demon
Got your broad in the garage eatin' semen
Every time a nigga go back to the ward
Niggas act like they want start
And we leave them on the cement (Grra, grra)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Outro: Travis Scott]
I, crash down, we get money (Hey)
For the full town (Woah, when you won't play, I)
I decided, for the full side (Hoes will say)
And they know, I might (And fly, I...)
Get down, might (Don't play)
See the whole town every time, I... (Oh, every day)
Yeah, they know what's up (Folks will say)
Lyrics from snippet

[Verse]
I just done dreamed that it worked on ya
Hop up, lil' play-by
Yeah, I get the Benz and I play with it, yeah
Jump on, don't play me

[Chorus]
What you gon' do?
Hop in the Benz and the, ooh
Ayy, vamanos, ooh
Hop in, then cop out the coupe
Ayy, I just want bool
See me, go caca doodoodoo
What you gon' do?
My old car keeps breaking down
My new car ain't from Japan
There's already too many Datsuns
In this town

Another thing that's bugging me
Is this commercial on TV
Says that Detroit can't make good cars any more
Motor City

Who's driving my car?
Who's driving my car now?
Who?

My army jeep is still alive
Got locking hubs and four wheel drive
Ain't got no radio
Ain't got no mag wheels
Ain't got no digital clock
Ain't got no clock
The paint job is lookin' blue
The white walls are missing too
But I guess until I get my car back
This will do

Who's driving my car now?
Who's driving my car now?
Who?

Who's driving my car now?
Slipping and sliding and playing domino
Lefting and then Righting, it's not a crime you know
You gotta tell your story boy, before it's time to go

Are you ready for the country because it's time to go?
Are you ready for the country because it's time to go?

I was talkin' to the preacher, said God was on my side
Then I ran into the hangman, he said it's time to die
You gotta tell your story boy, you know the reason why

Are you ready for the country because it's time to go?
Are you ready for the country because it's time to go?
Out on the trans-Canada highway
There was a girl hitchhiking with her dog
Fireflies buzzin' round her head
Like candles in the fog

He was three miles down the road
Tryin' to stay up, but he knew that he couldn't
She was looking for a ride through the night
But out there, who wouldn't

They were bound for glory
Bound for living on the edge
They were bound for each other
Like two comets heading for a bed

She had a new way of living
New way of looking at life
He had an '84 International and two kids
He left back home with his wife

He was tired of writin' letters to himself
And living in the dark
She was open to suggestions
And some say she had a broken heart
He had everything he wanted
'Til it all turned out to be a job
One fallen asleep trucker
And a girl hitchhiking with her dog

They were bound for glory
Bound for living on the edge
They were bound for each other
Like two comets heading for a bed

She had a new way of living
New way of looking at life
He had an '84 International and two kids
He left back home with his wife

Out on the trans-Canada highway
The sun came climbing up the cab
By the time it hit the window they were wakin' up
From what little sleep they had

When that heat hit the blankets
They were looking for love at second sight
Just starin' in each others' eyes
Findin' it in the mornin' light

They were bound for glory
Bound for living on the edge
They were bound for each other
Like two blankets layin' on a bed
She had a new way of living
New way of looking at life
He had an '84 International and two kids
He left back home with his wife
Verse 1:

I stop and stand
In place
Frozen
Ice chills
Moving down my arms

B-Section:

Will the law of attraction
Pull me closer to you?
I can’t fathom the words to gather It’s true
I’m a mess when it comes to you
When it comes to you


Chorus:

I wanna go to
The ends of the world with you
I want to float to the sky
And be your brightest star

Verse 2:

Nostalgic vibes
When I look into those honey eyes
I’m taken back to a place of comfort
Summertime crush of mine

B-section:

Pull me closer to you
I can’t fathom the words to gather it’s true
Im a mess when it comes to you
When it comes to you

Chorus:

I wanna go to
The ends of the world with you
I want to float to the sky
And be your brightest star


Bridge:
Why can’t I form my lips to say
Baby I just want to be with you
Chorus: (2x)

I wanna go to
The ends of the world with you
I want to float to the sky
And be your brightest star

[Verse 1]
I am a child, I'll last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile
You hold my hand, rough up my hair
It's lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]
I gave to you, now, you give to me
I'd like to know what you learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color, when black is burned?
What is the color?

[Verse 2]
You are a man, you understand
You pick me up and you lay me down again
You make the rules, you say what's fair
It's lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]
I gave to you, now, you give to me
I'd like to know what you learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color, when black is burned?
What is the color?

[Outro]
I am a child, I'll last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile
Why art thou silent & invisible
Father of jealousy
Why dost thou hide thyself in clouds
From every searching Eye

Why darkness & obscurity
In all thy words & laws
That none dare eat the fruit but from
The wily serpents jaws
Or is it because Secresy
Gains females loud applause
- Well...
- I've prepared for you a canoe to sit in this
It's time for you to leave now, William Blake..
Time for you to go back to your kingdom
- There' s so cloudly...
- Back to the plays from where all the spirits came
And we are all the spirits between them
This world won't no wonder continues...

[NOBODY]
Stupid white men. William Blake, you go to them

[WILLIAM]
What? Why don't we just go around them?

[NOBODY]
No, you go

[WILLIAM]
I’d rather not

[NOBODY]
It's a test

[WILLIAM]
I don't know those people. I don’t know if they're friendly or if they'll kill me

[NOBODY]
Nobody will observe

[WILLIAM]
All right, I'll go. I'd rather not, but I'll go. What's the fastest way to get down there?

[NOBODY]
Be quiet and go
Is my world not falling down
I'm in pieces on the ground
And my eyes aren't open
And I'm standing on my knees

But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I'll miss you

Turn me up or turn me down
Turn me off or turn me round
I wish I could have met you in a place
Where we both belong

But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I'll miss you
Sometimes I feel
Like I'm just a helpless child
Sometimes I feel like a king
But baby, since I have changed
I can't take nothing home

City lights at a country fair
Never shine but always glare
If I'm bright enough to see you
You're just too dark to care

But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I'll miss you
Well, hello lonely woman
Won't you take a walk with me
I know a place where we can go
Grab a bite to eat

Hello lonely woman
Are you feelin’ all right?
Well, you look just like heaven
On a clear clear night

Well, I know you're a lonely woman
And I know what's on your mind
I won’t ask you any favors
I'm familiar with your kind

I know you need me
Like a river needs rain
I won't ask you any favors
Until I pass this way again

Well, hello lonely woman
Won't you take a walk with me
I know a place where we can go
Grab a bite to eat
Hello lonely woman
Are you feelin' all right?
Well, you look just like heaven
On a clear clear night

Well, I know you're a lonely woman
And I know what's on your mind
I won't ask you any favors
I’m familiar with your kind

I know you need me
Like a river needs rain
I won’t ask you any favors
Until I pass this way again
We used to laugh and play games together
We found things to do in stormy weather
But now I find you're leaving me behind
Casting me away from you

I try to tell myself it doesn't matter
I can find someone who'll treat me better
But now I see that you are leaving me
Casting me away from you

Someday maybe you'll know
You broke my heart in two
I hope that someday
You'll come back again
'Cause I'll be waitin' 'til you do

But now I find you're leaving me behind
Casting me away from you
I try to tell myself it doesn't matter
I can find someone who'll treat me better
But now I see that you are leaving me
Yes, I see that you are leaving me
Casting me away from you

[Verse 1]
The end has come
My sky has lost it's sun
The harm is done
She was the only one

[Bridge 1]
There goes my babe
There goes what might have been
There goes my babe
In the cool morning rain
And now my heart
Lies empty and still again

[Verse 2]
Don't take my hand
I'm doing the best I can
Understand
I'm trying to be a man

[Bridge 2]
She was so young
Too young to really care
I fell in love with her long flowing hair
And now my heart
Lies empty without her there

[Verse 3]
If she were here
I'd long to hold her near
But now it's clear
The price of love is dear

[Bridge 1]
There goes my babe
There goes what might have been
There goes my babe
In the cool morning rain
And now my heart
Lies empty and still again

[Verse 1]
Hey, who's that stomping all over my face?
Where's that silhouette I'm trying to trace?
Who's putting sponge in the bells I once rung?
Taking my gypsy before she's begun

To singing the meaning of what's in my mind
Before I can take home what's rightfully mine
Joinin' and listenin' and talkin' in rhymes
Stoppin' the feeling to wait for the times

And who's saying baby that don't mean a thing?
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

[Verse 2]
And who's all hung-up on the happiness thing?
And trying to tune all the bells that he rings?
And who's in the corner and down on the floor
With pencil and paper just counting the score?

And who's trying to act like he's just in between?
The night isn't black if you know that it's green
Don't bother looking, you're too blind to see
Who's coming on like he wanted to be
Who's saying baby that don't mean a thing?
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

[Verse 3]
And who's coming home on old ninety-five?
Who's got the feeling that to keep him alive?
Though havin' it and sharin' it ain't quite the same
It ain't no gold nugget, you can't lay a claim

And who's seeing eyes through a crack in the floor?
There it is baby, don't worry no more
Who should be sleepin' but is writing this song
Wishin' and a-hopin' he weren't so damned wrong

And who's saying baby that don't mean a thing?
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing
And who's saying baby that don't mean a thing?
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing
Your silver child suspended in space
Crying out to you
Beckons you to yet another fine place
Where the trials of life are few

Don't think you're living long
Who says you are coming on
They won't remember you
The rent is always due

The cloudy men who take their place
And stand in line they do
Know not of the satin face
That separates them from you

Just put your blue jeans on
Grab your guitar and sing a song
Don't think I'm kidding you
The rent is always due

She rides a broom with gold-plated straw
She flutters around and she cries
The Brylcream fools just standing on
Digesting all their lives
But then you walk along
And she starts coming on
Beneath her melting broom
The rent is always due
Come to see her in the river?
She'll be there to wave to you
In the hope that you'll forgive her
She will join you there

Find out that now was
The answer to answers
That you gave later
She did the things that
We both did before now
But who forgave her

Now you see how down you've fallen
Now you hear your conscious call
Thank yourself alone for stallin'
I'm not there to call

Call me a fool 'cause
I need her, and see her
But now you're down
Something inside you
Will tell you I'm wise to
What you're spreadin' round
If I could stand to see her cryin'
I would tell her not to care
When she learns of all your lyin'
Would she join you there?

Find out that now was
The answer to answers
That you gave later

[Verse 1]
No, I'm not gonna hide my feelings
Couldn't if I tried
No, I'm not holding them inside
Holding back is so close to stealing
Though we both have pride
We could lose it all if we lied

[Bridge]
Someday it's later than
The feeling we have now
It's off the ground, I've always played around
But now I don't know how

[Verse 2]
Listen easy 'cause I'm saying
What I mean this time
Sharing words I always said were mine
I was breezy, now I'm swaying
Like the tree we climbed
Asking you to give me one more sign

[Chorus]
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you’re thinking that
You're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon

[Verse 1]
It’s so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad

[Chorus]
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon

[Verse 2]
There's a girl just down the aisle
Oh, to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote
As you read a hidden note

[Chorus]
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You’re leaving there too soon
You’re leaving there too soon

[Verse 3]
Now you say you're leavin’ home
'Cause you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin’ out it's real?

[Chorus]
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon

[Outro]
Though you're thinking that
You're leaving there too soon

[Verse 1]
I think I'd like to go back home
And take it easy
There's a woman that
I'd like to get to know
Living there

[Chorus]
Everybody seems to wonder
What it's like down here
I gotta get away
From this day-to-day running around
Everybody knows this is nowhere
Everybody knows

[Verse 2]
Every time I think about back home
It's cool and breezy
I wish that I could be there right now
Just passing time

[Chorus]
Everybody seems to wonder
What it's like down here
I gotta get away
From this day-to-day running around
Everybody knows this is nowhere
Everybody knows

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Everybody seems to wonder
What it's like down here
I gotta get away
From this day-to-day running around
Everybody knows this is nowhere
Everybody knows

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 1]
It's so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 2]
There's a girl just down the aisle
Oh to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote
As you read the hidden note

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 3]
Now you're underneath the stairs
And you're giving back some glares
To the people who you met
And it's your first cigarette

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 4]
Now you say you're leaving home
Because you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real?

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 1]

Don't call pretty Peggy, she can't hear you no more
Don't leave no message 'round her back door
They say the old laughing lady been here before
She don't keep time, she don't count score

[Verse 2]
You can't have a cupboard if there ain't no wall
You got to move, there's no time left to stall
They say the old laughing lady dropped by to call
When she leaves, she leaves nothing at all

[Verse 3]
See the drunkard of the village falling on the street
Can't tell his ankles from the rest of his feet
He loves his old laughing lady 'cause her taste is so sweet
But the laughing lady's loving ain't the kind he can keep

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
There's a fever on the freeway, blacks out the night
There's a slippin' on the stairway just don't feel right
And there's a rumbling in the bedroom and a flashing of light
There's the old laughing lady, everything is all right

[Verse 1]
Is my world not falling down?
I'm in pieces on the ground
And my eyes aren't open
And I'm standing on my knees

[Chorus]
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I'll miss you

[Verse 2]
Turn me up or turn me down
Turn me off or turn me 'round
I wish I could have met you in a place
Where we both belong

[Chorus]
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I'll miss you

[Bridge]
Sometimes I feel
Like I'm just a helpless child
Sometimes I feel like a king
But baby, since I have changed
I can't take nothing home

[Verse 3]
City lights at a country fair
Never shine but always glare
If I'm bright enough to see you
You're just too dark to care

[Chorus]
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I'll miss you
When the dream came
I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane
Like a smoke ring day
When the wind blows
Now I won't be back till later on
If I do come back at all
But you know me, and I miss you now

In a strange game
I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came
And you had a chance to see through me
Though the other side is just the same
You can tell my dream is real
Because I love you, can you see me now

Though we rush ahead to save our time
We are only what we feel
And I love you, can you feel it now

[Verse 1]
When the dream came
I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane like a smoke ring day when the wind blows
Now, I won't be back till later on
If I do come back at all
But you know me, and I miss you now

[Verse 2]
In a strange game
I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came and you had a chance to see through me
Though the other side is just the same
You can tell my dream is real
Because I love you, can you see me now?

[Outro]
Though we rush ahead to save our time
We are only what we feel
And I love you, can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Can you?

[Verse 1]
She's a victim of her senses, do you know her?
Can you see her in the distance as she tumbles by?
Veteran of a race that should be over
Can you hear her sigh? With wings to fly
She rolls along doing it wrong

[Chorus]
Ah, I've loved her so long
Ah, I've loved her so long

[Bridge]
There's a place that I know
We could go get away for a while
I can bring her the peace that she needs
Give her reason to smile

[Outro]
Ah, I've loved her so long
Ah, I've loved her so long
Ah, I've loved her so long, so long
Ah, I've loved her so long

[Verse 1]
Well, I used to drive a cab, you know
I heard a siren scream
Pulled over to the corner, fell into a dream
There were two men eating pennies
And three young girls who cried
The West coast is falling, I see rocks in the sky
Well the preacher took his Bible and laid it on the stool
He said "With the congregation running
Why should I play the fool?"

[Verse 2]
Well, I used to be a woman, you know
I took you for a ride
I let you fly my airplane
It looked good for your pride
'Cause you're the kind of man you know
Who likes what he says
I wonder what's it's like to be so far over my head
Well, the lady made the wedding
And she brought along the ring
She got down on her knees and said
"Let's get on with this thing"

[Verse 3]
Well, I used to be a folk singer
Keeping managers alive
When you saw me on a corner
And told me I was jive
So I unlocked your mind, you know
To see what I could see
If you guarantee the postage
I'll mail you back the key
Well I woke up in the morning
With an arrow through my nose
There was an Indian in the corner
Trying on my clothes

[Verse 4]
Well, I used to be asleep you know
With blankets on my bed
I stayed there for a while till they discovered I was dead
The coroner was friendly, and I liked him quite a lot
If I hadn't have been a woman
I guess I'd never have been caught
They called up all my friends and told them
They had been misled
My friends gave me back my house and car
And nothing more was said

[Verse 5]
I was driving down the freeway
When my car ran out of gas
Pulled over to the station but I was afraid to ask
The servicemen were yellow and the gasoline was green
Although I knew I couldn't
I thought that I was gonna scream
That was on my last trip to Tulsa
Just before the snow
If you ever need a ride there
Be sure to let me know

[Verse 6]
I was chopping down a palm tree
When a friend dropped by to ask
If I would feel less lonely
If he helped me swing the axe
I said, "No, it's not a case of being lonely we have here
I've been working on this palm tree
For eighty seven years"
I said, "No, it's not a case of being lonely we have here
I've been working on this palm tree
For eighty seven years"
He said, "Go get lost!" and walked toward his Cadillac
I chopped down the palm tree
And it landed on his back

[Verse 1]
The lights turned on and the curtain fell down
And when it was over it felt like a dream
They stood at the stage door and begged for a scream
The agents had paid for the black limousine
That waited outside in the rain
Did you see them, did you see them?

[Chorus]
Did you see them in the river?
They were there to wave to you
Could you tell that the empty quivered
Brown skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow
Held a broken arrow?

[Verse 2]
Eighteen years of American dream
He saw that his brother had sworn on the wall
He hung up his eyelids and ran down the hall
His mother had told him a trip was a fall
And don't mention babies at all
Did you see him, did you see him?

[Chorus]
Did you see him in the river?
He was there to wave to you
Could you tell that the empty quivered
Brown skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow
Held a broken arrow?

[Verse 3]
The streets were lined for the wedding parade
The Queen wore the white gloves, the county of song
The black covered caisson her horses had drawn
Protected her King from the sun rays of dawn
They married for peace and were gone
Did you see them, did you see them?

[Chorus]
Did you see them in the river?
They were there to wave to you
Could you tell that the empty quivered
Brown skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow
Held a broken arrow?
I've been up, I've been down
I've been so turned around
That I've seen my fate
In the eyes of others

I've been high, I've been low
But there's one thing I know
There's a lot to give
When we give to each other

So I bring you my song
Hoping you'll sing along

Turn down the lights
Turn up the music
Let's just be together tonight
And turn down the lights

First we're here, then we're gone
But the music plays on
From the heart of one
To the heart of another
It's goodnight, not goodbye
We're just done for awhile
We'll be back again
With some new things discovered
And we'll bring you our song
Hoping you'll sing along

Turn down the lights
Turn up the music
Let's just be together tonight
Come turn down the lights

So I bring you my song
Hoping you'll sing along
Turn down the lights
Turn up the music
Let's just be together tonight

Turn up the love
Bring out the memories
You and I could share them all night
So turn down the lights
Turn down the lights
Turn down the lights
Turn down the lights
Winding paths through tables and glass
First fall was new
Now watch the summer pass
So close to you

Too late to keep the change
Too late to pay
No time to stay the same
Too young to leave

No pass out sign on the door set me thinking
Are waitresses paying the price of their winking?
While stars sit in bars and decide what their drinking
They drop by to die 'cause it's faster than sinking

Too late to keep the change
Too late to pay
No time to stay the same
Too late to keep the change
Too late to pay
No time to stay the same
Too young to leave
Find out that now was the answer
To answers that you gave later
She did the things that we both did before, now
But who forgave her

If I could stand to see her crying
I would tell her not to care
When she learns of all your lyin'
Will she join you there?

Country girl I think you're pretty
Got to make you understand
Have no lovers in the city
Let me be your country man
Got to make you understand

[Verse 1]
There you stood on the edge of your feather
Expecting to fly
While I laughed, I wondered whether
I could wave goodbye
Knowin' that you'd gone

[Bridge 1]
By the summer it was healing
We had said goodbye
All the years we'd spent with feeling
Ended with a cry
Babe, ended with a cry
Babe, ended with a cry

[Verse 2]
I tried so hard to stand
As I stumbled and fell to the ground
So hard to laugh as I fumbled
And reached for the love I found
Knowin' it was gone

[Bridge 2]
If I never lived without you
Now you know I'd die
If I ever said I loved you
Now you know I'd try
Babe, now you know I'd try
Babe, now you know I'd try
Everybody's sayin' music is love
Everybody's sayin' it's love

Put on your colors and run, come see
Everybody says that music's for free
Take off your clothes and lie in the sun
Everybody says the music's for fun

[Verse 1]
Hello, cowgirl in the sand
Is this place at your command?
Can I stay here for a while?
Can I see your sweet sweet smile?

[Chorus]
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game

[Verse 2]
Hello, ruby in the dust
Has your band begun to rust?
After all the sin we've had
I was hopin' that we turn back

[Chorus]
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game

[Verse 3]
Hello, woman of my dreams
Is this not the way it seems?
Purple words on a grey background
To be a woman and to be turned down

[Chorus]
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game

[Verse 1]
When the dream came
I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane like a smoke ring day when the wind blows
Now, I won't be back till later on
If I do come back at all
But you know me, and I miss you now

[Verse 2]
In a strange game
I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came and you had a chance to see through me
Though the other side is just the same
You can tell my dream is real
Because I love you, can you see me now?

[Outro]
Though we rush ahead to save our time
We are only what we feel
And I love you
Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Can you?

[Verse 1]
Sailing heart ships through broken harbors
Out on the waves in the night
Still the searcher must ride the dark horse
Racing alone in his fright

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay but young enough to sell?

[Verse 2]
Tell me lies later, come and see me
I'll be around for a while
I am lonely but you can free me
All in the way that you smile

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay, but young enough to sell?

[Intro]
Old man, look at my life, I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life, I'm a lot like you were

[Verse 1]
Old man, look at my life
Twenty-four, and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two
Love lost, such a cost
Give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you

[Bridge]
Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

[Verse 2]
Lullabies, look in your eyes
Run around the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me
To mean that much to you
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last
Rolling home to you

[Bridge]
Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

[Outro]
Old man, look at my life, I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life, I'm a lot like you were

[Verse 1]
When the winter rains come pouring down
On that new home of mine
Will you think of me and wonder if I'm fine?
Will your restless heart come back to mine
On a journey thru the past?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?

[Verse 2]
Now I'm going back to Canada
On a journey thru the past
And I won't be back till February comes
"I will stay with you if you'll stay with me"
Said the fiddler to the drum
And we'll have good time on a journey thru the past

[Outro]
When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?

[Verse 1]
There is a town in north Ontario
With dream comfort memory to spare
And in my mind I still need a place to go
All my changes were there

[Verse 2]
Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us

[Chorus]
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Baby, can you hear me now?
The chains are locked and tied across the door
Baby, sing with me somehow

[Verse 3]
Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us

[Chorus]
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning with love in mind
It was raining outside but my love still shined
Kept me warm till my plane touched the sky

[Verse 2]
And I've seen love make a fool of a man
He tried to make a loser win
But I got nothing to lose I can't get back again

[Bridge]
Man made rules been holdin' back my love
Can't hold it back no more
Churches long preach sex is wrong
Jesus, where has nature gone?
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning with love in mind
It was raining outside but my love still shined
Kept me warm till my plane touched the sky

[Verse 2]
And I've seen love make a fool of a man
He tried to make a loser win
But I got nothing to lose I can't get back again

[A Man Needs a Maid]

[Verse 1]
I was thinkin' that maybe I'd get a maid
Find a place nearby for her to stay
Just someone to keep my house clean
Fix my meals and go away

[Chorus]
Afraid
A man feels afraid
Afraid

[Post-Chorus]
It's hard to make that change
When life and love turns strange and cold

[Verse 2]
To give a love
You gotta live a love
To live a love
You gotta be part of
And when will I see you again?

[Verse 2]
A while ago somewhere I don't know when
I was watchin' a movie with a friend
I fell in love with the actress
She was playing a part I could understand

[Chorus]
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid
A man needs a maid

[Heart of Gold]

[Verse 3]
I want to live, I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give
That keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

[Verse 4]
I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwoods
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line
That keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

[Outro]
And when will I see you again

[Verse 1]
Old man sittin' by the side of the road
With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinkin' from the weight of the load
And the buildings scrape the sky
Cold wind rippin' down the alley at dawn
And the mornin' paper flies
Dead man lying by the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Verse 2]
Blind man runnin' through the light of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down to the river of sight
And you can really understand
Red lights flashing through the window in the rain
Can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lyin' in a gutter in the lane
If you're walking home alone

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Verse 1]
There's a world you're living in
No one else has your part
All God's children in the wind
Take it in and blow hard

[Bridge 1]
Look around it, have you found it
Walking down the avenue?
See what it brings, could be good things
In the air for you

[Verse 2]
We are leavin', we are gone
Come with us to all alone
Never worry, never moan
God will leave you all alone

[Bridge 2]
In the mountains, in the cities
You can see the dream
Look around you, has it found you?
Is it what it seems?

[Verse 1]
There's a world you're living in
No one else has your part
All God's children in the wind
Take it in and blow hard

[Verse 1]
I caught you knockin' at my cellar door
I love you, baby, can I have some more?
Gone, gone, the damage done
I hit the city and I lost my band
I watched the needle take another man
Gone, gone, the damage done

[Verse 2]
I sing the song, because I love the man
I know that some of you won't understand
Milk blood to keep from running out
I've seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
And every junkie's like a settin' sun

[Verse 1]
Tin soldiers and Nixon comin'
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio

[Chorus]
Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her and
Found her dead on the ground?
How can you run when you know?

[Verse 2]
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah

[Chorus]
Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her and
Found her dead on the ground?
How can you run when you know?

[Verse 1]
Tin soldiers and Nixon comin'
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio
Never thought love had a rainbow on it
Used to think a cloud was a nightmare
That was up until I first met you
Now I go around hoping you care

Dance, dance, feel it all around you
Dance, dance, dance
Never thought love had a rainbow on it
See the girl dance
See the girl dance

Mississippi mud never touched her fingers
California sand lies in her hand
Love her more than life as the daylight lingers
Early in the morning I'll be her man

Dance, dance, feel it all around you
Dance, dance, dance
Mississippi mud never touched her fingers
See the girl dance
See the girl dance

[Verse 1]
I am a child, I last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile
You hold my hand, rough up my hair
It’s lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]
I gave to you, now, you give to me
I'd like to know what you've learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color when black is burned?
What is the color?

[Verse 2]
You are a man, you understand
You pick me up and you lay me down again
You make the rules, you say what’s fair
It's lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]
I gave to you, now you give to me
I'd like to know what you learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color when black is burned?
What is the color?

[Outro]
I am a child, I last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile

[Verse 1]
I want to live, I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It’s these expressions I never give
That keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searchin’ for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

[Verse 2]
I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line
That keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old, ooh ooh
Keeps me searchin’ for a heart of gold
And I’m getting old

[Outro]
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
You keep me searchin’ and I'm growing old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
I've been a miner for a heart of gold

[Verse 1]
Bad fog of loneliness
Put a cloud on my single-mindedness
I dream of sweet caress from you

[Verse 2]
What makes tomorrow guess
What makes me take from me and put aside the rest
I dream of sweet caress from you

[Bridge]
So long woman I am gone
So much pain to go through
Come back maybe I was wrong

[Verse 1]
Bad fog of loneliness
Put a cloud on my single-mindedness
I dream of sweet caress from you

[Verse 1]
When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will you think of me and wonder if I'm fine?
Will your restless heart come back to mine
On a journey thru the past?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?

[Verse 2]
Now I'm going back to Canada
On a journey thru the past
And I won't be back till February comes
"I will stay with you if you'll stay with me"
Said the fiddler to the drum
And we'll keep good time on a journey thru the past

[Outro]
When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?
Angora fur, the Aegean Sea
It's a soft wet love that you have for me
Beyond the stars, beneath the sea
Love is the arrow deep in your side
When the arrow's pulled, the person has died
Oh yeah


You see girl, you string me along (Get it up, get it up)
You pulled the arrow and then you're gone (Get it up, get it up)
You taste my wine and opportune (Get it up, get it up)
You came too quick and you... You left too soon
Girl, you left me too soon


Fate has its circle, life has its net
Leave me in the morning, leave me without, huh, breath
Oooh


Angora fur, the Aegean Sea
It's a soft and wet love that you have for me
You taste my wine and opportune
You came too quick and you left me too soon
Ooh yeah
You know you left me too soon

[Chorus]
Soft and wet
You are soft and wet
Your love is soft and wet
You are soft and wet
Your love is soft and wet
You are soft and wet
Your love is soft and wet

[Verse 1]
My friend, you know you had your time a while
But I'm willing to give you mine
Few things we both have keep us alive
My life and our true love is all we need

[Chorus]
All we need
It's all we need
It's all we need

[Verse 2]
I don't want to feel a world against our love
I don't want to grow old alone and broken heart

[Chorus]
It's all we need
It's all we need
It's all we need
It's all we need
All we need
All we need

[Verse 1]
Lost in the flames of love
Unrequited love
Time won't always heal
And it eats at my mind
Because you're the one that got away

[Chorus]
I've been searching high and low, wondering where my feelings go
Nothing feels the same, 'cause there's no one like you
No one like you
And even though you're far away, even if my time decays
Nothing feels quite the same, you're the one that got away
Unrequited love

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel alone
Tried to hold my breath
Somewhere deep in space
And I felt like you understood
What it truly means to be in love

[Chorus]
Baby, you're the one, the one that got away
This is what it feels like to have regrets
It is what it is
Now I'm wide open, it's so hard to focus
Now that it's the end, I guess you'll always be
The one that got away

Catch me strokin' like a damn dog

And I don't ever wanna eat it in the dark
Seventy thousand dollar chandelier, cut the lights off
I'ma stroke it from behind like wow
When we do the sixty-nine, that's the only time that you ain't a dime
Got your front yard filled up with trees and they pine
I know just how to get it, it'll fuck up your mind though
Told you once that I never met a darling
But if you wanna hit, then it's my apology
Baby, baby, baby, I'm sorry
Bless you with some good brain, call it "Thugology"
You know I would never-ever-ever

[Verse 1]
You can only be strong for so long
Before everything just smashes
They will insult you, break you, hurt you
But they cannot destroy you

I no longer feared the darkness
Because the darkness, now fears me
The light will shine and everyone will see
From the ashes of my past
Like a phoenix, I will be

[Chorus]
Because I am standing, standing, and still standing
They will see me now as I am rising
Nothing to left, nothing to cling (oh)
I am reborn and I will keep burning

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of being desperate, sick of being alone
So I look up to the sky to try and find a home
The light will shine and everyone will see
From the ashes of my past
Like a phoenix, I will be

[Chorus]
Because I am standing, standing, and still standing
They will see me now as I am rising
Nothing to left, nothing to cling (oh)
I am reborn and I will keep burning

[Bridge]
I am a phoenix, I’ve been reborn  (oh yeah)
I am a phoenix, I've been resurrected
I am a phoenix, I've been reborn (oh yeah)
I am a phoenix, get ready to see me burn

[Chorus]
Because I am standing, standing, and still standing
They will see me now as I am rising
Nothing to left, nothing to cling (oh)
I am reborn and I will keep burning

[Post-Chorus]
I am reborn and I will keep burning
And keep burning

[Verse 1]
I'm losing my self-control
Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

[Chorus]
Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

[Verse 2]
I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
I think of you

[Chorus]
Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

[Bridge]
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over, yeah

[Chorus]
Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
(And I'll have to get over you all over again)
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
(Over you all over again)

[Outro]
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over

[Verse 1]
Baby you should leave this girl alone
But you won't, won’t, won't
But you don't, don’t, don't
Now delete my number from your phone
But you won't-won't-won't
You gotta go, go, go
Oh my, my, my
Gonna spell it right out

[Chorus]
I don't know what you're looking for
But I don't think it’s me
I wish I could give you my all
Not good at make believe
I don’t feel how you feel
I'm just telling it like it is
I don’t need you to say those words over
I'm just telling it like it is

[Verse 2]
Boy, man up
You're not some animal
No no no, no no no
Rather die a thousand times tonight
Than take you home, than take you home
These walls I build, they're never coming down

[Chorus]
I don’t know what you're looking for
But I don't think it's me
I wish I could give you my all
Not good at make believe
I don't feel how you feel
I'm just telling it like it is
I don't need you to say those words over
I'm just telling it like it is

[Bridge]
I'm not messed up baby, I'm not heartless
Just not ready to start looking for apartments
I'm into shopping but no baby departments
Bang, I tell it like it is
I'm not messed up baby, I'm not heartless
Just not ready to start looking for apartments
I'm into shopping but no baby departments
Bang, I tell it like it is, I tell it like it is

[Chorus]
Cause I don't know what you're looking for
But I don't think it's me
I wish I could give you my all
Not good at make believe
I don't feel how you feel
I'm just telling it like it is
I don't need you to say those words over
I don't know what you're looking for
But I don't think it's me
I wish I could give you my all
Not good at make believe
I don't feel how you feel
I'm just telling it like it is
I don't need you to say those words over
I'm just telling it like it is

[Chorus: Peewee Longway]
Did it for real
Did it for real
Did it for real
I used to jug, I lost the jug
Bills andKelos, bills and Kelos
Bills and Kelos, I used to jug, I lost the jug
I lost my plug, I lost my plug
I lost my plug, I used to jug
I lost the jug

[Verse 1: Peewee Longway]
Georgio, Georgio, Georgio, I lost my plug
I crossed off a deal, made me a deal, his price was low
Got bricks that torpito across the boarder, start placing your order
Got them fishes, they drop in the water
Chef in the kitchen, I'm cooking your order
Do it for real, I knock off your bro
Play off my Cho, I knock you with the 4
The egg with the beaters, I whip up the Coke
100 percent, see no shit like before
I'm back like the 80's, riding with my baby
Want 20, I surve you a baby
I switch up and get the work from your old lady
She told me I'm rich, I think that she shady
Them cookies I'm baking, they tasting amazing
We fuck with them Mexicans, and them Jamaicans
They say that I'm missing, my paper be short
I smashed up your sign, show me the vault
Told you before, I want it for my dogs
Guwop told me "don't fuck with him, dog"
I thought I had real trust for you, dog
Rich in the ring, throw it in the Benz now
Longway!

[Chorus: Peewee Longway]
Did it for real
Did it for real
Did it for real
I used to jug, I lost the jug
Bills andKelos, bills and Kelos
Bills and Kelos, I used to jug, I lost the jug
I lost my plug, I lost my plug
I lost my plug, I used to jug
I lost the jug

[Verse 2: Peewee Longway]
I fuck with the plug, no tourest
He got rich, and he don't got insurance
Take it, it boost my endurance
Smoking on gas like my name is Curren$y
Whitness the plug give me the work that's currant
Hop in the Rover, put up them curtens
Trap like a boss, cause I gotta stay workin
All them ghosts and them goblins, they lurkin
Fuck with my soldiers, they robbin and taken
Hustling and booming, I sold them Masons
Coke so strong, like I'm President Raiggen
Trapped out Southcentral Station
I'm switching up lawyers, I'm beating them cases
Juggin with George, and juggin with hasians
Back to the basics, I'm thumbing through faces
Used to be a jugger, now I take it
My diamonds they poke, my neck look like a glaciar
Engen in the rear, fuck it, we racing
Then for real, we rap it and take it
Damb, damb, I lost my plug
Damb for real, I cross you and take you
Surv you a brick, and surv it right up
I used to be juggin, I lost my plug
Longway!

[Chorus: Peewee Longway]
Did it for real
Did it for real
Did it for real

No Michael Vick, but all these hoes get in dog fights
Pull up in that forign, watch the trafic get the frog eyes
Keep that money on my mind like it's a brain tumer

Every state we land in, we in the latest fassion

Working out and moving weight, I'm tryna get a 6 pack
Time is money, I need a hundred bands just to chit chat

Chacing a bitch is something I can't do

Chop his head off, and pull a caper
And you ain't nobody, if you ain't having haters
OG gass and Kush, all kind of flavors

Fuckin with my dogs who don't take no time in the least
And we don't keep eating, till we obese

Have to talk to the Governor today
Concerning the Carnival parade
Have to talk to the Governor today
Concerning the carnival parade

In Trinidad people running wild
Governor say no Carnival
A big a riot police and thing
A picket sign and the people start to sing

Lord don't stop the Carnival
Carnival is a Creole bacchanal
I would make no fuzz if you cut up the Christmas
Have no fear if you cut up the New Year

Here come de woman walking up the block
With she bottom going like a clock
Here come de woman walking up the block
With she bottom going like a clock

No carnival the woman said
Oh Lord you better off dead
Show me the way to the governor's mansion
I'm going to have me a reckon session
Lord don't stop the Carnival
Carnival is a Creole bacchanal
I would make no fuzz if you cut up the Christmas
Have no fear if you cut up the New Year

A little boy can't be more than nine
Standing on the corner speaking out his mind
A little child can't be more than nine
Standing on the corner speaking out his mind

He said we must unite
Oh yes stand up for your right
Contact the Governor we want action
I speak before the young generation

Lord don't stop the Carnival
Carnival is a Creole bacchanal
I would make no fuzz if you cut up the Christmas
Have no fear if you cut up the New Year

Believe me people what I say is true
You know Harry wouldn't lie to you
Believe me people what I say is true
You know Harry wouldn't lie to you

Man the Governor he went mad
Arresting all of Trinidad
Oh he made a big mistake
Just some things that Trinidad won't take
Lord don't stop the Carnival
Carnival is a Creole bacchanal
I would make no fuzz if you cut up the Christmas
Have no fear if you cut up the New Year

I tell you friends it's a part of history
Carnival time is a big necessity
I tell you friends it's a part of history
Carnival time is a big necessity

Half the world couldn't sing the songs they sing
'Bout Carnival and all the joy it brings
Oh Lord it make me glad
Carnival time is back in Trinidad

Lord don't stop the Carnival
Carnival is a Creole bacchanal
I would make no fuzz if you cut up the Christmas
I have no fear if you cut up the New Year
I wouldn't think you mean if you cut up the Halloween
I don't care what they say if you cut up the May Day

Tell you friends it's a big calamity
Carnival time is a big necessity
Tell you friends it's a big calamity
Carnival time is a big necessity
Half the world couldn't sing the songs they sing
From carnival and all the joy it brings
Oh lord it make me sad
No more songs coming out of Trinidad
Lord don't stop the Carnival
Carnival is a Creole bacchanal
I would make no fuzz if you cut up the Christmas
Have no fear if you cut up the New Year

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'ma keep doing what I been doin'
Say I'm gettin' money, bitch, I'm used to it
Pull up to the club, got these hoes choosin'
I heard these niggas hatin', but I'm used to it
I'm drunk, so I'm swaggin' under influence
But gettin' dumb high, bitch, I'm used to it
When I send her back home, bet her hair ruined
But fuckin' niggas' bitches, man, I'm used to it

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Touchdown with a hundred pounds
Dancin' in the end zone
Ballin' on you like a jump shot, oops, I meant field goal
Crossed the middle with a 50 pack, hit me, I'm open
I call the shots like Tebow, one man down, no jokin'
I'm 'bout the set like Strahan, oops, I meant Ray Lewis
Look how my crew do it
Droptop, I'm so foolish

[?] I'm Megatron
Got a mega bomb and I'm heavily armed
Gettin' Georgia dome in my Georgia home
Ho pass out when I perform
And since they put my stats on the internet
These bitches let me put my dick all in they neck
And what do you expect? I'm a pro-bowler
A hundred pack of Ace of Spades, I got a hangover

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'ma keep doing what I been doin'
Say I'm gettin' money, bitch, I'm used to it
Pull up to the club, got these hoes choosin'
I heard these niggas hatin', but I'm used to it
I'm drunk, so I'm swaggin' under influence
But gettin' dumb high, bitch, I'm used to it
When I send her back home, bet her hair ruined
But fuckin' niggas' bitches, man, I'm used to it

[Verse 2: Wale]
Nothing 'bout this loot, woah
She love all my new songs
She say she wanna kick it, that mean "hit this with your shoes on"
Ha, look, don't mean to be too forward
Keep these bitches motivated, then they don't got no motives
Now does it? 

[?] cannot trust them
But I bet you there's a hater for every woman with my number
Youngin, hold up, hoes outside my hotel
And most of 'em got boyfriends, when I go in them, they like, "Oh well"
Holiday is my nigga, Gucci 'nem is my partner
Hookah bar for the boujee broads
Come and loosen up with this ganja

[?] partner
Pick and choose when I feel like flossin'
And I ball though, and you all broke, y'all fuck niggas ain't on yet

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'ma keep doing what I been doin'
Say I'm gettin' money, bitch, I'm used to it
Pull up to the club, got these hoes choosin'

But gettin' dumb high, bitch, I'm used to it
When I send her back home, bet her hair ruined
But fuckin' niggas' bitches, man, I'm used to it

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Got a lil boy with big wheels

I'm a hood nigga with a big deal
Got a black girl on four pills, got a white girl need more pills
It's 2012 nigga, so that means I get more skrill
I'm so hood, I'm too real
Hard to stop, and I'm hard to kill
Probably gon die a bachelor, I'm single as a one-dollar bill

Got fish scale, like fish gills
Tryna jack Gucci, that's unreal
Bet a hundred K, you won't live
(It's Gucci!)

[Chorus: Wooh Da Kid]
Red and blue diamonds, it look like a riot

Shoot him up, bang bang, wish a nigga try it
Mike WiLL Made-It, Wooh and Gucci slayed it
My career taking off, his career fading

[Verse 2: Wooh Da Kid]
Used to kick doe, put your hands up

[?] nigga, make a nigga stand up
Chopper shells sit him right back down
Life on mute, won't make no sound
Woo Da king of beasts, fucking up the chain, I don't need no leash
Catch a nigga slippin', and my boys gon feast
I could do it acapella, I don't need no beat
No BS, boys be on that BS
Eighty-thousand worth of diamonds, every time that you see us
I think I should slow it down, can't forget my old flow
My life a mill, been on, Wooh

[Chorus: Wooh Da Kid]
Red and blue diamonds, it look like a riot

Like a preschooler, in my garage playing switcharoo (Huh? What?)
I park the red one, put the yellow front of the blue (Yellow, yellow, yellow)
I had the county blues, now every day I'm counting the blues (Mwah)
No lean in Mountain Dews, Guwop, I'm so proud of you
Accountants count it, two stacks so tall, got a mountain view (Money)
My house so big, this bitch mistook it for the Fontainebleau (Huh?)
First time I copped the Deuce, said, "Guwop, I'm so proud of you" (Skrrt, skrrt)
Guwop still Trap God and they quote me more than Dr. Seuss (Wop)

[Chorus]
I'm way richer than when I got out three years ago (I'm richer than y'all)
I freestyle, don't even write, don't even think no more (I ain't writin' down shit)
Put the lean down, I don't want it, I don't drink no more (Lean, lean)
You ain't my friend, you ain't my round, man, we can't link no more
(Fuck my opps)
Ran out of places to tattoo, can't get no ink no more (No)
Fresh off parole, and I can't go back to the clink no more (No)

Eminem:]
Yeah
It's my life
My own words I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
"Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby

[Hook x2:]
You look like you're in another world
But I can read your mind
How can you be so far away
Lying by my side

[Ludacris:]
Things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be
Like all these fakin' ass rappers in this industry
Talkin' bout what they got, and they ain't got a damn thang
How you own three cars, but you don't own ya own name?
Get ya business right boys, the first class is in session
Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession
Start up ya own company, trademark the name
That's gon' run ya bout a grand so start savin' ya change
Open a bank account quick, and then follow these steps
Sign yourself to yourself and start signin' ya own checks
Hit the booth and start recording at the speed of need
Whatever gets ya juices flowin' could be speed or weed
Get it mixed and mastered, pressed up and plastered
Sell it to ya whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard
Show all the non-believers what you destined to be
And in just a couple years you could be rich like me
But I can't hold my tongue

[Hook x2:]
You look like you're in another world
But I can read your mind
How can you be so far away
Lying by my side

[Lil Wayne:]
Money to be made best believe a nigga clockin
I run it myself like a quarterback option
I pitch a 10 g's tell a bitch to go shopping
She buy herself some clothes, and she bought me back a chopper
See niggas tryna kick it, but no I don't play sucka
I'm all about my cake I'm tryna marry Betty Crocker
A package on the way you know my whip game proper
And enough for one key I see seventy thousand dollas
Now I was shootin dice, smokin on a joint
I bet with Yo Gotti, he hit five straight points
We ova here hustlin, we ova here grindin
You rap about money and nigga might sign ya
You rap about me and a nigga might find ya
Banana in ya ass with ya head right behind ya
DOPE GAME BITCH let his mamma worry bout him
You can holla at me for a fee

[Hook x4:]
You look like you're in another world
But I can read your mind
How can you be so far away
Lying by my side

[Intro: Big Sean & DJ Khaled]
I gotta give thanks, you know?
I never really met nobody who was truly successful that wasn't thankful (Straight up, woah)
For the good and the bad (Go time)
It made me who I am
Straight up, look
DJ Khaled

[Verse: Big Sean]
When it get this dark, you gotta feel your way out
They tried to bury me alive, I Kill Bill-ed my way out
Letting go of grudges that I used to feel a way about
'Cause some emotions are too taxing to keep paying out
Life is what you make it, I know I'll make it for sure, then make it some more
I know critics hate it galore, it doesn't phase me no more
I know some peoples only taste of success is the bite that they take out of yours
My GG told me God laugh at you when you make plans
The type of wisdom that made us men
Plus tryna thank everybody who helped us along the way
Is like trying to name every single member of the Wu-Tang Clan
Yeah, I might skip one or two
But that doesn't mean they wasn't just as part of the plan
Some love goes without saying
Who would've thought that DJ that was on 6 to 10
Right there on 99 Jamz, screamin', "We the best"
Would've had all the execs eatin' right out of his hands?
Showed us all the keys to success from doors being slammed
Look, I gotta thank Khaled, who back in 2010
Convinced Ye, Sean should drop "My Last" shit
It's a smash hit, add Chris to it and it's a classic
That's that rare shit, yeah loyalty everlasting, look
All I know, forever stuck to the code
Only one I changed was 48221 to 90210
Fast forward later, this nigga Khaled my neighbor
The type of stories that you can't make up
The universe doesn't just work it out, man, it works in our favor
What's Heaven on earth, getting everything that you prayed for?
Shit, believe it to achieve it or you never will
On the phone with Colin Kaepernick
He like, "They not gon' make it easy for us in this game and they never will"
I'm like, "That's not just the NFL, bro, that's every field"
Look, no restraints, bitch, only strength
That's my wavelength, surprised I ain't go insane
Heard more gunshots outside than the doorbell rang
And swam with sharks that's too big to fill up tanks
And I'm right here, right now, how could I not give thanks?
Feel my pain, I paint these pics, I spill this paint
I miss my dogs, I spill this drink
I pray that all your growing pains turn gold champagne
Plus I gotta thank my exes on some "thank u, next" shit
And all the old times that gave me new perspectives
Speaking of new, I'm about to ink a new deal, Don Life Records
And put anyone on in the city who needs connections
This that Fortune 500, my shit never plummet
I just bought a mansion and moved in the dungeon, don't none of y'all want it
So all y'all fuckboys that want us to fuck up
Just know I made five hundred plays and not one of 'em fumbled
My vision is tunnel, Sean Don

[Outro: Big Sean]
And I just gotta give thanks
'Cause it's that time
You know what I'm talking about, that grind time
You've been grinding your whole life
It's that time where that preparation meets that opportunity
And you gotta be ready
And give thanks

Where I standeth is holy ground (Holy ground)
I shot him down to the ground, never to be found
No wickedness, only righteousness
But I shot him down to the ground
With word, power, and sound
I fear no evil ground, no, no

Just like the anointed, your judgment shall be tripled
Lord, God
Where thou standeth is holy ground, remember that (Holy ground)
While I standeth on this holy ground (Holy ground)

A rebel is a warrior, just give him a cause
No more badass, no more wars
The state of play ain't pretty over

Or stay incarcerated, feeling nice in all black
The poor still living in a state of shock
The time you took I know I will not never get back, but

You can see the pain in my eyes
See the tracks in my tears
Feel it deep in my body
You don't know where I came from
I can't go back, no, I can't run
I won't do that for nobody
This world's so cold
I can't ever break my code
You won't ever take my soul
You won't ever
And I'm all alone
I ain't got no one to hold
But you won't ever take my soul
You won't ever take my soul
You won't ever

Love is a myth, unless it's your mother, father, and kids
You beg to dif'
Forgive 'em for their ignorance
They not rememberin'
I gotta give them their discipline
Remember when I used to suffer
Struggle through daily pain?
I got it good now
I'm talkin' a mental plane
Silencin' all the noise
Pray for the day I bust a nina on that bitch who shot Selena
Then I rejoice, uh
We some fathers to our boys
Birth a boy, you rich for life, see the joy
I live to see my kids doin' business
Tell 'em everything's business
Basically, everything's a business
So make it your business to get it

You can see the pain in my eyes
See the tracks in my tears

Exactly what you run from, you end up chasing. Like, you can't avoid, but just chasing it and just like trying. Giving it everything that you can. There's always an obstacle.

Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I’m gonna to sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she’s gone
And I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry

I’m gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse]
Next time you see me, things won't be the same
Next time you see me, things won’t be the same
If it hurts you, my darling, you only got yourself to blame

Well, it's a true, true saying, all that shines is not gold
Well, it's a true, true saying, all that shines is not gold
Like the good book says, you gotta just reap what you sow

[Chorus]
Well, you lied, cheated -- whoa-oh! for so long
Well, you lied, cheated -- whoa-oh! for so long
You were wrong to do it, woman, and another queen is on your throne

[Instrumental break with harmonica solo]

Well, my mama told me, my papa told me too
My mama told me, papa told me too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
I went to the depot, I never got there on time
Went down to the depot, never got there on time
My train's going down, she's a-rolling down the line

Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
My train's going down, she's a-rolling down the line

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

Well, my mama told me, my papa told me too
Now, my mama told me, papa told me too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

[Outro]
I think the worst of our intonation difficulties are just about over

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

[Verse 2]
Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

[Verse 3]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

[Verse 4]
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

[Verse 5]
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Verse 6]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

[Verse 7]
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left

[Verse 8]
But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Verse 9]
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I

[Verse 10]
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

[Verse 11]
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

[Verse 12]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

[Verse 13]
Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

[Verse 14]
From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina good-bye

[Verse 1]
I take a little powder, take a little salt
Put it in my shotgun, and I go walkin' out
Jubba jubba (Jubba jubba), wolly bully (Wolly bully)
Looking high (Looking high), looking low (Looking low)
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, ’cause Mister Charlie told me so

[Verse 2]
I won't even take your life, won't even take a limb
Just unload my shotgun, take a little skin
Jubba jubba (Jubba jubba), wolly bully (Wolly bully)
Looking high (Looking high), looking low (Looking low)
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, ’cause Mister Charlie told me so

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Take my silver dollar, take those silver dimes
Fix it up together in some alligator wine
I take a little salt, take a little salt
Put it in my shotgun, and I go walkin' out
Jubba jubba (Jubba jubba), wolly bully (Wolly bully)
Looking high (Looking high), looking low (Looking low)
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, 'cause Mister Charlie told me so
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, 'cause Mister Charlie told me so

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
And if that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Caroline
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
Had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
The Hound broke down
Left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There's people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

[Verse 1]
The first thing I remember knowin' was a lonesome whistle blowin’
And a youngin's dream of growin' up to ride
On a freight train leavin’ town, not knowin' where I was bound
No one could change my mind, but mama tried

Was the only rebel child from a family meek and mild
Mama seemed to know what lay in store
All my Sunday learnin'
For the bad I kept on turnin' 'til mama couldn't hold me anymore

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison, doin' life without parole
No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleadin' I denied
That leaves only me to blame ’cause mama tried

[Verse 2]
Dear old daddy rest his soul, left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Workin’ hours without rest, wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right, but I refused

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison, doin' life without parole
No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleadin’ I denied
That leaves only me to blame 'cause mama tried

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison, doin' life without parole
No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleadin' I denied
That leaves only me to blame ’cause mama tried
That leaves only me to blame 'cause mama tried

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running
I wonder if you care
I had a hard run
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
Lord, I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went back down on to the sea
Try to see what's going down
Lord, try to read between the lines
Had a feeling I was falling, falling, falling
I turned around to see
Heard a voice calling, calling
You was running me back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
I ducked back into a bar door
It was all night pouring
But not a drop on me
Test me, test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jail house
Until the sun goes down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore

Message, message: Would Ron Bowman go talk to the folks at the front door. Ron Bowman to the front door, please

[Verse 1]
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Well, you ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all

[Verse 2]
You got me working, boss man, a workin' around the clock

Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Boss, you ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all

[Instrumental break with harmonica solo]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm gonna get me a boss man, one gonna treat me right

Boss, you ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms, yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby, here I am and I'm a man upon the scene
I can give you what you want, but you got to come home with me
And I've got a whole lot of good ol' loving and I got some in store
When I get through throwin' it on you, you got to come back for more

[Chorus]
Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, I am

[Verse 2]
Action speaks louder than words and I'm a man with great experience
I know you got you another man, but I can love you better than him
Take my hand and don't be afraid, I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free so won't you place your ad with me

[Chorus]
Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, I am

[Bridge]
Give it to me baby, I got to have it, some of your love
It's all I need, early in the morning, late in the evening..
I need it, I got to have it, some of your lovin'...
...got to get some, some of your love...

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Baby, here I am and I'm a man upon the scene

'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, I am

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
I can't stay much longer, Melinda, the sun is getting high
I can’t help you with your troubles, if you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, I gotta get down to the mine

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up ’til four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, or I can't work there no more

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill, keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all, and you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down take your shift at the mine?"

[Verse 4]
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Lotta poor man got the Cumberland blues, he can't win for losing
Lotta poor man got to walk the line just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don’t know now, I just don’t know if I'm going back again
I don’t know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again

[Chorus]
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
A quarter to nine
Hits River Junction
At seventeen to
A quarter to ten
You know it's travelin' again

[Chorus]
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

[Verse 2]
Trouble ahead
The Lady in Red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead
Switchman's sleepin'
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you

[Chorus]
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But we still don't see
Come 'round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams
And the engine just gleams

[Chorus]
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed

[Outro]
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

We're gonna take a short break, probably about ten minutes and then we'll be right back, so we'll see you then

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'm a goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' home
Hey now, get back truckin' home
Hey now, get back truckin' home
WAH, get back truckin' home
WAH, get back truckin' home
WAH, get back truckin' home
Hey now, get back truckin' home

[Instrumental]

Truckin', I'm a goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' home
Hey now, get back truckin' home
Hey now, get back truckin' home
WAH, get back truckin' home
WAH, get back truckin' home
WAH, get back truckin' home
WAH, get back truckin' home
Hey now, get back truckin' home

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot of
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she’d have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I’m seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo’s crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around
I walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, meet you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Rolling over sweetly
Ride out singin’, I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
My sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Come on over and daydream
Sweet, my daydream, come on over and daydream
My sunshine daydream, my sweet flowing daydream
Come on over and daydream
Come on over and daydream
Come on over and daydream, yeah
Come on over and daydream, yeah, yeah
Sweet flowing daydream

[Verse 1]
The warden led the prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
I heard him tell the warden just before they reached my cell
"Let my guitar playin' friend sing my request"

[Chorus]
Sing me back home a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Sing me away, and turn back the years
Sing me home before I die

[Verse 2]
I recall Sunday morning when the choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers, "There’s a song my mama sang
Could I hear it once before you travel on?"

[Chorus]
Sing me back home a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Sing me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1 repeated]
The warden led the prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
But I heard him tell the warden just before they reached my cell
"Let my guitar playin' friend sing my request"

[Chorus]
Sing me back home a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Sing me away, and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die

[Outro]
Sing me back home before I die

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
Well, I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they loaded down
Soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
High-low jack and the winner take the hand

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
My uncle starts winning, cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be, that's me
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
And I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
Well now, we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Verse 5]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
Taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Verse 1]
I want to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're going to know just how I feel
Our love is real, will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, yeah
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, yeah
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Outro]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, yeah
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back in the woods among the evergreens
There in an old cabin made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar like ringin' a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track
The engineers seen him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' to the rhythm that the drivers made
People passin' by would stop and say
"Whoa, my, that little country boy can play!"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 3]
His mama told him "Someday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people comin' from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Someday your name will be in lights
Johnny B. Goode tonight"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode
That's it, see y'all later, bye

[Spoken Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the auditorium, and welcome The Grateful Dead

[Verse 1]
Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
’Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door

[Bridge]
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won’t you come with me?
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody’s choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John’s Band
Playing to the tide
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He’s come to take his children home

[Instrumental break]

[Refrain]
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Outro dialogue]
Thank you

I gotta ask you to take a little consideration and not destroy this place on account of if you do that then we can’t use again. It's probably the best acoustic location around, and--so you can take it from there. We're gonna play this here's music this year, gang. Thank you, thank you

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
I can tell your future
Oh, just look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Like a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
But you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country, sweet Suzie
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Verse 2]
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna get up in the morning and go
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country, sweet Suzie
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Outro]
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Got no chance of losing this time

[Verse 1]
You said you was hurting
Almost lost your mind
'Cause the man you love
Hurt you all the time

[Chorus]
But when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 2]
You love him a little more
When you should be lovin' him less
Why pick up behind him
And take his mess?

[Chorus]
'Cause when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 3]
You love another man
Oh now, girl, you know that I love you
Oh, I know you love him
Stick with him just like glue

[Chorus]
But when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Instrumental break with harmonica solo]

[Verse 4]
Well, he better leave you
Or you better put him down
I just can't stand to see
See you pushed around

[Chorus]
'Cause when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 1]
I can't stay much longer, Melinda, the sun is getting high
I can't help you with your troubles, if you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, I gotta get down to the mine

[Verse 2]
You keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up 'til four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, or I can't work there no more

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill, keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all, and you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down take your shift at the mine?"

[Verse 4]
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away

[Verse 5]
Lotta poor man got the Cumberland blues, he can't win for losing
Lotta poor man got to walk the line just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again

[Verse 1]
Empty pages before my eyes, do not deny or criticize
Empty bedrooms where I paid my dues
Watching the ceiling instead of you
Can you tell me where you're goin'
I don't run around to hear my song
I've got some songs that I'd love to sing
Always brings down some other thing
Where can I go? My hands are broken
It seems like your love is just a token
So won't you stay with me? Oh, stay with me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Up in the morning, out the door
Doing some business that I never know
Come back in the morning with your mouth all poked out
You know I got a mind to put you out

[Outro dialogue]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Well, this job I've got is a little too hard
Yeah, I'm running out of money, Lord, I need more pay
Gonna wake up in the morning, Lord, I'm gonna pack my bags
Gonna beat it on down the line

[Chorus 1]
I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Hey, down the line (Going down the line)
Hey, I'm gonna beat it on down the line

[Verse 2]
Listen, I'll be waiting at the station, Lord, when that train pulls on by
I'm going back where I belong
And I'm going north to my same old used-to-be
Hey, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Chorus 2]
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
I said a coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, that coal mine (Coal mine)
That there coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, coal mine (Coal mine)
Down in Joe Brown's coal mine, yeah

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Yes, I'm going back to that shack way across the railroad track
Hey, that's where I think I belong
Yes, I got a sweet woman, Lord, she's waiting there for me
Hey, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Outro]
I said a happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
Hey, a happy, happy, happy, happy home (Happy home)

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said, "Please
Gentle Jack Jones won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1929 when he stepped to the bar
Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He paid his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over and the rest were sins
Thirteen children, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell
I cut hickory just to fire the still
Took two drinks and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
The sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1 repeated]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said, "Please
Gentle Jack Jones won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
The sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Verse 2]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well, he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Verse 3]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge]
Ladyfinger dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Saint Stephen will remain
All he lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been here so long he's got to calling it home

[Outro]
Fortune comes a-crawling, Calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Going where the chilly winds don't blow
Going where those chilly winds don't blow
Going where those chilly winds don't blow
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
I don't want to be treated this a-way

Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

I don't want to be treated this a-way

You’re going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away

[Outro]
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away (Not fade away)
You know our love will not fade away (Not fade away)

We got a little message here: Ah, would Henry Hobin, Henry Hobin go out into the lobby, somebody wants to see you, Henry Hobin into the lobby

It’s a trick!

[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train
Feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby flagged a diesel down, just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was blowing sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slapping time, Bobby clapping hands
We pined to sing every song that driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to do
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standing right beside me, Lord, in everything I've done
Bobby's body kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Looking for that home I hope she finds
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holding Bobby's body close to mine

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing was all she left for me
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Bridge]
Lelela, lelelala, lelela, lelela, laleleha, laleleha, lalala
Leleleheee, lalala, leleleheee, lalala, leleleha, leleleha
Lala, lala, lala

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Verse 1]
Fare you well, my honey
Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone

Going to leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time - in my time - I will roll, roll roll

[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 2]
River going to take me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back home
It's a far-gone lullaby
Sung many years ago
Mama, Mama, many worlds I’ve come
Since I first left home

[Chorus]
Going home, going home, by the waterside I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I'm going to plant a weeping willow
By the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

[Chorus]
Fare you well, fare you well, I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul...

[Outro Harmonizing]

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feeling so bad
Asked my family doctor just what I had
I say, "Doctor, Doctor, Mister M.D., (Doctor)
Can you tell me (Doctor), what's ailing me?" (Doctor)

[Chorus]
And he said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"

I've got the fever (Baby, yeah), you got the cure (Baby, yeah)

[Chorus]
And she said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" (Yes she did)

'Cause all I need, all I need, ow (Good lovin')

A little bit of good ol' love
A little bit of good ol' love
I just got to have a little good ol' love to keep on going
It's all I need, all I got to have
All I need now, honey
You know that's all I got to have
In the morning, late in the evening
Some of that love, some of that love
I just got to have it in the morning
I just got to have it in the evening
I guess I, I guess I, I guess I gotta get some all day
That's all I need

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Some of that love
Some of that love...just to keep me going
Some of that love at night a-just to keep everything alright
That's all I need, all I need, all I need, all I need
You can't good time without a little lovin'
You can't have a good time at all
You can't have a good time with no love
You can't have a good time without it at all
You got to feel alright
Around the middle of the night
Around the middle of the night
Sometimes you know now fellas, Pigpen a little bit outta hand
You know you got to have a woman 'cause you know you a man
Only thing you need if you want in line
Good ol' woman hanging around all the time
That's all you need, that's all you need
That's all you got to have now
That's all you got to have
Just a little bit of lovin'
Little bit of lovin', little bit of lovin'
Little bit of love, a little bit of lovin'
Yes, I got to get it; yes, I got to get it
Got to get it, got to get it, got to get it, got to get it

[Verse 1 repeated]
I was feeling so bad
Asked my family doctor about what I had
I say, "Doctor, Doctor, Mister M.D., (Doctor)

And he said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" (Yes he did)

[Verse]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

Well, I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
High-low jack and the winner take the hand

[Instrumental break]

My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be, that's me
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, well hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
And then we high-tailed it down to Mexico
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Verse]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Before we get started, maybe we should all take part in an exercise, a simple exercise
I want every one of you out there to stand up real slow, put your hands in the air and turn around real slow
Don't try anything funny 'cause I got you covered
Thank you

[Intro]
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
Oh, she had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, she looked so fine
Delilah she sat down on old Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
And she spoke so kind, talked so fair
Samson said, "Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength become as natural as any old man"

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever has lived on earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around the lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
If I had my way

I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 2]
I been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you about all that went down
It would burn off both of your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
And tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonesome blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 1 repeated]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time

Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down

Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she’d have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She’s got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive, y'all

[Chorus]
Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
Caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on, honey, come along with me

[Bridge]
She’s got everything delightful
She’s got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out, and I wander around
I walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, meet you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
You’re blooming like a red rose
Roll on over sweetly
Ride out singin', I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Come on over, daydream
My deep water daydream, sweet filled daydream
Come on over and daydream, come on over, daydream
Come on over and daydream, sweet flowing daydream
Sunshine daydream, meet you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
We're blooming, blooming like a red rose
Like a red rose, oh...
Sweet flowing daydream

[Verse 1]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I’ll walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 2]
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry today
Didn't hear no baby cry this morning
Didn't hear no baby cry today

[Verse 3]
Where have all the people gone, my honey?
Where have all the people gone today?
There’s no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

[Verse 4]
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I thought I heard a young man mourn today
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

Said your love for me was dyin'
So come on baby, baby please
Come on baby, and I'm on my knees

[Chorus]
Turn on your light, let it shine
Turn on your lovelight, let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

Let it shine (Let it shine on me)
Let it shine (Let it shine on me)
Let it shine on me (Let it shine on me)
Let it shine on me (Let it shine on me)
Let it shine on me
Let it shine
Early in the morning, let it shine
Late in the evening, let it shine...
Just got to have it shine, just got to have it shine
Just got to have it shine, just the site of my heart and soul

[Instrumental Break]

Early in the morning, just before the day is dawning
All I need is some of your love...
All I need, all I need, all I need
Is some of your love

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Early in the morning, just before the day is dawning
Sometimes in my quest to get a little bit, get a little bit more, baby
Hungry for some love, hungry for some love
Hungry for some love, hungry for some love
When I get in it, puts just in a kind of mood
All I do is ask my baby one or two sweet questions
I ask her please, I ask her please
Baby, why don't you do one thing for me, do one thing for me
I want you to roll over, round your lips show love
Turn on over and give me some love
Turn on over and give me some love
Turn over, all I need, all I need is some of your love
All I need, all I need, all I need, all I need is some of your love

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I wanna tell all you fellas now
I see a whole bunch of fellas in the house this evening
And I know that some of you fellas would like to have a little company
Well, if you ain't got no company, I got a plan for you
You ain't got to mess around and look over your shoulder at some little fox...
And tell yourself, well, it sure would be nice to have a little of that company
Because I'll tell you, man, y'all could run around this whole place looking for a little company this evening, and go back home and put your hands in your pockets, and you ain't supposed to be doing that, fellas
There's a lot of places better than your pockets to put your hands in
So I'll tell you what you do:
Now, anybody out in the house this evening, what y'all do, if there happen to be some foxy little lady standing next to you and you got some ideas on your mind, ain't no reason for beating around the bush
Just look next door and ask that young lady one time, hold it
Anybody in the house that sees a young lady next to him that he would like to get next to, I want him to turn around and say, "How would you like to come home into my bedroom this evening?"
I wanna see all you brothers do it
I know a lot of you folks got a lot of trouble out there; myself, I'm cool...

'Cause when I get lonesome, when I get lonesome and it's time to go
All I gotta do is ask my old lady one thing
And you know she knows just what I mean
I say please, I say please, mama, please, girl
All I need is some of your love
All I need is some of your special love shining on me
Shine it on me, shine it on me
It make me feel so nice sometime
It make me feel so good sometime I just can't stand it once in a while
But I ask her one time, I say, please, darlin', after everything else is over
There's one more favor I'd like to ask of you
Get your line, let it shine on me
Get your line, let it shine on me
Sweetly love, sweetly love, sweetly love, sweetly love
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, some of your love, some of your love
Some of your love, some of your love

[Instrumental Break]

My my, makes me feel so good
Ask my baby one time, ask her please
Ask my baby one time, mama, ask her please
Please turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your light, let it shine
Let it shine, a special little thing
I know you got it hid away, 'cause I know it's around someplace
I know you got it hid away, but I've been there before
When I'm in the darkness, I need a little light
In the darkness, need a little light
I know you've got one, I know you've got one
I know you got one, darlin', just waiting for me
Brighten up my day, even brighten up my night
Brighten everything, brighten everything in sight
That sweet little love, all your light
All your light is all I need
Now, please, won't you let it shine, let it shine
Let it shine, shine on me
I need your love (Let it shine)
Let it shine (Let it shine)
Let it shine (Let it shine)
Let it shine (Let it shine), shine on me
Let it shine (Give me your light now)
Let it shine (Give me your light now)
Give me your love (Give me your light now)
Little bit high, little bit high (Little bit high)
Little bit high (Little bit high)
Little bit higher (Little bit high)
Little bit higher (Little bit high), oh
Give me your love (Give me your love now)
You know I need it (Give me your love now)
All I need (Give me your love now)
Oh Lord (Shine on me)
Why don't you give it to me, give it to me (Shine on me)
Give it to me, give it to me (Shine on me)
Give it to me, give it to me (Shine on me, whoa now)
Some of your love, some of your love, I got to have it
Some of your love, some of your love
Give me some love
Got to get it, got to get it, got to get it, got to get it
Got to get it, got to get it, got to get it, got to get it, AH!
(Give me your light now, give me your light now, give me your light now)
Got to get some, some of your love, some of your love, some of your love
I guess I got to, I guess I got to, I got to have it
Can't do without it, baby...
Got to have it, got to have it
I need it, I got to have it...

Thanks, folks

[Intro]
It takes us just a little bit to get everything just exactly right
You know how it is
You'll be happy to know that we got everything just exactly right now

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Caroline
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
Had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
The Hound broke down
Left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There's people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
And if that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

[Verse 2]
Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

[Verse 3]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

[Verse 4]
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

[Verse 5]
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Verse 6]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

[Verse 7]
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left

[Verse 8]
But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Verse 9]
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I

[Verse 10]
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

[Verse 11]
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

[Verse 12]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

[Verse 13]
Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

[Verse 14]
From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina good-bye

[Outro]
I don't know how many of you know that today is Ho Chi Minh's birthday
It's true, I read it in my almanac

[Verse 1]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 2]
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
If you will marry me, all my cities I will free
And free all the people in the area-O

[Verse 3]
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you but your guineas are too few
And I fear my mama would be angry-O

[Verse 4]
What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink?
Saw me marching at the head of my soldiers-O

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, all your cities I will burn
Destroy all the people in the area-O

[Verse 6]
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, combing back your yellow hair
Bid a last farewell to your William-O

[Verse 7]
Sweet William, he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William, he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William, he is dead, and he died for a maid
And he's buried in the Louisiana country-O

[Verse 8]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin’
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
But it's all right 'cause I love you, and that’s not going to change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You guess from the cries you were listening to a fight
Well, you know, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
They're only tryin' to make it through the night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I only want to hold you, I don't want to tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It’s just that I, I, have gotten used to havin’ you around
My landscape would be empty, if you were gone

[Chorus]
But it's alright ’cause I love you, and that's not going to change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
(Brave the storm to come)
Surely looks like rain
Ooh, here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Whole world's turning gray
(Brave the storm to come)
Well, it looks like rain and it feels like rain
(Here comes the rain)
Brave the storm to come
’Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Yes, and the whole world's turning gray
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Oh, here comes the rain
Yes, and it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Oh, here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Yes, and my whole world's turning gray
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, ooh
Ooh, here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come) Brave the storm to come
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh, oh
Oh, here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come) Brave the storm to come
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Oh, here comes the rain
Whole world's turning gray
It looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh, oh
Oh, here comes the rain

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
And don't you run off no more

Don't hang your head, let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Here's a half a dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

[Chorus]
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock you, baby, to and fro
Not too fast, and not too slow

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Bridge]
That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Oh, get down and row
Row, row, row, row


I think Bill's got something that ain't exactly right so he's gonna make it exactly right

[Verse 1]
Firefly, can you see me?
Shine on, glowing, brief and brightly
Could you imagine? One summer day
That same night be on your way
Do you remember? Hearts were too cold
The seasons have frozen us into our souls
People were saying the whole world is burning
Ashes have scattered too hard to turn it

[Chorus]
Upside out, inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Passenger, don't you hear me?
Destination seen unclearly
What is a man deep down inside
But a raging beast with nothing to hide?

[Chorus]
Upside out, inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
But you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Verse 2]
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
Well, I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna get up in the morning and go
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Outro]
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

And get out when they blow

Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 2]

Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy

My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
But I'm in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying
And they tell me where I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry 'bout me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
It's going to be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
Been so long I felt this way
And time's sure passing slow
Still I know I lead the way
They tell me where I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

A prophet on the burning shore
California

Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Bridge]
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me
Them voices telling me you will soon receive me
Shine on the beach, sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me and we will rise to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)

And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
And my work fills the sky with flame
And might and glory going to be my name
And people will light my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me, no
Been so long I felt this way

My time coming, voices say
Don't worry 'bout me

No, no, don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry

Lady with a Fan

Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
'Til my tale is told and done

While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'Til things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

While the fire, it all forms
Smoke flies and they all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing there

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it
In the lion's den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forsake you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
And not disaster

[Instrumental break]

The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise
The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
And not to master

[Instrumental break]

Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

Terrapin Station

Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best, oh
From the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - If it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - But the train's put it's brakes on
Terrapin - And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Some folks look for reason
Others look for fights
I don't trust to nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Oh, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Verse 1]
Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
’Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won’t you come with me?
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody’s choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John’s Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He’s come to take his children home

[Instrumental break]

[Refrain]
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Outro]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Verse]
Saint Stephen will remain
All he lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and the foam
Been here so long he's got to calling it home

[Outro]
Fortune comes a-crawling, Calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

[Verse 1]
Went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's going to be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo, Saturday night now
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Oh, Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the place is going to fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Ow, Saturday night

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought he'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey now, Saturday Night
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Hey, Saturday night now

[Verse 3 repeated]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought he'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey now, Saturday Night
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Hey, Saturday night

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night now (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
(One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night

Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
OW! (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night

Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
OW! (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Refrain]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Verse 1]
Round, round robin run around, got to get back to where you belong
Little bit harder, just a little bit more
A little bit further than you gone before

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Small wheel turn by the fire and rod
Big wheel turn by the grace of God
Every time that wheel turn 'round
Bound to cover just a little more ground
Bound to cover just a little more ground

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Outro]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Verse 1]
A pistol shot at 5 o'clock
The bells of heaven ring
All I leave behind me
Is only what I found

[Verse 2]
If you can abide
Let the hurdy-gurdy play
Stranger ones have come by here
Before they flew away

[Instrumental break]

I will not condemn you
Nor yet would I deny
I would ask the same of you
But failing will not die

Take up your china doll
(Take up your china doll)
It's only fractured
Just a little nervous from the fall

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Like a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

Thank y'all

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running
I wonder if you care
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
Lord, I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down on to the sea
Try to see what's going down
Lord, and read between the lines
Had a feeling I was falling, falling, falling
I turned around to see
Heard a voice calling, calling
You was running me back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
I ducked into a bar door
It was all night pouring
But not a drop on me
Test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jail house
Until the sun goes down
'Til it go down, 'til it go down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
Well, I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
High-low jack and the winner take the hand

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be, that's me
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
Well, I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, well hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
Well then, we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Verse 5]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
Taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left him lyin' there by the side of the road

[Verse 1]
Mary run around, sailin' up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it’s nothing you can stop
Lord, you know they made a fine connection

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it’s true

[Verse 2]
He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her
Don't get in their way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesel train
You better not be there when it rolls over
When that train pulls in, you won’t know it’s been
You gotta try to see a little further

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it’s true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 1]
I have seen where the wolf has slept by the silver stream
And I can tell by the mark he left you were in his dream
Ah, child of countless trees
Ah, child of boundless seas
What you are and what you're meant to be
Speaks his name, though you were born to me
Born to me, Cassidy

[Verse 2]
Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac
I can tell by the way you smile he's rolling back
Come and wash the nighttime clean
Come grow this scorched ground green
Blow the horn and tap the tambourine
Close the gap of the dark years in between
You and me, Cassidy

[Bridge]
Quick beats in an icy heart
Catch-colt draws a coffin cart
There he goes now, here she starts
Hear her cry
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Verse 1]
There was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell
He had a beautiful daughter, the truth to you I'll tell
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell
She had sweethearts a plenty, and men of high degree
But none but Jack the sailor, her true love ever be
Oh, her true love ever be
Now, Jackie's gone a sailing, with trouble on his mind
He's left his native country and his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind
She went down to a tailor shop and dressed in man's array
She climbed on board a vessel to convey herself away
Oh, convey herself away
Before you get on board, sir, your name we'd like to know
She smiled on her countenance, they called me Jack-a-roe
Oh, they call me Jack-a-roe

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
I see your waist is slender, your fingers they are small
Your cheeks too red and rosy to face the cannonball
Oh, to face the cannonball
I know my waist is slender, my fingers they are small
But it would not make me tremble to see ten thousand fall
Oh, to see ten thousand fall

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
The war soon being over, she went and looked around
Among the dead and wounded her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found
She picked him up on in her arms and carried him to the town
She sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds
Oh, to quickly heal his wounds
This couple they got married so well they did agree
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Oh, why not you and me?
Oh, why not you and me?

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin', my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, and it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
Now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't a winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed a man can rest on, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
Cold iron shackles and ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evening train
Well, you know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed

Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Well, you know, people, it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 2]
Drink all day and rock all night
Law come to get you if you don't walk right
I got a letter this morning, people, all it read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Gonna catch a few winks, baby, down under the bed
Better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 3]
I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
Doggie turned to me and he said:
Let's head back to Tennessee, Jed

I woke up a-feeling mean
I went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around, people, the letters read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Chorus]
I was born in the desert, I was raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in the desert, I was raised in a lion's den
You see, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Said I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well, the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would
Know she wish she would

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well now, the doctor call me crazy, sometimes I am and sometimes I ain't
Well now the doctor call me crazy, sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't
See, the preacher man call me a sinner, but his little girl call me a saint

[Chorus]
Said I was born in the desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in the desert, raised in a lion's den
See, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Said I was born in the desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in the desert, raised in a lion's den
You see, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men
You see, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
Don't you run off no more

Don't hang your head, let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Here's a half dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

[Chorus]
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock you, baby, to and fro
Not too fast, and not too slow

[Chorus]
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Bridge]
That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Oh, get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Verse 1]
Firefly, can you see me?
Shine on, glowing, brief and brightly
Could you imagine? One summer day
That same night be on your way
Do you remember? Hearts were too cold
The seasons have frozen us into our souls
People were saying the whole world is burning
Ashes have scattered too hard to turn it

[Chorus]
Upside out, inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Passenger, don’t you hear me?
Destination seen unclearly
What is a man deep down inside
But a raging beast with nothing to hide?

[Chorus]
Upside out, inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

[Verse 1]
As I was walking round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
From the other direction she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion but I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening when the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches and was closing the door
I had one of those flashes I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
Well, I ain't often right but I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way it does in the song
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right

[Verse 4]
Well, there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
There's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand
Everybody is playing in the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?
Come out and play, get out of the door
Playin' cold music on the barroom floor
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
There's a dragon with matches loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Long distance runner, one foot at the door
Caught in slow motion, fall to the floor
You gave all you had, you, fall to the floor
You gave all you had, why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more it will take
That thin line beyond which you really can't fake

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental]


Thank you. We're gonna take a short break. We'll be back in just a few minutes, so everybody hang loose

[Intro]
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
Yeah, she had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, she looked so fine
Delilah she sat down on old Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
And she spoke so kind, and talked so fair
Samson said, "Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength become as natural as any old man"

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever has lived on earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around that lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

I've been asked to announce that if you're doing anything that the law don't allow, you ought to be very careful because the law's here tonight. So live and let live

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said, "Please
Gentle Jack Jones won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1929 when he stepped to the bar
Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over and the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack in Big Foot country
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell
I cut hickory just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1 repeated]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said, "Please
Gentle Jack Jones won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Spoken Intro]
We just cut something up and now we're gonna see if we can remember it

We got a plan here, it’s long and involved, and it's gonna take quite a bit of work on our behalfs to remember it all, so what you gotta do is wish us good luck. So at the count of three, wish us good luck. 1, 2, 3...thank you, we needed that

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
But I’m in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying
And they tell me where I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry 'bout me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
I’ll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I’m going to shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Gonna be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
Seems so long I felt this way
Time sure has been slow
Still I know I lead the way
And they’ll tell me where I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don’t worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Bridge]
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me
Them voices telling me you will soon receive me
Shinin' on the beach, sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me and we will rise to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)

And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
And my work fills the sky with flame
And might and glory going to be my name
And people will light my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me, no
It's gonna be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
This afternoon, streets turned gray
And I watch the fire below
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me

[Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, I know where I'll go

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothing's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Verse 2]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Now he's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothing's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Same old, rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's going to bring him back, he's gone
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
(Gone, gone, he's gone for good)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around
(Coming around) Coming around (Coming around)
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind-man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Verse 1]
Been walking all morning went walking all night
I can't see much difference between the dark and the light
And I feel the wind, and I taste the rain
Never in my mind to cause so much pain

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind-man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
From day to day just letting it ride
You get so far away from how it feels inside
You can't let go 'cause you're afraid to fall
But the day may come when you can't feel at all

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind-man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill
Only love can fill
Only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Verse 2]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well, he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge]
Ladyfinger dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty and talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

[Verse 1]
I want to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're going to know just how I feel
Our love is real, will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running
I wonder if you care?
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
Lord, run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down to the sea
Try to see what's going down
Maybe read between the lines
Had a feeling I was falling, falling, falling
Turned around to see
Heard a voice calling
You was runnin' back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
Ducked back into a bar door
It was all night pouring
Lord, but not a drop on me, oh no
Test me, test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jail house
Until the sun goes down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha don't you come around here anymore

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha don't you come around here anymore

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore
Anymore

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in the desert, raised in a lion’s den
See, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from other men

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a wanted man in Texas
Busted jail and I'm gone for good
Said I’m a wanted man in Texas
Busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well, now the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would
Know she wish she would

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well now, the doctor call me crazy
Sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't
Said the doctor call me crazy
Sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't
See, the preacher man call me a sinner
But his little girl call me a saint

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
See, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from other men

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
See, I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion’s den
You see, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from other men
You see, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from other men

[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper
Just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday
In a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City
Just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls
And get out when they blow

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill
Mama told the sailor
One go up and one go down
Leave nothin' for the tailor
Just like Jack and Jill
Papa told the jailer
One heat up and one cool down
Do yourself a favor

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto
Just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush
Aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelley
Just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains and count your change
Try to walk the line

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Verse 4]
Goodbye, Mama and Papa
Goodbye, Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
Either side of the hill

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 1]
I have seen where the wolf has slept by the silver stream
And I can tell by the mark he left you were in his dream
Ah, child of countless trees
Ah, child of boundless seas
What you are, what you're meant to be
Speaks his name, though you were born to me
Born to me, Cassidy

[Verse 2]
Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac
I can tell by the way you smile he's rolling back
Come wash the nighttime clean
Come grow this scorched ground green
Blow the horn, tap the tambourine
Close the gap of the dark years in between
You and me, Cassidy

[Bridge]
Quick beats in an icy heart
Catch-colt draws a coffin cart
There he goes now, here she starts
Hear her cry
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine

[Outro]
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said, "Please
Gentle Jack Jones won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin’ down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1929 when he stepped to the bar
Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin’ down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

Tumble down shack on Big Foot country
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell
I cut hickory just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin’ down

The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down

And it looks like the old man’s gettin' on

[Verse 1]
The first thing I remember knowin' was a lonesome whistle blowin'
And a youngin's dream of growin' up to ride
On a freight train leavin' town, not knowin' where I was bound
No one could steer me right, but mama tried

Was the only rebel child from a family meek and mild
Mama seemed to know what lay in store
In spite of all my Sunday learnin'
For the bad I kept on turnin' 'til mama couldn't hold me anymore

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison, doin' life without parole
No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleadin' I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame 'cause mama tried

[Verse 2]
Dear old daddy rest his soul, left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Workin' hours without rest, wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right, but I refused

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison, doin' life without parole
No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleadin' I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame 'cause mama tried

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison, doin' life without parole

That leaves no one but me to blame 'cause mama tried

[Verse 1]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 2]
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, combing back your yellow hair
Bid a last farewell to your William-O

[Verse 3]
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
If you will marry me, I will set your cities free
And free all the people in the area-O

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you but your guineas are too few
And I fear my mama would be angry-O

[Verse 5]
What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink?
Saw me marching at the head of my soldiers-O

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 6]
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, all your cities I will burn
Destroy all the people in the area-O

[Verse 7]
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, combing back your yellow hair
Bid a last farewell to your William-O

[Verse 8]
Sweet William, he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William, he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William, he is dead, and he died for a maid
And he's buried in the Louisiana country-O

[Verse 9]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Verse 2]
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
Well, I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna get up in the morning and go
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
You can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down

Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Chorus]
Let it flow, let it flow, wide and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

[Pre-Chorus]
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Chorus]
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
And if that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Outro]
Thank you. We're gonna take a short break and we'll see y'all in just a little bit

[Verse 1]
Lazy lightning
That sleepy fire in your eyes
Is that desire in disguise?
I keep on trying but I
I can't get through
Lazy lightning
I'd like to find the proper potion
To try to capture your emotion
You're right beside me but I
I can't get through

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Just a loop of lazy lighting
Must admit you're kind of frightening
But you really get me high

[Verse 2]
Lazy lightning
When I hear your velvet thunder
You seem so near I start to wonder
Would you come closer if I
If I asked you to
Lazy lightning
The way you're messing with my reason
It's an obsession but it's pleasing
Tell me a lie and I will swear
I will swear it's true

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Liquid loop of lazy lightning
Must admit you're kind of frightening
You're a loop of lazy lightning

[Bridge]
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
Rope of fire ever tightening (Tightening)
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
It's either lunacy or lightning
It's frightening

Loop of lazy lightning, hoo

[Verse 3]
Lazy lightning
They say you never start the same place
I want a double dose in my case
I'd fly a kite if I thought
Thought that would do

[Outro]
Lazy lightning
The way you always electrify me
Someday I know you'll satisfy me
And all that lightning will be
My lightning, my lightning too
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Come on lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)

[Verse 1]
Well, dizzy ain't the word for the way that you're making me feel now
Got to help me
Well, I need some indication, good Lord, is it real now
Got to help me, girl
Well, I've heard it said, baby, there's something wrong with my head now
Got to help me, girl, now
Could it be infatuation or am I just being misled now?

[Outro]
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
It's sparking my imagination
Got to fight me now
Cause me such excitation
Girl, don't fight me now
Well, cause me excitation
Got to like me now
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
Cause me such excitation
Girl, don't fight me now

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day which could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Verse 2]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smoking leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayed for better weather

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
When your big old ship comes in, the first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Oh, across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river

[Intro]
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets

[Verse 1]
Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street
They're dancing in Chicago
Down in New Orleans
In New York City

[Pre-Chorus]
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be laughing and singing, music swinging
Dancing in the streets
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere around the world

[Chorus]
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets

[Verse 2]
This is an invitation across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
There'll be swinging and swaying, music playing
Dancing in the streets
Philadelphia, P.A
Baltimore and D.C. now
Can't forget that Motor City

[Pre-Chorus]
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be laughing and singing, and music swinging
Dancing in the streets
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere around the world

[Chorus]
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets

Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere around the world

[Outro]
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets

Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets

[Verse 1]
Cosmic Charlie, how do you do?
Trucking in style along the avenue
Dum de dum de doodley do
Go on home, your mama's calling you

Kalico, Kahlia, come tell me the news
Calamity’s waiting for a way to get to her
Rosy red and electric blue
I bought you a paddle for your paper canoe

[Bridge]
Say you'll come back when you can
Whenever your airplane happens to land
Maybe I'll be back here, too
It all depends on what’s with you

[Verse 2]
Hung up waiting on a windy day
Kite on ice since the first of February
Mama keeps saying that the wind might blow
But standing here I say I just don't know
New ones coming as the old ones go
Everything's moving here but much too slowly
A little bit quicker and we might have time
To say "how do you do" before we're left behind
Calliope wail like a seaside zoo
The very last lately inquired about you
It's really very one or two
The first you wanted, the last I knew

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I just wonder if you shouldn't feel
Less concerned about the people unreal
The very first word is, "How do you do?"
The last, "Go home, your mama's calling you"

[Outro]
Calling you, calling you
Go on home, your mama's calling you (Calling you)
Go on home, your mama’s calling you (Calling you)
Go on home, your mama’s calling you (Calling you)
Go on home, your mama's calling you (Calling you)
Go on home, your mama’s calling you (Calling you)
Go on home, your mama's calling you (Calling you)
Go on home, your mama's calling you (Calling you)
Go on home, your mama's calling you

[Verse 1]
As I was walking round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
From the other direction she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion but I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening when the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches and was closing the door
I had one of those flashes I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
I ain't often right but I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way it does in the song
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
Well, there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand
Everybody is playing in the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Verse 2]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well, he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge]
Ladyfinger dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills
Yes it does

[Verse 1]
I want to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're going to know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Saint Stephen will remain
All he's lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and the foam
Been here so long he's got to calling it home

[Outro]
Fortune comes a-crawling, Calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on. Under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
And jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, walking in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Come on over sweetly
Ride out singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, Sunshine daydream
Come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, could be coming from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, wading in a cold stream
Crawl on out your window
Going, going where the wind goes
They're never gonna miss us
Ride out singin', I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream, woo
Sunshine daydream, woo
Sunshine daydream, woo
Sunshine daydream, woo
Sunshine daydream, come along and daydream
Sunshine daydream, depending on your daydream
Sunshine daydream, and I just wanna daydream
Sunshine daydream, woo
Sunshine daydream, woo
Sunshine daydream, woo
Sunshine daydream, woo
Sweet lovin' daydream
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Well, I married me a wife
She's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well, she's coming down the stairs
Combing back her yellow hair
And I ain't going to be treated this old way
This old way
And I don't wanna be treated this old way

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Well, I married me a wife
She's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Oh, run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow

[Verse 1]
I have seen where the wolf has slept by the silver stream
And I can tell by the mark he left you were in his dream
Ah, child of countless trees
Ah, child of boundless seas
What you are, what you're meant to be
Speaks his name, though you were born to me
Born to me, Cassidy

[Verse 2]
Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac
I can tell by the way you smile he’s rolling back
Come and wash the nighttime clean
Come grow this scorched ground green
Blow the horn, tap the tambourine
Close the gap of the dark years in between
You and me, Cassidy

[Bridge]
Quick beats in an icy heart
Catch-colt draws a coffin cart
There he goes now, here she starts
Hear her cry
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine

[Outro]
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Verse 1]
Cold iron shackles and ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evening train
You know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed

Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Got a letter this morning, people, here’s what it read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won’t you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 2]
Drink all day and rock all night
Law come to get you if you don't walk right
Well, you know it is like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Catch a few winks, baby, down under the bed
Then head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 3]
I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My dog, he turned to me and he said:
Let's head back to Tennessee, Jed

I woke up a-feeling mean
I went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around sure enough and the letters read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won’t you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain’t no place I'd rather be
Baby, won’t you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
You see, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
See, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Said I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well, the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well now, the doctor call me crazy, sometimes I am and sometimes I ain't
Said now the doctor call me crazy, sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't
See, the preacher man call me a sinner, but his little girl call me a saint

[Chorus]
Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
See, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Well now, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
Come on all you pretty women
With your hair hanging down
Open up your windows
'Cause the Candyman's in town
Come on, boys, and gamble
Roll those laughing bones
Seven come eleven, boys
I'll take your money home

[Chorus]
Look out, look out the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 2]
I come in from Memphis
Where I learned to talk the jive
When I get back to Memphis
Be one less man alive
Good mornin', Mr. Benson
I see you're doing well
If I had me a shotgun
I'd blow you straight to hell

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Come on, boys, and wager
If you have got the mind
If you got a dollar, boys
Lay it on the line
Hand me my old guitar
Pass the whiskey 'round
Want you to tell everybody you meet
That the Candyman's in town

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 1]
Now, baby used to stay all night long
Made me cry, Lord, she done me wrong
Hurt my eyes open, baby, that's no lie
Tables turnin’, now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it’s all over now (Over now)
Oh yes, I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)

[Verse 2]
Well, she used to run around with every man in town
Spend all my money, Lord, out playing her high class game
Put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Table's turnin', now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)
Oh, I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Lord, I used to wake up in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I got worried, Lord, she eased my achin’ head
But now she’s here and there with every man in town
Still tryin' to take me for that same old clown

[Chorus]
’Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Now, baby used to stay out all night long
Made me cry, Lord, she done me wrong
Hurt my eyes open, baby, that's no lie
Tables turnin’, now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep that night 'til the morning came around

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
If he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 4]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:

[Verse 4 repeated]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Chorus]
Let it flow, let it flow, wide and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

[Pre-Chorus]
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Chorus]
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
Someone turned out the lights in musicland

[Verse 1]
There he goes
My baby walks so slow
Sexual tic-tac-toe
Yeah, I know we both know it isn't time
But would you be m-mine?
We'll never get too far
Just you, me and the bar
So in a menage a trois sometimes
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?

[Chorus]
Oh baby, lights on, but your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone with this fever, fever, yeah
I want it all
Now, I'm going to get you alone
Give you a fever, fever, yeah

[Verse 2]
There it goes
You stole my soul, and so
'Cause sweetheart, no-no-nobody a-no-no-knows
They're occupied
Tempted to be ma-mine
Let's get inside your car
Just you, me and the stars
Kind of menage a trois sometimes
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?
Could you be m-mine?
Yeah

[Chorus]
Oh baby, the lights are on, but your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone with this fever, fever, yeah
My one and own
Now, I'm gonna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever, yeah

[Break]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh baby, lights on, but your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone with this fever, fever, yeah
I want it all
Now, I'm gonna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever, yeah

[Outro]
Fever, fever, yeah
Yeah
Fever, fever, yeah
Fever, fever, yeah

[Chorus: Donna Missal]
We got that bad love, but it taste like medicine
I never had love, so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought I'd have to choose
Between paradise and you

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I still creep on your 'Gram, oh
See you with you and your man, oh
And I scroll, and see the pictures you deleted
Like the history ain't happened, long as we cannot see it
Getting back is insanity, and we repeat it
Momma said we need counseling
But I can't reason with a terrorist
Oh, this is embarrassing
You ain't Cinderella, ain't no pumpkin turning into fuckin' carriages
You create a narrative, people ask me "Where's she been?"
Send her packing, now she's living back out at her parents' crib
Fight, break up, we fuck, we fight, break up, you know the deal
Vent to friends and tell them, "This the last time, I'm for real"
You text me, then the next thing you know, I'm behind the wheel
Pull up, fuck you in the backseat thinking this will help us heal
There's no use for you texting my phone
Got FOMO the minute I walked out the door
Can't get in the gate because I changed the code
Now you can toast to the love we don't make anymore

[Chorus: Donna Missal]
We got that bad love, but it taste like medicine
I never had love, so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought I'd have to choose
Between paradise and you
And now I'm free (oh oh)
I'm free, yeah (oh oh)
I'm free, yeah (oh oh)
Now I'm free, yeah (oh, oh)
(And now I'm free)

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Back on the "Why didn't you text me?"
Back on the "Shit, I was busy"
Back to us raising our voices
Back on that nobody's listening
Back to those horrible choices
Back on you moving back home
'Cause I would rather live in Hell than get comfortable sleeping alone
Back to that lying deception, back to the self-will
Back on that "Well, she don't do it, and I know that somebody else will"
You cheated, I cheated, you cheated, I cheated, I mean it, please Father, forgive us
The dirt that you've done and the secrets that we swept up under the rug that are gonna die with us
And I tried to cut the ties so many times
That I finally gave up on the scissors
We are both sinners, if we both lie to ourselves
That is just selfish, that isn't commitment
I try to hold it and I try to hold it and
Numb to it all and ignoring it
I'm just searching where the closure is
Going in circles, not noticing
But in my heart, I know I'm not over it

[Chorus: Donna Missal]
We got that bad love, but it taste like medicine
I never had love, so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought I'd have to choose
Between paradise and you
And now I'm free (oh oh)
I'm free, yeah (oh oh)
I'm free, yeah (oh oh)
Now I'm free, yeah (oh oh)
(And now I'm free)

And, baby, you know it's obvious

[Chorus]
I'm a sucker for you
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly

[Chorus]
If I could travel through time, I think I
Would tell myself from the past, "You'll be fine"

[Verse]
But what you don't know is the fun part of passion
And its the place where I think all the fun begins
What you don't see is what you believe
But to be is the place where the angels dance
What you don't hear is the voice of fear
When you get passed that is when your life appears
What you don't touch is what you won't clutch
But you'll latch on tight when the coast is clear

[Chorus]
If I could travel through time, I think I
Would tell myself from the past, "You'll be fine"

[Part 1]

[Intro: Steve Lacy]
Hello
This is about me and what I am
I didn't wanna make it a big deal
But I did wanna make a song, I'll admit
Uh, I just wanna, just see who can relate, who's out there
You know, it's like, bro, um
I don't know if you can still relate
You know, and that's what I'm afraid of
I just wanna relate to everyone, so

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
How many out there just like me?
How many work on self-acceptance like me?
How many face a situation like me?
I wonder, oh
How many out there just like me?
How many others not gon' tell their family?
How many scared to lose their friends like me?
I wonder, I wonder

[Post-Chorus: Steve Lacy]
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder

[Verse 1: Steve Lacy]
I only feel energy, I see no gender
When I talk 'bout fish, I wanna catch ya, I'm a fisher
Now they debate on who I like, they wanna see a list of
Girls and boys out here so they can see if I'm official
I tell 'em, ooh, come down, this ain't your life found
If you want to smile, if you're happy for me now
I hope you can relate, if you can't right now
You might be a little late or you might never get it down
But who like

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
How many out there just like me?
How many work on self-acceptance like me?
How many face a situation like me?
I wonder, oh
How many out there just like me?
How many others not gon' tell their family?
How many scared to lose their friends like me?
I wonder, I wonder

[Post-Chorus: Steve Lacy]
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really...

[Verse 2: Daisy]
Ah, I used to wanna be normal
I used to lay out the labels and pray that one of them stuck
I used to beat myself up, but it's too abstract to scratch past
So I ain't asking for an answer like that (No, no)
I'm over hoping for a box to check, a giant past to connect
I' argued with myself over breakfast, yeah
I scavenge my mind, but she rides in spirals counter to clockwise
I'll be your passenger (When you're too distracted to drive)
And I'll be your lover (If you think you're down for the ride)
Ain't got a preference, a wifey or a boyfriend
Or something in-between, we don't need no categories

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Daisy]
How many out there just like me? How many out there?
How many work on self-acceptance like me?
How many face a situation like me?
I wonder, oh I wonder, I wonder
How many out there just like me? How many out there?
How many others not gon' tell their family?
How many scared to lose their friends like me?
I wonder, I wonder

[Post-Chorus: Steve Lacy]
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder

[Part 2]

[Verse]
I cried to the window
No one heard my pain, just my window
Tears cried on my pillow
I'm in need of a flower, bring some willows
I cry in the window (Ah)
Uh huh (Ah)

[Part 3]

[Verse]
I fade away
We'll all fade away
I fade away
We'll all fade away
I fade away
We'll all fade away
I fade away
We'll all fade away
I fade away
I fade away
I fade away
I fade away
I fade away

[Chorus]
Know you wanna play 'round
Well, baby, I'm on the playground
Hop on up, get on down
And wiggle that thing that's so round

[Verse 1]
Somethin' in the way you treat me like you do
Two can play the game when it feels so right next to you
And we can leave up out of here, bring your body here
Two can feel the same on nights where love is the plan

[Chorus]
Know you wanna play 'round
Well, baby, I'm on the playground
Hop on up, get on down
And wiggle that thing that's so round
Know you wanna play 'round
Well, baby, I'm on the playground
Hop on up, get on down
And wiggle that thing that's so round

[Verse 2]
Remember all the days you left me by the phone
You love to hesitate, now you are the second place
You must have saw me out holdin' hands with someone else
Baby blink without a doubt, I see the signs you keep givin' me

[Bridge]
Yeah, shake on, shake it down like what
Shake on, shake it down, that bridge
Shake on, shake it down like what
Shake on, shake it down, that bridge

[Outro]
Sometimes people say
We just run away
But we keep comin' back
To ya
Our mistakes
Make us great
We shine, you're gold
Know you wanna play 'round

[Chorus]
I could be your guide, know you're gonna keep it under
I've been there before, you just got to get over
Other side of this picket fence built by jokers
I could get you here, you just got to get over

[Post-Chorus]
You just got to get over
I know you want to get over
Say you got to get over
Now you just got to get over

[Verse]
If you can climb
Hop it, baby, oh
You could find
Just somethin', baby

[Chorus]
I could be your guide, know you're gonna keep it under
I've been there before, you just got to get over
Other side of this picket fence built by jokers
I could get you here, you just got to get over

[Post-Chorus]
You just got to get over
I know you want to get over
Say you got to get over
Now you just got to get over

[Verse]
If you can climb
Hop it, baby (Oh)
You could find
Just somethin', baby
If you can climb (Oh)
You could find

[Verse 1]
I need an intervention
I'm in this situation
I scratch, but it's still itchin'
I yearn for his affection
'Cause I'm addicted to this drug

[Chorus]
You're my addiction
I can't find the diction of what I feel
Your touch is a trip
And I hate coming down, coming down
Said I hate coming down, coming down
Yeah, I hate coming down, coming down
Yeah, I hate coming down, coming down

[Verse 2]
I need some self-discipline
Where do I start to begin
Who can I call to help me?
In need of somethin' heavy, yeah
'Cause I'm addicted to this drug

[Chorus]
You're my addiction
I can't find the diction of what I feel
Your touch is a trip
And I hate coming down, coming down
Said I hate coming down, coming down
Yeah, I hate coming down, coming down
Yeah, I hate coming down, coming down

[Verse 1]
I want some touch
All over my body, give some love
To me, my dove

[Refrain]
Let me get inside of your core
Let me live inside of your core
Let me hide up under your core
Let me live inside of your core

[Verse 2]
I want a kiss
All over my face and even my lips
While I grab your hips

[Refrain]
Let me get inside of your core
Let me live inside of your core
Let me hide up under your core
Let me live inside of your core

[Verse 3]
I've had enough
Tired of the meaningless, feelingless fucks
These days, in lust we trust

[Refrain]
Let me get up out of your core
Let me live outside of your core
Let me ease on out of your core
Let me live outside of your core

[Verse 1]
I swear there's something in the wind outside today
And it ain't cool
Got me thinking 'bout how things decay
And about you

[Chorus]
But I'll be fine, I have to set delay
Before I try to fall in love, not pain
Yes, I'll be fine, I just can't rush
Not again, not again, no, not again

[Spoken interlude]
Fuck, why is falling in love so hard?
I think I'm just moving too quickly
Based on the patterns I've been studying on myself
Of the most scientific research and I think
That I should just take things a little slower
You know, I've learned a lot in experience
You know, I'm grateful to be in this place right now, ayy

[Verse 2]
I swear there's something 'bout a loss there is to gain
Perhaps a lesson
If you do it once, don't do it again
Unless it's destined, oh

[Chorus]
But you'll be fine, you have to set delay
Before you try to fall in love, not pain
Yes, you'll be fine, you just can't rush
Not again, not again, no, not again

[Intro: Amandla Stenberg & Steve Lacy]
I feel like we really just wrote that together with, like, minimal effort
Yeah, it's nothing
You're just like, "What?"
Get the bare maximum
We're giving 'em a little intro
That's nice

[Instrumental]

[Part I: Outro Freestyle]

[Refrain 1: Steve Lacy]
I'm the only star, I shoulda left ’em 'fore they fall
Put in so much work, I check in like a 9 to 5
They protectin' shit, I’m feelin' how I do in love
I can't even lie, I think I was really high

[Verse 1: Steve Lacy]
Rolex on a wrist watch, bitch, I'm Chris Rock
And these niggas always hating me, but they binge watch
I should have a show on Netflix that they friends watch
Copped the dealer, now we're reckless
I'm a big boss like I'm Rick Ross

[Interlude: Matt Martians]
Yeah, man
You niggas already know what the fuck going on, man
I'm lying
Apollo 21, you fuck niggas better catch up, man
This shit over, this shit is over
Steve Lacy

[Refrain 2: Steve Lacy]
Call me number two ’cause really, I think I’m the shit
You be talking 'bout that money, money, you don’t get
You be talking 'bout the pussy, pussy, you don't hit
You be sucking dick, you be, you be sucking dick

[Verse 2: Steve Lacy]
Apollo double-X-I, fuck a double-X-L
I've been eating my greens, I’ve been eating my kale
All these niggas, they chips, all these niggas, they stale
I'm so, I'm so hot, you'd think I was from Hell

[Outro: Steve Lacy]
Outro, outro, out, out, outro, out
Outro, outro, out, out, outro, out
Outro, outro, out, out, outro, out
Outro, outro, out, out, outro, out
Outro, outro, out, out, outro, out
Outro, outro, out, out, outro, out
Outro, outro, out, out, outro, out
Outro, outro, out, out, outro, out

[Part II: 4ever]

[Chorus]
Please take the wheel forever
With you, I feel no effort
Show me the way to never
Land where you stay forever

[Post-Chorus]
Forever, forever
-Ever, forever

[Chorus]
Please take the wheel forever
With you, I feel no effort
Show me the way to never
Land where you stay forever

[Post-Chorus]
Forever, forever
Ever, forever

[Outro]
Forever

[Intro: Justine Skye]
Ooh, ah

[Verse 1: Blood Orange & Justine Skye]
Started smirking, system broken
Dogs are barking on the terrace
Such a force, exchange my thought
Change, we're tired, fuck that
Takin' that down, drinkin' that gin
Say it stands for all I am
Where's my brother, moving backwards
Falling deeper on my classics
Make a statement, I lost my way
I used to say where I'm heading
Anyway, fuck that
Take it back, (Take it back) fuck that
I take it back, (Take it back) fuck that
I take it back, (Oh-oh, that) fuck that
I take it back, (I'd just take it back) fuck that
Yeah (But fuck that)
(Mm, but fuck that)

[Interlude: Blood Orange & Justine Skye]
I've been fucked so the odds aren't even
It's time for freedom
Put us right back
All for you

[Verse 2: Arca]
Vente para acá
Que ya no quiero esperar más a que me llames
Un día cualquiera en que te vi
Tu me has cachao'
No hay otra manera de decirlo
Tu me has cachao'
Papi, como tu no tienes idea

[Verse 1 - Reprise: Blood Orange & Arca]
Started smirking, system broken (Me has cachao')
Dogs are barking on the terrace  (De una manera)
Such a force, exchange my thought
Change, we're tired, fuck that
Takin' that down, drinkin' that gin
Say it stands for all I am

[Verse 3: JOBA]
The skies remain broken, you can't take back a bullet
That shit will see right through it, one shot to make it through it
See, I'm a bit manic depressive, glad I didn't do it
If not for you I would've, you and your family knew it
See we were both born different, science can't weigh the spirit
I wish I called sooner, guess that's my smoking gun
Discovered intuition with you aside an institution
Like you, I pick my truth, not sure what you believed in
But through you I saw me different, in you I found solution
What's clear as day is dark as night, I cannot see shit
Back out with all my demons, blacked out for all my reasons
My reflected image vanished in an instant

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Nights, flying down the 10, nearly 2 AM
Happiness begins
Days lifted in a haze, we weren't just a phase
We weren't just pretend (Just pretend)

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I remember low lows and high highs
We threw our hands up, palms out to the skies

[Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
It was fun when we were young and now we're older
Those days when we were broke in California
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster
It was fun when we were young and now we're older
Those days that are the worst, they seem to glow now
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster with you

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh (Oh, oh)
But I'd come back and ride that roller coaster

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Faith led me to the clouds, reaching for the ground
'Cause life was upside down
Now everything has changed, we found better days
But I still hear the sound

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I remember low lows and high highs
We threw our hands up, palms out to the skies

[Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
It was fun when we were young and now we're older
Those days when we were broke in California
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster
It was fun when we were young and now we're older (Oh)
Those days that are the worst, they seem to glow now (Yeah)
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster with you

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Woo-ooh-ooh (Yeah, with you)
Woo-ooh (With you, with you)
Woo-ooh-ooh (Oh, oh)
But I'd come back and ride that roller coaster

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
It was fun when we were young and now we're older (Oh)
Those days that are the worst, they seem to glow now (Yeah)
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Nights, flying down the 10, nearly 2 AM
Happiness begins

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Mr. Misdemeanor
Call me up and say you're needin' my love
Now you say you're leaving, oh yeah
Like you never even needed my love
Then I don't even see you (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Not even for a weekend or a month
So much you left between us (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
But you don't ever think about us (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Why do, why do, why do, why do I want you
Even though you make it hard and I don't want to?
And now I'm out here catching feelings like I want you
But all you ever do is look a-, look away

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
You're always on my mind, it doesn't matter what I do, I do
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
But keep me on the line, if loving you's a crime
Then I won't keep my love locked down for you
Every single time

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Yeah, I remember when we met
Like it was yesterday in Amsterdam (Smoke it up)
Making love through every season
Oh, every day, oh, every day
And I can't believe it now (I can't believe it)
You think, you think it's only physical (Oh no, no)
No good at getting even
The way you play, the way you play

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Why do, why do, why do, why do I want you
Even though you make it hard and I don't want to?
And now I'm out here catching feelings like I want you
But all you ever do is look away

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
(I keep on coming)
You're always on my mind (Always on my mind)
It doesn't matter what I do, I do
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
(I keep coming back to you)
But keep me on the line, if loving you's a crime
Then I won't keep my love locked down for you
Every single time

[Post-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Every single, every single time
Every single, every single time
Every single, every single time
Love locked down for you

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Because there's too much water
Under this bridge to go down like this
I never thought that we'd come this far
To **** it all up and e-end like this

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
You're always on my mind, it doesn't matter what I do (I do)
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
But keep me on the line, if loving you's a crime
Then I won't keep my love locked down for you
Every single time

[Post-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Every single, every single time
Every single, every single time
Every single time
Every single, every single time
Every single time
I'm in love with a good woman
Who understands
She can't go far in this world
If she hasn't got a good man

I'm in love
I'm in love, love, love

Love
Make me feel good all over
I'm in love
I know y'all know what I'm talkin' about
It's like this
I feel just like a baby boy
On Christmas Day with a brand new toy

I'm in love, yeah
I'm in love, love, love

Make me feel good, do it again
Do it again and again and again
If you got somebody you can call your very own
I know y'all know what I'm talkin' about
I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you
Let it be me

Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever
Let it be me

Each time we meet, love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love
What would life be?

So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always
Let it be me

Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love
What would life be?
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always
Let it be me

[Intro: Mehki Raine]
Billie

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Snippet

[Intro]
Ooh, Yeah-ah-eah
Yeah
Bye, Bye

[Verse 1]
I can't control my emotions
Give me a minute
I just tryna find peace
I recognize it’s impossible
I still reach for whatever will run my mind
Recognize I‘m the root of all my afflictions
Oh, you gettin' bored?
Doin' too much just to show you love
I ain’t got the stomach for it
Get it, get it, go be in some other girl

[Chorus ?]
Hands up for you
Guard down, and you shootin' still
Guard down, and you shootin' still
Guard down, and you shootin' still
Hands up for you
Guard down, and you shootin'
I got my guard down, and you shootin'
Guard down, and you shootin' to kill
Ooh, Yeah-ah-eah
Yeah

[?]
Ooh

[Verse 2]
I swear
Could be the way you don't handle all me
I’d be ashamed just to share your loses
I do, I do
Go run away if you really want it
Got me ashamed, put your name on it
All for nothing

[Intro: 6LACK]
Ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: 6LACK]
You can hit my line if you need me (Ayy)
Stars in your eyes when you see me (Ayy)
Food for thought, not for a thot
I drip a lot, I check the time up on my watch
It's drip o' clock, it's six o' clock, yeah
You can get this shit, it don't stop
You can't even buy a fucking drive for the low (Oh)
I got so much drip, make a nigga slip, hoes on my hip, yeah
I know I'm the shit, such a pro at this, need a starter kit, yeah

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, I be, there for you, believe me if I swear to you
If I cuff you promise ain't no sharin' you, say it
You cut from a different cloth, they don't make this material
Gave me your all now my love imperial, play it
It's drip o' clock, with the shits or not
We hit the spot I hit your spot, hit you with this Glock
That pussy good, I'm tryna' kill, like it's a opp
When you said you need some more time, let you get a watch
Just to let you know what time it is
I'ma break your heart, just like no promises, I promise this
"You love her? Treat her like me," that's what my mama said
And if that nigga start acting up, just hit my line instead
For real

[Chorus: 6LACK]
You can hit my line if you need me (Ayy)
Stars in your eyes when you see me (Ayy)
Food for thought, not for a thot
I drip a lot, I check the time up on my watch
It's drip o' clock, it's six o' clock, yeah
You can get this shit, it don't stop
You can't even buy a fucking drive for the low (Oh)
I got so much drip, make a nigga slip, hoes on my hip, yeah
I know I'm the shit, such a pro at this, need a starter kit, yeah

[Open Verse]

[Chorus: 6LACK]
You can hit my line if you need me (Ayy)
Stars in your eyes when you see me (Ayy)
Food for thought, not for a thot
I drip a lot, I check the time up on my watch
It's drip o' clock, it's six o' clock, yeah
You can get this shit, it don't stop
You can't even buy a fucking drive for the low (Oh)
I got so much drip, make a nigga slip, hoes on my hip, yeah
I know I'm the shit, such a pro at this, need a starter kit, yeah

[Verse 1]
I wanna be alone
Alone with you - does that make sense?
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest

[Verse 2]
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right so stay a sec

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
You're all I wanted
Just let me hold you

Like a hostage

[Verse 3]
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak

[Verse 4]
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
And nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
You're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Hold you

Like a hostage

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl, this love's amazing
Kissing, let’s get it, get at me, do that shit
Pretty young thing, can you be mine, babe?
You wanna smoke with me, get faded
Fuck slowing down
Pick it up, pick it up, roll
In my bed, it's going down
Can I get you all alone?
Think I'ma roll the dice, roll the dice, roll the dice tonight
’Cause I'm 'bout that life
Want all night, that'll change your life
Think I'ma roll the dice, roll the dice, roll the dice tonight (Roll up, roll up, roll up, roll up)
(Haha, leggo!)
And you my lucky number
(Look, look)
I'ma roll the dice

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Okay, I'm rollin' and rollin’ and takin’ a chance
Throwin' this money and makin’ her dance
My clothes different, I smoke different
That top flight, that Peter Pan
But I gotta bigger booty in my face right now
Big tig ol' bitties and her waist slimmed down
And she pullin' on my hands, lookin' in my pants
A nigga ’bout to give her all this money right now (Okay)
Lay down, lay down backwards
Lick it, write my name in cursive
This spell out some bad words
Own it like I own it
She hop it on it, ride it backwards
Girl, don't stop doin' that damn thing
Throwin' all these dead presidents
'Cause that pussy is my campaign
Vote for it, vote for it, that yaya
Girl, that cookie make a nigga go broke for it, broke for it
I know you wet, I ain't ever gon' let you drown
That's what a real nigga got a boat for, boat for
10 car garages, let's have a ménage
And let's get it poppin' in a four-door, four-door
I started makin' it rain
But I got so much ice on, I'ma make a snow storm
It's awfully cloudy, in my section I'm smokin' maui
Blowin' four O's, that's an Audi
R8, no license plates
A nigga was born in '89, how the fuck we spendin' money from '88?
I guess that means that I'm before my time
And I'm first place and you a second late, yikes!

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
Girl, this love's amazing
Kissing, let's get it, get at me, do that shit
Pretty young thing, can you be mine, babe?
You wanna smoke with me, get faded
Fuck slowing down
Pick it up, pick it up, roll
In my bed, it's going down
Can I get you all alone?
Think I'ma roll the dice, roll the dice, roll the dice tonight (Roll the dice)
'Cause I'm 'bout that life
Want all night, that'll change your life
Think I'ma roll the dice, roll the dice, roll the dice tonight (Roll up, roll up, roll up, roll up)
(Yeah, yeah)
And you my lucky number
I'ma roll the dice

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
Look, K-Mac comin' straight from the eighties (Eighties)
A nigga dabbled in crack in the eighties (Eighties)
Callin' out all the single, pretty ladies
Which one of y'all wanna have my pretty babies? (Babies)
Oh, I think it's you (You)
Or maybe even you but I like her too (Too)
All y'all cute so a nigga can't lose (Lose)
I'ma roll the dice, daddy need a new pair of shoes (Pair of shoes)
They the new black ones that I got from Louis (Louis)
Big house, big broad, livin' in the boonies (Boonies)
I be so fly, yeah, I got the honies (Honies)
And they give me good brain, I don't fuck with dummies (Fuck with dummies)
You know you got that fire, why you trippin'? (Why you trippin'?)
Take a look around you, you ain't got no competition, huh (Competition)

[Intro: James Blake]
All those days in, all that stays in
I don't keep it, I won't be here for it
All those days in, all that stays in
I don't keep it though, I won't be here for it

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Blood on my hands and it look like candy
I pay-ay lawyers and the mic can't stand me
Ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
I got lood on my hands and it look like candy
I pay-ay lawyers and the mic can't stand me
Ya-yah, turn me up, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
Ya-yah, ya-yah

[Verse: Raekwon]
This what kings do, talk paper and skate
You know what this what kings do, lay up and stack in the gate
This what kings do, throw family first, it's real
This what kings do, thinkin' about flying the 

[?] up
This what kings do, vacay lands in Egypt
This what kings do, rake down plans with speeches
This what kings do, make sure mama is right, yup
This what kings do, hit Dubai in a night
And this how kings move, yo, hoe your money and invest wise
Whether you selling buttons or select pies
A king move, keep it silent, no one else dies
We all pharaohs in Camaros flexin' S5's (Uhuh)
It's what kings do, this how a king move (What up, son?)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, ayo

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Blood on my hands and it look like candy
I pay-ay lawyers and the mic can't stand me
Ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
I got lood on my hands and it look like candy
I pay-ay lawyers and the mic can't stand me
Ya-yah, turn me up, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
Ya-yah, ya-yah

[Verse 1]
I have gone insane-o
I lust for volcano
Be with molten lava
Give me my nirvana
I have no vertigo
I lust for tornado
Be a leaf upon air
Venusian mal-de-mer (Oh)

[Chorus]
Venusian sickness dire
I want to be set on fire
Venusian, gather while I
Venusian-ly catch on fire
Auto-cremate
Self-immolate

[Verse 2]
Like a bird in a cage
Aerostat habitat
To motion, I am slave
Give me hell, I want that
Venusian sickness
Venusian bilious
Venusian nausea
Venusian mal-de-mer (Oh)

[Chorus]
Venusian sickness dire
I want to be set on fire
Venusian, gather while I
Venusian-ly catch on fire

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Drive me crazy, make me mental
No other buttons she can push
One second she's Miss Sentimental
Then she’s afraid she's said too much

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Opposites attract and we're the livin’ proof of this
But I keep on comin' back like a magnet

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
'Cause when you love her
No matter the fight you know she's always right
And that's alright
And they say love can hurt
But seein' her smile can get you every time
Yeah, every time
Because you love her, la-la-lala-lala
Love her, yeah

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
I put my selfish ways in boxes
And shipped 'em back to where they came
Will never let it get close to bein' toxic
And I promise I’ll never walk away

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Opposites attract and we’re the livin' proof of this
But I keep on comin’ back like a magnet

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
'Cause when you love her
No matter the fight you know she's always right
And that's alright
And they say love can hurt
But seein’ her smile can get you every time
Yeah, every time
Because you love her, la-la-lala-lala
Love her, yeah

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Gotta learn to let the small things go
And know it's always far from perfect
And I know that we can get emotional
But the hardest parts are always worth it

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
'Cause when you love her
No matter the fight you know she's always right
And that's alright
And they say love can hurt
But seein' her smile will get you every time
Yeah, every time
Because you love her, la-la-lala-lala
Love her, yeah

[Outro: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Because you love her, la-la-lala-lala
Love her, yeah

[Verse 1]
Don't need no directions, baby

Who like it, who want it?
Just tryna put my name on it
Three o'clock in the morning
Who be hittin' me horny?

[Pre-Chorus]
You, you
Don't know what you deserve
Baby, baby, it's true

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
Oh, imagine a land, it's a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam
Where you wander among every culture and tongue
It's chaotic, but hey, it's home

[Pre-Chorus: Will Smith]
When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west
And the sand in the glass is right
Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
As you wind through the streets at the fabled bazaars
With the cardamom-cluttered stalls
You can smell every spice
While you haggle the price
Of the silks and the satin shawls

[Pre-Chorus: Will Smith]
Oh, the music that plays
As you move through a maze
In the haze of your pure delight
You are caught in a dance
You are lost in the trance
Of another Arabian night

[Chorus: Will Smith]
Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
More often than not are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways
Arabian nights
Like Arabian dreams
This mystical land of magic and sand
Is more than it seems

[Bridge: Will Smith & Frank Welker]
There's a road that may lead you
To good or to greed through
The power your wishing commands
Let the darkness unfold or find fortunes untold
Well, your destiny lies in your hands
Only one may enter here
One whose worth lies far within
A diamond in the rough

[Chorus: Will Smith]
Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
They seem to excite, take off and take flight
To shock and amaze
Arabian nights
'Neath Arabian moons
A fool off his guard could fall and fall hard
Out there on the dunes

[Intro]
Uh

[Verse 1]
Both hands on the wheel
Shades on, you know it's real
Me and my bitch smoke and kill
We at the top, so we know the deal
My niggas got no chill
And we don't pop no pills
We just get money
Ain't tellin' on myself cause one of these niggas will
Pillow talking with me as your topic
These niggas funny than a muhfucker
Remember days I was broke
Then I seen it all come together
Good clothes for the bad weather
Good dope in my lungs
Surprisingly, this is what they wanted for me
It's room in the safe, so we ain't done

[Interlude]
I'm talkin' 'bout gangster-gangster
Real gangster shit, gang-gang, nigga
Gang over everything, we been doin' this shit
Fuck wrong with you lil' niggas?
Ain't shit changed, it's the motherfucking gang
Don't get gang banged on, and we rollin' up them planes
Taylor!

[Verse 2]
Gettin' checks in my sleep
Livin' my dreams, so I'm wide awake
Feel bad for the nigga Meek
I stay out of trouble in my hideaway
Might drive the foreign ride today
Might tell my driver he could drive
Started small, now we smokin' out the turkey bag
You a 

[?] turkey, these is hunting grounds
I'm the reason your son's serving pounds
She say my voice get her moist
We turn boys to men
Now we mentor you little boys
Treat the foreign whip like a toy
Or I'm pullin' up in my six-fo'
Rags to riches, killin' these niggas
Throwin' the body bags in ditches

[Interlude]
I thought I told you niggas, the gang ain't gon' stop
It don't matter what y'all niggas do
It don't matter what y'all niggas say
It don't matter how much y'all niggas copy our style
We the originators of this shit
It's the motherfucking gang
And if you forgot, we here to remind y'all niggas
Fuck wrong with y'all niggas, huh?
You bitch! Pittsburgh, Taylor Gang, Young Khalifa
Fuck you, and your stupid ass rules
Young bitch
Young ass nigga, hahaha

Take pictures out of all the frames
Pack up your love with all your things
See if it helps, give it a week
I bet no one else gets you like me

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
'Cause I know you think you’re better off without me now
Sayin' all you need is space
But baby, we can work this out

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
But don't throw it away this time, just take a little time to think
Don’t throw it away, it's fine, just don't forget to think of me
Don't throw it away, your mind is messin' with your head again
Instead of walkin' away we should give it a break 'til we know what to say
Don't throw it away

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Don’t save the words ’til it's too late

Why can't I when everybody fakes it?
Well, they think I'm happy
Like they know exactly how I feel
It ain't real, but they still think

They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm sad

[Intro: Joe Jonas]
I don't trust myself when I'm around you
I don't trust myself when I'm around you

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
Lately, I don't think I even know me
Every time you come around, I'm like the old me, old me
Take me back to when you were my only
Well, we were thicker than thieves, like a pod, two peas

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
And all at once, it's like I'm being someone else, yeah
You're all I want, but I know that you're bad for my health

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I don't trust myself when I'm around you
I don't trust myself when I'm around you
Doing things I never do, acting like a damn fool
I don't trust myself when I'm around you

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
I know that I'm better off without you
But I know that I could never live without you, 'out you
Thinkin' 'bout my lips upon your mouth, yeah
Got me weak in the knees, my God, can't breathe

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
And all at once (All at once)
It's like I'm being someone else (I can be your someone else)
All I want (All I want)
I know that you're bad for my health (Oh no, no)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I don't trust myself when I'm around you (Hey)
I don't trust myself when I'm around you (Without you, baby)
Doing things I never do (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Acting like a damn fool
Yeah, I don't trust myself when I'm around you
(When I'm around you, baby)

[Bridge: Joe Jonas]
I don't trust, I don't trust myself

Doing things I never do (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Acting like a damn fool
Yeah, I don't trust myself when I'm around you

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
I came here looking for another excuse
To run away from something beautiful
It's like it’s driving me closer to you
Every step back pulls me right back to you

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Time stands still and it's only us
What we feel started way before we ever touched
Just imagine only us
Yeah, you found me right before I'd given up

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I just saw the lightning strike
Knew it right then when I looked in your eyes
And I said to myself, "It’s no surprise we ain't strangers"
Strangers tonight
Must be from a different life
Been here before and it just feels right
No, this ain't the first time for you and I, we ain't strangers
Strangers tonight

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Strangers (strangers)
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers tonight
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers tonight

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
You say my name like it's been on your lips
Familiar in ways I can't explain
You got a heart that I know I can miss
Hold me like that and pull me right back again

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Time stands still and it's only us
What we feel started way before we ever touched
Just imagine only us
Yeah, you found me right before I'd given up

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I just saw the lightning strike
Knew it right then when I looked in your eyes
And I said to myself, "It’s no surprise we ain’t strangers"
Strangers tonight
Must be from a different life
Been here before and it just feels right
No, this ain't the first time for you and I, we ain’t strangers
Strangers tonight

Strangers  (Strangers)

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Come back to me, baby, I'll come back to you
You know the place that I go runnin’ to
I get scared when you're scared but what else can I do?
Come back to me, baby, I'll come back to you

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Wherever you are right now
Know somehow
I’ll be on the way like a bat out of hell
Heaven knows I'm proud but I'll turn 'round
Baby, if you stay then I won't let you down, oh
Whatever we've done, whatever we'll do
Baby, if you come back now
I'll come back to you

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Come back to me, baby, I’ll come back to you
Light up the world like only you can do
If you’re lost on the way then I'll get lost too
Come back to me, baby, I’ll come back to you

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Wherever you are right now
Know somehow
I'll be on the way like a bat out of hell
Heaven knows I'm proud but I'll turn ’round
Baby, if you stay then I won't let you down, oh
Whatever we've done, whatever we'll do
Baby, if you come back now, I'll come back to you

[Bridge: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Ooh-ooh

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Come back to me, baby, I'll come back to you

Come back to me, baby, I'll come back to you

[Intro]
Gang, gang gang
Gang over everything
Once a nigga get some money in they pocket
Loud weed in they paper
Then shit changed

[Verse]
Lighten up like a pair of S-Beezy's
I might this shit look easy
As soon as you see me, you gon' believe me, times 3
My team succeed through anything
Whole boxes of raw papers get used and abused
In the presence of G's, they get confused
Out of town, blowin' on jet fuel
My hoes throwin' up the set
We don't tolerate no disrespect
Lames get checked
Everything tatted to my neck
She don't fuck with me cause I break bread
Better fake dead
Smoke you out, say she can't feel her legs
Could go to the club, but we just get stoned instead
My only motivation is the bread
Gotta do what you gotta do
Move how a boss move
Always been the man with the plan
Have a joint lighter in my hand
She rollin' Instagram

[Outro]
Gotta get that paper, though
Get that paper, though
That's why we keep them papers rolled
Keep them papers rolled
Get that paper, though
Get that paper, though
Keep them papers rolled, keep them

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish]
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once (That's better)
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, all I see is him right now
H-h-him right now

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
(Thanks)

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish]
Your love feels so fake
My demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now (Ahh)
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow them out
(B-b-blow them out)

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
7-4-2008
I still remember that
Heaven sent a present my way
I won't forget your laugh
Packing everything when you leave
You know you coming back
Wanna see me down on my knees
But that was made for a ring
I try to wait for the storm to calm down
But that's stubborn, baby, leading to war
We droned down on each other
Tryin' to even the score
We all been found guilty in the court of aorta

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
And I'll watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Outro: Billie Eilish & Vince Staples]
Watch your car, watch your car burn
I won't forget your laugh
Go ahead and watch my heart, watch my heart burn
You know you coming back, you know you coming back
Watch your car, watch your car burn
(Go ahead and watch my heart, watch my heart burn)
Tryna even the score
Go ahead and watch my heart, watch my heart burn
Found guilty in the court of aorta

[Verse 1]
Aw
I'm the shit, need a toilet (aw)
Swerve like an alcohol
Fuck is up, can't call it (aw)
Pussy ass niggas, why these bitches keep callin'
Lit off an eight, and a whole lot of vodka
If I take another shot, I'd be face like a boxer
12 A.M tryna figure out my options
I'ma call baby over to the sheets and it's poppin'
Raw like ahi
Cook it, chop it, bag it, fuck it, boot it, boppa
Same shit happen when the friend start watchin'
Couch potato pussy get mashed on the sofa
I like when she drunk, but I prefer when she sober
A nigga like me ain't got time for no convo
S-T-F-U, your Uber just left you
Prayer hands sex me 'cause bitch I just blessed you
T-Reverend, I'm hot like Campbell's and my soup all zero
Hunnids in casino, yeah I'm all about dinero
Tried to save the bitch, but fuck being a hero
Dog ass nigga and my leash came from Goyard
My whip from a graveyard, yours from a junkyard
Everything new but you already knew dog
I got a new checkbook, and it's signed T-Raw

[Chorus]
I'm the shit, need a toilet
Fuck is up, can't call it
Hello, I'm ballin'
Cook it, chop it, bag it, I'm ballin'
I'm the shit, need a toilet
Fuck is up, can't call it
Hello, I'm ballin'
Cook it, chop it, bag it, I'm ballin'

[Verse 2]
Like Kobe with 81
I got an '88 Camaro just to ride for fun
And these bitches chew my dick like bubble gum
I make these bitches taste 

[?]
Saint Laurent, double up, my jacket got the fur on
Raw daddy, endless, skeet on them bitches
My bitch so bad, skip 

[?]
All about my green faces, 

[?]
My nigga A from Oakland, so we keep the barrel smoking
Smokey like a bear papa, hunnid kush, roll it
Nigga try to see me, get kilt by appointment
Your son wanna be me, get fly in the Lambo
Hello, I'm ballin'
Ain't shit poppin' but the number on my jersey
Dirty ass niggas couldn't look this perfect
My team every level only barely scratch the surface
Bitch!

[Chorus]
I'm the shit, need a toilet
Fuck is up, can't call it
Hello, I'm ballin'
Cook it, chop it, bag it, I'm ballin'
I'm the shit, need a toilet
Fuck is up, can't call it
Hello, I'm ballin'
Cook it, chop it, bag it, I'm ballin'
Hello, I'm ballin'
I'm ballin
Hello, I'm ballin'
Cook it, chop it, bag it, I'm ballin'
I'm ballin
Hello, I'm ballin'
Hello, I'm ballin'
Cook it, chop it, bag it, I'm ballin'
Wake up everybody no more sleepin' in bed
No more backward thinkin' time for thinkin' ahead
The world has changed so very much
From what it used to be
There is so much hatred war an' poverty
Wake up all the teachers time to teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen to whatcha have to say
'Cause they're the ones who's coming up and the world is in their hands
When you teach the children teach em the very best you can

The world won't get no better if we just let it be
The world won't get no better we gotta change it yeah, just you and me

Wake up all the doctors make the ol' people well
They're the ones who suffer an' who catch all the hell
But they don't have so very long before the Judgment Day
So won'tcha make them happy before they pass away
Wake up all the builders time to build a new land
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand
The only thing we have to do is put it in our mind
Surely things will work out they do it every time
The world won't get no better if we just let it be
The world won't get no better we gotta change it yeah, just you and me

Change it yeah, change it yeah, just you and me
Change it yeah, change it yeah
Can't do it alone, need some help y'all

If you disrespect anybody
That you run in to
How in the world do you think
Anybody's s'posed to respect you

If you don't give a heck 'bout the man
With the Bible in his hand
Just get out the way
And let the gentle man do his thing

You the kind of gentleman
That want everything your way
Take the sheet off your face, boy
It's a brand new day

Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot, na na na na
Respect yourself, respect yourself

If you're walking 'round
Think'n that the world
Owes you something
'Cause you're here
You goin' out
The world backwards
Like you did
When you first come here

Keep talkin' 'bout the president
Won't stop air pollution
Put your hand on your mouth
When you cough, that'll help the solution

Oh, you curse.. around women folk
And you don't even know their names
And you dumb enough to think
That'll make you a big ol man

Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot, na na na na
Respect yourself, respect yourself
Respect yourself, respect yourself
Free, free, set them free
Free, free, set them free
Free, free, set them free
If you need somebody
Call my name
If you want someone
You can do the same
If you want to keep something precious
You got to lock it up and throw away the key
If you want to hold onto your possession
Don't even think about me

If you love somebody
If you love someone
If you love somebody
If you love someone, set them free
Set them free
Set them free
Set them free

If it's a mirror you want
Just look into my eyes
Or a whipping boy
Someone to despise
Or a prisoner in the dark
Tied up in chains you just can't see
Or a beast in a gilded cage
That's all some people ever want to be
If you love somebody
If you love someone
If you love somebody
If you love someone, set them free
Set them free
Set them free
Set them free

You can't control an independent heart
Can't tear the one you love apart
Forever conditioned to believe that we can't live
We can't live here and be happy with less
So many riches
So many souls
With everything we see that we want to possess

If you need somebody
Call my name
If you want someone
You can do the same
If you want to keep something precious
You got to lock it up and throw away the key
You want to hold onto your possession
Don't even think about me

If you love somebody
If you love someone
If you love somebody
If you love someone, set them free
Set them free
Set them free
Set them free
Set them free

[Intro]
Doin' what I gotta do, doin’ what I gotta do
This life is not for you
Uhh, woah woah woah woah

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
That's just the ways, yeah
I swear that's just the ways
I can’t change how I was raised
You know that's just the ways
That's just the ways, that's just the ways
That's just the ways, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I overthink too much, that's just how I was raised
I'm dealin' with choices that no one around me ever had to make
The result of going down the road less paved without ways
That’s just the ways, that’s just the ways
That's just the ways, yeah yeah
Dad cheated on Mom, that’s how I was raised
So how do you expect me to have different ways?
Broken marriages somehow get inherited
I'm embarrassed to say, but that's just the ways, that's just the ways, yeah
So how do you expect me to be financial
And manage the money that everyone ’round me can't handle?
How do you expect me to be a leader
If I never seen one?

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Cause that's just the ways, yeah yeah
That's just the ways, that's just the ways
That's just the ways
I can't change how I was raised
Blowing weed, yellin' "Fuck the police" every other day
Seen fiends to crack every day, that's just the ways
That's just the ways, yeah yeah
Cause that's just the ways
That's just the ways, that's just the ways
That's just the ways

[Verse 2]
At least I thought so until I got it from a different angle
Back when the closest thing to Arizona was the much mucho mangos
I was drained, though
Going through life no strings attached, still gettin' tangled
Before I knew I was the one that realized the strings was handled by angles
Thinkin' I don't wanna have a kid in this world and it might go to waste
Having a son with a gun on his waist
Falling victim to the system that we can't escape
Stuck in the city like a never ending maze
Treating problems like they ain't problems and they a phase

[?] raise cause he can't take advice I never gave, yeah yeah
Cause if Dad treated Mom with a little respect, yeah
Then he gon' grow up and find the right girl to protect
Cause family businesses ands good marriages somehow get inherited
When life give you that message, it's up to you to translate, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Cause that's just the ways, that's just the ways
That's just the ways
I realize I can't change how I was raised
And give somebody something they never gave
Cause that's just the ways, that's just the ways
That's just the ways, yeah
That's just the ways
I ain't gotta be stuck in my ways
That's just the ways, yeah yeah
That's just the ways, that's just the ways
That's just the ways

[Outro: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Way, way
It's like this for you
Way, way
That's just the ways, that's just the ways
That's just the ways, yeah, yeah (ways)
Oh ah
Oh ah
That's just the ways, that's just the ways
That's just the ways, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, Both]
Walk in the party with my dick in my hand
Then straight to the bathroom with my dick in my hand
You wanna step up? I got the brick in my hand
Then leave your ass face down with my dick in my hand
I'm Mark McGwirey, buff not wirey
Alex P. Keaton is who I admirey
And I know that it's true, 'cause I read it in your diary
Your spirit, your bat, and your crotch, all fiery
Bash Brothers, fast lovers
We be fuckin' faster than chattering teeth
Chattering teeth
We're two little Jack rabbits fuckin' in our cleats
All you silly billy big ol' titty biddies
Wanna see my willy-dilly vibing me willy-nilly
And we getting silly honeys but I don't mean silly funny
Snow bunny, city bunny, even Ms. McGillicuddy
And we're making silly money
While you play with silly putty
Then I'm bashing with my buddy
And I'm bashing with my buddy
Wearing fashion with my buddy
Playing saxes with my buddy
Snorting a relaxant
While evading taxes with my buddy

[Bridge: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, Both]
I'm a gladiator (I'm a gladiator)
My body's a machine (My body's a machine)
I hit home runs (I hit home runs)
'Cause I'm focused as fuck
Where is the limit? (There are no limits)
And what is the goal? (To make dad love me)
To make dad love me (To make dad love me)
To make dad finally love me!

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer]
I got one hundred cardboard cutouts of Kathy Ireland all in one room
I run through that shit naked make 'em all watch me fuck myself with a broom
Oh, Kathies, all my Kathies
You're the only ones that know my pain
And you're the only ones that see my shame
Hey yo, José
Come on, man, we're late for the game!

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer]
Step into my crib, everything smell like Coolwater
And if you come into mine you know it's Drakkar Noir
Now have a seat on this couch made of horse leather
I'm told the horse that it's from could run fast and far
Whoo, that shit is sexy
Tell the maitre'd at your booty to expect me
I'm solo and I'm flexin' but don't try to Soloflex me
NordicTrack all day
Squats in the living room, can I get a witness?
The greatest aphrodisiac is physical fitness (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
So take off your Guess and let go of your stress
'Cause the classiest shit is what comes next

[Chorus: Sia, Andy Samberg & Akiva Schaffer]
Silk robes and kimonos
Silk robes and kimonos
Change outta your own clothes
These athletic days, but, oh, those Oakland Nights
Silk robes and kimonos
It's our pleasure to no-noes
Pumps and pantsuits all day
All work, no play, no way
It's time for Oakland Nights

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer]
In the bedroom, champagne on ice
I make erotic shadow puppets in the candle light
Your hair's crimped, all frizzy 'cause you're frivolous
I feel like Macho Man and you my Miss Elizabeth
Sizzlish, do some crunches and some scissor kicks
Body shaved slick like an exquisite fish
Drag your Lee Press-On Nails down my hairless chest
Now, pull my sash, my body shakes like a leaf
Revealing the cloth of my cheetah-print briefs
And I love the way your high-cut thong
Make your butt long
Now take 'em off
But you know what to leave on

[Chorus: Sia, Andy Samberg and Akiva Schaffer]
Silk robes and Kimonos
Silk robes and Kimonos
Peel off your pleated polos
These athletic days, but oh those
Oakland Nights
Silk robes and Kimonos
I pound the taiko drum in your dojo
Days in padded blazers
Filing papers, no more
It's time for Oakland Nights

[Outro: Sia]
Silk robes and kimonos
Silk robes and kimonos
I'm a pro when I bone but I do it pro-bono
You work hard days so you deserve the Oakland Nights
We're the Oakland Knights of the Round Table
Plus I'll take you out to pizza at the Round Table
Pizza, my favorite pizzeria in Oakland
But bring a change, 'cause you can't wear your silk robe in

[Intro: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone]
Welcome back to Sports Chat
I'm standing here with two fellas who are having a heck of a year, the Bash Brothers
At this point, guys, I think everyone knows who you are
But just in case, why don’t you introduce yourselves?
Oh, okay, well

[Chorus: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer]
They call me José
And I'm Mark
José
And I'm Mark

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer]
Go, José, go, oiled up like Rambo
Take the needle out my butt and hop in the Lambo
The anabolics got me feelin’ bionic
'Cause you know I'm indestructible
I'm José, I'm Mark
You're a stud, and you're a thoroughbred stallion
Necks laced up with the let's bash medallion
Rollin’ to Hilltop Mall to get a pager
Got girls of every flavor because we’re in the majors
Freaks, hit up my Skytel, I'll come mess up your Maybelline
My beeper beeping more than my dialysis machine
Kidney failure’s just part of the game
We're not ashamed now the world knows my motherfucking name

[Chorus: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer]
They call me José
And I'm Mark
José
And I'm Mark

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer]
Canseco, can make the hoes go low
Slow-mo for your bro, one time otro
Nineteen-eighty-ocho the year of the lobo
The whole Bay love me because I’m so bolo
Speeding through San Fran
Got a pass from the po-po
Pumpin' my andros then wash 'em down with SoCo
Try and touch my Jheri curls I'll put you in a chokehold
Hit the Taco Bell and drop the extra guacamolo
Hotbox the whole Lambo with pakalolo
And teach me that taekwondo, though
Well step into my dojo
Cocaine fists cave your nose hole
They don't know, thoughWe like Samwise and Frodo
But also like Dorothy and Toto
But way more swole, bro
Our bodies are loco, that's why they're chanting

[Chorus: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer]
José (José! José! José!)
And I'm Mark
José (José! José! José!)
My name is Mark McGwire, I play first base

[Outro: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer]
They call me José (José, José, José)
(And I'm Mark, And I'm Mark And I'm Mark)
And I'm Mark
José (And I'm Mark, I'm Mark)
And I'm M-m-m-m-Mark

[Verse 1: Akiva Schaffer]
Papa did you see me hit a home run last night?
I lit the stadium on fire, I was Oakland's pride
Daddy, did you see me?
(Look what I can do, yeah)
Daddy, do you hear me crying? (Crying)
Daddy, can you see I'm dying? (Dying)
Oh, Dad
Tell 'em, José

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg]
Ever since little league
Middle school, middle league
Always played technically
Perfect like a symphony
Little me got much bigger, faster, stronger, Dad
Hit it so long, but you always want it longer, Dad
But therapy's for losers
Little boy, therapy's for losers

[Verse 3: Akiva Schaffer & Andy Samberg]
Buy all my steroids in bulk (Costco)
Wanna get big as The Hulk (Hogan)
Stronger than Wolverine teeth (Logan)
Answer to 'Where's the beef?' (Slogan)
First, I put on my jock
Then both of my socks
Parachute Hammer pants and my Reeboks
Hot tub inside a limousine at Chuck E. Cheese
Dad, look at me

[Interlude: Reporter, Andy Samberg]
José, heard you went on a pretty hot date the other night. Care to tell us about it?
Hey, come on. You guys know I don't kiss and tell

[Verse 4: Akiva Schaffer, Andy Samberg]
Oh, I went on a date with MadonnaShe said that she wanted Cuban babies
She seemed like a smart business lady
But I didn't find her physically attractive
I went on a date with my mama
Took her out for all-you-can-eat shrimp
She said she was proud of her baby (That's me)
So, I guess we both had a wild week
Therapy's for losers, Dad said
Therapy's for losers

[Outro: Akiva Schaffer, Andy Samberg, Both]
Keep your mouth shut
No snitchin'
About the steroids
No snitchin'
About the steroids
About the steroids
About the steroids
About the steroids
Don't fuck up a good thing while you got it

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg, Akiva Shaffer]
She said she wanna fuck me with my uniform on
She grabbed me by the bat, now it's going, going, gone
I never finish sex 'cause I'm so juiced out
But she nutted three times then we bashed then I bounced
I reside in Blackhawk in a big fucking house
My community is gated 'cause I don't strike out
Got a room with a chair, got a room with a couch
Got a framed photograph of the time I met Alf
You know I'm not a hamburger but they call me Big Mac
Got the one ton Jimmy and the itty-bitty sack
My ball shrinky-dinky 'cause the 'roids so strong
But it makes the aforementioned Jimmy-jam look long
The name is Mark, and no I'm not Mork
And yes, I eat pork 'cause it's tasty on my fork
And no, I'm not a jork but I'll jork it out the pork
'Cause Noah should have had the Bash Brothers on his Ork
We are the perfect pair to start a new society
Filled with home-run hitting gold glove Goliathes

[Interlude]
Here's what I found on the web for "What is the plural of goliath?": Goliaths

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg, Akiva Shaffer, Both]
Oh, we're Goliaths, baby boy
Kirk Gibson’s a pariah, baby boy
I work out with a tire, baby boy
I wonder who can lift it higher, baby boy
Ahh! Lift that tire, bitch
Put your back in it and lift it higher, bitchStab that needle in my ass 'til I am rich
Make me a god with the chemical sciences
Ahh! Baseball, baseball, He-Man hit the baseball
By the power of Grayskull
Rip the skin off and eat the brains out the baseball
Gonna run a motherfuckin' train on the baseball
Ahh! Don't tell me to be fucking calm
Whip out my dick on the Jumbotron
Rip out my bones cause my muscles so strong
Now the pain's so bad that my motherfucking heart stop-

[Intro: Akiva Schaffer]
Well, "The Bash" started with myself and José Canseco
Uh, we were matching forearms one day in the clubhouse
And, uh, we decided instead of giving a high five we would bash our forearms together

[Chorus: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer]
Let's bash (Let’s bash)
Let's bash (Let's bash)
Let’s bash (Let's bash)
Let's bash on they ass
Let's bash (Let's bash)
Let's bash (Let's bash)
Let's bash (Let’s bash)
Let’s bash on they ass

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg & Akiva Schaffer]
Uh, just hit a three run ho-ho
But if you wanna high five that's a no-no
I’m heading home, all my homies at home plate
Are waiting on me, so you know I gotta do something great
And that's when the arms go up
Like we about to drink from a cup
'Cause we a bunch of buff dudes just flexin'
Acknowledging our feats via human connection

[Chorus: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer]
Let’s bash (Let's bash)
Let's monster bash
Hit a tater out the stadi-er for monster cash
Hit a dinger through the fuckin' VIP suite glass
Break your fuckin' arm in half and then sign the cast

[Interlude: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone]
Get well soon
Love, José
Sorry about your arm, Walt Weiss
It happens

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer]
When we in Kansas city we walk out in the parking lot
Then yell, "Fuck the Royals"
Start swinging and popping off
We beat up their fans 'til the cops say to knock it off
Down half a creatine shake and to top it off
The next day on the bus, got hit with the roid rage
But I played it off
Said I was irritated 'cause of my booty hole rash
No pain, no gain motherfucker

[Chorus: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer]
Let's bash (Let's bash)
Let's bash (Let's bash)
Let's bash (Let's bash)
Let's bash on they ass

[Refrain]
I left my steroids in El Sobrante
Left my steroids in El Sobrante
Left my steroids in El Sobrante
I got to get 'em
I got-got to get 'em

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer]
I might be an Athletic but I'm built like a giant
And I'm wearing white socks like an angel that's flyin'
Met a blue jay that's fucking an oriole
You're royally screwed like a marlin
Exposed to the oil that a pirate or a mariner
Spilled out his tanker
That's a cardinal sin, padre
Yeah? Tell it to the ranger
You feel brave little cub-cub?
Try to sock me
But when I'm seeing red shit is gonna get rocky
I dodge your fist, beat your blood-red red socks soggy
Astrophysicist make you see stars promptly
I'm more hopped up then a brewer that's hyper
Sit Indian-style when I'm yankee on my tiger
I'm staring at a philly with some major league twins
If you didn't know by now, I'm naming baseball teams

[Chorus: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, Both]
Let's bash (Let's bash)
Let's monster bash
Round tripper make the pitcher feel like donkey ass
Hit a ding dong doodle with my bing bong bat
We smack a blast then we smash a bash

[Intro: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, Both]
Ah, The Oakland Coliseum
Its's 1988 and the season's going well
I'm at the height of my career
So why do I feel sad?

[Verse: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer]
These days don't recognize my own face in the mirror
I'm a monster, not the man I wanna be
But focus on the game, José, the game, José
Don't be a fool, don't throw it all away
Haven't talked to mom in two weeks (Mark, it's your mother)
Things at home are even more bleak
Focus on the game, Mark, the game, Mark
Focus on the game, Mark, oh-oh
So don't look at me 'cause I'm all alone in left field
Thinkin' bout all the fucked up shit that I did to get here
Did I lose my soul?
When did I lose control?
But they tell me to focus on the game, Mark
Lord knows I'm trying
And I never leave the shower
So they never see me crying
You're just a scared little boy in the body of a giant
A freakshow of science
But then my friend says
You're the man JC
You're the man BigMac
You're the only one who knows what it truly means to bash
And if one day they should come for us
And strip us of our crowns
I know that if I am going down
You're also going down

[Outro]
The ball's hit pretty well to left field
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You can chalk up number twenty-one for Canseco
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
He hit it outta here
Oh-oh, oh-oh
And the big guy from Florida has just struck again
Oh-oh
Man, did he hit that baseball

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, Both]
Picture this, we up in the Gold's Gym pumpin'
Perfecting the science of straight lifting somethin'
On your mark, get set, we rippin' a rep
Gonna spray the whole bench press up with our sweat
But then, both of us turned to the gym door
And both of our jaws hit the gym floor
'Cause there stood the two most bodacious babes
In bikinis, my heart stopped faster than Fellini's
They headed straight for us, I reached for my jimmy hats
But then they pinned us back to the bench man, they had us trapped
Told us to wake up and smell the Folgers
Then stood up straight like two toy soldiers
Then while remaining stiff, they fell into our hands
Looked down, said, "Lift", so I turned to my man
Lift girls instead of weights? Man, this is nuts
But then we cocked back our muscles and lifted 'em up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then time slowed down (Slowed down)
All that mattered was this moment

[Chorus]
Bench pressing bodacious babes
In bikinis is the best bodybuilding craze
You can ditch the barbells and the fancy weights
Cause we g-g-guarantee that you're gonna look great

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, Both]
In the world of weights, the bench press is the coolest
Add two babes, now your fuckin' with the newness
A new routine that'll change your attitude-ness
Your whole self-esteem will scream, "I've made improvements"
But make sure the two girls are the same sizes
Cause you don't want your biceps lopsided
I'm a lean cut of beef, you can call me top-sided
We've seen the results for ourselves, and we're delighted
A babe walked in and she wanted me to lift her
But she was in sweatpants, so I dismissed her
With a good bikini grip, you never risk a blister
Sweatpants slide, that's a hazard to the lifter
And when we do push-ups, they sit on our backs
And when we take a breather, we sit in their laps
But when the breather is done we bounce back to the bench
Babes stiffen then dip into our hands outstretched
And we cock back our muscles, get our fingers all clenched
Then send 'em to the heavens 'cause from heaven they sent

[Pre-Chorus]
Then light shone down (Then light shone down)
Bathing all in a moment of divinity (Bathing all in a moment of divinity)

[Chorus]
Bench pressing bodacious babes
In bikinis is the best bodybuilding craze
You can ditch the barbells and the fancy weights
Cause we g-g-guarantee that you're gonna look great

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, Both]
Now we gotta address the elephant in the room
A lot of guys to the girls be like "How you doin'?"
They wanna take advantage and have sex with the babes
Who are here for a workout and not for a date
So keep your dick in your pants and treat the babes with respect
'Cause when you peckin' at their ear, then we're not working our pecs
I guess such is the life of trailblazers
It's the bikini babe workout, and we're the creators

[Outro]
And I will lift you up (And I will lift you up)
And you will be set free (You will be set free)
And we will be transformed
As the heavens weep

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg]
Got Oakleys on my face to keep the sun from coming in
I'm swinging at the ball and that's a double homonym
Ain't no one that can touch me, I got trouble cuddlin'
In the forty-forty club and I ain't s-s-stutterin'
The name's José, they call me Yoplait
I'm a low fat treat that the ladies wanna lay
And in a melee, bring style to the brawl
'Cause I'll punch you in a poncho and I'll shake you in a shawl
Hit the ball so fuckin' hard you can hear the cow it came from scream
Plus my mane got the sheen
I mean its mean to disrupt the mean, but I meant to
This ain't Bill Buckner's legs, you don't know what I went through
And I got news to present you
My collect calls to your mama got sent through
In her crib so much, I should pay rent, too
"Devil down below" when they ask me, "Who sent you?"

[Verse 2: Akiva Schaffer]
The house of pancakes is my favorite place
I love the booth seating and I love-a the taste
My Andros are part of a nutritious breakfast
My necks so big that it broke-a my necklace
Slipped on the puka shells on the floor
Had to go re-up at the puka shell store
"Hey, Mark, welcome back to your favorite shop"
Yo, shut the fuck up and put the pukas in the box
"Okay, Big Mac, there's no need to be rude"
I'm sorry Bob, it's the steroids, they fuck with my mood
Now put the pukas in the bag before I blow my top
'Cause me and Jose 'bout to smash back to IHOP

[Intro: Akiva Schaffer, Andy Samberg]
It's just over there, José
Whoa, this IHOP is goin’ off!
Sure is, look at all those people in the parking lot
Hey, Mark, check out those guys

[Verse: Haim & Maya Rudolph, Akiva Schaffer, Andy Samberg]
Hey, you, nasty freak
Shake that nasty butt (Who, us?)
I said hey, you, nasty freak
Shake that nasty butt (Hey, watch it!)
Hey, you, a-freakety-freak
Step up and jiggle your stuff (Okay)
If you a boy or a girl, do a jump and a twirl
And then bounce that funky dump (Hahahaha)

[Bridge: Haim & Maya Rudolph, Andy Samberg, Andy Samberg & Akiva Schaffer]
Ooh, welcome to the parking lot
Where there's dancin' all the time (Alright!)
So watch out for those moving cars
And stay within the painted lines (Whoa!)
You know it feels so good to be ourselves (Sorry!)
And let our bodies move to the rhythm
’Cause we're dancin' tonight (Woo)
Shake that nasty butt

[Chorus: Haim & Maya Rudolph, Akiva Schaffer, Andy Samberg]
You, nasty boys
Keep shaking those nasty butts (We are)
I said hey, you, nasty boys
Shake four halves of butt (Phrased weird)
It's not phrased weird at all
Shake four halves of butt (Okay)
Your mama gave you a butt
So shake that butt

[Refrain: Haim & Maya Rudolph, Akiva Schaffer, Andy Samberg]
Shake that butt (We are)
Shake that butt (We are!)
Shake that butt
Shake that butt (It's too much!)
Shake that butt
Shake that butt (Stop!)
Shake that butt
Shake that butt (Help! I wanna stop!)
Shake that butt (Help!)
Shake that butt
Shake that butt (Mark!)
Shake that butt (José!)
Shake that butt (Mark!)
Shake that butt (José!)
Shake that butt
Shake that butt
Shake that butt
Shake that butt
Shake that butt
Shake that butt

[Outro: Andy Samberg & Akiva Schaffer]
And what is the price of fame?
Will my family be proud of their name?
Feels like my body's a runaway train
Mama please help me, I'm goin' insane

[Interlude: Reporter, Akiva Schaffer, Andy Samberg & Akiva Schaffer]
Wow, it sounds like being famous is really hard
Yeah, it is
Also, would you mind shaking your butts for the camera?
See? That’s what we’re talking about

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg]
My car, my house, my kid, my spouse
My team, my dream, I gots to feed the beast
My glutes, my bod, they say, "My God"
My tris, my calves, my thighs
The hits, the tags, the sex, the crabs
The road, the bus, my tiny little nuts
Your finger, my butt, you know what's up
The bumps, the slumps, the motherfucking umps
The fans, the heckles, the girls with the freckles
They're trying to distract me from trying to be special
These pompous fucking pitchers trying to strike your man out
And these scummy bloodsuckers looking for a handout (Out)

[Verse 2: Akiva Schaffer & Andy Samberg]
The stress, the press, the beautiful mess
The razors I use to shave my chest
The bills, the pills, the views from the hills
My streaks, my ruts, my tiny little nuts
My mom, my burden, I'm not a virgin
The aches, the pain, the heat, the rain
The lies, the secrets, José, I'll keep it
And Mark, I'll keep it, we'll keep our secret (Our secret)

[Chorus]
Feed the beast
Feed the beast
Feed the beast

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg]
They say it's lonely at the top, but I got hella homies
Like Mark, plus the guy that gets my blow for me
Plus the guy that gets my 'roids for me and my cars for me
And my money manager that collects my dough for me
Plus my private bodyguard, always on patrol for me
Plus the lady that I pay to suggest Merlots for me
Plus my agent, my real best friend
Yeah, my agent, he'll be there 'til the end
My sports agent, I trust him with my life
The only one that truly understands my strife
Together, we'll achieve the most amazing heights
He knows what I like, and he treats me right

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Girl, it's true, I went out on a date with your man
And honestly, I don't give a damn about you
He didn't even mention your name
And I don't think he cares about you, so sad

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
He don't want you anymore
He's leavin' your shit at the door
You walkin' around, modelin' now
Like you gon' settle the score
But you, not the one anymore
And I got the keys to his Porsche
With nothing I like, not one in the same
I just wanna say

[Chorus: Andre Merrit]
I want your boyfriend and he wants me
So I understand why you don't like me
And me letting go, girl, is unlikely
So I guess we have to agree to disagree

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're so lonely, oh
You're so lonely, oh
You're so lonely
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You're looking stupid, oh, poor baby
You're better off letting it go
There's no pacifier for you
Nobody will spoil you
Ain't hiding, him and me gettin' on, on

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
He don't want you anymore
He's leavin' your shit at the door
You walkin' around, modelin' now
Like you gon' settle the score
But you not, the one anymore
And I got the keys to hIs Porsche
With nothing I like, not one in the same
I just wanna say

[Chorus: Andre Merrit]
I want your boyfriend and he wants me
So I understand why you don't like me
And me letting go, girl, is unlikely
So I guess we have to agree to disagree
I want your boyfriend and he wants me
So I understand why you don't like me
And me letting go, girl, is unlikely
So I guess we have to agree to disagree

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Too bad for you
Too bad for you
Now I got him
No need to think about you
What more do you want?
It's pointless
Come on, get faded

[Chorus: Andre Merrit]
I want your boyfriend and he wants me
So I understand why you don't like me
And me letting go, girl, is unlikely
So I guess we have to agree to disagree
I want your boyfriend and he wants me
So I understand why you don't like me
And me letting go, girl, is unlikely
So I guess we have to agree to disagree

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're so lonely, oh
You're so lonely, oh
You're so lonely
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
You're so lonely, oh
You're so lonely, oh
You're so lonely
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Mother circle of life

[Verse 1]
My thoughts mixed up
You don't seem to bother
Are you blind or just tired
Of everything that has been going on
Lately I'm sorry
Maybe I shouldn't try
To be the guy who solves your problems

[Chorus]
Right place, wrong time
Is what she said to me
These days gone to waste
Is what we're left with

[Verse 2]
My thoughts mix up
You never seem to bother
Are you blind or just tired
Of everything that has been going on
Lately you say you're not ready
But will you ever be ready?

[Chorus]
Right place, wrong time
Is what she said to me
These days gone to waste
Is what we're left with
Right place, wrong time
Is what she said to me
These days gone to waste
Is what we're left with

[Bridge]
Ready, are you ready?
Will you ever be ready?

[Chorus]
Right place, wrong time
Is what she said to me
These days gone to waste

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can’t let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can’t stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Refrain]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Verse 1]
Round, round robin run around
Got to get back to where you belong
Little bit harder, just a little bit more
A little bit further than you gone before

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can’t hold on
You can’t go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don’t get you then the lightning will

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Small wheel turn by the fire and rod
Big wheel turn by the grace of God
Every time that wheel turn 'round
Bound to cover just a little more ground
Bound to cover just a little more ground

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can’t hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Outro]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Intro]
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, oh, she looked so fine
Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
And she spoke so kind, talked so fair
Samson said, Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength become as natural as any old man

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever has lived on earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around the lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand and says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Verse 1]
Been walking all morning, went walking all night
I can't see much difference between the dark and light
And I feel the wind, and I taste the rain
Never in my mind to cause so much pain

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Day to day just letting it ride
You get so far away from how it feels inside
You can't let go 'cause you're afraid to fall
But the day may come when you can't feel at all

[Outro]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill, only love can fill, only love can fill
Only love can fill, only love can fill

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Intro]
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets

Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street
They're dancing in Chicago
Down in New Orleans
In New York City

[Pre-Chorus]
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be laughing and singing, music swinging
Dancing in the streets
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere around the world

[Chorus]
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets

Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

[Outro]
1, 2, 3
This here is Bob, in case nobody knows it

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back in the woods among the evergreens
There in an old cabin made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar like ringin' a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track
The engineers seen him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' to the rhythm that the drivers made
People passin' by would stop and say
"My my, but that little country boy can play!"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 3]
His mama told him "Someday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people comin' from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Johnny B. Goode tonight"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

Go go, go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode
Thank you

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Caroline
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
Had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
The Hound broke down
Left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There’s people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We’d be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the night
Fly through the night

Don’t cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep
In the stars
Don’t you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la
La...

[Instrumental break]

All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the dark
Fly through the night

Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep
In the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la
La, la...

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

[Bridge]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

[Verse 2]
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Bridge]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

[Verse 3]
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Bridge]
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I

[Verse 4]
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

[Bridge]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

[Verse 5]
Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina good-bye
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental break]

Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot of
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms
Bringing me down
I'm running aground
Blind in the light of the interstate cars
Passing me by
The buses and semis
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars
But I’m here by the road
Bound to the load
I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars
Alone with the rush of the drivers who won't pick me up
The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars

The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a life where nothing is new
Ah, Mother American Night, I'm lost from the light
Oh, I’m drowning in you

I left St. Louis, City of Blues
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget
I tried to pretend it came to an end
'Cause you weren't the woman I once thought I'd met
But I can't deny, oh, times have gone by
I never had doubts or thoughts of regret
And I was a man when all this began
Who wouldn't think twice about being there yet
Black-throated wind whisper mix in
It's speaking of life that passes like dew
Forced me to see you’ve done better by me
Done better by me than I’ve done by you

What's to be found, racing around
You carry your pain wherever you go
I’m full of the blues, trying to lose
You ain't gonna learn what you don't want to know
So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies
Please help them to learn as well as to see
Capture a glance, oh, and make it a dance
Of looking at you looking at me

Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a lie that could almost be true
Ah, Mother American Night, here comes the light
Turn around, that's what I’m going to do
Oh, I'm going back home, that's what I'm going to do
Oh, I'll turn around, that's what I'm going to do
Well, I'm going back home, that's what I'm going to do
You've done better by me than I've done by you
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
Well, I'm going back home, that's what I'm going to do
You've done better by me than I've done by you
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
Ooh, I'm going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Oh, I'm drowning in you
Circuitry of our wizard-like piano amplification system
There you have it, that was a real good one

Thank you for your patience
Well, my mama told me, my papa told me too
Now my mama told me, papa told me too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[instrumental break]

Well, I went to the depot, I never got there on time
Well, I went down to the depot, never got there on time
Well, my train's going down, she's a-rolling down the line

Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Well, my train's going down, she's a-rolling down the line

[instrumental break]

Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed
Well, my mama told me, my papa told me too
Now, my mama told me, papa told me too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin', my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
Now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't a winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed a man can rest on, you keep us on the run

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
But you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Verse 2]
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
Well, I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna get up in the morning and go
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Outro]
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I’m going to sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she’s gone
And I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die
And I'm going to sit right here until I die
Listen, I’m going to sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper
Just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday
In a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City
Just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls
And get out when they blow

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill
Mama told the sailor
One heat up and one cool down
Leave nothin' for the tailor
Just like Jack and Jill
Papa told the jailer
One go up, one go down
Do yourself a favor

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto
Just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush
Aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelley
Just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains, count your change
And try to walk the line

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Verse 4]
Goodbye, Mama and Papa
Goodbye, Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
Either side of the hill, oh

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose
Ramble on, Rose
I can't stay much longer, Melinda, the sun is getting high
I can't help you with your troubles, if you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, I gotta get down to the mine

You keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up 'til four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, or I can't work there no more

[Instrumental break]

A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill, keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all, and you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down take your shift at the mine?"

Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away

Lotta poor man got the Cumberland blues, he can't win for losing
Lotta poor man got to walk the line just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I mean, we can't play when it sounds like that so we're gonna tune up

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it’s done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I’m just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Like a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band
Thank you. We're gonna take a short break, and we'll be back in just a few minutes, so hang loose

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now, he's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothin's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Verse 2]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Now, he's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothin's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Same old rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
He's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothin's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothing's going to bring him back, he's gone
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back

[Instrumental]99

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
Now, what in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

[Verse 5]
Now, you're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' home
Hey now, get back truckin' home
Hey now, get back truckin' home
AH, get back truckin' home
AH, get back truckin' home
AH, get back truckin' home
AH, get back truckin' home

[Instrumental]

Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
Get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' home
Hey now, get back truckin' home
Hey now, get back truckin' home
WAH, get back truckin' home
WAH, get back truckin' home
AH, get back truckin' home

[Instrumental]
All of my friends come to see me last night
I was laying in my bed and dying
Annie Beauneau from Saint Angel
Say "The weather down here so fine"

Just then the wind
Came squalling through the door
But who can
The weather command?
Just want to have
A little peace to die
And a friend or two
I love at hand

[Instrumental break]

Fever rolled up to a hundred and five
Roll on up
Gonna roll back down
One more day
I find myself alive
Tomorrow
Maybe go
Beneath the ground
See here how everything
Lead up to this day
And it's just like
Any other day
That's ever been
Sun going up and then
The sun it going down
Shine through my window
And my friends they come around

[Bridge]
Come around
Come around

[Outro]
The people might know
But the people don't care
That a man could be
As poor as me
"Take a look at poor Peter
He's lying in pain
Now let's go
Run and see"
Run and see
Oh, run and see
Run, run and see

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2]
She said her name was Billie Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 3]
And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose from the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the clouds of delusion

[Chorus]
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Instrumental]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

Where have all the people gone, my honey?
Where have all the people gone today?
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I thought I heard a young man mourn today
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Instrumental break]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Instrumental break]

I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Verse 1]
Well, this job I've got is just a little too hard
I'm running out of money, Lord, I need more pay
I'm gonna wake up in the morning, Lord, I'm gonna pack my bags
I'm gonna beat it on down the line

[Chorus 1]
I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Yes, going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Hey, I'm gonna beat it on down the line

[Verse 2]
Listen, I'll be waiting at the station, Lord, when that train pulls on by
I'm going back where I belong
Baby, I'm going north to my same old used-to-be
Hey, said down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Chorus 2]
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
Said coal mine (Coal mine)
Yeah, coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, coal mine (Coal mine)
Down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Yes, I'm going back to that shack way across the railroad track
Hey, that's where I think I belong
Yes, got a sweet woman, Lord, yeah, who's waiting there for me
Hey, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Outro]
Said happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
Said happy home (Happy home)
Said a happy, a happy, happy, happy home (Happy home)
Hey, hey, hey hey (Happy home)
Happy home, now, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home
Sunshine daydream, walk you in the tall trees, going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Come on over sweetly
Ride out singin', I'll walk you in the morning sunshine

Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Come on over daydream
Sunshine daydream, now come in, comin' from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, Wading in a cold stream

Crawl on out your window
Go anywhere the wind goes
Sunshine daydream
Oh, comin' from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, ah, come on over daydream
Sunshine daydream, go on, comin' from a sweet dream

Sunshine daydream, hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
Thank you all and good night

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day that could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Verse 2]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, a pile of smoking leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayed for better weather

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
When your big old ship comes in, the first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots?
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way

[Bridge]
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my tickets when I speed

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
And jump like Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive, y'all

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
Caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around
Walk around

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, walking in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Now come on over sweetly
Ride out singin', I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, falling from my first dream
Sunshine daydream, wading in a cold stream
Crawl on out your window, going, going where the wind goes
They're never gonna miss us
Ride out singin', I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, going for a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sweet flowing daydream

[Verse 1]
I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep that night 'til the morning came around

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, baby, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 4]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one say she got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:

[Verse 4 repeated]

I want to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're going to know just how I feel
Our love is real, will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, feeling bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
I don't want to be treated this a-way

You know our love will not fade away

Say love-e-love will not fade away
Say love-e-love will not fade away

[Verse 1]
Went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's going to be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Now everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the whole place going to fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Woo, Saturday night

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I turn on Channel Six, the President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues
His wife say "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, put on your rocking shoes

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday Night!
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Oh, Saturday night!

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought he'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday Night
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Ow, Saturday night

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Everybody came, boy (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night, woo

Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
OW! (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night now, woo

Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
OW! (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night, woo

Thank you, we'll see you next time we're in town

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothing's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Verse 2]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothing's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Same old, rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Now he's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothing's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothing's going to bring him back, he's gone
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around
(Coming around) Coming around (Coming around)
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Old man down, way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty, asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine, more than my maker, though he's no friend of mine

Everyone said, I’d come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life, I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

But I'll get back on my feet someday
The good Lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I’m living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

I'll get up and fly away, I'll get up and fly away, fly away

"Pearly's been true, true to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him, I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I’m sure she’s been true to you"
Got up and wandered, wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl, named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl’s been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental]

[Intro Crosstalk]

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running
I wonder if you care
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner, corner, corner
Lord, I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down on to the sea
Try to see what's going down
Lord, and read between the lines
Had a feeling I was falling, falling, falling
Lord, I turned around to see
Heard a voice calling, calling
You was runnin' back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
I ducked into a bar door
It was all night pouring
But not a drop on me
Test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jail house
Lord, until the sun goes down
'Til it go down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2]
She said her name was Billie Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 3]
And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
But I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands, yeah

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 2]
I been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you about all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
And tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonesome blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play, children
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 1 repeated]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Outro]
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Wait until that deal come round
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I’m going to sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she’s gone
Then I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die
And I'm going to sit right here until I die
And I’m going to sit right here until I die

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street
With a dollar in my hand
I was looking for a woman
Sweet mama didn't have no man

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
The girl I love, she's sweet and true
The dress she wears, sweet mama, it's pink and blue
She brings me coffee, she brings me tea
She brings about every darn thing but the jailhouse key

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I was walking down Main
Deep Elliman too
You know all God's women down there
Got the Texas blues

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Chorus]
Playing

Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

Thank you. We're gonna take a short break, we'll be back in a few minutes, so everybody hang loose

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Caroline
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
Had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
The Hound broke down
Left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There’s people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We’d be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

Thank you
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, combing back your yellow hair
Prettiest lady in the area-o

Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me? Mama won't agree
And I know your mama would be angry-O

Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
I would marry you but your guineas are too few
And I know my mother would be angry-O

[Instrumental break]

What would your mother think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mother think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mother think if she heard my guineas clink?
Saw me marching at the head of my soldiers-O

If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, all your cities I will burn
Destroy all the people in the area-O

[Instrumental break]

As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
And don't you run off no more

Don't hang your head and let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Here's a half dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

[Chorus]
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock you, baby, to and fro
Not too fast, and not too slow

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Bridge]
That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

Get down row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Oh, get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train
Feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby flagged a diesel down, just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was blowing sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slapping time, Bobby clapping hands
We pined to sing every song that driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to do
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standing right beside me, Lord, through everything I've done
Bobby's body kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Looking for that home I hope she finds
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday
Holding Bobby's body close to mine

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing was all she left for me
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Bridge]
Lelela, lelelala, lelela, lelela, laleleha, laleleha, lalala
Leleleheee, lalala, leleleheee, lalala, leleleha, leleleha
Lala, lala, lala

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
My mama told me, my papa told me too
Now my mama told me, papa told me too
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Instrumental break]

I went to the depot, I never got there on time
Went down to the depot, never got there on time
Well, my train's going down, she's a-rolling down the line

Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Well, my train's going down, she's a-rolling down the line

[Instrumental break]

Well, my mama told me, my papa told me too
Well, my mama told me, papa told me too
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues
Wish I had a-listened to, oh, what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened to, oh, what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
Now, what in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She's lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' home
Hey now, get back truckin' home
Hey now, get back truckin' home
AH, get back truckin' home
AH, get back truckin' home
HEY, get back truckin' home
AH, get back truckin' home

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Nobody's fault but mine, nobody's fault but mine
If I don't read my soul gets lost
Nobody's fault but mine

[Verse 2]
Well, my ma, she taught me how to read
Mother, she taught me how to read
If I don't read my soul gets lost
Ain't nobody's fault but mine

[Verse 3]
I had a Bible in my arm, had a Bible in my arm
If I don't read my soul gets lost
Ain't nobody's fault but mine
Nobody's fault but mine, nobody's fault but mine
If I don't read my soul gets lost
Nobody's fault but mine

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter’s summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Fare you well, my honey
Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone

Going to leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time - in my time - I will roll, roll roll

[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 2]
River going to take me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back home
It's a far-gone lullaby
Sung many years ago
Mama, Mama, many worlds I've come
Since I first left home

[Chorus]
Going home, going home, by the waterside I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Going to plant a weeping willow
By the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

[Chorus]
Fare you well, fare you well, I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul...

[Outro harmonizing]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental break]

Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot of
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive, y'all

Sugar magnolia ringing that bluebell
Caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out, and I wander around, I walk around now

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, yeah
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 2]
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
I'm goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
About a quarter to nine
Hits River Junction
At seventeen to
A quarter to ten
You know it's travelin' again

[Chorus]
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

[Verse 2]
Trouble ahead
The Lady in Red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead
Switchman's sleepin'
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you

[Chorus]
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But we still don't see
Come 'round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams
And the engine just gleams

[Chorus]
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

[Outro]
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

Thank you all, good night

[Intro]
A very pleasant good morning to you all

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Caroline
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
Had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
The Hound broke down
Left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There's people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day that could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Verse 2]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, a pile of smoking leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayed for better weather

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
When your big old ship comes in, the first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots?
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Oh, across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I have seen where the wolf has slept by the silver stream
And I can tell by the mark he left you were in his dream
Ah, child of countless trees
Ah, child of boundless seas
What you are, what you're meant to be
Speaks his name, though you were born to me
Born to me, Cassidy

[Verse 2]
Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac
I can tell by the way you smile he's rolling back
Come and wash the nighttime clean
Come grow this scorched ground green
Blow the horn and tap the tambourine
Close the gap of the dark years in between
You and me, Cassidy

[Bridge]
Quick beats in an icy heart
Catch-colt draws a coffin cart
There he goes now, here she starts
Hear her cry
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine

[Outro]
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Verse 1]
Cold iron shackles and ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evening train
Well, you know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed

Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Well, you know, people, it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 2]
Drink all day and rock all night
Law come to get you if you don't walk right
I got a letter this morning, people, all it read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Gonna catch a few winks, baby, down under the bed
Better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 3]
I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
Doggie turned to me and he said:
Let's head back to Tennessee, Jed

I woke up a-feeling mean
I went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around, people, the letters read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin’
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
But it's all right 'cause I love you
And that’s not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You guess from the cries you were listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
They're only tryin' to make it through the night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I only want to hold you, I don't want to tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It's just that I, I, have gotten used to havin’ you around
My landscape would be empty, if you were gone

[Chorus]
But it’s alright 'cause I love you
And that’s not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
(Brave the storm to come)
Brave the storm to come, looks like rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Yes, and the whole world's turnin' gray
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like, ooh
Ooh, here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Yes, brave the storm to come
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, ooh
Ooh, here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Yes, and my whole world's turnin' gray
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, ooh
Ooh, here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Yes, and brave the storm to come
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Oh, here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Yes, and the whole world's turnin' gray
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Oh, here comes the rain
Yes, and brave the storm to come
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Oh, here comes the rain
Oh, here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)

[Verse 1]
Mary run around, sailin' up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop
Lord, you know they made a fine connection

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 2]
He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her
Don't get in their way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesel train
You better not be there when it rolls over
When that train pulls in, you wonder where it's been
You gotta try to see a little further

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Chorus]
I was born in the desert, I was raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in the desert, I was raised in a lion’s den
You see, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Said I’m a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well, the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would
Know she wish she would

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well now, the doctor call me crazy, sometimes I am and sometimes I ain't
Said now the doctor call me crazy, sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't
See, the preacher man call me a sinner, but his little girl call me a saint

[Chorus]
Said I was born in the desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in the desert, raised in a lion's den
See, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Said I was born in the desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in the desert, raised in a lion’s den
Well now, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men
I said my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
As I was walking round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
From the other direction she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion but I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening when the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches and was closing the door
I had one of those flashes I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
I ain't often right but I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way it does in the song
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
Well, there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand
Everybody is playing in the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Lazy lightning
That sleepy fire in your eyes
Is that desire in disguise?
I keep on trying but I
I can't get through
Lazy lightning
I'd like to find the proper potion
To try to capture your emotion
You're right beside me but I
I can't get through

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Loop of lazy lighting
Must admit you're kind of frightening
But you really get me high

[Verse 2]
Lazy lightning
When I hear your velvet thunder
You seem so near I start to wonder
Would you come closer if I
If I asked you to
Lazy lightning
The way you're messing with my reason
It's an obsession but it's pleasing
Tell me a lie and I will swear
I will swear it's true

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Loop of lazy lightning
Must admit you're kind of frightening
You're a loop of lazy lightning

[Bridge]
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
Rope of fire ever tightening (Tightening)
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
It's either lunacy or lightning

Loop of lazy lightning, woo

Loop of lazy lightning
Loop of lazy lightning
Must admit you're kinda frightening

[Outro]
Lazy lightning
They say you never start the same place
I want a double dose in my case
I'd fly a kite if I thought
Thought that would do
The way you're messing with my reason
And all that lightning will be my lightning too
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Loop a loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Come on, come on lazylightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Oh, come on lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)

[Verse 1]
Well, dizzy ain't the word for the way that you’re making me feel now
Well, I need some indication, good Lord, is it real now
Got to help me, girl
Well, I've heard it said there's something wrong in my head now
Got to help me
Could it be infatuation or am I just being misled now?

[Outro]
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
It’s sparking my imagination
Got to light me now
Cause me such excitation
Girl, don't fight me now
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
Deadly is my combination
Got to light me now
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don’t tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don’t tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
And if that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don’t tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don’t tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Outro]
We’re gonna take a break. We'll be right back

[Intro]
You know what? Uncle Bill says we only got an hour from when we start playing, so we're not gonna start playing for a little bit

[Verse 1]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Verse 2]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well, he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge]
Ladyfinger dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

[Verse 1]
I want to tell you how it's going to be
You’re going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're going to know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I want to tell you how it's going to be
You’re going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away

[Verse]
Saint Stephen will remain
All he's lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and the foam
Been here so long he's got to calling it home

[Outro]
Fortune comes a-crawling, Calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

[Verse 1]
Paradise waits on the crest of a wave, her angels in flames
She has no pain, like a child she's pure, she is not to blame
Poised for flight, wings spread bright, spring from night into the sun
Don't stop to run, she can fly like a lie, she can't be outdone
Tell me the cost, I can pay, let me go, tell me love is not lost
Sell everything, without love day to day insanity's king
I will pay day by day, anyway, lock, bolt and key
Crippled but free, I was blind all the time, I was learning to see

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Help on the way, well, I know only this, I've got you today
Don't fly away 'cause I love what I love and I want it that way
I will stay one more day, like I say, honey, it's you
Making it too, without love in a dream, it will never come true

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
Oh yes, she had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah, she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, it would be the last time
Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
She spoke so kind, God knows, she talked so fair
Samson said, Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength become as natural as any old man

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever has lived on earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around that lion's jaws
And he ripped that beast, God knows, killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
In another time's forgotten space
Your eyes looked from your mother's face
Wallflower seed on the sand and stone
May the four winds blow you safely home

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you where the four winds dwell
In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell
It can ring, turn night to day
It can ring like fire when you lose your way

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

[Verse 3]
God save the child that rings that bell
It may have one good ring, baby, you can't tell
One watch by night, one watch by day
If you get confused listen to the music play

[Instrumental break]

Some come to laugh their past away
Some come to make it just one more day
Whichever way your pleasure tends
If you plant ice you're gonna harvest the wind

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
I'll tell you where the four winds sleep
Like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep
Wildflower seed on the sand and wind
May the four winds blow you home again

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
(Roll away)
Roll away the dew
(Roll away)
You'd better roll away the dew
(Roll away)
You'd better roll away the dew
(Roll away)
You'd better roll away, roll away
Roll away the dew
Come on roll away, roll away, roll away
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew (Roll away)

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
You better roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
You better roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

[Verse 1]
Went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's going to be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo! Saturday night
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Woo, Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the whole place going to fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo, Saturday night
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Woo, Saturday night

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I turn on Channel Six, the President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues
His wife say "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, put on your rocking shoes

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo, Saturday Night!
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Oh, Saturday night!

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought he'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo, Saturday Night now
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Ow, Saturday night

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
(One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night

Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
OW! (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night now

Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
OW! (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night

[Verse 1]
Red and white, U.S. blue
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I'm still alive
Ain't no luck, I learned to duck
Check my pulse, it don't change
Stay seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 2]
I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am
Been hiding out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hand that shook the hand
Of P.T. Barnum and Charlie Chan
Shine your shoes, light the fuse
Can you use and old U.S. Blues?
I'll drink your health, share your wealth
Run your life, steal your wife

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Back to back, chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
You can call this song the United States Blues

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
My, my my my, my my oh my, oh my, oh my
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

Good afternoon

[Intro]
Alright, without any further to do, on a nice Sunday morning
The Grateful Dead

[Verse 1]
Great North Central, would you all board
You can't find a ride like that no more
The night the chariot swung down low
Ninety-nine children had a chance to go
One long party from front to end
Tune to the whistle going round the bend
No great hurry, what do you say?
Might as well channel me every good way

[Chorus]
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well

[Verse 2]
Ragtime slowly for twenty-five miles
Then switch over to the cajun style
Bar car blowing rhythm and blues
Rock ’n' roll wailing in the old caboose
Long train running from coast to coast
Bringing home a party when you need it the most
Work on the box car, beat on the bell
Nothing else shaking so you might just as well

[Chorus]
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well
You might as well, might as well, might as well

[Bridge]
Never had such a good time in my life before
I'd like to have it one time more
One good ride from start to end
I’d like to take that ride again, again

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Ran out of track and I caught the plane
Back in the county with the blues again
Great North Central is on my mind
I might like to ride it just one more time

[Chorus]
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well

You might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, you might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well
You might as well, might as well, might as well
You might as well, might as well, might as well
You might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well
You might as well, might as well, might as well

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
The first thing I remember knowin' was a lonesome whistle blowin'
And a youngin's dream of growin' up to ride
On a freight train leavin' town, not knowin' where I was bound
No one could steer me right, but mama tried

Was the only rebel child from a family meek and mild
My mama seemed to know what lay in store
In spite of all my Sunday learnin'
For the bad I kept on turnin' 'til mama couldn't hold me anymore

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison, doin' life without parole
No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleadin' I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame 'cause mama tried

[Verse 2]
Dear old daddy rest his soul, left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Workin' hours without rest, wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right, but I refused

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison, doin' life without parole
No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleadin' I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame 'cause mama tried

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison, doin' life without parole
No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleadin' I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame 'cause mama tried
That leaves no one but me to blame 'cause mama tried

[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper
Just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday
In a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City
Just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls
And get out when they blow

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill
Mama told the sailor
One heat up and one cool down
Leave nothin' for the tailor
Just like Jack and Jill
Papa told the jailer
One go up and one go down
Do yourself a favor

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto
Just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush
Aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelley
Just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains and count your change
Try to walk the line

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Verse 4]
Goodbye, Mama and Papa
Goodbye, Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
Either side of the hill

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 1]
I have seen where the wolf has slept by the silver stream
And I can tell by the mark he left you were in his dream
Ah, child of countless trees
Ah, child of boundless seas
What you are and what you're meant to be
Speaks his name, though you were born to me
Born to me, Cassidy

[Verse 2]
Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac
I can tell by the way you smile he's rolling back
Come and wash the nighttime clean
Come grow this scorched ground green
Blow the horn, tap the tambourine
Close the gap of the dark years in between
You and me, Cassidy

[Bridge]
Quick beats in an icy heart
Catch-colt draws a coffin cart
There he goes now, here she starts
Hear her cry
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine

[Outro]
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 2]
I been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you about all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
And tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonely blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play, children
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 1 repeated]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And please play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Outro]
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

[Verse 2]
Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

[Verse 3]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

[Verse 4]
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

[Verse 5]
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Verse 6]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

[Verse 7]
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left

[Verse 8]
But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Verse 9]
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I

[Verse 10]
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

[Verse 11]
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

[Verse 12]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

[Verse 13]
Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

[Verse 14]
From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina good-bye

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Verse 2]
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
Well, I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna get up in the morning and go
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Outro]
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
You can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I took my head for its midnight walk
Oh no it hadn't been outside in days
I get the leash 'round my side, but it wasn't quite tight
And I lost it

So now I'm wandering in the countryside
Right past the potholes and the graveyard ghosts
And although they call me quite clearly and keep my pace
'Cause they can't save us

[Chorus]
Stuck inside the space again
Like dreaming with heavy rains
My head is made out of 

[?]
Let go, let go, let go

[Verse 2]
I still believe in love
And I believe in keeping my shit up
And though we might like a 

[?]
I'll take it, yes I will

[Chorus]
Such a precious instinct
Proof that time can take 

[?]
And nothing written how it was
Hold on, hold on, hold on

[Outro]
I love her eyes
I love my furs
I'll answer too
My tongue, it purs
I'll dream until I turn to clay
Okay

[Verse 1]
One is hard a stone, unpleasant
Once filled with warmth, it's perfect
They're so far away from others
They stay and dance with each other
Each other

Turning
Spinning

[Verse 2]
And when things are worse or better
They'll stay by their sides forever
And if you don't believe it
Up in the sky you'll see it
You'll see it

Turning
Spinning

Turning
"No" is a word that fuels people
Detuning
"Never" is a word that only makes you dream
Makes you dream

Deep in ourselves beyond nature
We feel it right in our side too big for us to see
You'll see most of the love
But not landscape, drive through it
Knowledge is a cloud that changes with the air
With the air

You'll see (you will see)
You'll see (you will see)
You'll see (you will see)
You'll see (you will see)

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Caroline
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
Had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
The Hound broke down
Left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There's people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said, "Please
Gentle Jack Jones won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin’ down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1929 when he stepped to the bar
Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin’ down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over and the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack on Big Foot country
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell
I cut hick’ry just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin’ down
And it looks like the old man's gettin’ on

[Verse 1 repeated]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said, "Please
Gentle Jack Jones won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin’ on
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1]
I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep that night 'til the morning came around

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, baby, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 4]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]

[Verse 1]
Old man down, way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty, asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine, more than my maker, though he's no friend of mine

[Verse 3]
Everyone said, I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life, I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Verse 4]
But I'll get back on my feet someday
The good Lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Bridge]
I'll get up and fly away, I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 5]
Pearly's been true, true to me, true to my dying day he said
I said to him, I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Instrumental]

It doesn't matter what you wear

[Outro]
We're gonna take a break, we'll see y'all in a little bit

[Intro]
Know what? Nobody ever thanks Bill Graham for putting these things on
So I think at the count of three, everybody oughta say 'Thank you, Uncle Bill'
1, 2, 3...

If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
Yes, she had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, it would be the last time
Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
And she spoke so kind, God knows, talked so fair
Samson said, "Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength become as natural as any old man"

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever has lived on earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
Talk to me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around the lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can’t let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can’t stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Refrain]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Verse 1]
Round, round robin run around, got to get back to where you belong
Little bit harder, just a little bit more
A little bit further than you gone before

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can’t hold on
You can’t go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don’t get you then the lightning will

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Small wheel turn by the fire and rod
Big wheel turn by the grace of God
Every time that wheel turn 'round
Bound to cover just a little more ground
Bound to cover just a little more ground

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can’t hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Outro]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around
(Coming around) Coming around (Coming around)
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Verse 1]
All the years combine, they melt into a dream
A broken angel sings from a guitar
In the end there's just a song, comes crying up the night
Down all the lonely streets and broken years

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Verse 2]
When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams
And yet there's just a song, comes crying like the wind
Down every lonely street that's ever been

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Bridge]
I've stayed in every blue-light cheap hotel, can't win for trying
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time
Gonna make them shine (Shine)

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
It all rolls into one, and nothing comes for free
There's nothing you can hold for very long
And when you hear that song, crying like the wind
It seems like all this life was just a dream

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
And jump like Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, oh, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Yeah, come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out, and I wander around
Walk around

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, walking in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming, blooming like a red rose
Now come on over sweetly
Ride out singin', I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Well, come on, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, well, come on, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, wading in a cold stream
Riding out your window, going, going where the wind goes
They're never gonna miss us
Ride out singin', I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, well, come on, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, well, come on, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, and I think I wanna daydream
Sunshine daydream, oh, sugar magnolia daydream
Sunshine daydream, well, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, oh, I think I wanna daydream
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, OW!
Sunshine daydream, OW!
Think of a daydream...
Thanks a lot, thanks a lot

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back in the woods among the evergreens
There in an old cabin made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar like ringin' a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track
The engineers seen him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' to the rhythm that the drivers made
People passin' by would stop and say
"My my, but that little country boy can play!"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 3]
His mama told him "Someday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people comin' from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Johnny B. Goode tonight"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

Go go, go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode
Thank you, good afternoon
Understand: I cannot find the grains of sand
They fall as planned
Can I go just long enough to say hello
I'll never know

Today when it goes
One more time
There's one more chance to breathe the air
I'm free of care, memories, fate
The darkest times that turn to grey
I've learned to love today

[Verse 1]
It's so easy for you to keep sitting
But it's hard for me to sit
You gotta understand, I've got bigger plans
I can't be still

Is there a party? (Ah)
You think a part is you?

[Chorus]
No! There is no party
There's no party, you just gotta work
Keep workin', hard work
There is no party (workin' workin' workin')
You think there's a party?
It's hard work, it's work, you gotta work
(Yeah, I never stop, I never stop)
Keep on workin (yeah)
You gotta work, there's no party (never stop, I gotta work, keep on workin')
It's hard work

[Post-Chorus]
It's so easy for you
It's so easy for you
It's so easy for you
It's so easy for you
But it's hard for me

[Verse 2]
It's so easy for you to do nothing
But that's hard for me
I'm stayin' up all night, until I reach the light
Until the sun comes up

[Bridge]
Look into my eyes behind the true disguise
You can't even try, but you can criticize
Something from my heart for you to pick apart
You think that I need you? All of this is just for me

[Chorus]
'Cause it's hard for me
It's hard work, it's not a party (it's hard work, gotta work)
It's hard work, don't take no party, (keep on workin' yeah)
I don't see no party, it's just hard work (yeah, gotta work)
I never stop, I'm workin' workin', I'm workin' workin' workin' (never stop)
I never stop, it's hard for me

[Post-Chorus]
But it's easy for you
It's so easy for you
It's so easy for you
It's so easy for you
It's so easy for you
But it's hard for me
I sell 

[?] didn't like it
Without you there, couldn't fight it
I wouldn't survive
If you need me you'll believe me

Throw out your death, that time is over
Just cry your fears into my shoulder

No tired 

[?] the days burn
Sit down with me and watch the world turn
I think you will learn
If you need me you'll believe me

If you need me you'll believe me
If you need me you'll believe me

Don't start to cry, it's far from over
Look at who I am, coming closer

Look on your face doesn't seem well
The big disguise, joy is painful
I just hope that if you need me, you'll believe me

[Intro: RuPaul]
Miley Cyrus
Bitch, you look like you done already done had yours
You better go take your country-ass indoors
And put some damn clothes on
'Cause don't nobody need to be seeing all of that
The library is officially open

[Verse 1: RuPaul]
This cat is in heat
Let me ride that beat
My pussy on fire
Pussy five-alarm fire
This cat is in heat
Let me ride that beat
My pussy on fire
Pussy five-alarm fire

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Turn up your gratitude, turn down your attitude
I love my pussy, that means I got cattitude
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you
Turn up your gratitude, turn down your attitude
I love my pussy, that means I got cattitude
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
Ayy, go stupid, go dumb
Come and get it 'cause I know you want some
Nashville, Tennessee where I'm from
Since I was three, I've been banging on the drum
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum-pum

[Refrain: Miley Cyrus]
Nasty, I'm so nasty, nasty
I'm nasty, I'm so motherfucking nasty

[Verse 3: RuPaul]
Ride, shine, clock said pussy time
Bust my pussy nut while I'm fingering your butt
Do I suck dick? You ain't seen shit
Throw a C-note, watch you slide down my throat
Yeah, my pussy fine, I pop it 'cause it's mine
I don't give a fuck if they call me a slut
What I do with a dick, elect me presidick
Put tears in his eyes when I milk a brother dry

[Refrain: Miley Cyrus & RuPaul]
I'm so nasty, I'm nasty (Nasty)
I'm nasty, I'm nasty

[Verse 4: Miley Cyrus & RuPaul]
I'ma keep working from dawn to dusk
So I can keep buying cars off Elon Musk
The matte black spinners, now that's a must
But I want the whole pie, so leave the crust
I'm the moon, I'm the stars, I'm a Maserati
I love you, Nicki, but I listen to Cardi
I got a new song on the radio, and it goes five
(Four, three, two, one)
That's right, it's a number one
And I can't take you with me as a carry on
I already got my luggage, it's Margiela
And for my 16th birthday, I got Deréon
From the house of the queen
Queen, queen, that's what you can call me
Queen, I'ma have you run to your mommy
Queen, I'm the life of the party
Don't worry 'bout me, go and get yourself a hobby
(Sweet pussy of mine)
I'm so nasty
(Sweet pussy of mine)

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Turn up your gratitude, turn down your attitude
I love my pussy, that means I got cattitude
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you

[Post-Chorus: Miley Cyrus & RuPaul]
(Get it, get it) I'm so nasty
(Cash money) I'm so nasty
(Get it, get it, got it good)

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Ru, turn up your gratitude, turn down your attitude
I love my pussy, that means I got cattitude
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
Back up, you're squashing my charisma
Why I gotta be so motherfucking extra?
Back up, you're squashing my charisma
Why I gotta be so motherfucking extra?

[Post-Chorus: Miley Cyrus & RuPaul]
(Get it, get it) I'm so nasty
(Cash Money) I'm nasty
(Get it, get it) I'm so nasty
(Cash Money) I'm so motherfucking nasty

[Outro: Miley Cyrus]
You're just mad 'cause your hair is flat
(I'm so motherfucking nasty)
You're just mad 'cause your hair is flat
(I'm so motherfucking nasty)

Home town, I've been to a lot of places
But boy, when I come home, y'all know y'all show me love for real
Thank you, I love y'all
Umm, put your C's up

When I think of home, I think of a place where there's diehard fans that love me
And whenever I'm outta town, no matter where I go, you know that I gotta represent the C, yeah
Most of y'all don't even know that back in the days Rob was a street performer
Did whatever I had to do out in these streets just to make a come up, oh
But now I'm here, yeah
And I feel so blessed to be in the game for twenty two years, yeah

Uh, when I think of home, I think of a place where there's babies made to my music, oh
And when it comes to support, showing Kellz some love, Chicago y'all really know how to do it

Sometimes I ask myself, ''if it wasn't for y'all, where would I be?''

And that's why I thank God for Chicago, my baby city
And my homeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  My homeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Man, I got so much on my mind
And if I don't let it out, I'ma explode
Straight up

I'm sitting here, looking at all the people around me
Thinking if I weren't the R, tell me where would they be, hmm?
Most of them don't even care about Robert Kelly, no

They only care about what I can do for them
Some of em hang around me cause I got money!

Tell me what happened to my whole family, hmm?
Can't they see what I'm going through?
Little brother really needs them
I was there for them when they needed me, yeah

Soon as the drama comes, y'all asses quick to run
What type of shit is that?
How could y'all turn y'all backs?

People they smile right in your face
Then go and talk behind your back
When they don't even know the facts
And some of ya'll church forks point the finger at me, yeah
You should be loving on me
Or you should be praying for me
You'll never get it right
Is that the christian life?!

Sometimes I like to party, drink, have sex and smoke weed
But just because I love them things, it doesn't mean I'm going crazy
God, I wish I knew why people wanna hate me

When all I do is help em
Try my best to love em
Try to lift em up but they don't appreciate
So fuck em

[Verse 2: E-40]
Her booty shake like it got a generator
Thicker than a bowl of oatmeal in the refrigerator
To all the young gals, she an inspirator
Have a Range Rover, hella bad, gettin' tens of yaper
For all the triple beam boys want her and the entertainers
The dudes with the suits on the elevators
Easy on the eyes, small waist
Nice tits, nice thighs, nice cakes
Pull a bankroll out her bra, baddest bitch I ever saw
Bet she got some good jaw, oughta be against the law
Wetter than Niagara Falls, wetter than a spa
Make a preacher or a deacon wanna run up in her raw
She ain't pretty for no reason, got a head on her shoulder
Got her hygienes up, smell good, no odor
Lookin' like somebody drew her, baby bad, she a gor'
She a winner, she a pretty piece of art, she a sculpture
UH!

[Intro]
2002 baby
The beginning
Straight Drop Records
Mack and ? this bitch
My nigga Gucci Mane
And this is how we are doing it
Straight Drop in this shit

[Verse: Gucci Mane]
A Rolex watch and a yacht
Nigga I don´t got
But with the rocks and Glocks
I bet you I close shop
I'm in strip spots with knots
Where Moet bottles get popped
I put Straight Drop on top
So niggas giving me props
Back to my block with yay
They getting moved every day
They call me Gucci Mane my nigga
But my kin call me Ray
But what you bitch niggas say
It can´t make me or break me
I´m shooting dice every day
Five-deuce and four-trey
Babies four ways
Izzos,ninos and kilos
The yayo in fat boy pillows tripple zeros
I´m getting to the money
Don´t be no dummy don´t be no fool
Paint change every season
Or else I gotta cop something new
Step up your game another notch
I went from rocks to blocks
And now we stampin SD’s on block
We rockin' straight drop chains
With the diamonds and bezels
You can´t fuck with Gucci Mane
I´m on a whole ´nother level

[Intro]
There you had it
Straight Drop records baby
You know Straight Drop this shit
And we ain´t even finished
Gucci Mane
Take it home baby

[Verse: Gucci Mane]
My nigga I don´t rap
I spit game over beats
You can catch me in the trap
With some crack cocaine on the street
And I ain´t gotta put no chains on your feet
For 3 grams of that P
I´ll have my partner leave you ready to see
And I don´t freestyle nigga
´Cause this game ain´t free
The keyboard cost money so does that MP
This rap game is like a trap
So I´m still on the grind
Every track I spit a verse on
I´m cooking a nine
Every city that I open
Is like I´m selling a dime
´Cause if I ain´t making money
Then I´m wasting my time
And we ain´t never smoke no swishers with Tigger
Yeah this deal, the Straight Drop bank account is getting bigger and bigger
These niggas are dreaming about deals
But that ain´t the dealy
They want the keys to a Bentley
I want the keys to the city
I´m a pimp
Born a pimp
I´m a pimp ´till my death
I´ve got so much pimpin in me
I´ll be pimpin myself
´Cause Gucci Mane´s on the track

[Verse 1]
It was twenty years ago today
When Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So let me introduce to you
The man you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Bridge]
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home

[Verse 2]
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Guitar Solo]

Reprise

[Verse]
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you have enjoyed the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're sorry, but it's time to go
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We'd like to thank you once again
Sgt. Pepper's one and only Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's getting very near the end
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Verse 1]
I needed loving, I needed a friend
I needed something that would be there in the end

[Chorus]
Of the rough ride to Heaven
Want to get inside; what will I do?
Oh, on a rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside to be with you

[Verse 2]
I knew you'd help me, I knew you could
You knew I didn't want to be misunderstood

[Chorus]
Of the rough ride to Heaven
Want to get inside; what will I do?
Oh, on a rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside to be with you

[Verse 3]
I'm not asking for an easy passage, so I hope you understand
I'm not after any special treatment, but I wouldn't mind a hand

[Outro]
On a rough ride, on a rough ride
On a rough ride, on a rough ride
On a rough ride To Heaven
Want to get inside; what will I do?

[Verse 1]
Going fast, coming soon
We made love in the afternoon
Found a flat, after that
We got married
Working hard for the dream
Scoring goals for the other team
Times were bad, we were glad
We got married

[Chorus 1]
I love the way you open up your hearts to each other
When you find a meeting of the minds
Just as well love was all we ever wanted
It was all we ever had

[Verse 2]
Further on in the game
Waiting up till the children came
Place your bets, no regrets
We got married, we got married, we got married
Nowadays every night flashes by
At the speed of light
Living life, loving wife
We got married

[Chorus 2]
Ohh, I love the things that happen when we start to discover
Who we are and what we're living for
Just because love was all we ever wanted
It was all we ever had

[Outro]
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work out at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work out at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work out at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work out at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work out at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work out at it

[Verse 1]
Baby, I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
And maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time
You hung me on a line
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

[Bridge]
Baby, I'm a man, and maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Baby, I'm a man, and maybe you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby, won't you help me to understand?
Ooh-ah

[Bridge]
Baby, I'm a man, and maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Baby, I'm a man, and maybe you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby, won't you help me to understand?
Ooh-ah

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time
And maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song
You right me when I'm wrong
Baby, I'm amazed at the way I really need you

Oh, oh, oh
Hey-hey-hey!
Oh, oh
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh

[Intro]
Oh, yeah!

[Verse 1]
You're always barking about the money I spend
You never quit screaming about paying the rent

[Chorus]
Quit bugging me
(Yeah, yeah, he's cracking up
Yeah, yeah, he's cracking up
Yeah, yeah, he's cracking up)

[Outro]
I'm crackin' up, baby

[Verse 1]
You made me cry when you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Isn't that a shame? You're the one to blame

[Verse 2]
Well, you broke my heart when you said we're going to part
But ain't that a shame?
Oh my tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame
You're the one to blame

[Verse 1]
You made me cry when you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Isn't that a shame? You're the one to blame

[Chorus]
Oh well, goodbye, although I'm gonna cry
Ain't that a shame?
Oh, my tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
This is a good place to be!

[Verse 1]
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Verse 2]
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Chorus 1]
Ooh, well, I got a girl with a record machine
When it comes to rocking, she's a queen
Went to a dance on a Saturday night
All alone where I could hold her tight
She lives on the twentieth floor uptown
The elevator’s broken down

[Chorus 2]
So I walk one, two flight, three flight four
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight more
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag
Fifteen before I'm ready to drag
Get to the top, and I’m too tired to rock

[Verse 1]
Well, she, she called me up on the telephone
Said, "Come on over, baby, I'm all alone"
I said, "Baby, you're mighty sweet
But I'm in bed with a aching feet"
This went on for a couple of days
But I could not stay away

[Chorus 2]
So I walk one, two flight, three flight four
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight more
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag
Fifteen before I'm ready to drag
Get to the top, and I'm too tired to rock

[Verse 2]
Well, sent to Chicago for repairs
Till it's fixed I’m using the stairs
I hope they hurry, before it’s too late
You know, I love my baby too much to wait
All this climbing is getting me down
They'll find my corpse draped over the rail

[Chorus 2]
So I walk one, two flight, three flight four
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight more
Up on the twelfth I’m starting to sag
Fifteen before I'm ready to drag
Get to the top, and I'm too tired to rock

[Chorus 1]
Ooh, well, I got a girl with a record machine
When it comes to rocking, she's a queen
Went to a dance on a Saturday night
All alone where I could hold her tight
She lives on the twentieth floor uptown
The elevator’s broken down

[Chorus 2]
So I walk one, two flight, three flight four
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight more
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag
Fifteen before I'm ready to drag
Get to the top, and I'm too tired to rock

[Verse 1]
Give me your hand
I'd like to shake it
I want to show you I'm your friend
You'll understand
If I can make it clear
It's all that matters in the end

[Chorus]
"Put it there if it weights a ton"
That's what a father says to his young son
"I don't care if it weights a ton
As long as you and I are here, put it there
Long as you and I are here, put it there"

[Verse 2]
If there's a fight, I'd like to fix it
I hate to see things go so wrong
The darkest night and all it's mixed emotions
Are getting lighter sing along

[Chorus]
"Put it there if it weights a ton"
That's what a father says to his young son
"I don't care if it weights a ton
As long as you and I are here, put it there
Long as you and I are here, put it there"

Heba, heba helloa, oh, yeah
Heba, heba helloa, yo, whoa
Heba, heba helloa, oh yeah
Heba, heba helloa, yeah

[Intro]
This one, this one, this one
This one, this one...

[Verse 1]
Did I ever take you in my arms, look you in the eye
Tell you that I do?
Did I ever open up my heart
And let you look inside?

[Chorus]
If I never did it, I was only waiting
For a better moment that didn't come
There never could be a better moment
Than this one, this one
The swan is gliding above the ocean
A god is riding upon his back
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
Fade this one to black

[Verse 2]
Did I ever touch you on the cheek, say that you were mine
Thank you for the smile?
Did I ever knock upon your door
Try to get inside?

[Chorus]
If I never did it, I was only waiting
For a better moment that didn't come
There never could be a better moment
Than this one, this one
The swan is gliding above the ocean
A god is riding upon his back
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
Fade this one to black

[Bridge]
What opportunities did we allow to flow by
Feeling like the timing wasn't quite right?
What kind of magic might have worked if we had stayed calm?
Couldn't I have given you a better life?

[Verse 3]
Did you ever take me in your arms, look me in the eye
Tell me that you do?
Did I ever open up my heart
Let you look inside?

[Chorus]
If I never did it, I was only waiting
For a better moment that didn't come
There never could be a better moment
Than this one, this one
The swan is gliding above the ocean
A God is riding upon his back
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
Fade this one to black

[Outro]
This one is gliding, oh
A God is riding, oh
How calm the water
How calm the water and bright the rainbow

[Verse 1]
One day, you'll look
To see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

[Verse 2]
Some day, you'll know
I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

[Chorus 1]
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
One day, you'll find
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
Yeah tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

[Chorus 2]
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 4]
One day, you'll find
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

[Chorus 1]
The same me that stands here now
When I think that all this stuff
Can make a life that's pretty hard to take it in
That was me

Mersey Beat'n with the band, that was me
Yeah that was me, sweating cobwebs under contract
In the cellar, on TV, that was me

If fate agreed that all of this
To make a lifetime, who am I to disagree
Oh, that was me

You're in my bed uninvited
It's fine 'cause I'm in the mood
Hope you don't mind if I spike it
We'll drink it, just me and you

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
And you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be sleeping on a red-eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night
And we're just gettin' started

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Always last to leave the party
Drugs rule everything around me
Wake up with new tattoos on my body
Drugs rule everything around me
Hit the Goose, raise a toast, pop the molly
I can go toe-to-toe, like I'm Ali
We're all tryna fill the lonely
Drugs rule everything around me

[Post-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
These planes are all UFOs
And this city's in outer space
It's better than where we came from
I think that we both should stay

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Cause you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be fucking on a red-eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night
And we're just gettin' started

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Always last to leave the party
Drugs rule everything around me
Wake up with new tattoos on my body
Drugs rule everything around me
Hit the ghost, raise a toast, pop the molly
All the girls in my room look like Dolly
We're all tryna fill the lonely
Drugs rule everything around me

[Post-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
(Drugs rule everything around me)
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Drugs rule everything around me
You could call me a king
I got it all in my store, you should crown me
Purple Perc, sticky green mollies, sippy lean
Got the white that's sure to light the floor like in "Billie Jean"
Scarface nights (Nights)
500 thousand on the pinkie, Broadway ice (Ice)
We throw diamonds at weddings and y'all throw rice (Rice)
Lollapalooza, Coachella custies, that's my type
Party all night

[Verse 1]
Hallelujah, I'm a freak, I'm a freak, hallelujah
Every day of the week, I'ma do ya like I want to
I'm a Nile crocodile, a piranha

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my God, she got the power
Oh, look at her, she got the power
So, so, so

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter

So, back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh

[Verse 2]

Swish swish, I'm a three-point shooter, I blow through ya
Like a hot wind out in the bayou, yah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my God, she got the power
Well, look at her, she got the power

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
My mama always told me that I'd make it
That I'd make it, so I made it
I put my back into and my heart in it
So I did it, yeah, I did it
My mama always told me that I'd make it
That I'd make it, so I made it
I put my back into and my heart in it
So I did it, yeah, I did it

[Chorus]

Let me show you how to switch it for

[Intro]
To lead a better life I need my love to be here

[Verse 1]
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

[Verse 2]
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn’t know he's there

[Chorus]
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I’m always there

[Chorus]
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Outro]
I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere

[Verse 1]
I saw a cat with a machine in his brain
The man who fed him said he didn't feel any pain
I'd like to see that man take out that machine
And stick it in his own brain
You know what I mean

[Verse 2]
I saw a rabbit with its eyes full of tears
The lab that owned her had been doing it for years
Why don't we make them pay for every last eye
That couldn't cry its own tears?
Do you know what I mean?

[Chorus]
When I tell you that we'll all be
Looking for changes
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures
And we will learn how to grow

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
When I tell you that we'll all be
Looking for changes
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures
And we will learn how to grow

[Bridge]
When we're looking for changes

[Verse 3]
I saw a monkey that was learning to choke
A guy beside him gave him cigarettes to smoke
And every time that monkey started to cough
The bastard laughed his head off
Do you know what I mean?

[Chorus]
When I tell you that we'll all be
Looking for changes
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures
And we will learn how to grow

[Outro]
When we're looking for changes
We're looking for changes 

[x2]
We're looking for changes in the way we are

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
This winter was as cold as you and I
I know you're home, hoping I'm alright
How many times have I left you in the deep?
I don't know why you still believe in me

[Chorus]
Oh, and even in my darkest days, even in my lowest place
You love me the most
And even when I can't stay, even when I run away
You love me the most
So why do I hurt you so? Is it 'cause I know?
Why do I hurt you so? Is it 'cause you love me the most?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the most
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I know? Is it 'cause you love me the most?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the most
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I know? Yeah

[Verse 2]
Your tender touch is the healing that I seek
I come to you when my judgement becomes weak
All that you are is all I ever need
I don't know why you still believe in me

[Chorus]
Oh, and even in my darkest days, even in my lowest place
You love me the most
And even when I can't stay, even when I run away
You love me the most
So why do I hurt you so? Is it 'cause I know?
Why do I hurt you so? Is it 'cause you love me the most?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the most
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I know? Is it 'cause you love me the most?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the most
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I know? Yeah

[Outro]
How many times have I left you in the deep?
I don't know why you still believe in me

[Chorus]
I'm a little drunk, I know it
I’ma get high as hell
I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else
I'm a little drunk, I know it
I’ma get high as hell
I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else

[Verse]
Wake up in the middle of a breakdown, yeah, uh
Have sex on the table with the takeout (Uh)
I'm sick of the faking, the using, the taking
The people calling me obscene
You hate me, you love me, you just wanna touch me
I'm only trying to get some peace
So let me do me

[Chorus]
I'm a little drunk, I know it
I'ma get high as hell
I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else (Hey)

[Chorus]
I'm a little drunk, I know it
I’ma get high as hell
I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else

Can you spark me up your last cigarette?
I promise you, you'll never forget
What it feels to be living larger
Baby, party harder

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart’s never wanted anymore than you yet
When I see those tattoos all over your chest
I want nothing more than to wake in your bed
Next to you, next to you

[Chorus]
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl

[Verse 2]
I'll kiss all the ink on your neck
'Cause baby, you do it, and you do it the best

Hold me for a little longer

Tell me things I always wanna hear
You're the medicine, doctor
Skin on skin, softer

My heart's never wanted anymore than you yet
When I see those tattoos all over your chest
I want nothing more than to wake in your bed
Next to you, next to you

Snippet

[Verse ?]
You call it film, I call it truth
You can't be trusted, get to the root of your bullshit
I could have my way if I feel like it
Jungle turn to pavement if my pen write it
I can't be questioned, bitch, who are you?
Can't learn a lesson, stuck in the loop of my own shit
I will sacrifice my evolution

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
The missile is headed straight for my heart
It's like a thousand buildings crashing down
I’m stuck on this planet, can't count on the stars
'Cause my wish has never come back around
You take me up, and then you drop me, baby
’Cause you're the perfect fix, you're my drug
You drive me crazy
I go again and again, and then I overdose

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Like I'm sober, but I don't know where I'm at
See I done followed you, girl, and I don't know my way back
I gave you my love, just wanna be loved
Just you and me in love, yeah
You're tryna defeat love, I’m fighting to keep love
What did you do to me, babe?

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter & Both]
There’s no such thing as a perfect day
'Cause once the moment comes, it’ll fade away
I done gave you every single part of me
What else can I give? There's nothing left to take
Girl, you're my rise 'n fall
Ooh-ooh, a-all
I see it clearer
Girl, you’re my rise 'n fall
Ooh-ooh, a-all
I see it clearer

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
I used to think that I need you as bad as I need it
And all this rage that you started inside of me, it ain't 'posed to be here
One minute you say that you love me, and then you go and close the door-oor
This ain't a mistake, I don't know what it's for
I just wanted another to just prove you wrong
Can't take it no more, oh-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Like I'm sober, but I don't know where I'm at
I done traveled down this lonely road before
See I done followed you, girl, and I don't know my way back (Oh)
I gave you my love, just wanna be loved
Just you and me in love, yeah
You're tryna defeat love, I'm fighting to keep love
Fighting to keep you here

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter & Both]
There's no such thing as a perfect day(Oh-oh)
'Cause once the moment comes, it'll fade away (Ooh-ooh)
I done gave you every single part of me (Yeah, oh)
What else can I give? There's nothing left to take (No, no, no)
Girl, you're my rise 'n fall
Ooh-ooh, a-all (Oh)
I see it clearer
Girl, you're my rise 'n fall
Ooh-ooh, a-all
In my head

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
'Cause I am in my head, back and forth
I'm playing it over again
Wanna be back in love, back in love with you
I'm so confused
Why can't you change for me? (Oh)
Why can't you stay for me? (Oh-oh)
Instead of changing who you are
Girl, you don't have to please everybody (Yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter & Both]
There's no such thing as a perfect thing (Oh)
'Cause once the moment comes, it'll fade away (Ooh-ooh)
I done gave you every single part of me (I done gave you everything I—)
What else can I give? There's nothing else to take
Girl, you're my rise 'n fall
(You're my rise 'n fall, you're my rise 'n fall)
Ooh-ooh, a-all (Oh)
I see it clearer
Girl, you're my rise 'n fall
(You're my, my)
Ooh-ooh, a-all
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
But I still love you, baby
You are my rise 'n fall, girl

I don't know if I wanna caress you (Oh)
I don't know what I wanna do with you, girl (Oh)
I don't know what I wanna do with you

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Well, it's that gat toting, pistol holding nigga on your damn street
Pussy nigga usually pop a trigger if the hand speak
Lackluster, I'ma smack suckers this year
I'ma make a hundred thousand racks off of this here
Do the math, hundred million for the slow ones in the class
Type of bags I be gettin' be too big to pay in cash
Send the wire, send it fast 'fore I might just change my mind
Nowadays, a million dollars barely worth a nigga time
I ain't sayin' I'm the richest nigga that's in this shit (But I'm one of them)
Barely check my account, nigga, I'm admittin' it (I don't give a fuck)
Fuck around with my bread, bet you I'ma find out (I'ma catch you, nigga)
Couple niggas I deaded know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Nigga, don't play with me, I got a wife, I got a baby to feed
I got a mama to spoil, I got a brother, got a few legal fees
I got a daddy and shit
Medical bills, credit to fix
People to pay, label to run
You play with your life if you play with my funds, nigga

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Got me stressed (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
I don't wanna rest (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
Smoking cigarettes (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)

But I can't help it thinkin' if I lose the rest (Oh)
And I can't help it, I don't wanna stress (Oh)
But I can't help it, yeah (Oh)
No, no, no

[Bridge: J. Cole & T-Shyne]
Old sweats, road, jets, tote TECs, no flex
Bad bitches, no let's, on deck, broke, next
Pill popper, square niggas bare witness, uh (Oh)
Blunt twisters, fuck niggas (Oh, got me stressed, woah)

[Verse 2: T-Shyne]
I've been stressin' 'cause I still ain't buy my dad a house (Stressin')
I've been stressin' 'cause my girl said, "We can't work it out" (Got me stressed)
I know some people that start sinnin' as soon as church get out (Church get out)
And I don't think like I used to think 'cause I'm older now (Older now)
When you broke, you doin' more for less (Yeah)
You ain't findin' no success (No success)
Sad to say my girl just left
And I really love her to death (I do)
Told her I can't call her my ex 'cause I feel like we ain't finished yet (We not done)
I just texted her phone and I said, "Are you out your feelings yet?"
And my brother, he just called, he need that lawyer money (That lawyer money)
They said he did it, but I know he didn't (Nah)
But you need O. J. money when you tryna get acquitted (Yeah)
This shit is sickenin', nobody listen when you in prison (Prison)
I was hangin' on the corner with some Jordans on, no designer (No designer)
Servin' up that white girl, back then we called her fine china (Yeah)
I was lookin' for a bad bitch, but I didn't know where to find her (Where to find her)
All this pressure and this stress made me a diamond (Diamond)
I'm just tryna show love, some people never grow up
Sometimes I wish I could trust, but that's how feelings get crushed
I used to ride on the train, I used to ride on the bus
They wanna hang with the gang, but, no, they not one of us

[Verse 1]
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I find myself in love racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

[Chorus]
I wanna run (Run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (Run)
And smash into you

[Verse 2]
Ears closed
What I hear, no one else has to know
'Cause I know
That what we have is worth first place in gold
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong, oh

[Chorus]
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
Smash into you
Oh...

[Bridge]
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I'm in love and I'm racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love (Your love)
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

[Chorus]
Ohh, I wanna run
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (Run)
Smash into you
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I wanna run (Run)
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (Run)
Smash into you

[Verse 1]
She was lost
In so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
Never for the grace of God

[Chorus]
Oh, I, I found heaven on Earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria

[Bridge]
Sometimes love can come
And pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hits you
And then you realize
It's out of your hands
Baby you got to understand

[Chorus]
Ave Maria
Ave Maria

[Outro]
Ave Maria, gratia plena
Maria, gratia plena
Maria, gratia plena
Ave, ave dominus
Tecum

[Verse 1]
You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could’ve been
But still ,you live inside of me
So tell me how is that?
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, you’re the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
So let me just say
I don’t wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don’t want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
This, no broken-hearted girl

[Bridge]
Now I’m at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain’t gotta be afraid, my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh, ohh, ohh

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, baby
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't want to take a breath with out you, baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
So let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I’d kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I’d be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin’ for me to come home
To come home
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I’d be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he’s taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you’re just a boy
You don't understand
Yeah, you don't understand
How it feels to love a girl, someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy
I want you to know that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me
Would she go down on you in a theatre
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive

[Chorus]
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
Are you thinking of me when you fuck her
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive

[Chorus]
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

But you're just a boy
Yeah, you don't understand
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy

[Verse 1]
Stop the track, lemme state facts
I told you, gimme a minute and I'll be right back
Fifty million 'round the world and they say that I couldn't get it
I done got so sick and filthy with Benjis, I can't spend it
How you gon' be talkin' shit? You act like I just got up in it
Been the number one diva in this game for a minute
I know you read the paper - the one that they call the Queen
Every radio 'round the world know me 'cause that's where I be (first!)

[Chorus]
I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey)

When he pull up, wanna pop my hood up

Tell me somethin', (Tell me somethin')

[Bridge]
Since 15 in my stilettos, been struttin' in this game
"What's yo age?" was the question they ask when I hit the stage
I'm a diva, best believe her, you see how she gettin' paid?
She ain't callin' him to greet her, don't need him, her bed's made
This is a stick-up, stick-up (I need them bags, all that money)
We're gonna stick-up, stick-up (You see them ask, "Where that money?")
All my ladies get it up, I see you, I do the same;
Take it to another level, no passengers on my plane

(Hey)

[Verse 1]
You're the only one that Papa allowed to hang out in my room
With the door closed, we'd be alone
And mama never freaked out when she heard it go 'BOOM!'
'Cause she knew we were in the zone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hold him in my arms and look out of my window
(Under the moonlight)
And he be keepin' me calm so I'd never let him go
He's got a place in my heart

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound

[Versus 2]
When I get into my car, turn it uh-up, uh-up
Then I hear vibrations all up in my truh-unk, uh-unk
And the bassline be rattlin' through my see-eat, ee-eats
Then that crazy feeling starts happeni-ing- i-ing, OH!

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I get butterflies when I hear the DJ (Playing the stuff I like)
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays
He's got a place in my heart

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound

[Bridge]
I be on the hotline, like e'rryday
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play
You know I got my top back and my beat low-oh
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio-oh
Turn up my radio, radio, radio....

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound

Oh, ooh, whoa, whoa

[Intro]
Aw baby, how you doin'?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh?
Some women were made...
But me, myself?
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
And, uh
What's more special than you?
You feel me?

[Verse 1]
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

[Chorus]
It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much)
It's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

[Verse 2]
Usually I'm humble
Right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know
I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes?
Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda something like me

[Chorus]
It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much)
It's too tough (Tough)
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego
Such a huge ego
But, he loves my big ego
It's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

[Verse 1]
I love the way you walk into the room
Body shining, lighting up the place
And when you talk, everybody stop
'Cause they know you know just what to say
And the way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you grow, you take everyone you love along
I love that shit

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I’m cold
I want you to know

[Chorus]
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
It was many years ago (Ago)
Baby, when you (When you)
Stole my cool (Stole my cool)
'Cause you had me at hello (My cool) (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)

[Verse 2]
I get so excited when you travel with me
Baby, while I'm on my grind
Never would I ever let my hustle
Come between me and my family time
You keep me humble out of this hype
'Cause you know there's more to life
If I need you, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I’m cold
I want you to know

[Chorus]
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
It was many years ago (Ago)
Baby, when you (When you)
Stole my cool (Stole my cool)
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello, hello)

To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch (Don't touch)
And keep talking that mess that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And, it's my name that's on that jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Verse 2]
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
'Cause you was untrue
Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

So since I'm not your everything (Irreplaceable)
How about I'll be nothing (Nothing)
Nothing at all to you (Nothing)

'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you was so easy

Don't you ever for a second get to thinking

To keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue 'em with glue
I'm in a trance, all eyes on you and your crew
Me and my man's don't dance, but to feel y'all bump and grind

[Hook: Michelle Williams, Kelly Rowland & Beyoncé]
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly

Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe

[Intro: JAY-Z & (Beyoncé)]
Hehehe! Yeah, B!
Talk yo' shit! Hehe (Partner, let me upgrade you)
How you gon' upgrade me?
What's higher than number one?
You know I used to beat that block
Now I be's the block (Partner, let me upgrade you)

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a leash though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me
Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (That's a good look)
I'mma help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look, ladies that's a good look)
When you're in them big meetings for the mills (That's a good look)
It take me just to compliment the deals (That's a good look)
Anything you cop, I'll split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look, ladies that's a good look)

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels
Upgrade you, I can up, can I upgrade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you
Flip a new page, let me upgrade you
Introduce you to some new things, and upgrade you
I can up, can I up, let me upgrade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I can do for you, what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equals
Still play my part and let you take the lead role, believe me
I'll follow, this could be easy
I'll be the help, whenever you need me (You need me)
I see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (That's a good look)
I'ma help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look, ladies, that's a good look)
When you're in them big meetings for the mills (That's a good look)
It take me just to compliment the deals (That's a good look)
Anything you cop, I'll split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look, ladies, that's a good look)

[Chorus 2: (Beyoncé & JAY-Z)]
Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels
Upgrade you, I can (up), can I (up) grade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you
Flip a new page, let me upgrade you
Introduce you to some new things, and (Uh!) upgrade (HOV!) you
I can (up), (Uh!) can I (up), let me, (HOV!) upgrade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you,(Uh huh huh!)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I be the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (hehe)

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
Now you my project celebrity
I keep ya name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star, but unless you're flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]

[Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels
Upgrade you, I can (up), can I (up) grade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you]

[Flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things, and upgrade you]

[I can (up), can I (up), let me, upgrade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you]

[Outro: Beyoncé]
Audemars Piguet watch, dimples in ya necktie
Hermes briefcase, Cartier tie clips
Silk-lined blazers, diamond creamed facials
VVS cuff links, six-star pent suites
Partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Let me, let me, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, partna, let me upgrade ya (Huh!)

[String instruments play]

At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh yeah yeah

At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Oh yeah, when you smile
You smile, Ooh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At last
Oh!

[Verse 1]
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It’s only beginning to find release

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

[Chorus]
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I’m not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I’m more than what
You’ve made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened

[Verse 2]
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I’m screamin' out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or turned
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen

[Chorus]
Listen. I am alone at a crossroads
I’m not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

[Bridge]
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't

[Chorus]
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own, my own

Now put your hands up

[Verse 1]
Up in the club (club), just broke up (up)
I’m doing my own little thing
Decided to dip (dip), but now you wanna trip (trip)
'Cause another brother noticed me
I’m up on him (him), he up on me (me)

[Bridge]
Don't treat me to the things of the world
I’m not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here’s a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I’m the one you want
If you don’t, you’ll be alone
And like a ghost, I’ll be gone

[Bridge]
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)

'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it

Whoa, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

[Chorus]
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

[Post-Chorus]
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo

[Verse 2]
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

[Chorus]
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

[Post-Chorus]
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo
Halo
Ooh

[Chorus]
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more

Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

[Verse 1]
Love is the answer
If it is real, it won't leave
Yeah, your love's taking over, over
Broken heart makes the speakers bleed

[Chorus]
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed (Oh-oh-oh)
The speakers bleed
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed (Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
I ain't doing this for myself
Just 'cause you with somebody else
This just ain't another natural balance
So why would you just lie to yourself?
It's not the way to love me

[Chorus]
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed
The speakers bleed
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed
The speakers bleed
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair (No fair)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes (Those ocean eyes)
I'm scared (I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 1]
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

[Verse 2]
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Verse 3]
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Bridge]
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych

Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Verse 1]
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Verse 2]
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)

[Bridge]
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

Crown

It's been funky
It's been hip

Look at my wings
They're fantasy, they're fairy
Now you are looking at me
You don't have 'em, I'm the boss
I'll give you where it hurts
With all my fairy dust
You roll crazy like a dice
Cause of my wings, my glitter
And oh my mind!

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been dope
It's been sick
It's been funky
It's been hip

[Chrous]
They say I'm nobody, I'm not worth anything, but I know that's just envy
With my wings they will go crazy
Cause' they shine more than those lazy
And if they don't get to buy my heart, then I don't consider 'em a f*cking threat
Funky

[Intro: Tk-N-Ca$h]
My mind right
I had to leave that ho alone to get my mind right
I had to leave that ho alone to get my mind right
Yeah
Yeah

[Hook: Tk-N-Ca$h]
I had to leave that ho alone to get my mind right
(Leave that ho alone to get my mind right)
I had to come up on a check to get my mind right
(come up on a check to get my mind right)
I had to-

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Get my mind right
Money white
Hustle right
Fuck her right
Fuck it right
Fuck them pussy niggas I’ll see ‘em in another life
Woo! May my tombstone read what a life
Pussy ass nigga say he thuggin’ he a fuckin' lie
Tell him I say its a wrap like it's mummified
Hustle for a hundred days a hundred nights
Run it right
Runnin’ lights
Duckin’ lights
There he go, cut the lights
Try to spare these niggas but I put 'em on fuckin' strike
Got these niggas scrambling, and we sunny side
Come at me sideways I ride three six five days
Hot as a latte, picante, an entrée
I am the fucking best man for the job
These niggas bridesmaids, I leave niggas sideways
I don't want to hear it to me it's just blasé
I need my money ándale ándale
I got my mind right I got my mind made
But how come the early bird acting like I'm late
I'm ready for war
Money right
Hustle white
Alright
Fuckin' right
Whippin' white all night 'til a nigga knuckle white
Smoke a pound drunk a pint, another pint, another pint
B-T-W F-Y-I F-Y-L
Fuck your life L-O-L bullet shell, bloody knife
Body parts, babies crying, bitches running, bells ringing
Had to leave my heavenly bitch for a hell's angel, Lord
I l-l-licked the pussy 'til I got my L's tangled
I take CMB off the YM, I'm just spell checkin'
Yeah, I know a nigga named Rodney King
Get along with him and not with me
'Cause I'm on the edge and I'm 'bout to leave
Gun to his head make him count to three
One, two, three
BOW BOW BOW BOW
She gave me head she forgot to breathe
Straight from the bed to the shower scene
Straight from the stove to the block nigga
I do numbers you can count on me
Remember when I didn't have a pot to pee
Now I look like I done hit the lottery
Went from poverty to property
Make a mockery of a shopping spree
These niggas ain't cold they ain't hot to me
They think they like me but they not to me
Wait let me put my binoculars on
You fake as fuck as far as I can see
My eyes red as fuck look like a eye disease
I let that yopper squeeze, I sat down with me
And then I told myself, look before you kill somebody leave

[Hook: Tk-N-Ca$h & *Lil Wayne*]
I had to leave that ho alone to get my mind right

I had to leave that ho alone to get my mind right
(Leave that ho alone to get my mind right)

[Verse 1]
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Verse 2]
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)

[Bridge]
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown (You should see me, see me)
Your silence is my favorite sound (You should see me, see me)
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Intro]
Aah
Aah

[Verse 1]
The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run
Aah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need? (I need)
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

[Verse 2]
I'm home alone, you're God knows where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Giving you all you want and more
Giving you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored?
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it

[Intro]
Hey, leave a message

[Verse 1]
Hey - call me back when ya get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait - you know what?
Maybe just forget it
'Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked

[Chorus]
"Stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way...
"It's not you it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Dontcha, babe
I'm not your party favor

[Verse 2]
Look - now I know we coulda done it better
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if ya read 'em backwards
You'll single out the wrong words
Like you mishear all my songs

[Chorus]
You hear "stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way
"It's not you it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Dontcha, babe
I'm not your party favor

[Chorus]
Was supposed to be a casual arrangement
Now I feel as though I'm constantly complaining
That don't make it right if it makes you feel good
That don't make it right if it makes you feel good

[Verse 1]
Trying hard to keep the rules that we established
Sometimes it seems like you're the lead and I'm the ad-lib
That don't make it right if it makes you feel good
That don't make it right if it makes you feel good

Male: I love you
Female: Roger, you've got to stop this, you're acting like a baby. I can't see you now and that's that
Male: Well then, talk to me, say something, say anything
Female: Say something?

[Chorus]
Was supposed to be a casual arrangement
Now I feel as though I'm constantly complaining
That don't make it right if it makes you feel good
That don't make it right if it makes you feel good

[Verse 2]
Used to wake up feeling like I won the lotto
Out of sight out of mind, that's the motto
That don't make it right if it makes you feel good
That don't make it right if it makes you feel good

Female: Alright Roger, I'll say something. Why don't you take a flying jump at the moon?

[Chorus: Charli XCX + Rita Ora]
We're staying all night

Oh yeah, and we're united forevermore

Why the fuck you in my bed all day?
Talking 'bout you getting bread
'Less you is a bird, then I understand, okay
Never ever bite the hand feeding you the worm
These are not your eggs, okay, look, look, look
Long ass money with a short fuse

Late to the shift, be sweet

Nigga D-E-F 'bout to throw grenades (Grenades)
Keep a ghetto freak, but she lightin' sage
Natural hair poppin', don't ever get it twisted
She at your scalp for the fame
Nah, nah, nah, nigga, listen, let me lecture, see
When it be about the bread, oh, want the Quiznos, don't test it, ayy
I'm a gentleman, I turn to a barracuda swimming in your blessings, hey
Higher than a hallelujah, hot as halitosis, she lick me like

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
Hey, you little piss baby
You think you're so fucking cool? Huh?
You think you're so fucking tough?
You talk a lotta big game for someone with such a small truck
Aw, look at those arms
Your arms look so fucking cute, they look like lil' cigarettes
I bet I could smoke you, I could roast you
And then you'd love it and you'd text me "I love you"
And then I'd fucking ghost you

[Chorus: Laura Les]
With the big boys coming with the big stuff
I feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah
Big boys coming with the big trucks
Feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah
Big boys coming with the big trucks
Feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah
Big boys coming with the picture
Feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah (Oh yeah)

Tell me what's the deal, I've been tryin' to go to bed
I've been up for days, I've been tryna get ahead
Said it all before, and I'll say it once again
I'm better off alone
Tell me what's the deal, I've been tryin' to go to bed
I've been up for days, I've been tryna get ahead
Said it all before, and I'll say it once again
I'm better off alone

[Verse 1]
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

[Verse 2]
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Verse 3]
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Bridge]
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Too many brothers falling
Too many mothers cry
Too many prayers have bounced back from the sky
Too much talk and too much cheat
Too many fathers losin' sleep
Too many broken hearts we can’t make right

[Chorus]
We need love, love, love
We've gotta fight for, we've gotta fight for
Love, love, love
We’ve got a right to, we've got a right to
Love, love, love
It's the only thing
There just ain't enough of
There just ain't enough of

[Verse 2]
Too many bridges burnin', too many battle lines
Too many wounded dreamers left behind
Too much time spent buildin' walls
Was what we found worth what we lost?
Too many pages that we can't rewrite

[Chorus]
We need love, love, love
We’ve gotta fight for, we’ve gotta fight for
Love, love, love
We've got a right to, we’ve got a right to
Love, love, love

Ooh

(All we need, all we need is a little love)
All we need is love, yeah

[Outro]
Too much talk and too much cheat
(All we need, all we need is a little love)
Too many fathers losing sleep
Too many broken hearts we can’t make right
(All we need, all we need is a little love)
Oh, we need love, love, love
It's the only thing
There just ain't enough of

[Chorus]
Blame it on the night
One too many at the dive
Saw you called a thousand times
Can’t talk about it, won’t talk about it
Danced until I cried
Took a hit and got too high
Started questioning my life
Let’s not talk about it, won’t talk about it

[Verse 1]
I’m waking up to messages
Don’t recognize the name
I’m wondering who the F it is
‘Cause I don’t know any James
Somebody next to me in my bed
Hold up, wait, this isn’t my bed
Telling myself never again, again

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah) I don’t know what happened to my friends
(To my friends) Or where I been
(Ah) And I can’t tell you how this story ends
And I can’t pretend

[Chorus]
Blame it on the night
One too many at the dive
Saw you called a thousand times

Can’t talk about it, won’t talk about it

[Verse 2]
How am I in the club again?
Said I was staying in (Ah, ah)
Having another heart to heart
With someone that I just met (Ah)
And the next thing that I know (I know)
Is I wake up in my clothes (Ah-ah)
And the voice inside my head (My head)
Says never again, again

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah) I don’t know what happened to my friends
(To my friends) Or where I been (Ah-ah-ah)
And I can’t tell you how this story ends
And I can’t pretend (Ah-ah-ah)

Blame anyone you like, ‘cause I can’t be held responsible
Blame it on the night, blame the alcohol
Blame anyone you like, ‘cause I can’t be held responsible

[Chorus]
Keep my eyes half open
As I sit I watch the screen
It teleports me

[Verse 1]
Who are these people standing in my room?
Who are these people standing in my room?
One day, I’ll have the keys
One hand on the wheel
How does it feel?

[Verse 2]
If you wanna lose the time
Do what you almost did
And it’s easy if it’s tight
Focused on your walls
But I love her all again
Noticed how it is
But you knew it from the start, uninterested
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh

[Verse 3]
I’m impressed you can recollect that much
You must be quick
Pulling the rest
Twisting and turning out from 

[?]
You made me famous, I’ll take them back

Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Keep my eyes half open
As I sit I watch the screen
It terrifies me

[Verse 4]
Twisting and turning 

[?]
You made me famous
I hit my hands
One day I’ll have the keys
One hand on the wheels
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it-

[Verse 1]
Crazy that the world is round
And we have our upside downs
And it's more than a miracle
That I even met you
Crazy how I went on dates
For you to say the words you say
And sometimes it's the little things that
That come to get you

[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel the distance
Baby, maybe you can save me
This is real love, real love
I can see the problem isn't
Hanging onto any piece of you love, you love

[Chorus]
Now don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life and never, ever let go now
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life but never, ever let go now
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Save me when I rip the cord
And hang on so I don't get bored
And pull me when I kiss the ground
It's so nice to know you
Go 'head, you can chase the light
Kick back when it gets too bright
'Cause my world is another world
I'd, I'd like to show you

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see the problem isn't
Hanging onto any piece of you love, you love

[Chorus]
Now don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life and never, ever let go now
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life but never, ever let go now
No, no

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see the problem isn't
Hanging onto any piece of you love, you love

[Chorus]
Now don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life and never, ever let go now
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life but never, ever let go now
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me

[Intro]
(Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
Live from the battlefield
(Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew) (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Comes Superweirdo
(Yuh, yuh, yuh) (Woo)

[Verse]
Okay
My name Mac Miller, who the fuck are you? (Who the fuck are you?)
Paranoid motherfucker, I don't even trust the truth (Whoa)
This ain't the motherfuckin' Huxstables
So if my mother doin' nothin', I'ma cut her loose (Get her outta here)
I waste no time, criminal since '09
Posted on the coast line, smokin' on that (Oh my)
Everybody say I do it so (Well, well, well, well)
Young anomaly, destroyin' your Metropolis
Stand aside, I turn Rodeo Drive into the Gaza Strip (Woo)
It's the raw shit, drunk off confidence
I don't got a dealer, got an anesthesiologist (Wow)
Bitch, my shit is Artemis Fowl (Okay)
I'm standin' on the edge, they try calmin' me down
(Come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man)
They talk fast, but they listen slow (Listen slow)
There ain't a better coach around than Dick LeBeau (Whoa, whoa)

[Outro]
Uh, yeah, yeah
Oh my

[Verse 1]
From the sunburned plains of far-off North Australia
Came a fella born to ride the wide, brown land
Oh, he grew up runnin' wild
But soon, by all, was styled
As the country's greatest-ever drovin' man

[Verse 2]
Oh, his legend rode the winds from Broome to Darwin
They loved and loathed him right from end to end
For when the drover gave his heart
To a girl whose skin was dark
From that day on, he was no white man's friend

[Chorus]
So goes The Drover's story, you'll hear it near and far
And in the end, it's all he'll ever own
It says, "The outcast is a free man
If he sleeps under the stars
Makes the blanket of the southern skies his home"

[Verse 3]
Then they called him up to fight for Mother England
In a far-off war that spilled his brothers' blood
Inside the jaws of Hell
Where both his brothers fell
He just watched his faith in man die in the mud

[Verse 4]
There was no hero's welcome for The Drover
Just a country that had turned its back on him
When he came home from the war
His sick wife, they were not pure
They let her die for the colour of her skin

[Chorus]
So goes The Drover's story, you'll hear it near and far
And in the end, it's all he'll ever own
It says, "The outcast is a free man
If he sleeps under the stars
Makes the blanket of the southern skies his home"

[Verse 5]
The Drover is a man of constant shadows
Haunted by his pain, his past, and name
For every mile he rides
What he cannot hide
Is the longing in his heart to love again

[Chorus]
So goes The Drover's story, you'll hear it near and far
And in the end, it's all he'll ever own
It says, "The outcast is a free man
If he sleeps under the stars
Makes the blanket of the southern skies his home"

[Outro]
Makes the blanket of the southern skies his home
His home

[Verse 1]
Why's it never light on my lawn?
Why does it rain and never say, "Good day" to the newborn?
On the big screen, they showed us a sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one

[Chorus]
And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

[Verse 2]
I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn
If anyone can cry, then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye

[Chorus]
And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see, yeah, what's real
Tell me, grey seal

[Verse 3]
Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was reborn before all life could die
The phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the phoenix bird can fly, then so can I

[Chorus]
And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see, yeah, what's real
Tell me, grey seal

[Outro]
Tell me, grey seal
How does it feel?
Tell me, grey seal
How does it feel?
Tell me, grey seal
How does it feel?
Yeah, yeah, grey seal

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
You know I've been searchin' for someone
I've been lookin', hah, for the perfect one
Who could share that special love with me
Mrs. Perfect
And your eyes have that glow
She had that glow though
Could it be?
Could it be your face I see on my computer screen
J. White, I need a beat, I can go off on, ooh
Uh, yeah
Go

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I was in the jail thinking 'bout my problems
Like all the niggas, when I get out, I'ma rob 'em (Hah)
Shit was hard, up and down, it was '09 (Nine)
Lookin' through this magazine, she was so fine
Pretty brown, black bitch, what a draft pick
Hot yellow thick chick with an accent (Yellow)
I told her, "I ain't ever seen another cuter" (No)
Good brain, she don't even need a tutor (Wow)
Fuck a shooter, I'll shoot a nigga's shooter (Bah bah)
Long money, I don't even need a ruler (Wow)
A big dawg, I ain't ever been a poodle (Grr)
So much ice on my bitch, she need a cooler (Burr, burr)
And I disturb the peace like Luda' (Like Luda')
Been droppin' low like you be doin' on that computer
You want a long distance love, I want computer love (Hah)
So drop it low and back it back like a computer does (Wow)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Gucci Mane]
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop (Yeah, hey)
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop (Yeah)
Ooh, when we both logged on, I didn't wanna turn off
That's that computer love (Guwop)

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber & Gucci Mane]
Hit you up on the laptop (Laptop)
I told you meet me at the last spot
You went with me, fell in love
Didn't take long for you to gain my trust, no
With all that I've been through, you make it simple
I never thought I would meet an angel
Until I met you, until I met you (Go)

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I'ma put you on the rocks (Bling)
Nobody fuckin' with the Wops (Burr)
Baby give me all that she got
Share it with me, we gon' throw it all in the pot (Hah, hah)
This the type of love more than physical (Hah)
When a king get a queen, he invincible (Hah)
Fought the system every level, it was critical (Ha)
Fuck the feds, state, civil, and municipals (Fuck 'em)
Even then, through computers I was kissin' you (Mwah)
Remember through the computer, I would visit you (Me)
Daydreamin' 'bout us fuckin' in your living room (Huh)
Doin' push ups 'cause I know you 'bout to visit soon (Grr)
I'm from the 6, I grew up in the worst trap (Zone)
I'm way too rich, bae, to fall for a thirst trap (Huh?)
Plus I know the grass ain't greener on the other side (No)
'Cause my house so big, I rarely see the other side (Wow)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Gucci Mane]
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop (Yeah, hey)
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop (Yeah)
Ooh, when we both logged on, I didn't wanna turn off
That's that computer love (Yeah)

[Outro]
(Computer love, computer love
Computer love, computer love
Computerized, digital love
Computerized
A beautiful love)

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there’s no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you’re not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
And now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
Someone you loved
Someone you loved

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
Someone you loved, yeah-yeah
Someone you loved
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Chorus: Laura Les]
I make my money on my own, yeah
Wakin' up five in the morning, yeah
Throwin' money in the oven, yeah
Fuck sleep and his cousin, yeah

I spend my money like it's stolen, yeah
Shit, I'm already broke and it's only 7:45 in the morning, yeah

Goddamn, what the fuck?
Feel like I'm not good enough
Get off of me, I swear I'll do it all
Do it all, do it all
I can swear I can do it all
Do it all, do it all
I can swear I can do it all

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
I'm done trying, new plan
Do what I want, don't hold my hand
I can do anything I want, first try
You take like ten tries, hurtin' my eyes
(Oh my god)

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
Batshit, got a check and I spent it
Money got me feelin' like a dentist
I can do anything I put my mind to
You can't do anything even if you wanted to (Yeah)

[Chorus: Laura Les]
I make my money on my own, yeah
Wakin' up five in the morning, yeah
Throwin' money in the oven, yeah
Fuck sleep and his cousin, yeah
I've been on a roll, yeah
I spend my money like it's stolen, yeah
Shit, I'm already broke and it's only 7:45 in the morning, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Goddamn, what the fuck?
Feel like I'm not good enough
Get off of me, I swear I'll do it all
Do it all, do it all
I can swear I can do it all
Do it all, do it all
I can swear I can do it all

[Intro: Laura Les]
He said, "I love you," on the plane, I said, "I love you too"
He said, "Everything is different now, everything has changed
Always on a plane, always something new"
I said, "Nothing's new, nothing’s changed, I still need you"
I'm 'bout to hit the boof
Smokin’ somethin' new

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
Ro-ro-roll the boof, then I smoke, then it's all gone
Hit that G so hard that I fall off
Taking shots in the dark, that's a bad call
Going straight for your head, got a sawed-off
(Go, go, go, go, go) I got a bag on the way
(Go, go, go, go, go) Smokin' a zip in a day
(Go, go, go, go, go) What were you trying to say?
(Go, go, go, go, go) Making it up on the way

[Bridge: Laura Les]
I never say what I need, when I need you
Never say what I need, when I need you
I'm good on the weed but I need you
I might hit the weed, I might hit the boof

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
I'm addicted to Monster, money, and weed, yeah
I'm blowin’ clouds so loud, you can’t fuckin' see, yeah
I’m addicted to everything that I see, yeah
I'm addicted to making money off me, yeah
I might go and throw my phone into the lake, yeah
It ain't hard to quit caring what you think, yeah
Burnt me one too many times like a tree, yeah
Now there's fire raining down on your screams, yeah

[Breakdown: Laura Les, Dylan Brady]
Ohhhh
Yeah
(AAAAAAAA)
I hit the big boof then it’s all gone
(AAAAAAAA)
I hit the big boof then it's gone
(AAAAAAAA)
I hit the big boof and the weed, yeah
(AAAAAAAA)
I hit the big boof then it's gone
Just shut the fuck up, where's the weed at?
Just shut the fuck up, where's the weed?
Just please fuck me up, where's the weed at?
Just shut the fuck up

[Intro]
Pick it up!

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
Bet my money on a stupid horse, I lost that
So I ran out to the track to get my cash back
I just gotta leave this place with a big bag
So I found the fuckin' jockey and I grabbed that (Pick it up!)
Pushed him down to the ground and I punched him in his face (In his face!)
Yeah, I stole his phone, that put him in his place (In his place!)
Me and the horse, we ran out of the place (Out the place!)
Then we drove my Porsche back to my place

[Chorus: Laura Les]
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account

[Interlude: Laura Les, Dylan Brady]
Woo!
Pick it up!

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
Stupid horse and a swordfish dancer (Pick it up)
Spending my money on a fishnet carousel
Go, go, go, go, go so fast now
Go, go, go, go, go so fast now
Racing horses at the derby
Why am I never getting lucky?
I never have any money
I never win any money

[Chorus: Laura Les]
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche (Oh shit)
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no (Oh no)
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche (Of the Porsche)
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no (Oh no)
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche (Of the Porsche)
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no (Oh no)
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche (Of the Porsche)
Lost the money in my bank account

Giving my heart for you to take
We could go and drive and leave this place
Getting my strength from your embrace
Baby, let's go all the way
Giving my heart for you to take
We could go and drive and leave this place
Getting my strength from your embrace
Baby, let's go all the way

[Chorus: Laura Les]

My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone

My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
27 missed calls lightin' up my cell phone
Sending you a text sayin', "Call you when I get home"
Taking off my work clothes, workin' in a cold one
45 group texts, 50 group DMs
Send another text askin' me if I've seen them
Pushin' back a deadline, gotta make my bedtime
Then I crack a smile, 'cause I love you and I'd do it all again

[Chorus: Laura Les]
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know

[Bridge: Laura Les]
Something's gotta work this time
It's my way of trying to let you know
I've got a little thing for you
I've got a little crush or somethin'
Maybe I'm just drunk as fuck
I customize my ringtone
But it's always you
It's always you
It's always you
It's always you
It's always you

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
It was always you
Put it on vibrate when I'm with you (With you)
Talkin' to myself again (Again)
Falling on broken glass
29 missed calls, never leave the basement
I don't wanna tell you what I'm really thinking (What I'm thinking)
Thinking, what I'm really thinking
Thinking, what I'm really thinking

[Bridge: Dylan Brady]
Used to love that ringtone when you called me
Now it makes me sick
Used to love that ringtone when you called me
Now it makes me sick (Sick, sick)

[Chorus: Laura Les]
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know

Stronger than you
You can call on me
Anytime

But please remember

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
I was tryin' to find a way to kill time
I didn't even get to tell you goodbye
I was tryin' to find a way to kill time
Now you're gone and I can't ever say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus: Dylan Brady]
This feeling's going to my head, I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room, I couldn't go another day
This feeling's going to my head, I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room, I couldn't go, go, go, go

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Oh my god, what the fuck? Take my hand, crush it up
Spill the blood on the floor, I ain't scared, think there's more
What the fuck? Make it stop, took too long, here right now
On the floor, in the car, smoking cigs in the bar
I don't want you to think I got bad intentions
Never wanted you inside, you made it your mission, yeah
Didn't wanna hurt no one
But you just went and made it fun, fun, fun, fun

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
I hear you're lookin' for a way to fight the Corpus bride
She's workin' in my mind
And you're lookin' for a way to crush, it's not enough
You fucked up your last try (Last try)
We were in the studio, I was just playin'
You were all work and I was all play and
You were talkin' business, aiming with your weapon
I was on your hit list, I felt the compression

[Outro: Laura Les]
I'll never go, I'll haunt your studio
You won't think of words when you write it up
You'll just hear me singing this song
You'll think that's okay, you'll just sing along
You just copy everything we do
If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too
You just copy everything we do
If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too

[Intro: Dylan Brady]
I look outside and see your bright eyes
I don't know if I can get to you
Don't know if I'll be back (If I'll be back)
I don't know how to be alone
I'm always looking at the phone
(Ooh) Waiting for your call
(Okay, alright, okay, alright, I see)

[Chorus: Laura Les]
I can see it right now
You're sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"

[Post-Chorus: Dylan Brady]
I needed this more than you will ever know
I needed this more than you will ever know

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
Dishes are piling up
But that's cool
'Cause at least we got food
Yeah, everything is pilin' up
But that's cool, that's cool
'Cause at least I got you, I got you, I got you
Tell me that you don't want to bug me
I'll tell you, "Baby, bein' here is nothing"
Call me anytime you're feelin' lonely
(Okay, alright, okay, alright, I see)
And I'm running home to be with you

[Chorus: Laura Les]
I can see it right now
You're sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
Dishes all accounted for
Got about a counter full
Yeah, I'm always out of bounds
Yeah, I'm not responsible
But I'm always counted for
Fuckin' up but riding home
Corner store to studio
To work and then I'm back to you

[Chorus: Laura Les]
Now
You're sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"

[Verse 1]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?

[Verse 2]
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

[Bridge]
They're playing our sound
Laying us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Crying us back to life
But you're cold as a knife

[Chorus]
Six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Bloom
Bloom
Again

[Outro]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you

[Verse 1]
I wanna be alone
Alone with you - does that make sense?
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest

[Verse 2]
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right so stay a sec

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
You're all I wanted
Just let me hold you

Like a hostage

[Verse 3]
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak

[Verse 4]
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
And nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
You're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Hold you

Like a hostage

[Chorus]
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Well, what a shame, I'm not there

[Verse 1]
What is it you want?
You can lie, but I know that you're not fine
Every time you talk
It's all 'bout me, but you swear I'm not on your mind

[Chorus]
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows
You and I are suicide and stolen art (Art)
Pretty mama sews
Stitches into all your bitches broken hearts

[Chorus]
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

[Bridge]
Somebody new
Is gonna comfort you like you want me to
Somebody new
Is gonna comfort me like you never do

[Outro]
Every now and then, it hits me
That I'm the one that got away
But I guess being lonely fits me
And you were made for begging, "stay"
Goodbye England's Rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you'll ever know

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
I don't know what I did to turn your eye
Is your claim to fame what you’re putting down
After the first love, it was me or his black book
He's the boy for me

Does he share with me an oldfashioned love
Holding hands and cooing under the stars above
He asked me to wait
I've got to debate

He’s the boy for me

I don't have no reason to believe you
You told me those same lies before
But I know that it's assured when I
When I see you standing at my front door
I will love you Baby

You're super-sensitive
So unreasonably so
Who broke your heart my love
Is what I'd like to know
It's not about the money
What I want is the honey

He's the Boy for me

I don't have no reason to believe you
You told me those same lies before
At last change your story Baby

But I know that it’s assured when I
When I see you standing at my front door

You’re super-sensitive
So unreasonably so
Who broke your heart my love
Is what I'd like to know
It’s not about the money
What I want is the honey

Sweet Baby, you're the Boy for me
He's the Boy for me

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, um, okay
Uh, I'm steppin’ out the flux capacitor
Go to Africa, then come back wearin' jackal fur (Whoa)
This ain't a rap song, it’s a massacre
Only sacrificin' those who know to say the magic words
Stop, somebody get that man a pacifier
Y'all ain't shit but the appetizer (No)
I'm at a diner with a bad vagina, sippin' on some red wine
When I die, told her snort my ashes, that's a dead line
I'm doin’ just fine, control the suicidal thoughts
And when I’m runnin' out of time, then I’ma buy the clock (Lemme get that, boy)
Life's meaning tends to tie the open mind in knots
If it's all a game, I'm at the final boss (Bow)
You won’t stop us with a diamond cross
This type of demon crucifies the fake who try to floss
And if the rain is just the cryin' gods, then Utopia's behind the fog

[Verse 2: Delusional Thomas]
See, my eyes wide shut, I'm layin' down in a field of roses
When sanity is at a distance, then we feel the closest
Society is all a joke
Turn the television on and see tomorrow's hoax

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
You'll fit the picture with a doctored pose (Pose)
Just be like everybody else and never walk alone (Walk alone)
I'm on the phone with the devil, speakin' monotone (Uh)
Gettin' bored with all these threats that he throwin' at me

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Delusional Thomas]
Why are we so unhappy? Yeah
Why are we so unhappy? Yeah
Why are we so unhappy? Yeah
Yeah, why are we so unhappy?

[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
Okay, okay
So can you tell the captain that his boat about to sink
And Mr. Drummond's wife is somewhere smokin' meth on the ship deck?
We livin' in a shipwreck, we nothin' but some insects
Obsessed with sex in this business givin' big checks (Ching)
Been ready to die until I realized I haven't lived yet
I haven't made an indent to the Lord we try to impress (Praise God)
I just wish that I was fearless, bikin' down the mountain
Start to tremble as the gears switch (Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit)
So hear this, hear this, come bathe in my appearance (Ya)
When life give you a car, learn to steer it before you crash
There's more than cash and there's more than ass (Ass)
'Cause all those pleasures turn to torture fast (Fast)
And you can try to fight it but you never win (No)
They assemblin' the evidence to keep you from the truth and the lies (Lies)
We fall into the glamour like a cancer
The answer is there ain't a answer, bitch

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Why are we so unhappy? Yeah
Why are we so unhappy? Yeah
Why are we so unhappy? Yeah
Why are we so unhappy?

Do you love me? You, yes you over there
Everybody asks me who I am
I'm nobody, I'm only a man

So I say "run motorcycle run"
Run motorcycle run

You don't know what you do, do ya?
I am on fire for you
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down

I can dance if I want to
Yeah, it's true I want you
But don't say you don't want no harm
If you can't understand
'Cause I won't be here long enough for you to be my man

It's not a very nice ending, but that's what you get, just kidding

[Intro]
I recently went to a big homecomin' celebration
In Cleveland County Arkansas where I was born
Whole family went down and there was a great day for us
I felt like this day was special especially for my mother and my daddy
Though it was daddy's and mama's homecomin'
And I was so proud of 'em ridin' that carriage
Down the Main Street of Rison Arkansas
Sometimes the songs I write sound like talkin' about myself
But actually in some of these songs
Especially this one I'm writin' about my daddy

[Chorus]
Ridin' on the Cotton Belt Cleveland County's where I long to be
I got onto Brinkley and every mile I make is a memory
This boxcar's cold and windy and the dust goes around in circles in the air
But my hard times are behind me and I'm returnin' home so I don't care
And I'm ridin' on the Cotton Belt railroad line
In the pitchin' rolling rhythm and the noise
Railroad men are friends of mine and I'm ridin' on the Cotton Belt boys

[Verse 1]
Ridin' on the Cotton Belt across that little river called Saline
That's where I went fishin' and I hunted in her bottoms as a teen
Now just ahead's a farmhouse and in the kitchen window there's a light
And I've just got fourteen dollars but I'm taking it myself home tonight

[Chorus]
And I'm ridin' on the Cotton Belt Cleveland County's where I long to be
I got onto Brinkley and every mile I make is a memory
This boxcar's cold and windy and the dust goes around in circles in the air
But my hard times are behind me and I'm returnin' home so I don't care
And I'm ridin' on the Cotton Belt railroad line
In the pitchin' rolling rhythm and the noise
Railroad men are friends of mine and I'm ridin' on the Cotton Belt boys

[Verse 2]
Jumpin' off the Cotton Belt ain't easy when she's going forty per
But I see my wife standin' there hoping that I'm coming home to her
I got a few new cuts and bruises but this old working hobo's made a home
So long to your Cotton Belt thank you for the ride keep rolling on

[Chorus]
I'm ridin' on the Cotton Belt Cleveland County's where I long to be
I got onto Brinkley and every mile I make is a memory
This boxcar's cold and windy and the dust goes around in circles in the air
But my hard times are behind me and I'm returnin' home so I don't care
And I'm ridin' on the Cotton Belt railroad line
In the pitchin' rolling rhythm and the noise
Railroad men are friends of mine and I'm ridin' on the Cotton Belt boys

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Spending all your time with your new friends
And you take 'em all the places now that we been
But you used to be the one I love
Yeah, you used to be the one I love
Say you wanna talk, how-have-you-beens
I'm the only one you know that'll listen
And you used to be the one I love
Yeah, you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
Lately I don't even know ya
Too many devils on your shoulder, shoulder
Oh my God
Baby, if it's what you want
I just wanna see you happy
I can see it in your eyes
And you don't believe me
I don't lie
Even though you're not mine

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Cold feet turned into cold weather
We had love, now it don't matter
You just thought you could do better
So do better

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Spending all your time with your new friends
And you take 'em all the places now that we been
But you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)
Yeah, you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)
Say you wanna talk, how-have-you-beens
I'm the only one you know that'll listen
And you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)
Yeah, you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Woke up late and I'm dreamin' (Yeah)
So tired of chasing all your demons (Demons)
Oh my God
Baby, if it's what you want (If it's what you)
Little late if you ask me
But you know I'll come around if you ask me, ask me
I don't lie
Even though you're not mine, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Cold feet turned into cold weather
We had love, now it don't matter
You just thought you could do better
So do better

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Spending all your time with your new friends
And you take 'em all the places now that we been
But you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)
Yeah, you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)
Say you wanna talk, how-have-you-beens
I'm the only one you know that'll listen
And you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)
Yeah, you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)

[Outro: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
You used to be the one
Yeah, you used to be the one
Yeah, you used to be the one
Used to be the one
Used to be the one I
Lyrics from Snippet

...If I tell on anybody, pray to God I die the same day
I shot his body then I pray to God the same day
I caught a bag and bought the bitch a car the same day
My heart lover, but see that ain't what my pain say
You had my heart in your pocket like a device, girl
You didn’t tell me shit was good, I can't deny it girl
But you didn't never know lil’ shawty wouldn't bite
You didn't tell me this was clear, it would be right
You ever had the chance to figure out your life, baby, yeah
Came a long way from a Metro
Now it's Comme des Garçons, bosses on my leg, woah
I'll pin a bitch up, on the bed board, okay
All my life I ran from the cops
I live in and out a hotbox
I never had to go to the block
My daddy had 

[?]
My whole life I ain't see a wrong, I ain't see a Glock
Just a bad ass nigga, 

[?] and never ever thought to stop
Dot my I's and cross my T’s
Let my show sell out at night
’Cause I got haters and opps, so I don't be posting flyers
I know hatred ain’t that nice
Know a couple fraud bitches, marry niggas overnight
Put a bitch on 'em, divorce him, then get half of his life
Bitches plottin' on an abortion, trying to fuck you every night
Keep that pussy good as squeegee, and it's juicy, and it’s tight
Just an insecure bitch, ain't got insurance on your life
Yeah you right, niggas dogs, but a dog, hoe will bite (Rarr, rare)
I'm the capo, I bossed up my whole life
We can't be like none of you niggas, we some tourists
Bitch will fuck your rich friend for insurance
And I rock cash mill rich nigga shit, I eat calamari
I don't need no pen, I've been black carded
Got a sleeve on my shin, and I'm with a barbie
She got Benz on Benz, and my baby bought that
She said, hood...

[Snippet]
May my eyes always stay level to the horizon
May they never gaze as high as heaven to ask why
May I never go wear angels fear to tread
So as to have to ask for answers in the sky

[Verse 1]
Can you hear me? S.O.S
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clean again, I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Verse 2]
I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go, but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need you now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

My Iphone bout' to blow though
They looking for that coco
They know I got that coco
I'm never a no-show
I'm never with po-po
And it's always on the low-low
And it's always for the low-low
I look out for the poor folks
I'm sipped out I'm a slow 

[?]
I'm swagged out for the gold rope
I pull the cash out scream "yolo"
Till I get a sore throat nigga whoa whoa
I tell my hoe no before my woe woe
Fuck her till she scream "No more go slow"
I like when bitches scream "Go go go though"
And ride me lika a 

[?] Volvo
I got keys in this 

[?] Volvo
And I'm keeping a low pro fo' sure
I done made it to the money and it feel like Christmas

[Bridge 2]

Stop talkin' when you cuddle
Hoe this ain't no love boat
Smoking like a tug boat
I get in the 

[?] and I go for the gun store
I go for the gun store
I don't fuck with young hoes
My bitch swallow cum though and even blow a bubble
I just be like encore
This shit is a blood sport
We shoot you in your muscles
And leave you like a puzzle
AK-47 and the nina has a couple
Numbers don't lie I shoot you a hundred times
Long hair don't care
Bitch it's Weezy not Rapunzel
I'm on these trees bitch swinging in the jungle
And I was born there like Tarzan
I was dealt the hard hand
But now they call me Starzan
And I just pop the bar exam
Penitentiary flow my bars hard
Too hard for a cell mate
So all these other fucking rappers to me ain't nothing but a jail bait
Too much coke make the skill shake
Too much coke make the skill shake
It's Lil Tune aka Jim
That's what they call you when you sell weight
The feds watching with a stale face
The hoes watching with the Yeah face
We fuck all night make up on the pillow
Wake up in the morning see a real face
Ben Franklin with the blue face
Lil Wayne tattoo face
Bad bitch with a cute face
I fuck her and her room mate
The work just came today
I break the birds down to 

[?]
Then she let me hotter than a 

[?] I love you baby

[Bridge 3]
And trapping on the low low
Just me and my woe no
I don't do no porno

Snapping like a photo
Trapping in my Polo

[Intro]
I can be your dream girl
I can be your dream girl

[Verse 1]
When you wake up to the day
And see the city, dark and gray
You can already see the curtain coming down
Sittin', open up your files
Right click JARs to see her smile
Transfer to your heart, and let the world go ’round
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

[Chorus]
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
When it all gets too much
Darlin', I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby

[Verse 2]
​iPhone ringing, boss is screaming
On the TV, news streaming
It means nothing to you though, you tune it out
Close your eyes and change the station
Switch the pictures on your wavelength
Put me on your playlist, I’m your favorite song
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

[Chorus]
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
When it all gets too much
Darlin', I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby

[Bridge]
Candlelight burns twice as bright, baby burns half as long
So keep your fire burning, so you always love me strong
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Woah-woah
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Woah, baby
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Woah-woah
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Woah, baby

[Verse 3]
Now it's night time, driving uptown
City's sparkling, but you shut down
So you signal right and turn your engine off
Cars fly by you, stars beside you
Turn that radio inside you
Tune the station that's playing the one you love
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

[Chorus]
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
I can be your dream girl
When it all gets too much
Darlin', I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby
I can be your dream girl, baby

[Verse 1]
My baby likes me fresh in my white kicks
I'm sweet like cherry pie, and he likes this
I buy him drinks and he buys me cigarettes
He thinks that we're a little bit like Romeo and Juliet
Throw me 'round like a hot potato, if he want the butter, then say so
It's wrong, but well, it's okay though
It's okay though

[Chorus]
Baby ghetto love
Mama knows I like the bad boys
Baby ghetto love
Just like daddy was a bad boy
Ooh, ahh
Take me out tonight, baby save my life
Ooh, ooh
Take me out tonight, baby save my life
True love, true love, true love
It never dies, it never dies, it never dies
True love, true love, true love
It never dies, it never dies

[Verse 2]
My baby likes me fresh in my white kicks
He thinks it's a little like hair, tits, lips, sips
It doesn't really matter that I do my lipstick all day long, all day long
My baby likes me fresh in my white kicks
Dear Bonnie and Clyde, it's just like this
He thinks a little like my polka dot dress on
He like my hair long

[Chorus]
Baby ghetto love
You know no one loves you better
Baby ghetto love
You can be oh be no better
Ooh, ooh
Take me out tonight, baby save my life
Ooh, ooh
Take me out tonight, baby save my life

[Bridge]
Save my life, save my life, save my life
Save my life, save my life, save my life
Save my life, save my life, save my life
'Cause true love never dies
It's what I want
When I see what's up high
True love never dies

[Chorus]
Baby ghetto love
Mama knows I like the bad boys
Baby ghetto love
Just like daddy was a bad boy
True love, true love, true love
It never dies, it never dies, it never dies
True love, true love, true love

Be nice
Be nice
Be nice
Be nice

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
I just wanna be happy
I don't wanna feel nasty
I'm tryna turn my vibration around so I can feel fantastic
I'm talking to myself in the mirror
I'm telling me to, telling me to cheer up
Everyone around got tears of a clown
And it's so cold like Siberia

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am]
But I do not want negative energy
If you get what you give, give me positivity (Give it to me, hey)

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Be different, be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life (Hey)
Be different, be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life

The love you give is the love you get
So be nice and change your life

[Interlude: will.i.am]
Be nice

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
I got a new direction
I ain't got no time for stressin'
I don't wanna carry no bad vibration
I don't wanna be in depression
I just wanna be cool, live my life without the problems
Everybody tryna push me down to the ground
But I ain't living life in the bottom

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am]
'Cause I do not want negative energy
If you get what you give, give me positivity (Give it to me, hey)

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Be different, be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life (Hey)
Be different, be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
If we could all just find a way to fly away
To slip into a brighter day (Say what?)
One step, so deft, so right, go left
And do it to 'em right away
I'm talking to all of my leaders
We should just pow-wow, and all of us meet up
And fight for each other, not one another
And when we talk, be nice to each other
Be cordial, be glad, be happy, not sad
Stay in your bag
And all of my banger that bang with they flag
Whether Crip or Blood, be good to each other
Be hood to each other in the house-a, mi casa su casa
On and on, love that we givin' keeps rollin' on, rollin' on

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Hey, be different, be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life (Hey)
Be different, be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life (Hey)

[Outro: will.i.am]
Be nice (Hey)
Be nice

[Verse 1: (Sandy) Alex G]
One, two, three
I count black sheep on my way to sleep
I can’t pick and choose these devils in my
Patterned dreams
When I wake up I am smiling
Now I will not change my mind
I will remember the trouble in my
Brother’s eye

[Chorus: Emily Yacina]
It’s okay we don’t cry, we love the southern sky
It’s okay we don’t cry, we love the southern sky
It’s okay we don’t cry, we love the southern sky
It’s okay we don’t cry, we love the southern sky

[Verse 2: (Sandy) Alex G]
You and me
These are titles I can hardly speak
Are we bound here to an echo tinted
Blue and green?
Let my memory run backwards
So together we may lie
I will remember the fire
In the southern sky

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
I don't want pieces of beauty
I flare my eyes to the world
Watching the buckets of lovers
Coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming

And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming

That’s how she found me this morning
Bundled my head in her arms
Lifted my spoonful of sugar
Taking
And taking

Shit, I'm about to whip it on you like the Dazz Band (Band)

Bottles on the table, you could drink a fountain (Drink a fountain)

Got some out of town friends, bring them bitches down then
Say you was gon' tear it down for me, tear it down then (Tear it down)

If you make it clap for me, bitch, I'm pullin' out bands (Shut the fuck up)

[Verse 5: Juicy J]
Fuckin' to some Chris Brown, king of R&B (B)
She want me to climb up in it like a tree (Tree)
Is that ass real or fake? I'ma find out (Out)
She say she like it rough, I'ma pull her tracks out (Yank it)
I might blow it all, baby, tell me what's the total? (I got you)
Ain't nothin' out my range, I get brain in the Rover (Gangsta)
You knew she was a diamond, shoulda kept her in the vault
Uncut, no soda, she want me to hit it raw
Got the Bentley dealership, if she want it, she can have it
Gon' drive it, baby, #RichNiggaChallenge (Challenge)
Bust it wide open, baby, gon' bend it over (Over)

One giant leap for mankind

[Verse 1]
Can I? Wait, can I? Should I?
Rewind, just remind me that I'm down
Knocked down
And it's your year
I should have realized, realized, from the beginnin'
You right, you right with that, baby (Huh)
Yes, I know you better
Girl, nobody else matters

[Pre-Chorus]
If you stay away from me too long, I
I might swim for it
If you keep your love from me, girl, I might
I'ma just keep going
'Round and 'round in circles
Could you stop fuckin' with my head?
'Cause I see the color purple
Don't break my heart

[Chorus]
Don't wanna see
Red, red (Don't wanna see)
Red (Oh, no, no, no)
Don't wanna see, see
Red
Eyes turnin' blood red
I don't want this, bringin' out a part of me
(Don't wanna see)

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna go back and forth, back and forth
And you know it's a waste of time, baby
To get through to you, oh-whoa
You keep arguin' always 'bout the same thing
But you don't mean it, no, no
And I can't believe that you be so cold
You can't even keep a low pro'

[Pre-Chorus]
If you stay away from me too long, I (Stay away from me)
I might swim for it
If you keep your love from me, girl, I might
I'ma just keep going (Ooh)
'Round and 'round in circles
Could you stop fuckin' with my head? (Head)

Don't break my heart (Ooh)

[Intro: Chris Brown]
Next time, when you look at me (Oh)
Throw it back when you look at me (Oh yeah)
Next time, when you look at me (Oh whoa)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Is it on? Is it on 'til it's gone?
If they put me in the cuffs, if I'm locked behind the wall
If I never ever balled, if I ever lose it all
If my pockets gettin' small, would you treat me like they tall?
I gotta know, you make a wish, I check it off the list
Don't gotta ask for kiss, went and tell to your lips
Said that I ain't spendin' time, I put it on your wrist
So go and tell your ex a real nigga took his bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Word, for most men, these hoes a dream come true
But a dream girl is the girl that dreams of you
I got everything I need, all I want is you
That’s why a nigga still cuffin' when the season's through
Yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All I want is you
All that I want is you
All I want is you
All that I want is you
All I want is you

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Man, that pussy powerful, I fly you from Toronto
Come and live in L.A., we could see LeBron play (Swish)
And we sit, floor seat
Tom Ford on your feet
Diamonds like a wedding ring and your lashes on fleek (Yeah)
I'm a top dog, so I gotta get the top suite (Yeah, yeah)
Sweet, sweet, sugar cane, she gon' let me have a piece
Try to keep it lowkey, but they always want the tea (Yeah)
Babe, don't wake me up, she said it feel like a wet dream
Got you all iced out (Ice, ice)
Yeah, and your skin beautiful, what you need, a tenfold?
Turn the lights down (Lights out)
Yeah, I know you think I'm playin', no, that was just the same (Yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
All I want is you (Agh)
All that I want is you (Yeah)
All I want is you
All that I want is you
All I want is you
All that I want is you
All I want is you
All that I want is you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I pull your panties to the side, ease your mind
My pride aside, I'm tryna find the jewels hidden inside
Explore your mind, ain't one of these niggas just tryna hit it and slide
Started as a fling (Yeah), politicin' with a ting (Yeah)
Water locked up like a bing, but her finger got a ring
Chose a puppet on a string, but I woulda gave you wings
Backyard with the swing, cash money with the bling
Baby daddy from the 'burbs
He a bird, heard he lookin' for me, too
'Cause of you, I won't give him what he deserves
Plus you gave him your heart, don't break your word
And if life is tryna teach me a lesson, just know I've learned (I've learned), yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All I want is you
All that I want is you
All I want is you
All that I want is you (All I want is you)
All I want is you ('Cause all I want is you)
All that I want is you (You, want is you)
All I want is you (Ooh)
All that I want is you (I want it)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Next time, when you look at me (Oh)
Throw it back when you look at me (Oh yeah)
Next time, when you look at me (Oh whoa)
I'ma show you how it's goin' down
Since me and you met, it was goin' down
When you hop up in that bed, it was goin' down
This how me and you flex, now it's goin' down
You know how it's goin' down

[Verse 1]
I see the red sky
Beyond our state line
Over mama's minivan
Rushing to work on time
I see the red sky
You always ask me why
I find myself on corners
Every once in awhile

[Chorus]
You big old cow
You draw me out
Lie on the ground
Kiss on the mouth

[Verse 2]
I dream a deep sea
That it should swallow me
And pitch me up on some wave
Put me down tenderly
Yes, I believe I made out fine
And yes, it's true
I never loved nobody
The way that I love you

[Chorus]
You big old cow
You draw me out
Lie on the ground
Kiss on the mouth

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
You big old cow
You draw me out
Don't put me down
Don't put me down

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
I walked up in that bitch with five, tens, twenties, fifties, hunnids on me (Woo, woo)
I don't usually do this
I ain’t really with the stuntin', homie (Yeah)
But I gotta do it 'cause tonight, she 'bout to bust it on me
She gon' get to touchin' on me (Woo, woo)
I put all my money on it
'Cause you know you workin' with some ass, yeah, you bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, yeah, his last, yeah
You've been killin' it since last year
Since last summer, had these bitches gettin' mad, yeah (Hey)
Ain’t that somethin'?
I don't usually hit the shade club or drink much
But today I got my pay stubs, I'm laced up
Let me show you what the face does, a drink does
Saw you movin' from the waist up, I don't take drugs
Baby, what you call it? (Woo)
What you hidin' skeletons, all up in your closet? (Woo)
You exotic, open up, let me come inside it (Woo)
I'm invited, tell them bitches I'm a sexaholic (Woo)
I'm excited, perfect timin'
You look good, won't you throw it back on me?
You gon' make even a broke nigga put his last on it
You gon' make him spend the dough, he don't even have money
When you take off all your clothes, they gon' put they tax on it
But it's not enough

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
She said, "You gon' have to give me more than one dollar
You gon' have to give me more than five dollars
You gon' have to give me more than ten dollars
You gon' have to throw more than twenty dollars”
Said, "You gon' have to give me more than fifty dollars
Yeah, you gon' have to throw more than a hunnid dollars
Yeah, you gon' have to empty out your fuckin' wallet
Yeah, you gon' have to empty out your fuckin' pocket"

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
After you back it up, then stop
Wobbity, wobbity, drop, drop and make it hop
I'm in Versace, Armani, Balenciaga to the socks
And I'm on the molly, I'm throwin' thousands like rocks
Ooh, say less, my lil' babe blessed
She just bought a new booty, she on bed rest
She be twerkin' to Tunechi, for them paychecks
She tat' my name on her booty, her face next
I'm throwin' up the racks like some quarterbacks
Ooh, what a catch, that don't come with tax
Now you up in Saks with a bunch of bags
Shake that fuckin' ass for a budget plan
I throw a bunch of cash
I get so bored, I start throwin' money underhand
I need another hand
I got a blunt in hand, louder than a southern band
You gon' need a stack, bitch, do the money dance
Tunechi

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Lil Wayne]
She said, "You gon' have to give me more than one dollar (Mula)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
If I leave a paper trail, then I'ma need a tip drill
Shakin' it, turn the lights down
Bust it for the light bill
Diggin' it, then I'm lickin' all on that pussy, put it right there
Only wanna fuck the black bitches with the nice hair
Baby, bend it over, ass up, take the mask off
Don't ask me if I'm throwin' cash up, I'm spendin' that part
Black Card, play your part, now go retarded
That booty stupid, think you smart, I fuck regardless
Sprinkler fuckin' up your guard, that coochie water
I tear it up, she call me daddy, I'm not her father
Ask her where she from? She said, "New Orleans," it's a mic check
Don't try to kiss after you swallow, I don't like that (Huh)
But you look good when you throw it back on me
You gon' make even a broke nigga spend a bag on it
You gon' make me come alone like I don't even have homies
When you pull them titties out, put 'em in my mouth
Then I hit the dash on it

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown with Joyner Lucas]
She said, "You gon' have to give me more than one dollar
You gon' have to give me more than five dollars

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
Oh, I'ma throw a bag in the air
By the time it hit the ground, better bring that ass over here
Everything, all the drinks on me tonight
Put that thing on me, I'm tryna see what that pussy like
I'm just tryna pay a couple bills
When she hit the stage, I'ma leave more than a tip (Oh-oh)
Let me grab it, let me smack it, don't care if it’s real
Pullin' on my pants, I'ma let you feel it
Biggity bounce, biggity bounce, gon' toot it up
She breakin' it down, breakin' it down, I can't get enough
Spread 'em for me, showin' them cheeks
I'm actin' like a fiend, been here for a week
She give me the red light special
You can lie to me, baby, tell me that I'm special
Just keep steppin' on the money like they rose petals
I'm not a trick, just a rich nigga, know better

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
She said, "You gon' have to give me more than one dollar (Know better)
You gon' have to give me more than five dollars (Know better)

I'm the flame to your fire (Fire)
The quake causin' tidal waves (Tidal waves)

[Chorus]
Natural disaster
When we love, the world breaks (The world breaks)
When we love, the bed shakes (The bed shakes)
This world, it says (Huh)
Don't fall in love, it's a mistake (Oh)
But baby, don't be scared 'cause they afraid
And know nothing's gon' change but my feelings about you
'Cause love's stronger than it

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, my eyes wide open, so real now (Huh)
When we're in love, they make a big deal 'bout it (Huh)
You made a grave, I'll dig it out (Huh)
These words are never said
I came here to love you
Take me instead

[Chorus]
We always causin' natural disasters
I'm not gonna make you decide
Gonna take a leap of faith
Not gonna make you pick a side
I know it, oh-oh, you love me
I'm standin' here 'cause you chose me
I'm not gonna let them take your life
We get together, yeah, they know we gon' shine too bright
Two stars, supernova, at the same time
We don't care, we don't care, we exchange life

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, my eyes wide open, so real now (Huh)
When we're in love, they make a big deal 'bout it (Huh)
You made a grave, I'll dig it out (Huh)
These words are never said
I came here to love you
Take me instead

[Refrain]
We always causin' natural disasters

[Part II: Aura]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I think that we should listen to
All of the signs that this love provides
We know all is forgiven
Once you hear the truth from me and not the lies
I won't put my pain on you
Pain on me, this pain of you
Imagination
Vibrate with me 'cause I see what you're seein'
Know you see all of the colors
How 'bout you level me up?
In the bedroom
Come and get under the covers
So we can be one (Be one, huh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And when you feel me all around you say it
Rollin' all around 'til you can't take it
Ain't goin' nowhere, girl, just face it
You want the same thing, love
And now we got it (Now we got it, now we got it)

[Chorus]
Ooh
And now we got this aura (Huh)
I gotta get this off (Huh)
You know you all mine
You're all mine
And now we got this aura (Huh)
I gotta get this off

[Outro]
(Huh) You know you all mine
(Huh) You know you all mine

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, with Ink]
If I'm out at the bar havin' a night on the town
Life of the party, pourin' shots of the brown
And you see me from the street but I don't turn around
Would you say, "Hi"? Would you keep going?
If I told your family that you didn't mean nothing
If you posted about it and I didn't even comment
If the songs weren't true, but you still feel something
Would you still come looking for me?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink]
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
Your head and your heart won't feel the same
Even if it feels like it every time

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink]
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Might run across your mind but don't worry 'bout me, no
My heart is back in one piece, it ain't skipped a beat, no
Feeling rested up, I ain't missing sleep, no-oh
Don't take it personal if I can't reply now
I'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle, it comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh, I don't need your pity
Don't check on me

[Chorus: Justin Bieber, with Chris Brown & Ink, Ink]
Oh, don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown, with Ink]
Ain't call you back 'cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low, we were already gone
It wouldn't mean anymore to me now
I know it hurts you so bad just to see me happy
That I finally moved on, and you thought it wouldn't happen
At times I used to cry when the world was laughing
But I act like I didn't notice

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink, Ink]
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
You can't kill a flame with gasoline
Even if it feels like it every time
No matter how hard you try

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Ink & Justin Bieber]
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June

[Intro: Aaliyah]

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Aaliyah]
Rollin' on me, kissin' on me down low

Ha, take off your clothes
Make you feel good when you naked
Girl, your skin feels so smooth (Oh)
Put them titties on me
I won't be afraid
'Cause we grown enough (Grown enough)
We both in love (Both in love)
You know that pussy's for dada

I remember nights, I was cold and had no sleep
I was boostin' bikes, .22 under the fleece (Woo)
Mama said I had a gift, if I ever want to be something
But I do this shit so she won't ever need nothing
No more payments or laborin', I'm tryna move up
Rentin' you crazy apartments just to show my love
And appreciation, 'cause you only get one wifey and I'm thankful
And this life I lead is dangerous

Baby, take your skirt off
Pull your hair, double dare
Kiss on it just how you want it
Panties, throw 'em over here
God really broke the mold
Took his time with them breasteses and the waist line
Really with the shit, not a kid, this ain't play time
I don't fuck with FaceTime, I don't waste time
Just pop it to the bassline, I'ma take mine

[Chorus]
I know, but it's taken me all this time to say, ooh
I'm so sorry it's taken me all this time to say, ooh-wee
Tip toe
And I know that we all might make mistakes

You're sayin' I did this to you
Baby, I'm sick of this
Keep sayin' I ain't listenin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it all out, tell me how you feel about me
Get it all off your chest
I get it now, you said enough to hurt me
You regret every moment you're in my presence
Day by day, step by step

Don't you knock it 'til you try it
You know I won't hurt you, baby
Ooh, just let it loose
That's right

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it all out, tell me how you feel about me
Get it all off your chest
Scream it out loud, lay it all out for me
You regret every moment you're in my presence
Oh, day by day, step by step

Everything we put together
The perfect one I searched for right here
And baby, it don't get no better

[Pre-Chorus]
She get to lookin' like she been waiting for me
Contemplating, a thousand days of war
She waitin' for me to pay for it

Huh, if you grant me this wish, one wish, this wish, Lord, I promise
I'll never ask for anything else
'Cause I can't do it by myself
It's too hard
I can't play God, huh, that's your job
I'm just a simple man who needs his heart repaired
In purgatory, but not if she's there
I know I'm askin' for a lot but
Tryna break these chains I'm locked from
I'll no longer be scared
If you're really up there

[Chorus]
So beam me up and let me meet my maker

Dear God

[Verse 1]
Baby, I've been a good boy
But sometimes I can't keep it straight
Feels like I'm always waiting
For another chance to play the game

[Chorus]
Gotta roll the dice now
You gotta gimme a kiss for luck
I wanna be there with you somehow
But the SugarHouse calling my bluff

[Verse 2]
You never really met me
I don't think anyone has
But we could still be players together
Let SugarHouse pick up the tab

[Chorus]
I won't be forgotten
Let 'em bury me in the sand
When our children go digging for answers
I hope they can put me together again

[Verse 1]
He was a good friend of mine
He died
Why I write about it now?
Gotta honor him somehow
Saw some people crying that night
Yeah, Fentanyl took a few lives from our life
Alright

[Verse 2]
I awoke in the middle of the night
He spoke
With his eyes half closed
Can you get me something else to eat?
Got a hole in my chest
I can't take it anymore
Put my pillow to the test
Let me rest

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
In the house they were calling out his name
All night
Taking turns on the bed
Throwing bottles from the windows of the home
On Hope Street
You can write a check in my name now
Eddie take the money and run

[Intro]
All I want (Is to be near)
You, you, you, you

I'm a bad man, how about that? (So bad)
Going hungry on a pillar of fat (Of fat)
If I had a way, I would take it back (Take it back)
If you let me stay, I would be so glad (So)

What river runs deeper than this?
Stamping on cigarettes, opening fists
What river runs deeper than this?
Biting off fingernails, breaking our wrists
Breaking our wrists

Buried under black dirt, how about you?

Lying in the grass under tangerine sky
Tangerine sky

You will be a bird

Pull up the car outside the house
Took out the seats so we could lie down

[Refrain]
You know who was in my arms
You know who was in my arms

He laid his head back on my chest
Once had a wife, now nobody's left
You said the song makes you wanna do bad things, yeah

You know who was in my arms

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Yeezy season approachin'
Fuck whatever y'all been hearin'
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearin'
A monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shakin' like Parkinsons
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggas off than Cochran, huh

[Chorus]
On sight, on sight

[Bridge]
How much do I not give a fuck?

I lived with my dream gal

Your hair’s so thick
But you're so thin
I can see your bones through your skin
The airs so (?) I have to wring it out
My heart too tangled up to take it out
Babe

Happy in the sea
My body, it kind of flew apart
'Cos when the body slips nobody minds
Nobody keeps a hand on time
Bear up your spirit
The summer flower
It puts my faith in the higher power

[Intro]
I was sitting on them lil' toes
I was robbing on my street, just up the road

When he said "Taco Bell," he meant bag of weed

[Chorus]

Lyrics from a snippet

[Verse: 2 Chainz]
Shower water hit that black skin, your friend alive for you (Alive for you)
Air dry, let me suck that...

[Verse 1]
We weren’t meant to get out of Jersey
Two stops past the parkway and that old cemetery
We weren't born to grow in a hurry
But it rained hard in the garden state and we shot up like weeds
Walking out of the red brick house, yeah, I could hear it screaming
"Please don't leave"
If there is something
Hard for me to say
Of how minutes turn
Dragging my indifference
On a search for something new
Thinkin' my life over
On a sunday afternoon

Give me just a few more days too
I’m back out on a hunt for you
My my my
My my my lucky egg
My lucky egg
When I'm deep in danger
My head is filled with dread
Oh, I'll look for my lucky egg

If there is something
Hard for me to play
I bend a couple rules
Spent forty days over
My regard to my head
Spilled with grues
And how to ditch the soronial
When I’m stepped down to the pool
Give me just a few more days to
I'm back out on a hunt for you
My my my
My my my lucky egg
My lucky egg
When mistakes are high
But I'm just streaming in my bed
Oh, I'll look for my lucky egg
Oh, I'll search for my lucky egg
Oh, I'll turn to my lucky egg

[Flyin' High (In the Friendly Skies)]

[Verse]
Flyin' high in the friendly sky
Without ever leavin' the ground
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
Have laid their bodies down
I hear you, baby
I go the place where danger awaits me
Woo, it's the only, it's only fear I found
So stupid minded
I can't help it, baby
Oh, I go crazy when I can't find it, baby
I know I'm hooked my friend
To the boy and chump that made slaves out of men
Forever, always
Oh, that's alright

[Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)]

[Verse]
Oh, mercy mercy me
My song's about the ecology
When will we ever learn? Oh
Whoa, mercy mercy me
There are songs about you killing me
When will we ever learn?

[Bridge]
You see, you gotta search for the truth
You gotta search for the truth, baby
Search for the truth
Oh, it's what we got to do
Oh, mercy mercy me, Lord
Sometime I think the world is killing me
When will we ever learn, baby?
Heavenly Father, Jesus, oh Jesus, help us, Lord
Heavenly Father, please, help us, Lord
Oh mercy mercy me
And my song's about the ecology
That won't matter long as we never learn
Oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Thank you

The man everybody's been waiting for
It's a pleasure and a privilege for me to bring this gentleman on
The man who has created such tunes as "Inner City Blues"
"What's Going On"
"Let's Get It On"
"Keep Getting It On"
Five years this man has been absent
A man that has become a legend in his own time
Ladies and gentlemen, can I get a nice round of applause for
The fabulous, fantastic, marvelous Marvin Gaye

You recognize may recognize this theme from my Trouble Man album
It's one of my favorite themes so I'm gonna have Gene play some here, I thought it was very fitting
We're going to do a thing now that I hope you enjoy
Some people told me, "You know, when you're in love, and your lover leaves you, and you got nobody."
The lonely hours come over you
You sit and while they think, you say...

[Verse 1]
Distant lover, lover
(Lover, lover, lover), lover
Woo-hoo, so many miles away, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, oh, how I long for you every night, every night
And sometimes I dance through the day
Distant lover, woo-hoo
(Lover, lover) Lover (Lover)
You should think about me
Say a prayer for me
Please, oh please, baby, think about me sometimes
Think about me here, hey, in misery
Oh, say it, baby

[Bridge]
As I reminisce through our joyful summer together
The promises we made, baby
All the daily letters
Then all of a sudden, everything seems to explode (Pow)
Now I gaze out my window, sugar, down a lonesome road
Woo

[Verse 2]
Distant lover
(Lover, lover, lover) Ooh, ooh, sugar
How can you treat my heart so mean and cruel?
Didn't you know, sugar
That every moment that I spent with you
I treasured it like it was a precious jewel
Oh, baby, Lord have mercy

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I treasured it, baby, and you wanna leave, woo
Oh, baby, don't go (Wow)
Please come back, baby

[Outro]
Woo-ooh

When you left, you took all of me with you
Now all I want
Do you wanna hear me scream, please, please, oh please, baby
Come back home
Oh, baby,  oh, oh baby
Please, Lord, oh, ooh, come back home
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

[Intro]
Woo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo

Here's a new song I wrote, ladies and gentlemen
Song about a little girl
Really a beautiful, beautiful young girl
Thank you, darling
She asked me to write this, and I promised her I would
It goes like this

[Verse]
Janice is my girl
In all the world, there's no one sweeter
I will tell the world
I'll hold her tight and love her right deep down inside
'Til my body gives no more

[Bridge]
There's no world without my loving baby
Without Jan, ah hey hey hey
Life would be tragic for me without Jan

See, Janice is unique

[I'll Be Doggone]

[Verse]
I'll be doggone if I wouldn't work all day, ah baby
And I'll be doggone if I wouldn't bring you my pay
Oh no, baby, thank you
But if I caught you running around and
Blowing my money all over this town

[Chorus]
I, woo, be doggone
I'd be long, oh, long gone, baby
Wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long, oh, long gone
Let's move on up now
Alright, we're doing good now
This is it

[Try It Baby]

[Verse]
And now you're moving on up, pretty baby
You're leaving me behind
Everybody seems to love you
Girl, you're doing just fine, fine, fine

[Chorus]
But take away your good looks
And all, all your fancy clothes
Why don't you just
Try it, baby
Try it, baby
Try it, baby
Try it, darlin'

Nobody loves you but me, baby
Nobody loves you but me, darlin'

[Can I Get a Witness]

[Intro]
Woo, alright

[Verse]
Ah, listen everybody, especially you girls
Is it right to be left alone
While the one you love is never home?
I love too hard, my friends sometimes say
But I believe, I believe
A woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside
To see her treat me so unkind
Somebody, somewhere tell her it's unfair

[Chorus]
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
I want a witness
Can I get a witness?
I want a witness
I want a witness

[Outro]
You've given everything you had
Even tossin' in my sleep
Oh, let it go, Gene

I wanna talk to one young lady in the audience

[You're a Wonderful One]

[Verse]
You are so wonderful
Being near you is all that I...
Come here, baby, come here, baby, you
You show me more kindness in little ways
Than I've ever known, baby, I just wanna sing to her, my days
Tell me we'll stay together
Let me love you forever, I love you

You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one, oh

Got my mind made up to love you
Oh, yeah

Got my mind made up to love you
You, you

[How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)]

[Intro]
Oh darling, how sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh, yes it is, baby
In the back there

[Verse 1]
I needed the shelter of someone's arms, oh, there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And oh, there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I wanna stop, and thank you, baby
I wanna stop, and thank you, baby, woo

[Chorus]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh, I mean it, baby, oh yes, you're so sweet
Woo-hoo, baby

[Verse 2]
You were better to me than I've been to myself
For me, there's you, nobody else
I want to stop, I got to stop
Stop it, baby
Stop

[Interlude]
Oh, Lord have mercy
Wait a minute, ah, wait a minute
How sweet it is, woo, Lord have mercy
I've got to stop
How sweet it is, baby
I had to break the speed down right here where it's nice and groovy
I want the groove to lay right here
I want to talk to you, tell you how sweet it is, baby
Oh, it's so sweet, how sweet it is
Oh, it's so sweet, darlin', oh yes it is
Oh, it's so sweet
You know it's sweet
How sweet...
Wait a minute, I want everybody in the house to turn to the person sitting next to them and say 'how sweet it is'
That gentleman didn't like that, sir
How sweet it is, baby
Loving you every day
How sweet it is to be loved by you
You know, ladies and gentlemen, I got to take this time on this song to express to you my sincere thanks
I'm not leaving you
But this song, I have to tell you, I love you, you've been so good to me
I love you, how sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is
So sweet deep down inside my soul
Oh Lord, how sweet it is, woo, woo
Oh, how sweet it is loving you, baby
I think I've been gone a long time
I think I wanna tell you how sweet it is, baby
I wish I could come down there and talk to you, baby
I wish I could walk down and tell you how sweet it is
Oh, you're so good to me, how sweet it is loving you, baby
Oh Lord, yeah
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh, Gene, Gene, Gene, I'm ready to go on
Tell 'em 'bout it, Gene
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh, woo-hoo-ooh, woo-hoo
How sweet it is to be loved by you, and you, and you
How sweet it is

[Outro]
Thank you
Thank you very kindly, ladies and gentlemen

One more time for marvelous Marvin Gaye, ladies and gentlemen
So is this swearing or no swearing?” In a darkened soundstage on the outskirts of London, Abel Tesfaye is wondering if he can say “fuck” or not. Tesfaye, better known as breakout pop sensation the Weeknd, is at a rehearsal for Later...With Jools Holland, the BBC music show, about to soundcheck his smash hit “The Hills,” a four-minute horror-movie booty call featuring more than a dozen f-bombs. For Tesfaye, that’s relatively clean, but he knows the pensioners in Twickenham might disagree. So when the verdict comes back “no swearing,” he nods and smoothly pivots to a censored version — a small gesture that says a lot about the kind of professional he has become.

“The Hills” is currently enjoying its fourth straight week at Number One, a feat made even more impressive because it took the place of another Weeknd track, “Can’t Feel My Face” — Spotify’s official song of the summer, and the only song about cocaine ever to be lip-synced by Tom Cruise on network TV. Tesfaye is just the 12th artist in history to score back-to-back Number Ones, a group that includes Elvis Presley, the Beatles and Taylor Swift. His new album, Beauty Behind the Madness, has sold more than half a million copies in a couple of months, and he’s preparing to launch a national arena tour in November. “I’m still digesting it, to be honest with you,” Tesfaye says of his success. “But the screams keep getting louder, dude.”

This scene would not have seemed possible in 2011, when the Weeknd appeared with a trio of cult-favorite mixtapes that established both his sonic template — drug-drenched, indie-rock-sampling, sex-dungeon R&B — and his mysterious, brooding persona. A press-shy Ethiopian kid from Toronto who has given only a handful of interviews, he has cultivated a near-mythical image as a bed-hopping, pill-popping, chart-topping cipher. “We live in an era when everything is so excessive, I think it’s refreshing for everybody to be like, ‘Who the fuck is this guy?'” Tesfaye says. “I think that’s why my career is going to be so long: Because I haven’t given people everything.”


Spend just five minutes with him, though, and he reveals himself: sweet, soft-spoken, surprisingly earnest. When I tell him he’s not what I expected, he nods. “When people meet me, they say that I’m really kind — contrary to a lot of my music.”
When talking about his art and his career, Tesfaye is blessed with a towering self-confidence and has no hesitation about declaring his own greatness. “People tell me I’m changing the culture,” he says. “I already can’t turn on the radio. I think I’m gonna drop one more album, one more powerful body of work, then take a little break — go to Tokyo or Ethiopia or some shit.” Hearing him boast about talking shop with Bono, or name-dropping “Naomi Campbell, who’s a good friend of mine now,” you may be tempted to see a diva in the making; or you may see a 25-year-old guy who’s stoked and incredulous to be in the position he’s in.

After rehearsal, Tesfaye is in the greenroom with his two managers, 31-year-old Amir “Cash” Esmailian and 35-year-old Tony Sal. Cash is a first-generation Iranian-Canadian sweetheart who occasionally yells things into the phone like, “You may as well bend me over a table, bro!”; Sal is a courtly charmer who grew up in Beirut during the Lebanese civil war and now dates a former Miss USA. Right now, they’re trying to figure out how to get from Norway, where Tesfaye will be for promo in a few days, to Texas, where he has a show. According to their tour manager, the only commercial flight from Oslo to Austin is at 8 a.m.

“What about noncommercial?” asks Cash. The tour manager says he’ll check, but they’re talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Cash looks around and grins: “The label’s paying for it, right?”

I feel so much better today. I feel amazing right now.”

The next afternoon, Tesfaye is in a seventh-floor suite at his Soho hotel, having spent most of the previous 18 hours in bed. (There was also a B12 shot involved.) When a bellman brings in a silver tray with a selection of waters, Tesfaye pours himself a glass. “I just started being fancy, to be honest,” he says. “Like, I just started learning how to pronounce what I’m wearing.” He imitates a snooty shopgirl: “‘It’s not Bal-mane, it’s Bal-mahn.‘ ‘Oh, sorry!'”

When he first started recording as the Weeknd, Tesfaye was an unlikely star. “I was everything an R&B singer wasn’t,” he says. “I wasn’t in shape. I wasn’t a pretty boy. I was awkward as fuck. I didn’t like the way I looked in pictures — when I saw myself on a digital camera, I was like, ‘Eesh.‘” Instead of his face, his album art and videos featured black-and-white photos of artful nudes — a topless girl in a bathtub, a woman’s ass in a party dress. The aesthetic was American Apparel-style hipster catnip, right down to the Helvetica font.
Early Weeknd songs were atmospheric and chilly, their thick narcotic haze sliced by his broken-glass falsetto. The lyrics were an addiction counselor’s worst nightmare: pills, pain, shame, serotonin, danger. He and his crew posted three songs on YouTube and started spamming their friends on Facebook, then watched the play counts slowly climb. “I don’t know how many it actually was, but it felt like a million,” Tesfaye says. “Five hundred plays? Holy shit!” Toronto being a small town in some ways, the songs were heard by Drake’s manager, Oliver El-Khatib, who posted them to the OVO blog, where they promptly blew up. “Apparently, Drake wasn’t even fucking with it at first,” Tesfaye says today. “Oliver was the one vouching for me.”

The then-anonymous Tesfaye declined all interviews. In part, it was because he worried he wasn’t well-spoken enough: A high school dropout, he used to do crossword puzzles to improve his vocabulary, and to this day, he often wishes he were more articulate. “Me not finishing school — in my head, I still have this insecurity when I’m talking to someone educated,” he says. “I don’t want them looking at me like this fucking retard — no disrespect.” For months, no one even knew if the Weeknd was a person or a group. That’s when Tesfaye realized he “could run with the whole enigmatic thing,” he says now. “If it backfired, I probably would have been doing interviews. But people were kind of liking me being a fucking weirdo.”

The three free mixtapes that followed — House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence (all later repackaged and sold as Trilogy) — made him a darling of indie circles, and Tesfaye isn’t shy about praising them. “I probably could have toured off Trilogy for the rest of my life,” he says. “It definitely changed the culture. No one can do a trilogy again without thanking the Weeknd. A lot of artists started doing things faster and quicker after that: Justin Timberlake dropped two albums in a year, Beyoncé dropped a surprise album.” He’s equally proud of the music itself: “I’m not gonna say any names, but just listen to the radio. Every song is House of Balloons 2.0.”

Drake gave Tesfaye a big boost when he featured the Weeknd on his double-platinum 2011 album, Take Care. But for Tesfaye, being under the wing of his fellow Torontonian was a mixed blessing: A handful of songs he’d written for House of Balloons ended up on Take Care. As Tesfaye said in a 2013 interview, “I was hungry….I was like, ‘Dude, take anything.'” Today, he says he has nothing but gratitude for Drake, whom he calls “my closest friend in the industry at that time.” Still, he says, “I gave up almost half of my album. It’s hard. I will always be thankful — if it wasn’t for the light he shined on me, who knows where I’d be. And everything happens for a reason.” That said: “You never know what I would say if this success wasn’t in front of me now.”

It wasn’t long before the major labels came calling. But even then, few would have pegged Tesfaye for the global superstar he is now — least of all him. “Never in a million years,” he says. “At the time, I thought I’d be a punk star — grow my hair out, acne on my face, super-fucking-skinny. I was looking at artists like Iggy Pop and the Ramones, or Afropunk. But you evolve and realize your potential. And then it’s like, ‘Fuck yeah. Let’s go.'”

And now, a few words about the hair: The Weeknd’s hair is by far his most recognizable trait. There are Tumblrs and website listicles devoted to it; when I told the immigration agent at Heathrow what I was doing in the U.K., he said, “That’s the geezer with all the hair, innit?”
Tesfaye’s hair can be divided into roughly four sectors, each with its own distinct personality (front left: flopped-over moose antler; back left: tiny octopus). The overall effect is that of a rare double mullet: party in the front, party in the back. There’s not much to maintaining it, he says — just a hard shampoo every once in a while. But there are other annoying parts. “Sleeping. I wake up with neck pains sometimes. And not being able to hide myself.”
Tesfaye says the hair was partly inspired by Jean-Michel Basquiat. He began growing it out four years ago: “I want to be remembered as iconic and different,” he says. “So I was like, ‘Fuck it — I’m gonna let my hair just be what it wants.’ I’ll probably cut it if it starts interfering with my sight. I can kind of see it right now. But if I cut it, I’d look like everyone else. And that’s just so boring to me.”
Tesfaye’s hair also prompted one of his most WTF celebrity encounters. He was at a party for Sam Smith after this year’s Grammys, at an $80 million mansion in Bel-Air. Katy Perry and Ed Sheeran were there; Disclosure were DJ’ing. “Everyone was hammered,” Tesfaye says. “Sam had just won, like, every Grammy, so he was having the time of his life. Max Martin actually left because everyone was so drunk. Unfortunately, that was the one month I decided to stop drinking. Everybody was having a great time, all these cool things were happening, and I was shaking, like — ‘Fuck, I really want a drink.'”

That’s when he met Taylor Swift. “She actually schooled me on my own shit,” Tesfaye says. “She was like, ‘I’ve been listening to ‘The Morning’ 

[from House of Balloons] for years — it’s one of my favorite songs ever!’ I mean, she might have just Googled it. But she seemed genuine.”

Tesfaye says Swift went on for about 15 minutes. “But the whole time she was talking,” he says, “she was kind of, like, petting my hair? I think she was just drawn to it — she must have been a little gone off a few drinks. And of course I’m not going to be like, ‘Hey, can you stop?’ I mean, it felt good! But when she started petting my hair, that’s when I was like, ‘I definitely need a drink.'”
Anyone who’s heard the Weeknd sing or seen his stage moves knows the debt he owes to Michael Jackson. He often says it was Jackson’s music that made him want to be a singer, and the lyrics to “Dirty Diana” that made him want to write songs. But Jackson was even more important to his family than to most, because of their East African roots. “People forget — ‘We Are the World’ is for Ethiopia,” he says. “At home, if it wasn’t Ethiopian music, it was Michael. He was our icon.”

Tesfaye’s mother, Samra, emigrated from Ethiopia in the 1980s and settled with her mother in Scarborough, a drab neighborhood on the east side of Toronto. She juggled several jobs — nurse, catering, plus night school — and when she was home, she’d baby her only child. “I’m a mama’s boy,” Tesfaye admits. “Everything good, I get from my mother.” He was a quiet kid, and a little lonely sometimes. “I always wanted a brother so I’d have somebody to play with,” he says. “I remember lying to people that I had brothers — that’s how much I wanted one.”

Tesfaye’s mother and grandmother lived through Ethiopia’s so-called Red Terror, after Emperor Haile Selassie’s death, during which tens of thousands of civilians were killed by a military junta. But they never talked about it, and Tesfaye doesn’t know much of the history. “I actually wish Bono was here to school us both on it,” he jokes. “He knows more about Africa than any African I’ve ever met. I remember hearing some stories from my uncles — they would chew chat and talk. But I don’t think my mom wanted to tell those stories. I don’t think Ethiopians want their kids to feel like Ethiopia is a bad place.”

Because his mother worked so much, his grandmother took care of him a lot, taking him to services at their Ethiopian Orthodox church. (“It’s almost Islamic. There’s a lot of bowing.”) His first language was Amharic, not English, and he says his high-flying vocal style was influenced by habesha singers like Aster Aweke. He still loves Ethiopian food: “It’s the best, man. But it’s very fattening. I think I’m still burning off that fat, to be honest. For an Ethiopian mother, if you have a chubby kid, it means you’re doing something good.” Tesfaye recently bought his mother a “huge house” in Toronto. “I think me getting my diploma would make her much happier, though.”
Tesfaye doesn’t know much about his father beyond his name: Makkonen, also Tesfaye’s middle name. The elder Tesfaye took off when Abel was one or two: “I saw him vaguely when I was six, and then again when I was 11 or 12, and he had a new family and kids. I don’t even know where he lived — I’d see him for, like, a night. I’m sure he’s a great guy. I never judged him. He wasn’t abusive, he wasn’t an alcoholic, he wasn’t an asshole. He just wasn’t there.”

Tesfaye was an up-and-down student. Until eighth grade, he was in French-immersion class, which meant he had to speak French all day. (“It sucked. At recess, all the regular kids made fun of us — they called us ‘Frenchies.'”) His mother sent him to piano lessons for a while, but he preferred pop music. He grew up in a golden age of R&B when Aaliyah, Missy Elliott, Timbaland and the Neptunes were all over BET. “The late Nineties really formed my style — that sexy downtempo vibe,” he says. Later he got into rap — especially 50 Cent, whose debut came out when Tesfaye was 11 — and in middle school, he started smoking weed, so soon Hendrix and Led Zeppelin were in the mix. “I was the kid wearing the Pink Floyd shirt and listening to Ginuwine in my ear,” he says.

When he was 17, Tesfaye says, he got kicked out of his school for “some incident” that he can’t remember. He had to transfer to a rougher school across town, away from all his friends. “Imagine starting all over at Grade 11? Fuck that — peace.” He lasted six months before dropping out and leaving home, and he and two friends moved into a one-bedroom house at 65 Spencer Avenue, in an up-and-coming Toronto neighborhood called Parkdale. “It was amazing,” Tesfaye says. “No parents, we can do what we want, stay up as late as we want — like, literally for days.” Two blocks away was a strip of hip bars and clubs. “We kind of put that part of the city on,” Tesfaye says. “We were legends on that street. If you go there now, it’s all these little 18-year-old kids that look like me.”

(Tesfaye says 65 Spencer inspired the title House of Balloons. “We’d throw these shitty parties and have girls over, and we’d try to make it celebratory, so we’d have balloons,” he says. Another possible explanation: The Victorian house, with its white columns and gabled roof, looks a lot like the house of balloons from Pixar’s Up, which came out around that time.)

Tesfaye had long wanted to be a musician, and he started pursuing it in earnest. He formed a hip-hop duo called Bulleez N Nerdz, rapping under the name Kin Kane. (Abel = kin to Cain.) Later, he joined a local production team called the Noise and wrote songs he imagined being performed by Justin Timberlake, Drake and Chris Brown. He also started partying a lot. “I never needed detox or anything,” he says. “But I was addicted in the sense of ‘Fuck, I don’t want to spend this day without getting high.'” For a while he was homeless and couch-surfing; he didn’t talk to his mom for a year. “Like, ’08 to 2010 — those are my hazy years,” Tesfaye says. “I have this lyric that goes, ‘I’m not scared of the fall/I’ve felt the ground before.’ And in this industry, I’m not really scared of failing, because I already know what it means to be on the ground.”

One night, Tesfaye is joined in London by his girlfriend, Bella Hadid, the 18-year-old runway model and Real Housewives daughter. (She’s also an Olympic hopeful who is training to qualify for the 2016 Games in three equestrian events, which is apparently news to Tesfaye. “I read that!” he says. “I hope she does. I’ve never seen her do it, but word on the street is she’s bangin’ at it.”)

Hadid (whose older sister is budding supermodel Gigi) just arrived from Milan Fashion Week, where she walked in four shows. Now she’s hanging backstage with the crew, waiting for Tesfaye to get back, smoking cigarettes and eating chicken wings in a tight red dress. One of the guys asks what she’s up to. “I go to Paris tomorrow,” she says. “I can’t wait.” Tesfaye just bought her a puppy for her upcoming 19th birthday — a little black Yorkie named Hendrix. “But I’m probably going to end up taking care of it,” he says.

Tesfaye and Hadid have been dating since last April. “I actually asked her to be on the artwork for Beauty Behind the Madness,” Tesfaye says. “My motive was literally to work with her.” But when she declined, “I was like, ‘All right, cool — we can meet up face-to-face.'” Tesfaye says he loves how hardworking she is, and how close she is with her family. “It just kind of fell into my lap,” he says. “If this had happened two years ago — well,” he catches himself, “she couldn’t.” (Two years ago, Hadid would have been 16.) “But if I’d met someone two years ago, I probably would’ve fucked it up. But I’m more — how do I say it? — clear-thinking now.”

In his music, Tesfaye has presented a conflicted, frequently cold view of women and relationships. On Drake’s “Crew Love,” he brushes off a girl who dares to distract him from his art (“Take your nose off my keyboard/What you bothering me for?”). On “Often,” he brags about turning a woman’s erogenous zone into a meteorological phenomenon.

Tesfaye says the sex in his music is mostly autobiographical. “I mean, no girl has ever actually rained,” he says. “But if that’s not what you mean, then yeah. I don’t want to sound like that guy where sex is not an obstacle. But I’ve had a lot of sex.”

Tesfaye lost his virginity when he was 16. A friend in college took him to a toga party, and he told a girl he was a student at nearby York University. “I could have been a student at fuckin’ McDonald’s, she was so drunk,” he says. “I was drunk too. It was the worst experience of my life. Losing your virginity to an older woman sounds good, but it was kinda like, ‘Oh shit, it’s done?'” In general, he says, he “wasn’t a ladies’ man — it was nothing like it is now.” He quotes the rapper Mike Jones: “The line ‘Back then, ho’s didn’t want me/Now I’m hot, ho’s all on me’ is definitely relevant.”

Part of the allure of the Weeknd’s music is its emotional chilliness — the way he creates a world that sounds both sexy and numbed-out. Next to his darkest songs, an R. Kelly track can seem almost wistfully romantic. The debauchery can have a creepy undercurrent: Tesfaye’s songs, especially the early ones, occasionally depict troubling situations, like on 2011’s “High for This,” where he sings about getting a girl wasted before having sex with her. “Everything is consent,” Tesfaye insists. “The tone is dark, the environment is the dark. But there’s not force in it. They want to have a good time. Everybody wants to be there. Whether they regret their choices after is whatever. But everybody is in consent.”

There’s a more disturbing dynamic at work on 2011’s “Initiation,” where Tesfaye’s narrator implies that before a girl can be with him, she has to sleep with the rest of his crew.
“Back then, it was like, ‘Hey, you want to fucking hang out? Here’s my boys,'” he says. “It’s just me documenting what’s around me. Whether it is something that happened to me or something I see. Nobody’s forcing anybody to do anything. I really do believe a woman does whatever she wants to do.”

Tesfaye doesn’t seem to have spent much time thinking about the implications of these lyrics since he wrote them, and seems taken aback by the suggestion of anything predatory: “I definitely should’ve seen this coming,” he says. “At some point, I’ll probably have to answer for this. But it’s consent, all of it.”

In 2013, Tesfaye released Kiss Land, the much-anticipated follow-up to his mixtape trilogy. He was hoping it would launch him to the next level, but it didn’t take off. “It humbled me a bit,” he says. “I can be honest about it. Nobody wants to put out music where the reception’s not great.” Tesfaye considered moving to Seattle, where the depressing vibes might inspire something interesting. But he wound up in L.A. instead. “No matter how dark my experiences were during Trilogy, it’s nothing like L.A.,” he says. “L.A. is dark.”

Tesfaye is back in Los Angeles tonight, having landed early this morning. He’s still jet-lagged, sipping an Old Fashioned at a steakhouse downstairs from his hotel. He actually rents a house in town, in the Hollywood Hills, but he doesn’t like staying there. “I think it’s haunted, to be honest with you,” he says. “I’ve had sleep paralysis. I hear voices sometimes. I heard the Hills are over Indian burial ground. But maybe it’s just the wind.”

Tesfaye is glad he ended up in L.A. “The relationships I made here have helped me so much.” He says he signed with his label, Republic Records, specifically because of its success in pop radio. “I could have gone with another label that was really good at branding, but I’d already built a strong brand myself,” he says. “I wanted someone who could do what I couldn’t.”

“One thing about Abel that people don’t realize is, he’s incredibly ambitious,” says Republic label head Monte Lipman. Tesfaye asked the record company to help assemble some hits. In the summer of 2014, Republic sent him a half-finished song by labelmate Ariana Grande, “Love Me Harder,” produced by the Swedish pop wizard Max Martin.

“It was a great song,” Tesfaye says, “but it was a little generic. I couldn’t hear myself on it. So I changed it and made it dark.” He rewrote the lyrics and sent them back, and Martin liked what he heard. “It was kind of like the label giving me an alley-oop,” Tesfaye says. “I think that’s where the stars aligned for me. When I see an opening” — he punches his fist in his palm — “I penetrate it.”

The song was released that September. “If people didn’t like it, I would’ve been like, ‘Let’s sweep it under the rug.’ But people were fucking with it.” The song went to Number Seven and marked a turning point for Tesfaye — the beginning of his mainstream conquest. He followed that with “Earned It,” from the 50 Shades of Grey soundtrack, a slinky BDSM slow-jam that sounded like nothing else on pop radio and rode to Number Three on the charts. Then he went into the studio with Martin to craft some hits of his own.

“His whole operation is just genius,” Tesfaye says of the producer. “I was told he doesn’t do this very much, but he would actually sit on the floor with us and come up with ideas. I feel like usually he’ll collaborate, but he’s not as passionate or as hands-on. I felt superhonored, you know? It was some real Michael-and-Quincy, John Lennon-and-Paul McCartney stuff.”

Martin ended up co-producing three songs on the album: “Can’t Feel My Face,” “Shameless” and the forthcoming single “In the Night,” another Jackson homage that could become the Weeknd’s biggest hit yet. “If it works, it’s going to be huge,” Tesfaye says. “It’s like that load that you’re trying to hold in — I’m just waiting for the money shot.”

The Weeknd’s mixtapes, and even Kiss Land to an extent, relied a lot on atmosphere and mood, their hooks cloaked in a woozy codeine haze. Beauty Behind the Madness is more like a cocaine bump: shorter, tighter, more energetic. “It’s all about songs for me right now,” he says. “The production can be cool and crazy-sounding, but that’s just special effects. If you can’t strip it down and play it on piano, it’s not a good song.” He cites Radiohead as an example: “I love Radiohead, they’re one of the greatest of all time. But can you break down their songs and play them on piano? Maybe not.”

To Tesfaye, writing pop songs is a whole lot harder than writing cool songs. “Some people are like, ‘Oh, yeah, just sell out and do pop music.’ So you fucking do it, then! It’s not easy. Can I be honest with you? What all these kids are doing right now? I could do that in my sleep. I listen to it, and it doesn’t test me at all. I could make a girl go like this” — he does a little shimmy-dance — “with a beat. It’s very easy. I did it so much I can’t do it anymore. But pop music? That shit’s hard, dude.”

Three days later, tesfaye is across the country at Studio 8H in NBC’s Rockefeller Center, at a rehearsal for Saturday Night Live. Across the room, host Amy Schumer is posing on a chaise lounge in a black-lace Eighties Madonna dress. Tesfaye is soundchecking the same two songs he always does: “Can’t Feel My Face” and “The Hills.” SNL wanted him to do “In the Night” instead, but it’s a tough song to sing live, and he didn’t feel ready. Even he can recognize his limitations: “I’m not known as the greatest singer right now,” Tesfaye says, “but I’m also not known as the guy who fucking sucks, you know?”

After the camera-blocking, a producer comes over to ask Tesfaye’s team if he’ll shoot a couple of promos with Schumer and cast member Kate McKinnon. At first they decline, but Tesfaye knows what a big deal SNL is, so he agrees. He looks nervous as he takes his mark and stares at the cue cards. “Are you ready?” Schumer teases. “It’s not easy….”

They do a few takes, Tesfaye playing the straight man while Schumer and McKinnon improvise wackily. He’s funny — just the right amount of deadpan. When he asks about a typo on one of the cue cards, Schumer playfully smacks his shoulder: “Well, look who can read!” The director says they have it, and Schumer turns and gives Tesfaye a hug: “You were so good!” An embarrassed Tesfaye smiles, makes two finger-guns and blows his brains out.

At the broadcast Saturday night, Tesfaye is joined by surprise guest Nicki Minaj, who raps on a brand-new remix of “The Hills.” But the highlight for him was meeting Louis C.K., who was “just chilling backstage.” “He was in the middle of a conversation,” Tesfaye says, “and I was like, ‘I don’t know if I’m ever gonna see you again, so in case I don’t, I just want to tell you how much I admire your work.’ I don’t think he recognized who I was, but he was supersweet.”

Or the time he met the Band’s Robbie Robertson at Canada’s Walk of Fame. “Robbie’s from Scarborough too, actually. I met him and Peter Fonda together — those guys know how to party. I’m an avid film-watcher. Growing up, I loved anything Scorsese and De Niro, and Robbie’s been Scorsese’s friend for years, and consulted on Scorsese’s music. So he’d tell me stories about them. I live for these moments.” And then, most charmingly, there’s the time he simply overheard a conversation between LL Cool J and Denzel Washington at an Oscar party. “That’s when I was like, ‘You know what? I think I fuckin’ made it, dude.'”

At 3 a.m., after the SNL afterparty, Tesfaye will board a private jet that will take him to Austin for his headlining slot at ACL fest — his last festival of the year before he shuts down to prep for his own tour. There will be fireworks and a pyro display during “The Hills,” and 30,000 people singing along to “Can’t Feel My Face.” During “Often,” he’ll change the hook to say, “Ask how many times I come to Texas/I say Austin!” and then afterward, he’ll run offstage into a waiting SUV and enjoy a police-motorcycle escort on the way back to his hotel.

It’s a long way from his first big festival gig, in 2012 at Coachella. “Coachella was the first show I did in the States, and I hated my performance,” he says. “I was scared shitless. I got offstage and thought I did pretty good, then I watched the tape, and it was a nightmare. I saw all the comments, and I wanted to kill myself. I remember telling my agent, ‘You need to book me as many shows as possible. That guy onstage is not a star. That’s not a legend.'”

So Tesfaye got to work. He took some dance lessons, trying to build confidence and learn how to perform. And he played lots of shows. “I was performing my ass off,” he says. “My touring was booming. Everybody was confused — I don’t have a hit song, and I’m doing two nights at Radio City? I’m not saying I’m Beyoncé, but I feel like I went after it and nailed it.”

When it came down to it, Tesfaye was driven by fear. “I think the worst thing anyone can say about an artist is, ‘He could have been great,'” he says. “I was always scared of being that guy where it’s like, ‘He could have been big. He could have been a star.’ I was afraid I’d see somebody else up there and be like, ‘You’re trying to tell me they’re better than me? Why? Because they’ve got a couple of smash records? I can do smashes. I could figure it out.’

“And to be honest with you, it’s been, what, a couple of years now? And it feels great. I feel great.”

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
We weren't meant to get out of Jersey
Two stops past the parkway
And that old cemetery
We weren’t born to grow in a hurry
But it rained hard in the garden state
And we shot up like weeds
Walking out of that red brick house
Yeah I could hear it screaming
"Please don't leave"

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Like "Hey, where you goin'?
Don’t you want to talk about it
Before you walk away?"
Like "Hey, where you goin'?
When there's still
So much left to say"

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Hollywood's a lot like the Bible
Both take faith and if you want grace
Then you gotta believe
Holding on was always a battle
Even the father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
Don't always agree
There was always room for one of us
But not enough for three
So who its gonna be?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Saying "Hey, where you goin'?
Don't you want to talk about it
Before you walk away"
Like "Hey, where you goin'? (where you goin’?)
When there’s still
So much left to say"

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
To each other
If we're broken
Rather be honest than unspoken
Words they can hurt but
What could be worse
Than that final curtain come down

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Like hey, where you goin’?
Don't you want to talk about it
Before you walk away
Like hey, where you goin'?
When there's still
So much left
Still so much left
Still so much left to say

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Ooh, it's amazing that you came here
But there's a feeling that I can't ignore
When we go out like that, and you don't write me back
Got me like, ooh, got me like, ooh, yeah

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
I thought that we had a connection, yeah
But you keep putting me in second place
Pull me in to push me back, I ain't going out like that
Got me like, woo, got me like, woo

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
You're the kind of person to put yourself first, yeah
You're the kind of person to boost yourself worth, yeah
Acting like it's nothing only makes it worse, yeah
You're the kind of person to put yourself first, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
La la la la la la la la, la la la la la (first)
La la la la la la la la, la la la la la (first)

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
And you been playing me since day one, yeah
And truth is I think that I like the torture
I adored you, but I warned you
That I wouldn't be treated like a doormat no more, yeah
Now I'm feeling like, woo

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & , Nick Jonas]
You're the kind of person to put yourself first, yeah
You're the kind of person to boost yourself worth, yeah
Acting like it's nothing only makes it worse, yeah
You're the kind of person to put yourself first, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
La la la la la la la la, la la la la la (first)
La la la la la la la la, la la la la la (first)

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]

I got money in my veins comin' out my pores
When my bitch investigate, I slap the source
My coupe white and brown like smores, no remorse
I counted a million in cash my first time snortin'

Speaking of York, I just bought my bitch the Yorkie
Real street nigga, we made it outta EBT, yeah

[Bridge]
I remember the first time my momma called my phone, nigga, it was like three and a half years ago, she was like, "Bae they cut my food stamps off, what the fuck goin' on?"

Dropped a whole quarter mil' on the blouser, homie
Rockin' the mink, got koala on it

Call 'em, let 'em know that I'm on the road with a load
Come tell my doggy to be fired like you in loads
When it come to Actavis, I'm a J just like Cole
Stack it to the ceiling, man, you know that shit gon' fold
Ran up my money, I ran it up like I know
Run it up

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Too much money, only one dick, too much honeys
Five on the dick but two run from me
I leave that pussy hot like a cat in the oven, ooh
Now we at the derby
Tubs on my man, that's a young rastafari
Find me a 

[?] what deep 

[?]
In your bitch jaws like a dentist, I'm so sorry
I be a 

[?]
Couple of bamboos done fucked up my dough
Head in a cup for a nigga that's ghost
But when you get money, that's the way it go
Got me a model bitch, 'cane in her nose
Chop the moolah, yeah, she came with the clothes
Yves Saint Laurent is the 

[?]
I just can't get my shit else no where on the globe
Straight off the runway and not at a show
Straight out of Harlem, I came to explode
Feel like outside it's a hit everywhere I go
Feel like I'm trill, I can't fuck with our flow
Better hop on the boat
Cut to my block, better tuck in your dope
'Cause my niggas like bitches with 40 below
I said do not sleep with a nigga like 40 below

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Only keep a bag for the rest of streets on the road
In love with my dog, I'ma feed 'em nothin' but pesto
I'm not from N-O but I'm stickin' to the G Code
Call 'em, let 'em know that I'm on the road with a load
Come tell my doggy to be fired like you in loads
When it come to Actavis, I'm a J just like Cole
Stack it to the ceiling, man, you know that shit gon' fold
Ran up my money, I ran it up like I know
Run it up
Lately I've been ??? awake thinking, wishing, dreaming about you
???? as my eyes away, I can feel you with me, It's true

Place like Amsterdam, I just got some head in Rotterdam
I just got a lawsuit from my old manager
Look at my old clan tryna sue the man
Might go get a Bentley, might go sip a four
Might go get the Lamb' off the showroom floor
I just bought a Bentley, mark, set, let's go
I just do my thing and these ni‏ggas know
I just got a spot with leopard skin, last year ain't have a pot to piss in
I'ma see a psychiatrist, I ain't gon' ever win unless I take some Ritalin
No time to fuss, no fight, I'm at the best place in my life

Chillin' at the shop all day, bubblegum a new Kanye

You'll do it real good with my homie for a piggy blanket, ain't you?
You a real dog, you the real cause, you the real problem
You a nasty broad, you a dick hog, I'm a problem solver, ha
I was 'bout to call, I was pissed off, I'm on crystal, ha
Ain't no tellin' what I'm 'bout to say, man, I'm too ticked off, uh
How could you care about you when you don't care about me?
How could you say you in love when you a low key freak?
How could you know about that and you don't know about this?
How could you do that to a G? I took your ass off E
Who let this bitch up off the leash? I think somebody need to tame her
How could you say you owe me? You see me million dollar planking
I stayed inside the house with you like you had something on your ankle
Like you done fucked around and stanked 'em
Let's play big bank take lil' bank, uh

[Verse 1]
We have to love him now
While he is still here
For all that, all that he's done
Before the moment disappears

[Pre-Chorus]
We can still hug him now
After all these years
'Cause when the darkness, when the darkness comes
He's our chandelier

[Chorus]
To bring the light (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
To bring the light, yeah (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I'm sorry if this is a bore
But I wasn't seen in here before
So I toast him tonight
Wooh, uh (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)

[Verse 2]
When your trajectory was off
And couldn't find true north, just lost
He would say, "Protect him, at all cost"
They would hang up the calls

[Pre-Chorus]
But we, we can still hug him now
After all these years
'Cause when the darkness comes
He's our chandelier

[Chorus]
To bring the light (Ayy, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
To bring the light, yeah (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I'm sorry if this is a bore
But I wasn't seen in here before
So I toast him tonight
Wooh, uh (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)

[Bridge]
'Cause when the darkness comes
And you know it'll come, you know it'll come, but when it does
Just know, he's our chandelier

[Chorus]
Oh, to bring the light (Ayy)
To bring the light, yeah
I'm sorry if this is a bore
But I wasn't seen in here before
So I toast him tonight
Wooh, uh

[Verse 1]
All a kid needs is a girl with a dream
A girl like you, with no insecurities
Don't be ashamed if you all about the game
That’s what I'm tryna fuck, that's what I’m tryna chase
I like it when you take this money, girl, money, girl, it's all for you
Just tryna see you out that shirt
I brought money to throw for you, lets go

[Verse 2]
All a nigga needs is some good ass weed
And the bass real loud 'til my eardrums bleed
And if I give you a task, you'll do what I say
And you'll do what I say with a smile on your face
And you'll serve this royalty
Believing in me, know, you gotta serve this royalty right
And trust what I'm saying, we can get it

Little dose of napalm, blow it up, yeah

All she wanna do is my style, yeah
No one on my level
I play nice 'cause I'm too clever
I won't show it, never, never, but it's crystal (Woo)
I'm way up, way better
She might pop, but it's whatever
She might sell, but what's she selling?
Does she last long?
I know they write about me (Yeah)
I know that they all see me (Yeah)
Too scared so they don't play me
Some people tried to save me

[Bridge: Charli XCX & Troye Sivan, Charli XCX]
Ooh, but I'm feeling so good
Better than I ever could
Had bad people in my business, gone now
Cage, prison, now it's gone away
They wanna listen what I say
Think I care about the fame?
Na-na-na-na

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Troye Sivan]
I pull up, roll up, fuck up

[Verse 1]
Under your spell
Lock in me in your love like a prison cell
Don't know you well
Got to keep it secret, no kiss and tell

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In my head, in my head
I fight it 'cause I know we're misbehaving, we're danger
Risky 'cause there's something 'bout your lovin'
There's something 'bout your lovin'

[Chorus]
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know I'm yours

[Verse 2]
You call my phone
Fake it, like you're someone I never knew
Our friends, they keep it close
Whispers make our house fall down like dominos

[Pre-Chorus 2]
In my head, in my head
I fight it, but I know this misbehavior it's changin'
And it's special 'cause there's something 'bout your lovin'
But still, I won't say nothin'

[Chorus]
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know I'm yours

[Verse 1]
Our naked bodies go on trial
Just for laughing at the joke
Just for saying of the bargain
What any salesgirl already knows
Most of us old men die in the firing line
Just waiting for our number to be called

[Refrain]
I guess time just makes fools of us all
Oh, I guess time just makes fools of us all

[Verse 2]
The Memphis king regales his stepsons
When he's loaded as a gun
Says, "A real man is like a country
You need a map to find your one"
Now why do you suppose you must approach the throne
With its back up against the wall?

[Refrain]
I guess time just makes fools of us all
Oh, Lord, I guess time just makes fools of us all

[Bridge]
My drink is watered down
My champion's on his knees
He lost a rematch, he lost a comeback
He lost for charity
But that's the job
It's what gets the asses in the hall
Watching time just make fools of us all

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3]
The groom is a liar
And the bride is a shill
The priest says, "If these two don't make it
Who among us ever will?"
Don't ask the love you dare for a prediction
Wherein the lovers of tomorrow are involved

[Refrain]
I guess time just makes fools of us all
Oh, Lord, I guess time just makes fools of us all

[Outro]
I guess time just makes fools of us all
Oh, I guess time just makes fools of us all

[Chorus]
This our only chance, I gotta catch a flight
I know you got a man, but can I borrow you for one night?
Baby, all I got is one night (One night)
I see you dancin', love to play them games
But spend the night with me, your life ain’t gonna be the same
It's just one night, baby, all I got is one night (One night)

[Verse 1]
Uh, uh, uh, ha, ha

Baby girl wanna get nice, alright (Alright)
Don't fight, though it don't seem right

[Chorus]
This our only chance, I gotta catch a flight
I know you got a man, but can I borrow you for one night?

[Verse 2]
Ha, ha, ha

You know wassup with me, I'm tryna see wassup with you (Uh-huh)
Just want you for the night, then after that I'll let you loose
All the liquor in the world, so tell your friends to bring the juice
And we can mix it (Mix it), chase it (Chase it)
Girl that’ll like to taste it
Don't got a lot of time, and baby girl, don't wanna waste it (Uh-huh)
Come hang with the kid (Right), I'ma make you feel rich (Right)
I can tell that you's a freak by the way you swayin' ya hips, so

[Chorus]
This our only chance, I gotta catch a flight
I know you got a man, but can I borrow you for one night?
Baby, all I got is one night (One night)

Got ’em all tannin' by the pool and they greased up
Police in my city, man, I keep they pockets greased up (Okay)

Holy, holy, holy fall from grace
Jesus, what a sight when you're erased
Coastline, middle of your down time
Make it so you know what's wrong when time stands in the lake
Holy, holy, holy fall from grace
Coastline, middle of your down time
Make it so you feel fine
If you can see the cross your mother made you hold
What a sight to behold
Nazareth put on hold
What is it your teacher sold to you that made you run
You can't let go of what you saw
Hudson in the late fall
Hipster in a phone call
Make it so you feel fine
If you can see the cross your mother made you hold
Love spending time together
Walking around in any weather
Starting the day, dancing in the kitchen
You’re moving like Shakira meets Dick Van Dyke

Hold me darlin’ all morning
Lazy days have never felt so good as when we’re together
So chilled out, in the sun just laying down
And everyday I love you more than I did before

Hold me darlin’ all morning

Hold me darlin’ all morning

[Verse 1]
Oh honey, I'll do anything for you
Oh honey, just tell me what you want me to
Oh honey, kiss me up against the wall
Oh honey, don’t think anything, just have it all

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I can't take it, so don't you fake it
I know your love’s my destiny
Yeah, I can't take it, please demonstrate it
'Cause I'm going down in history

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, whoa-ho, I'm on a roll
Ridin' so high, achieving my goals
Hey, yeah, whoa-ho, I'm on a roll
Ridin' so high, achieving my goals

[Post-Chorus]
I’m stoked on ambition and verve
I’m gonna get what I deserve
So full of ambition and verve
I'm gonna get what I deserve

[Verse 2]
Oh honey, let’s get in through the door
Oh honey, not concerned who sees us ripping up the floor
Oh honey, we'll go dancing wherever you choose
Oh honey, you know we just can't lose

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I can't take it, so don’t you fake it
I know your love's my destiny
Yeah, I can't take it, please demonstrate it
'Cause I'm going down in history

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, whoa-ho, I'm on a roll
Ridin' so high, achieving my goals
Hey, yeah, whoa-ho, I'm on a roll
Ridin' so high, achieving my goals

I'm stoked on ambition and verve
I'm gonna get what I deserve

Ho you too old for casual sex
Do it for a bag that's collateral sex
She make the whole dick vanish that’s magical neck

She swallow all the kids no child get left behind
Can't say if she gon' go but it seem like she inclined
You blew your whole cover, you blew the façade
Your man found out you eat cat now he wanna ménage
She squeeze the pistol 'til I pull the trigga
Death come in threes I’m a pussy killa

Don't be a grinch, don't be a grouch
Tryna pump, tryna dump, tryna hump, tryna plow

Ain't talkin' retros but I like my women in threes

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
These motherfuckers don't know
These motherfuckers don't know, yeah

[Verse 1]
The tracklist filled up with so many mistakes, can't believe I'm alive
Will you be a saint or a sinner? Whatever you want, you decide
All day I been faded, all day I been faded, but fuck it, I drive
Now I'm in a Mercedes, the pills made me crazy, today I could die
Fall asleep in the pussy, wake up to the money, my life a cliché
I think I deserve a promotion, I think I'ma need me a raise
Tell these motherfuckers, "Keep playin'"
'Cause me, I created the game though
Stack my money and lay low, they can't fuck with my bankroll

[Chorus]
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
I been a real one, yeah, I been a real one

[Open Verse]

[Verse 2]
Yeah (Okay, okay, okay, okay), yeah
I get up with the sun, only sleep for a minute
Then back to the grind (Woo)
They party and bullshit, get wasted, I done it
Ain't wastin' my time (No, no)
I'm faded, my eyes low, so no reason to hide that I'm blatantly high
Bitches been trippin' since in the beginnin'
Don't listen every time they tellin' me lies, oh no (Oh, no)
All I ever wanted was to be somebody special
Couple diamonds dancin' on the dental
Cap in mind, don't mind though by the elbow, yeah, you know
Know you poppin' when you make a million dollars on the cellphone (Huh?)
Money been a manifesto, said, the money been a manifesto, yeah
I'm up like espresso, the bitches say, "Hello"
I'm outta the friendzone (Woo)
I rode with the homies, where ever we go
We don't follow no dress code (Nah)
And I'm still young, gettin' faded to feel numb

[Chorus]
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah (Woo)
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
I been a real one, yeah, I been a real one

[Outro]
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Ch-ch, check
I'm invincible, it’s principle, you're all in class
I'm invisible, the critics never saw Young Ab
In the kitchen whippin’, yeah, I started from scratch
I ain't pitch shit, I made a big shift
I kept givin' gifts, now they all on my sack
Bitches only, homie, Soul ain't never been no fag
I mean, I know they tryna legalize gay marriage, and that's fine
But that ain't no business of mine
I'm more in tune with ruins and suin', what you was doin’?
I mean, who really gon’ be ready when the gods come back?
Don't mean to scare you, just prepare you, where my niggas at?
Where the hoes at, where the weed?
Where the lean, where the extra pills? I really mean that
I see your median and your mode, it’s over
Take heed when you see the black

[Interlude: Ab-Soul]
Hippy (Soul), hit me
Put your pussy in the cleaners, bitch

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Your bitches Mars and pen arguin' with the followin' commoners
I be high as astronomers when I'm blazin’, and
All your problems is always who was in charge of your bitch
Who you the guardian over, confident lame shit? See
I don't care that you famous, 'cause I ain't scared of your gang
If you don't carry a stainless, your girl pussy is Pangus
Stank and ancient and tainted
I'm a saint and amazin'
Fuckin' Topanga with coat hangers, I'm heinous, bitch
And I'm accurate on inadequate overly passionate rappers
With half the establishment on my pinky finger
Buzzin' off two dozen bars, I give 'em stingers
You'll get it later, haha
Bitch, I think I'm a legend, bitch, I think I'm a God
Blowin' smoke on these bitches, suck my dick through the fog
You a functionin' puppet, bitch, you Kermit The Frog
Make another mil', give a person a job
Spit retarded, I'm 50 Tyson
Dumpin' ash in the studio, clean it with a Dyson
You eatin' steak, I'm eatin' bison
Take your girl's last name, with a hyphen
Me, I'm just blowin' this chronic
All these others rappers, they homoerotic
I love pussy, so I don't need to pause it
Put my plug right in her socket, watch it
But it's leakin' out my faucet, toxic
When you know it's not a option, stop it
You got it, you lost it, get off it

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
Take your pussy to the cleaners
Put a dollar in the meter
They gon' clean that pussy all day
They gon' clean that pussy all day
Put your pussy in the cleaners, bitch

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse]
I just spent thirty-five grand on a humbug (Go)
Half of this shit I went and spent with the gun plug (Bitch)
Nigga more strapped than a middle-aged dyke style
(Oh my God, Ronny)
Leave the boy layin' where he stayin’ like a bathtub
Tryna keep it cool but this bitch gon' make me act up
Nigga, back up, go somewhere and get your racks up
I will use my gun if I have to (Uh)
Big FN, I will not need back up
These bullets leave a nigga tryna get sewn up (Bitch)
This bitch bad, she about to get flown up
Since 17, I've been livin’ like a grown-up
Got a big bank now every single bitch gon' fuck
Pull up in a Tonk' truck lookin' like the money man
I do not give a single fuck about a hunnid bands
I can count that so quick with my other hand (Ooh, ooh)
My brims hard, let me know who realer then (Yeah)
Up a couple million, still rock a Gilla then
Might paint the whip all pink like I'm Killa Cam
Inside the whip peanut butter like I'm Peter Pan
I need my own island, Gilligan
I'm sorry your bitch wanna feel a man
Woah (Bee), walk in the club, changin' the weather
Call me the new weatherman
New earring same size as a CD (Ice)
Eighty-five racks, no cap, know you see these
Shit look sweet, no licks come easy
On my soul, this shit ain’t PG (Go)
I’ma sit this one out like KD
Might turn 30, go bald like KG (Yeah)
Prolly will not 'cause I am not that crazy
Keep talkin’ shit, I'ma wipe that baby
Six Grand tee, sent the money to AB
At this point, I see more water than the Navy
Need a Porsche coupe same color as some gravy
All tinted up, top drop, middle finger to a cop (Yeah)
Niggas hate Boat 'cause I'm the most unorthodox (Fuck)
Nutting on her face like the motherfuckin’ chicken pox
I remember when the fuck ass niggas didn't rock
Now niggas know what's goin' down, word to Yung Joc

[Outro]
(Bitch)
Bitch ass nigga
(Bitch)
Yeah, go crazy, go stupid
Ahh

[Intro]

Welcome to the, yeah
Welcome to the, yeah
Welcome to the, yeah
Yeah, um, yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the free mind
I pick you up from times that got you feelin' on a decline
Now we the giants, fee-fi
Just had to get some me time
Bitch, I ain't no average Joe, I'm motherfuckin' G.I
The weak spine can go to hell
I'm overwhelmed, can't even pick the car I wanna drive
Often times, we fear the disappointment from our father's eyes
Far cry to heaven, longer ride back home
Unconnect, a mind felon, never talk on phones
And fuck regret, we the legends when we hot or cold
I'm old-fashioned, very closed, and polka dot my soul, yeah
I made adjustments, I'm just gettin' started
Why the fuck I feel like brushin', like a sweep, or a snare roll?
How do I bear the weight to those I can't know?
Give light like a lamp post, and fix me up a ham roast
Everybody clap your hands for
The Wizard and the Tin Man, and the Lion and the Scarecrow

[Chorus]
There he goes again, standing on his toes again
You are not alone, my friend
If this feels like home, why don't you come on in? (

[?])
Have that glass of wine, share some laughs to pass the time
There's snakes in the grass, there's snakes in the grass

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I hate the power she got over me
I'm Bukowski writin' poetry
Hold on to imaginary rosaries
Put away your own beliefs
Guess we ain't the same
But we all came from Mother Earth's ovaries
Rabid dog, show my teeth, eat a motherfucker whole
Chewin' on your crunchy bones, spit out your disgusting soul
Homie, we don't love them hoes
Yes, we do, but fuck 'em though
Tell the doctor that my medicine can probably up the dose
I'm not there, but fuckin' close
Oh my god, I'm fuckin' close
Bitch, you ain't no fuckin' judge
But this my blood, I'm under oath
Shit, I guess it's just the way it goes
Yeah, better go and smell the roses if you wanna tell the world about 'em
I'm in my imagination, there's a world around 'em
And when they hate, eliminate 'em like you never knew 'em
Save me from my execution

[Chorus]
There he goes again, standing on his toes again
You are not alone, my friend
If this feels like home, why don't you come on in? (

[?])
Have that glass of wine, share some laughs to pass the time
There's snakes in the grass, there's snakes in the grass

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You spend a weekend with me, I spend a lifetime on you

Eat your flesh and stay mellow (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Gunna]
The white marble dresser with a picture of you (Picture of you)
Put a hold on my schedule, put a reservation for two (Reservation for two)
Shopping is your pleasure, and I feed your attitude (Feed your attitude)
Put you on a pedestal, take a trip to Cancun
Yves Saint Laurent sweater, when the weather feel cool
We livin' better, town house with six rooms
Mis-loyalty never, real run through my roots
I wish we could stay together, I'ma tell you the truth
Show me your commitment, I’ma do the same for you
Told me you gonna ride or die, so I bought a coupe for us two
Italy her whole life, everything brand new
Diamonds keep me frostbite, I’m just tryna keep my cool
Rep a gang red like Oldspice, going color blind, I see blue
Get high like a skyline, need to give me time to regroup
This money long, need a ruler call the jeweler, I need juice
Teach you game like a tutor, you won't fall in love with a fool

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You spend a weekend with me, I spend a lifetime on you
You Puerto Rican, baby, you know your love is the truth
I bought a coupe and baby, I’ll hand it over to you

[Verse 2: Lil Baby & Young Thug]
Ain't no want no cappin'
I've been onto better things, these niggas so last year
I'm in the back seat of the Maybach with a soul snatcher
I just switched lanes and go slow, they probably still won't catch us
Bae I love your ass, and what's your practice
Baby I love your practice, like I love my bratties
Talkin' 'bout stripper panties, and white wall grandies
It's just all ladies, shawty said, "those are candies"
Range Rover autobiography, ain't doin' no slackin'
Ain't doin' no more slackin', car too fast need traction
Bad lil' ten, she nasty
Diamonds on fleek, they dancin'
Woah, oh

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You spend a weekend with me, I spend a lifetime on you
You Puerto Rican, baby, you know your love is the truth

[Verse 1]
All of the faces makin' a frown
We shall not say
And all of the places where we let you down
We shall not be
And it’s hard, and it's hard, and it's hard, and it’s hard, and it's hard for us to know
Where we are, where we are, where we are, where we are, where we are and where to go

[Chorus]
We will follow you down roads obscure
We too are bound
Worryin' how it all turns out
We'll know when we find out

[Verse 2]
And all of the places where we let you down
We shall not be
And all of the faces makin' a frown
We shall not say
And it's hard, and it's hard, and it's hard, and it’s hard, and it’s hard for us to know
Where we are, where we are, where we are, where we are, where we are and where to go

[Chorus]
We will follow you down roads obscure
We too are bound
Worryin' how it all turns out
We’ll know when we find out
And it's hard, and it's hard, and it's hard, and it’s hard, and it's hard for us to know
Where we are, where we are, where we are, where we are, where we are and where we'll go

[Verse 1]
Dreaming of a wasteland
Maybe somewhere like hawaii
When I saw your face
Now the beach is filled with zombies

[Chorus]
Alright! Alright!
I'll let it go
Alright! Alright!
I'll let it go
Alright! Alright!
I'll let it go

[Verse 2]
As we dream I turn to stone
And the water haunts me
Creatures fill the land, oh
Now the beach is filled with zombies

[Chorus]
Alright! Alright!
I'll let it go
Alright! Alright!
I'll let it go
Alright! Alright!
I'll let it go

[Verse 1]
Since I can remember
Since I was a child
You gave me all you could and all you had
Now that I am older and now that I am grown
I see how hard you worked to make our house a home

[Chorus]
If I turn out half the man you are I’ll be happy with my life
Show me how to raise a family, and how to treat a wife
You put food on the table so that I was able
To follow every one of my dreams
If I turn out half the man you are, I’ll be doing alright

[Verse 2]
You said don’t let life get in your way
That would never get me down
Love as if there’s no tomorrow to stand to be a man
I can’t always make it easy but I’ll always lend a hand
Through whatever comes together you and I will understand

[Chorus]
If I turn out half the man you are I’ll be happy with my life
Show me how to raise a family and how to treat a wife
You put food on the table so that I was able
To follow every one of my dreams
If I turn out half the man you are I’ll be doing alright

[Bridge]
And I know that I’m still hurting
But I hope I make you proud
At the man that I’m becoming and the man I am now
And I know that I’ll keep learning
Never told you this before
You’re not only just a father
To me you’re so much more
To me you’re so much more

[Chorus]
If I turn out half the man you are I’ll be happy with my life
Show me how to raise a family and how to treat a wife
You put food on the table so that I was able
To follow every one of my dreams
If I turn out half the man you are I’ll be doing alright

[Post-Chorus]
And I love, l love, I love, I love
I love, I love you so
And I love, l love, I love, I love
I love, I love you so

[Outro]
And I know that I'll keep learning

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
Ain't no bad time when you run one (Yeah)
It'd make bank if you undo
Better break it down to find you
6' 1", on the money 9' 2"
Hand it down, hit me when you undo
Hand it back, hit it when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, circumnavigate the globe as the cash grows (Grow)
Get a nigga whacked like you get the grass mowed (Mowed)
I'm talkin' slick when I'm with the Big Slime, nigga (Slime)
Could hit your bitch, you could never hit mine, nigga (Mine)
In my DM, they electric slide, nigga (Huh, slide)
No catfishin', this is not a fish fry, nigga
Never switch sides on my dog
Catch a contact, hitch a ride, go to Mars
Everybody sing
How could you come up out your face
And say I ain't the hardest nigga you done ever heard?
I left a flock of rappers dead and buried
A verse from me is like 11 birds
I did the math, it’s like two thousand dollars every word
I'm on the verge, I'll beat the charge
I killed some niggas and I walked away from it
Then I observe, just how you curve
Then told the nigga that they gotta wait for it
"I know—I know you in high demand"
I'm ballin' on a pussy nigga like Juwanna Mann
I'm drownin' all inside the pussy like I never swam
Ayy, fuck your IG, I put somethin' on your sonogram
I'm the man, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
Ain't no bad time when you run one (Yeah)
It'd make bank if you undo
Better break it down to find you
6' 1", on the money 9' 2"
Hand it down, hit me when you undo
Hand it back, hit it when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Pimp talk, church talk, I can make a brick walk (Woo)
Up north, down south, Bankhead to Rachel Walk (Ayy)
Hit it with a little water, stretch it like a vocal cord
STD, I run my ward, fuck a fed and his daughter (Let's go)
I'ma run the compound (Yeah)
I supply the cigarettes and bread (Woo)
I got a main and she gon' ride (Uh)
She took a quarter and she fled (Uh)
I'm in the Lamb, so she gon' ride (Yeah)
I see the pain in shawty's light brown eyes (Ooh)
I'm at The London with some big thighs
No fries, she eat steaks with the fish sides
Did your mama tell you when something on fire
Stop, drop and roll? (Aw yeah)
I've been on the road like a pair of spinners at Stop-N-Go's (Yeah)
I could charge 'em like a Dodge Hemi Demon
Got your broad in the garage eatin' semen
Every time a nigga go back to the ward
Niggas act like they want start
And we leave them on the cement (Grra, grra!)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
Ain't no bad time when you run one (Yeah)
It'd make bank if you undo
Better break it down to find you
6' 1", on the money 9' 2"
Hand it down, hit me when you undo
Hand it back, hit it when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
I, crash down, we get money (Hey)
For the full town (Woah, when you won't play, I)
I decided, for the full side (Hoes will say)
And they know, I might (And fly, I...)
Get down, might (Don't play)
See the whole town every time, I... (Oh, every day)
Yeah, they know what's up (Folks will say)
(

[?] on the beat)

[Refrain: Travis Scott]
She jumped out with the breasts on ill
I took tears, so I might sight-see it
She jumped out with the breasts on ill
I took tears, so I might sight-see it

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London (Ooh, ooh)
Ain't no bad time when you run one (Ooh, ooh)
It'd make bank if you undo (Ooh, ooh)
Better break it down to find you (Ooh, ooh)
6' 1", on the money 9' 2" (Ooh, ooh)
Hand it down, hit me when you undo (Ooh, ooh)
Hand it back, hit it when I knew (Ooh, ooh)
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew
The Earth is our mother just turning around
With her trees in the forest and roots underground
Our father above us who's high is the wind
Paint us a rainbow without any end
As the river runs freely the mountain does rise
Let me touch with my fingers and see with my eyes
In the hearts of the children of pure love still roams
Like a bright star in heaven that lights our way home
Like the flower that shattered the stone
Sparrows find freedom beholding the Sun
In the engine and beauty we’re all joined in one
I reach out before me and look to the sky
As the river runs freely the mountain does rise
Let me touch with my fingers and see with my eyes
In the hearts of the children of pure love still roams
Like a bright star in heaven that lights our way home
Like the flower that shattered the stone
Like a bright star in heaven that lights our way home
Like the flower that shattered the stone
Listen
Maybe you should listen
I don't think you'd like it if I gave you permission
Maybe it's a sign
Lightning in the sky
Thunderstorms coming and I think I know why
Back to the front
What have I done?
Only you can judge me cause sometimes it's fun
You don't have to be vague
What can I say?
Lately I can only see static in gray

Listen
Maybe you should listen
I don't think you'd like it if I gave you permission
Maybe it's a sign
Lightning in the sky
Thunderstorms coming and I think I know why
Back to the front
What have I done?
Only you can judge me cause sometimes it's fun
You don't have to be vague
What can I say?
Lately I can only ever leave it in gray
Goin up to Alaska
Up to the land of the midnight sun
Where the whale and the polar bear run
Oer the icy blue sea
Goin up to Alaska
Up to the north and the pioneer life
Where courage and strength still survive
And a man can be free
American Child, does the call of the wild
Ever sing through the mist of your dreams
Does it fly with the wind when you waken again
When its gone do you know what it means
Can you picture the time when a man had to find
His own way through the cold
To come back again to all that youve been
Can't you see that its time to come home
To the flowers and seas and the rivers and the trees
And the earth whos the mother of all
A promise once made - will it shine, will it fade
Will we rise with the vision or fall
Goin up to Alaska
Up to the land of the midnight sun
Where the whale and the polar bear run
Oer the icy blue sea
Goin up to Alaska
Up to the north and the pioneer life
Where courage and strength still survive
And a man can be free
Men can be free
Goin up to Alaska
Goin up to Alaska
Goin up to Alaska

She got rock star pussy, she don't get old
Bitch tall, put tissues in my insoles
Got a big rock band, that's official

I double back every time I'm sentimental
I'm top five in your phone when I miss you

If your bitch friend zone me, I get friendly
Supposed to be a one night stand, I'm fuckin' on her plenty

Half-past twelve I was all alone
I can't be compromised
Fuckin' on my ex, we ain't apologize
'Cause I'm way too young and you always right
Threw it in my face, I'm on another flight
Girl at home, I ain't been living right
The little arguments always start the fight
I had to get away so I'm with you tonight
Is there another guy?

[Chorus]
Be honest, honest, honest, are you honest?
'Cause I'm honest, honest, honest, let's be honest
'Cause I'm honest, honest, honest, are you honest?
'Cause I'm honest, honest, honest, let's be honest
'Cause I'm honest

[Verse]
You're not who I love, huh
I just need to pass the time, huh
Felt good, you felt that
Come and get a peace of mind, huh
Move on, brands on me
Stripes in my pocket and a check on me
Never needed shit so don't you check on me
Home last night, the scent of sex on me
Baby Keem, shit, I'm chosen
I whip that red Toyota like it's stolen
I treat my lil' orange soda like a Hellcat (Hellcat)
She put me out in the winter, feet frozen (Frozen)
She wanna fuck with me 'cause I'm famous (I'm famous)
And that's okay with me, 'cause you been my favorite (My favorite)
I let her do it, she do a lil' bit
A lil' air in her room, she do a lil' bit

[Pre-Chorus]
Half-past twelve I was all alone
I can't be compromised
Fuckin' on my ex, we ain't apologize
'Cause I'm way too young and you always right
Threw it in my face, I'm on another flight
Girl at home, I ain't been living right
The little arguments always start the fight
I had to get away so I'm with you tonight
Is there another guy?

[Chorus]
Be honest, honest, honest, are you honest?
'Cause I'm honest, honest, honest, let's be honest

[Chorus]
Big protein, I'm smokin' lonely for the culture
No TED Talkin', steppin' on a little roach (Yeah!)
What that mean? Baby Keem, I invented it
Ten toes down, painkillers 'til I'm feelin' it
Big protein, I'm smokin' lonely for the culture
No TED Talkin', steppin' on a little roach
What that mean? Baby Keem, I invented it
Ten toes down, painkillers 'til I'm feelin' it

[Verse]
Before I leave the house, I tell my bitch that I love her
But that's not 'til I pop a pill, now it's fuck her
That's some shit I can't risk, she's an actress
She just wanna love me, I swear it's a habit
Flip a couple million
Have a couple children then give them my millions, I know
Hang with the demons, they dancin'
Don't dyke with my Dyson, don't cap on the fashion, I know
My bitch with the extras
Two ho down, now I'm fuckin' on her best friends
Yes, I made a sex tape, but that ain't no secret (Yeah, yeah)
If I tap then I wanna put it on the deep end (Yeah, yeah)
I put the pussy on ice
Can you be my co-sign? She don't think I'm nice
You don't need a thirst trap to show me that I'm right
I might hit the pussy all night, go flight, ayy, pay, ayy, bullshit

[Chorus]
Big protein, I'm smokin' lonely for the culture
No TED Talkin', steppin' on a little roach
What that mean? Baby Keem, I invented it
Ten toes down, painkillers 'til I'm feelin' it
Big protein, I'm smokin' lonely for the culture
No TED Talkin', steppin' on a little roach

[Chorus]
Too many options, love me 'cause I'm gettin' poppin', ayy

That's a pump fake, that's what you niggas all say
Say she love me, that's what you bitches all say
Yeah, you lost my trust
You was surfin' on your wave, you lose me for lust
New friends, I'm finna fight, get your mans, ho
Psych, you bow-legged ass bitch, I don't use hands, ho

When I see you, it's like starin' at a new face
My life changed when I seen you with your new bae
It's not the fact you moved on, it's the principle
Why you talk to bums? Treat the Louis like a visitor
You say this nigga average and that's just what you like
You hate when I ignore you, I have to board my flight

[Chorus]
Aye, I am your big homie
Aye, show me respect
Bitch show me the text
Two phones on my chest

I beat up the box

[Verse 1]
Hoes in the whip, ten toes on the ship, uh
She wastin' time on a nigga that ain't shit, uh
Hit it from the back, uh, I never left, uh
Ice cream boogers on my wrist, that's a fact, ayy
Fuck him up, he was checking on my bitch (Huh)
I was havin' fun 'til my checking took the hit, ayy
Two-phone Baby Keem, I might take a nigga shit, ayy
Bitch, I'm on the run, I smash the gas then I split
You niggas not my bro, you niggas not my homeboy
You niggas rock the boat, you niggas love to cap
I might take a loss, then I make it back
If I take a loss, I'ma make it back, yeah

[Chorus]
Shots at your kickback, uh, bitch, get back
I said, bro, get back, uh
Yeah, you don't want no smoke
You don't want no crack
Ayy, get back, huh
Get back, I said, bro, get back

[Verse 2]
Yeah, fuck did you think?
Pump fake, you talkin' to me?

We aren't the same, my squad is unique, ayy
Don't trust a sorry ho, my momma told me that
Ice cream, wrist pistachio, big water, hold the tap, yeah
Huh, focus straight to the whip, I floor it
Bust out a fit, I wore it
Text from your bitch, ignore it
Dick print, hope I'm her MCM, she dig the source
Cartier frames, this is my bitch, I see that the vibes distorted
Hop in the four-door (I am the sensei)
Hop in the Range (I am the sensei)
Big protein, take it to my brain (I am the sensei)
How much you make? You watchin' my pockets
We not the same (I am the sensei)
Kick that bitch if she switch up on the gang (Whoa!)

[Chorus]
Shots at your kickback, uh, bitch, get back

Pull up, air out, where is the function?
I be in her back, beat the walls, Tim Duncan
Soul Food, this ain't it, no assumption
Kung fu, on your whole crew, got the monsters
I just seen a Louis bag, I made my woman merch it
I gave you two chances, I might reverse it
Baby, we grown, we not meant to be perfect
Shut the fuck up

[Chorus: Baby Keem]
Baby, did I make you proud?
Did I make you proud? Yeah
Did I make you proud?
Did I make you proud?
Baby, did I make you proud?
Did I make you proud? Yeah
Did I make you proud?
Did I make you proud? Yeah

[Post-Chorus: Bakar]
I guess we got together at the wrong time
We were supposed to be together for a long time
Why does it happen like that?
Sometimes it happens like that

[Verse 2: Baby Keem]
I love when we cuddle (Yeah), we annoy each other (Yeah)
But don’t be annoyin' (Yeah), that's too much turmoil (Yeah)
Either way I love it, don’t destroy each other
Touchin' one another, tell me where your goin'
Pocket on ten, holdin' big proteins
Serve the opps, hit licks, Baby Keem, you're mean
Am I your type? I'm black with a big magazine
Fuck a thot, I need you with me

[Chorus: Baby Keem]
Baby, did I make you proud?
Did I make you proud? Yeah
Did I make you proud?
Did I make you proud?
Baby, did I make you proud?
Did I make you proud? Yeah
Did I make you proud?

[Post-Chorus: Bakar]
I guess we got together at the wrong time
We were supposed to be together for a long time
Why does it happen like that?
Sometimes it happens like that
Guess we got together at the wrong time
We were supposed to be together for a long time
Why does it happen like that?
Sometimes it happens like that

[Bridge: Bakar]
Life line, write mine, think I lost my right mind
Zeitgeist, five five, found me at the right time (Sometimes it happens like that)
I think she found me at the right time (Sometimes it happens like that)
I think she-

[Outro: Baby Keem]
Yeah, smokin' on this-

[Verse 1]
Can you hear me? S.O.S
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clean again, I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Verse 2]
I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go, but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need you now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
(We could be) We could be more than just part-time lovers
(Part-time lovers, yeah)
(More than, more than lovers)
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Outro]
Can you hear me? S.O.S
Help me put my mind to rest
Get, get away
I'm no good, I am poison
Leave, leave me be, leave me be

There'll come a time
You'll appreciate my rhyme
There's no tomorrow, no tomorrow

All around, and I see into you
All around
Living in a glass house
My Disease
I know everything about you, dear
Living in a glass house

There'll...

[Verse 1]
First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I could do no wrong
(Oh-oh)
Carry, carry, carry
Me up, me up, me up, me up
Carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on
Love's gonna lift me up, me up, me up, me up...

[Drop]
Love's gonna lift me up
Love's gonna lift me up (Love)
Love's gonna lift me up (Love)

[Bridge]
Up, up, up, up, up

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You are laughing with yo' friends
I keep mobbin' with my kin
Back and forth, don't let them niggas in
I know some things some niggas don't
You are laughing with yo' friends
I keep mobbin' with my kin
Back and forth, don't let them niggas in
I know some things they don't

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
On that cheap scale
Movin' back and forth like a refill
Something 'bout the niggas that can't be helped
All you niggas moving like some cheap stuff
Need a free

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
I rolled double you gon' have to pick me up
And should I die on the way, I hope to God to pick me up
Oh yes I match what I'm feeling, you gon' have to add it up
Some say they really know themselves, I'm still a stranger to myself
Wildin' by the pool house, come and bring your shoot out
Who that spilling Kool-Aid? Ain't yo' body 

[?]
I can't see the distance, I should keep it off me
But you're such a 

[?]
Fifth six in a foreign ceiling
Up at nights, I'm a bad boy
Reel 'em in with some catnip
Moving quick like an asteroid
Still sipping through the mixed feelings
Still goin' through the pages
Hanging on, a lil' dangerous, hanging on, a lil' dangerous

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
Real big shoes to fill
I learned the bigger the house, you know the bigger the bills
And like Beyoncé say it's always bills, bills, bills
That's how I feel, feel, feel
I send my money and love, but I ain't been home in years
I know my momma is good, I know my daddy is lonely
He be holding the phone and don't say shit when he call me
(That's all I have, it's-it's alright)

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon & Kevin Abstract]
Go ahead and walk away (Hey, hey, hey!)
You and I both hurt, these sins don't wash away (Hey, hey, hey!)
I don't really wanna talk today (Hey, hey, hey!)
Never have enough time when I start to have a lot to say (Hey, hey, hey!)
It's complicated, conversations, uncomfortable, secretive
Too scared of myself, too scared of the truth
Would I fail if I

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Suddenly left me again

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I wanna minimize
I want a moment to remember time
I want a friend of mine
So crazy to me, life is still wintertime, wintertime
Wintertime when I was 

[?]
Tripping off, fucking up every coat
All of my niggas that left me broke
All of my brothers, I feel like I'm home

[Verse: Dom McLennon]
Wintertime, wintertime
Remember when you were a friend of mine?
Remember when we couldn't get in line?
Now we the reason why they in the line
Wintertime, wintertime, wintertime
Cold tray like you do the drops
And raise the skies I need new socks
Cause I'm walking out with no shoes on, yeah
Wintertime, wintertime, wintertime

Wintertime, wintertime
The sky is fallin'
The sky is fallin'

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
I ain't never made of nothin'
I'm always hittin' the change button
My publicist said "Say nothing"
Just to keep me out of trouble
I ain't never made of nothin'
I'm always hittin' the change button
My publicist said "Say nothing"
Just to keep me out of trouble (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Just to keep me out of trouble, ah
Last year we hit a double, ah
Told my niggas add another, yah
Shit was smooth, no fumble, yah (Ooh)
Then I dropped when we tussled, ah
Back then when we struggled, ah
No one cared about the juggle, ah
Can you see me, ee?

[Chorus: JOBA]
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
All these voices on the sidelines
Feel like doubting lies, like what's in my head
Difference is a year ago, they were not there
Difference is a year ago, they did not care
Difference is a year ago, nobody felt like they would have to tell me, "Don't forget where you come from"
But I loved my city when they didn't love me
Ain't it funny when you in that conundrum?
I ain't one for all of your corruption, nigga
I don't move at your presumptions, nigga
Now we ride your repercussions, nigga
Do we look like fuckin' stuntmen, nigga?
I ain't gone, I ain't function, nigga
I was overdue for an eruption, nigga
You ain't even have the heart to face me when your problems changed me
Go fucking figure

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Just to keep me out of trouble, ah
Last year we hit a double, ah
Told my niggas add another, yah
Shit was smooth, no fumble, yah
Then I dropped when we tussled, ah
Back then when we struggled, ah
No one cared about the juggle, ah
Can you see me, ee?

[Chorus: JOBA]
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
I woke up on tour bus
I woke up on aeroport
Man I really dropped out
With no promise this would work
Man, I really dropped out
With no promisin', promisin', promisin', promisin'
You an astonishment! You an astonishment!
Look at my conglomerates, look at what we did
They said we was kids, was tryin' to live
Instead we made millions, boy I'm resilient
Boy we made millions, boy we made millions, boy we made millions

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Now we ain't gotta wait 'til devil
Big guilt cop over the sinner
To Ruby set black through the canyon
I spit on memory lane
Our lovin' is all that remains
Dust off and I'm keepin' my pace
I'm talkin' to wind today
Chalk it up, it's weird today
My momma pop bottles, it went to the roof
Laughin' and smilin', now keep it on loop
Food for all of my wounds
In times of solitude

[Chorus: JOBA]
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down

[Verse 4: Matt Champion, JOBA, Kevin Abstract, JOBA and Kevin Abstract]
I'ma work it out in my lifetime
Wouldn't trade it all in my right mind
I'm too drunk tonight, pack a punch, I might take a bullet for you
(That one day someone--)
To be truthful, I'd hate on me too
'Cause no one deserves what I want, no one is worthy
I'm selfish as fuck, I know that it's wrong
At least I admit it, I wish that I didn't
I don't know why I do it, always had the feeling
That one day someone would listen, listen
Maybe this route ain't what it's made out to be
Even though I wanted it forever
Never in my life has it been so hard to be
Maybe I could be better, maybe I would do better
If it wasn't so hard to be myself
When you get to shinin', they'd rather see you dying, nobody likes it

[Outro]
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
All the people who have told me
That love will make me whole
Love was with them in the moment
Another mistake on my part
I'm no savior in heart or in mind

The deals people make and the love people trade
Is this an art or a business venture?
Is your contest one I can enter?
I'm not expecting any love
But just give me some fun in return

I don't need my words revised
By all these blue-faced, red-penned writers
She lifts the weight, I feel much lighter
But is interaction lacking pain or passion worth the time?

I need to find better ways
To fill all these empty chairs
I need some more disarray
I need lots more love to share
My patience left me in May
I haven't heard from him since
But if you've got more to say
I can tell him he's needed
She's got some pretty new friends
They make her angry sometimes
If they take her clothes again
She is gonna lose her mind
I don't think I should still be concerned with her social life
But while she's clenching her teeth
My tongue will hide behind mine

[Intro]
Is it on?

[Verse 1]
I won't fool around no more
I promise
Even when I get bored
I promise
Even when your bed is cold
I promise
Even when I get bored

I won't fool around no more
I promise
I know which side to scope

Even when the ship is wrecked

Tie me to the rotting deck

I won't fool around no more
I promise
Even when the bed is cold

Even when the ship is wrecked
I promise
I won't fool around again

I won't run away again

Lift

[Verse 1]
This is the place
Sit down, you’re safe now
You’ve been stuck in a lift
We’ve been trying to reach you, Thom
This is the place
It won’t hurt ever again

[Chorus]
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Empty all your pockets
Because it’s time to come home

[Verse 2]
This is the place
Remember me? I’m that face you always see
You’ve been stuck in a lift
In the belly of a whale at the bottom of the ocean

[Chorus]
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up

[Intro]
Electioneering

[Verse 1]
I will stop, I will stop at nothing
Say the right things when electioneering
I trust I can rely on your vote

[Chorus]
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
Ah-ha-ha

[Verse 2]
Riot shields, voodoo economics
Give me one, gimme one of your prices
I trust I can rely on your vote

[Chorus]
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
Eh-hey-hey

Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, turn it on
Turn it frickin' on
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, turn it on
Turn it frickin' on
Ah

Thank you

[Verse 1]
The unacceptable face of
The docile and the good
That crawls into the box with
Anyone at all
Rejoicing to come
And no working this out
I don't want it to hurt
I don't want it go
But if we stand up they'll
Mow us down again

[Verse 2]
I don't want it to stand but
Sorrow's in my head
I don't want it to stay but
I may as well be dead
I know what I want, baby
I know what I want, baby
I know what I want and it is
It's written in your head and
If we stand up they'll
Mow us down again

[Verse 3]
The unacceptable face of
The docile and the good
The unacceptable face of
The smiling brotherhood
The joy of the uprising
The action into the chain
An action with some meaning
A brief release of hope
And if we stand up they'll
Mow us down again

[Outro]
La la la la la la la

In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
An airbag saved my life

[Chorus]
An interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe

[Verse 2]
In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the un-
