ing is better when you come home and stay

[Bridge 2]
Whatever's more important to you
You've got to choose what you wanna do
Whatever's more important to be
That's the view that you've gotta see

[Verse 2]
There is a long way between chaos and creation
If you don't say which one of these you're gonna choose
It's a long way, and in every contradiction
Seems to say it's a game that you're bound to lose

[Bridge 1]
Come home brother, all is forgiven
We all cried when you were driven away
Come home brother, everything is better
Everything is better when you come home and stay

[Interlude]
Come on back, come on back
Come on back to me

[Outro]
It's a fine line
It's a fine line
Whatever's more important to you (It's a fine line)
You got to choose what you want to do
Whatever's more important to be (It's a fine line)
That's the thing that you've gotta see
It's a fine line
It's a fine line
It's a fine line
It's a fine line
It's a fine line
It's a fine line

[Verse 1]
How kind of you to think of me
When I was out of sorts
It really meant a lot to be
In someone else's thoughts
Someone else's mind
Someone else as kind as you

[Verse 2]
The thoughtfulness you showed has made
A difference in my life
I won't forget how unafraid
You were that long dark night
I thought that all was lost
I thought I'd never find
A someone quite as kind as you
I thought my faith had gone
I thought there couldn't be
A someone who was there for me

[Verse 3]
How kind of you to stick by me
During the final bout
And listen to the referee
As I was counted out
I thought my time was up
I thought I'd never find
A someone quite as kind as you
I thought my faith had gone
I thought there couldn't be
A someone who was there for me

[Outro]
How kind of you to think of me
How kind of you

[Verse 1]
Like so many girls, Jenny Wren could sing
But a broken heart took her song away
Like the other girls, Jenny Wren took wing
She could see the world and its foolish ways

[Chorus]
How we spend our days casting love aside
Losing sight of life day by day

[Verse 2]
She saw poverty breaking up her home
Wounded warriors took her song away

[Duduk Solo]

[Verse 3]
But the day will come, Jenny Wren will sing
When this broken world mends its foolish ways

[Chorus]
Then we'll spend our days catching up on life
All because of you, Jenny Wren
You saw who we are, Jenny Wren

[Verse 1]
At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy road
Who can handle such a heavy load?
At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy day
We can think of nothing more to say

[Bridge 1]
If you show me love, I won't refuse
I know you'd never make me choose
Between the love I've got and the love I'd lose
Sometimes I'd rather run and hide
Than stay and face the fear inside

[Verse 2]
At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy day
Who can bear to turn their head away?
At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy road
We can watch the universe explode

[Bridge 2]
If you take me up, I won't say no
I guess you'd rather see me grow
Into a better man than the one you know
Sometimes my head is hanging low
It's time to get on with the show

[Verse 3]
At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy day
I can think of nothing more to say

[Intro]
Looking through the backyard of my life
Time to sweep the fallen leaves away

[Bridge 1]
Like the sun that rises every day
We can chase the dark clouds from the sky

[Verse 1]
I gave my promise to you girl
I don't wanna take it back
You and me, side by side
We know how to change the world
That is why I gave my promise to you girl

[Verse 2]
Hey, why wait another day?
That won't get us anywhere
All the time that it takes
To repair this brave old world
Will be ours, I gave my promise to you girl

[Bridge 2]
Every single second of our lives
We can use to chase the clouds away

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, there's no more barking up the tree
No more howling at the moon
They won't see you and I
Diving for the deepest buck
That is why I gave my promise to you girl

[Outro]
Looking through the backyard of my life
Time to sweep the fallen leaves away

[Verse 1]
I've been waiting on the other side
For your friends to leave so I don't have to hide
I prefer they didn't know
So I've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to go

[Verse 2]
I've been sliding down a slippery slope
I've been climbing up a slowly burning rope
But the flame is getting low
I've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to go

[Bridge]
You never need to worry about me, I'll be fine on my own
Someone else can worry about me
I've spent a lot of time on my own
I've spent a lot of time on my own

[Verse 2]
I've been waiting till the danger passed
I don't know how long the storm is going to last
If we're going to carry on
I'll be waiting on the other side, till your friends are gone
So tell me what I want to know
I'll be waiting on the other side, for your friends to go

[Bridge]
Someone else can worry about me
I've spent a lot of time on my own
I've spent a lot of time on my own

[Verse 3]
I've been waiting on the other side
For your friends to leave so I don't have to hide
I prefer they didn't know
So I've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to go

[Outro]
I've been waiting on the other side
I've been waiting on the other side
For your friends to go

[Verse 1]
Would you care to sit with me
For a cup of English tea?
Very twee, very me
Any sunny morning

What a pleasure it would be
Chatting so delightfully
Nanny bakes fairy cakes
Every Sunday morning

[Bridge]
Miles of miles of English garden
Stretching past the willow tree
Lines of hollyhocks and roses
Listen most attentively

[Verse 2]
Do you know the game croquet?
Peradventure we might play
Very gay, hip hooray
Any sunny morning

[Bridge]
Miles of miles of English garden
Stretching past the willow tree
Lines of hollyhocks and roses
Listen most attentively

[Verse 3]
As a rule the church bells chime
When it's almost supper time
Nanny bakes fairy cakes
On a Sunday morning

[Verse 1]
Laugh, when your eyes are burning
Smile, when your heart is filled with pain
Sigh, as you brush away your sorrow
Make a vow, that's it's not going to happen again

[Chorus]
It's not right, in one life
Too much rain

[Verse 2]
You know the wheels keep turning
Why do the tears run down your face?
We use to hide away our feelings
But for now, tell yourself it won't happen again

[Chorus]
It's not right, in one life
Too much rain

[Bridge]
It's too much for anyone, too hard for anyone
Who wants a happy and peaceful life
You've gotta learn to laugh

[Verse 3]
Smile, when you're spinning 'round and 'round
Sigh, as you think about tomorrow
Make a vow, that you're gonna be happy again

[Chorus]
It's all right, in your life
No more rain

[Bridge]
It's too much for anyone, too hard for anyone
Who wants a happy and peaceful life
You've gotta learn to laugh

[Verse 1]
A certain softness in her eyes fascinates me
More than I ever thought it would (A certain softness)
More than I ever thought it could
A certain softness in her eyes
Got me hooked
Got me hooked

[Verse 2]
A kind of sadness in her smile captivates me
Surer than anything that's sure (A kind of sadness)
Surer than anything before
A kind of sadness in her smile
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
Got me hooked

[Bridge]
If I could even find the words to tell her
I wouldn't want to anyway
'Cause that would only break the spell
And you know very well I couldn't betray her

[Verse 3]
A touch of wildness in her style haunts my memory
More than I ever thought it would (A touch of wildness)
More than I ever thought it could
A touch of wildness in her style
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
Got me hooked

[Verse 1]
A certain softness in her eyes fascinates me
More than I ever thought it would (A certain softness)
More than I ever thought it could
A certain softness in her eyes
Got me hooked
Got me hooked

[Verse 1]
I bit my tongue
I never talked too much, I tried to be so strong
I did my best
I used the gentle touch, I've done it for so long
You put me down
But I can laugh it off and act like nothing's wrong
But why pretend?
I think I've heard enough of your familiar song

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell you what I'm going to do
I'll try to take my mind off you
And now that you don't need my help
I'll use the time to think about myself

[Verse 2]
You're not aware
Of what you put me through but now the feeling's gone
But I don't mind
Do what you have to do, you don't fool anyone

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell you what I'm going to do
I'll take a different point of view
And now that you don't need my help
I'll use the time to think about myself

[Chorus 1]
The definition of friendship
Apparently ought to be
Showing support for the one that you love
And I was open to friendship
But you didn't seem to have any to spare
While you were riding to Vanity Fair

[Verse 3]
There was a time
When every day was young, the sun would always shine
We sang along
When all the songs were sung, believing every line

[Chorus 2]
That's the trouble with friendship
For someone to feel it
It has to be real or it wouldn't be right
I keep hoping for friendship
But I wouldn't dare to presume it was there
While you were riding to Vanity Fair

[Outro]
While you were riding to Vanity Fair
While you were riding to Vanity Fair
While you were riding to Vanity Fair

[Verse  1]
You lift up my spirits, you shine on my soul
Whenever I'm empty, you make me feel whole
I can rely on you to guide me through any situation
You hold up a sign that reads "Follow me"

[Verse 2]
You give me directions, you show me the way
You give me a reason to face every day
I can depend on you to send me to any destination
You hold up a sign that reads "Follow me", "Follow me"

[Bridge]
Down the track of loneliness, down the path of love
Through the woods of heartache, to the end
On the shores of sorrow, where the waves of hope crash in
The perfect place for me to find a friend

[Verse 3]
You lead me to places that I've never been
Uncovering secrets that I've never seen
I can rely on you to guide me through any situation
You hold up a sign that reads "Follow me", "Follow me"

[Outro]
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me

[Verse 1]
I'm very sure
This never happened to me before
I met you, and now I'm sure
This never happened before

[Verse 2]
Now I see
This is the way it's supposed to be
I met you, and now I see
This is the way it should be

[Chorus]
This is the way it should be for lovers
They shouldn't go it alone
It's not so good when you're on your own

[Verse 3]
So come to me
Now we can be what we want to be
I love you, and now I see
This is the way it should be
This is the way it should be

[Chorus]
This is the way it should be for lovers
They shouldn't go it alone
It's not so good when you're on your own

[Verse 1]
I'm very sure
This never happened to me before
I met you, and now I'm sure
This never happened before (This never happened before)
This never happened before (This never happened before)
This never happened before (This never happened before)

[Verse 1]
If you love me, won't you call me?
I've been waiting, waiting too long
In my soul is constant yearning
Always singing, singing this song

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Only love is strong enough to take it on the chin
When did I begin to fall?

[Chorus]
Anyway, anyway
You can make that call
You feel free to make yourself at home

[Verse 2]
If we could be closer longer
That would help me, help me so much
We can cure each other's sorrow
Won't you please, please, please get in touch?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If our love is strong enough, it may never end
Why would I pretend to fall?

[Chorus]
Anyway, anyway
You can make that call
You feel free to make yourself
At home

[Outro]
Anyway, anyway
Anyway at all
Anyway you can make that call

[Chorus]
Though is so beautiful, but she is so fine
Yes she is so beautiful and she says, she's mine

[Verse 1]
For her face that shines, in the morning glow
And the outside world, will never know
What she means to me, and what I owe to her

[Chorus]
But she is so beautiful, she is so devine
Yes she is so beautiful, and she's mine, she's mine

[Verse 2]
She can make me smile, as we start the day
And to hear her laugh, takes my breath away
Will I ever find, any words to say to her

[Chorus]
Though is so beautiful, but she is so fine
Yes she is so beautiful, and she's mine, she says, she's mine

[Intro]
Whoa 

[x3]
Can't believe it
Super Dope 

[x4], so strong
Hey hey, I can't believe it
Whoa whoa, where are you going
Give me the money I'm never gone come back
Super Dope, blast off

[Hook]
I'm smoking super dope, give me a million I'm on a boat
I stand on the stage, and I don't choke (pause)
I'm smoking a blunt, right under my nose
I cash out the store, nigga you know
I step in the block, and you won't
I'm taking a mil, I ship to New York
I'm buying the kicks, I shut down the store

[Verse 1]
Ferragamo fendi, I got plenty
Run up on me, hit you with the semi
In the maybach, feeling like I'm diddy
And this versace is super silky
I'm smoking super dope, Soulja Boy the king
And I fucked your girlfriend, it's not a thing
Smoking blunt after blunt, in my mansion
Got a lot of blunts, cause my diamonds dancing
If you run up on me, I'm a shoot like Larry
Riding in bugatti, man they staring
Pull up to the club in a Mclaren
I got ice from my chain to my earring

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When I pull up in that foreign, they say Soulja slow down
Got the AK on me, it'll go down
Got a lot of money, yeah you know we got bankroll
I got niggas that hold me, and Simpson Road
And then Lil 100 pull up in that Porsche, like whoa
Had a lot of girls, they already they know
A'int even got to tell them, they know
She want the molly she want the drink, she smoke
She smoking, she fucking, she sucking, I'm rollin, I'm ridin
I feel like supplying the islands, I go to the air with aliens talking Australian
My plug he looking Caucasian, but really he from Italy
The diamonds they came from cicely, a million

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I will leave a wallpaper life
And run away to the foreign legion
I would leave a wallpaper life
And run away to the foreign legion
As the tanks roll into town
As the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
As the tanks roll into town
As the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you

[Chorus]
I don't know why I feel so tongue tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive

[Verse 2]
Run until your lungs are sore
Until you cannot feel it anymore
Run until your lungs are sore
Until you find an open door
I build you up to pull you down
Tie you to your feet and watch you drown
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
I build you up to pull you down
Tie you to the stake and watch you burn in hell
In hell

[Chorus]
I don't know why I feel so tongue tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive

[Outro]
I'll find another skin to wear
I'll find another skin to wear

[Verse 1]
Back in the days of shock and awe
We came to liberate them all
History was the cruel judge of overconfidence
Back in the days of shock and awe

[Verse 2]
Back in the days of "Mission accomplished"
Our chief was landing on the deck
The sun was setting on a golden photo op
Back in the days of "Mission accomplished"

[Verse 3]
Thousands of bodies in the ground
Brought home in boxes to a trumpet's sound
No one sees them coming home that way
Thousands buried in the ground

[Verse 4]
Thousands of children scarred for life
Millions of tears for a soldier's wife
Both sides are losing now, Heaven takes them in
Thousands of children scarred for life

[Verse 5]
We had a chance to change our mind
But somehow wisdom was hard to find
We went with what we knew and now we can't go back
But we had a chance to change our mind
When you try to bring our spirit home
Won't you celebrate our lives
In a way that's right for our children
And families

When you write your songs about us
Won't you try to do us justice
Because we want to be just like you
And your families

I see a light ahead
There's a chill wind blowing in my head
I wish that I was home instead
With my family

There's a universe between us now
But I want to reach our and tell you how
Much you mean to me
And my family

I'm going back to the USA
I just got my ticket today
I can't wait to see you again
In the USA

[Intro]

[Verse 2]
How would it feel to never find love
Where would we be if we lose love?
How would we feel without love
How would we feel without love?
Take love away and we are lost if love is gone
Take love away we are ruined without our love
In a world without each other
How would we go on living our lives?
Where would we be without each other
How could we go on
How could we dare to face each other
How could we carry on?
Where could we run to
Where would we hide
Where could we run to
Where would we hide
Where could we run to - hide?
Our love, our love

Of a state of grace
In the saddest face
Something is there

How the rivers flow
We may never know
But it goes to show
Something is there

[Chorus 3]
This guiding light
Will burn so bright
So much wonder around us
All the love in the air
Let the good that surrounds us
Help us to always care

[Chorus 4]
Then the seeds we sow
Will survive and grow
And we all will know
Something is there

[Chorus 3]

[Verse 1]
In this world where ever present dangers
Circle round our family heart
Like a throng of hostile strangers eager for a war to start
There appears a friend's familiar face
Oh sweet relief, the heart goes to a warmer place

[Chorus 5]

[x2]
And this we prize
And this we hold so dear
This humble state of grace

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Verse 2]
Life aboard this fast revolver still remains a magic mystery
Loud reports of anger fill the pages of our history
Those of us with love can now embrace
With sweet relief a life lived at a gentler pace

[Chorus 5]

[x2]

[Verse 3]
In the night a daffodil
Is battered by the father of all storms
Daybreak sees it stand alone
Amongst a field of lifeless forms
Rays of light illuminate
Where sweet relief presents a shining yellow face

[Chorus 5]

Help to reveal my inner light
Inner Light

Into the light where we belong
Into the wrmth of your sweet song
We belong in the light of your song

Flowing deep and warm
Still it brings a special glow
To this heart of mine
For it means so much

Now music to lull us to sleep
Now lull us to sleep
Music to wake us from a dream

Take us into the light
Notice how gently we spin
Here on the skin of a sphere
Music to lull us to sleep
First music to lull us to sleep
Music to wake us from a dream

[Chorus 3]
Notice how gently we spin
Here on the skin of a sphere
Music to lull us to sleep
Music to wake us from a dream

[Chorus 4]
Whether we are strong or we are weak
Whether we are foolish or are wise
We all seek the treasures of love
We all seek the pleasures of love

[Bridge]
Music is the servant of the Queen and King
Who are happy if we smile but are delighted if we sing

[Chorus 4]
Whether we are strong or are weak
Whether we are foolish or we are wise
We all seek the treasures hidden within love
We all seek the pleasures of love
Music is the treasure that we all can bring
We are happy if we smile
But are delighted when we sing

[Chorus 4]
Whether we are strong or are weak
Whether we are foolish or wise
Ah treasures of love
We all seek the treasures of love
Ah pleasures of love
We all seek the pleasures of love
Ah love, treasures of love
Music is the treasure that we all can bring
And we are happy when we smile delighted when we sing

[Chorus 1]
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
There in the future we may be apart
Here in my music I show you my heart

[Chorus 1]
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
There in the future we may be apart
Here in my music I show you my heart

[Chorus 1]
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
When in the future we are apart
Music will show you my heart
If in the future we are apart
Music will show you my heart

[Chorus 1]
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
In the future we may be apart
Here in my music I show you my heart
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
Ecce Cor Meum
Show you my heart
Music will show you my heart

[Verse 1]
Truth is only reality
Nature truly is what we are
Peace is only nature at rest
Love is our true nature
Love is All
Truth and nature bring us peace and love
Love is our true nature
Love is all
Love is our true nature
Love is All
Peace and Love are all we long for
Peace and Love
Truth is only reality
Nature truly is what we are
Peace and Love are always our true nature
Love is all
Human nature, our true nature
Love at peace with nature
Human nature, human nature
Therefore everyone of us
Has to find a strong foundation for a love
Help us find a strong foundation for our love
Although life sometimes is hard we still pull through
Without truth false shades nothing else remains

[x2]
But still we are able to pull through
Even though we may have nothing else
Nothing ever remains
And then our positive feelings are threatened
Unless we can pull through
To the opposite side
Nothing else remains

[Verse 1]
I'm not a rat to be spat on, locked up in this room
Those bars that look towards the sun
At night look towards the moon
Everyday the swallows play in the clouds of love
Make me wish that I had wings, take me high above

[Chorus]
And I looked high, saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place

[Verse 2]
At night I lay upon my bench and stare towards the stars
The cold night air comes creeping in and home seems, oh, so far
If only I could swing upon those twinkling dots above
I'd look down from the heavens upon the ones I love

[Chorus]
And I looked high, saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place, fly!

[Chorus]
And I looked high, saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place, yeah

[Verse 3]
Hey, the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck
Some luck I ever got with you and I wouldn't like to bet
That sooner or later you'll own just one half of this land
By shining your eyes on the wealth of every man, yeah

[Chorus]
And I looked high and saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place
Fly on

[Outro]
Just send up my love, ain't seen nothing but tears
Now I've got myself in this room for years
I don't see no one, I never see anyone
Anyone, ah yeah
Oh
Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo
Oh-ho-ho
Woo, yeah
I said get down with it, babe
I want you to shh...
Right down now, right down now
Ah...
Oh... get on now
Get on up now

[Verse 1]
The seadogs have all sailed their ships
Into the docks of dawn
While the sirens sit and comb their hair
And twiddle with their thumbs
Oh Thor above the mountain
Look down upon your children
This is their heaven where they're told
To bring their galleons
Seek you find your place with me
Men of iron, men of steel
Only the brave hear the hammers ring
In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings

[Chorus]
You can come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
Come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala

[Verse 2]
There's long boats in the harbor
Which arrive there every hour
With the souls of the heroes
Whose blood lies on the flowers
And this heaven is the home
Of every man who loves his sword
And he uses it for freedom
To preach the word of Thor
Seek you find your place with me
Men of iron, men of steel
Only the brave hear the hammers ring
In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings

[Chorus]
You can come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
Come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
Val-hala
Val-hala
Val-hala

[Verse 1]
You're not a ship to carry my life
You are nailed to my love in many lonely nights
I've strayed from the cottages and found myself here
For I need your love your love protects my fears

[Chorus]
And I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
And I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold

[Verse 2]
Did you paint your smile on, well, I said I knew
That my reason for living was for loving you
We're related in feeling but you're high above
You're pure and you're gentle with the grace of a dove

[Chorus]
And I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
And I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold

[Verse 1]
It's hard to feel what's in your head
Where the gas lamps grow
And the garbage blows
Around the paper stands
And a baby cried
And I saw a light
And I wondered where
And I wondered why
There'd be a loss of life
Down here tonight

[Chorus x2]
Down on Western Ford Gateway
That's a place where the dead say
That a man lives no more
That his fair share of days
Down on Western Ford Gateway

[Verse 2]
It flowed upon the cobbled floor
For the bottle's dead
And they're drunk again
By the tavern door
And a baby cried
And I saw a light
And I wondered where
And I wondered why
There'd be a loss of life
Down here tonight

[Chorus x2]
Down on Western Ford Gateway
That's a place where the dead say
That a man lives no more
That his fair share of days
Down on Western Ford Gateway

[Verse 1]
If you feel that it's real, I'm on trial
And I'm here, yeah, in your prison
Like a coin in your mint
I am dented and I'm spent with high treason

[Pre-Chorus]
Through a glass eye, your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul

[Chorus]
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger

[Post-Chorus]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na

[Verse 2]
Well, I know he's not old
And I'm told, and I'm told he's a virgin
Or he may be she
What I'm told is never, never for certain

[Pre-Chorus]
Through a glass eye, your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger

[Post-Chorus]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na

[Pre-Chorus]
Through a glass eye, your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul

[Chorus]
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger

[Post-Chorus]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na

[Outro]
(Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na)
Take me, take me, oh, oh
(Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na)
Take me, take me, yeah, yeah
(Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na)
Take me, take me, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na)
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na

[Verse 1]
From this day on I own my father's gun
We dug his shallow grave beneath the sun
I laid his broken body down below the southern land
It wouldn't do to bury him where any Yankee stands
I'll take my horse and I'll ride the Northern plain
To wear the colour of the greys and join the fight again
I will not rest until I know the cause is fought and won
From this day on until I die I'll wear my father's gun

[Chorus]
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
So slip us a rope and sail on round the bend

[Verse 2]
As soon as this is over we'll go home
To plant the seeds of justice in our bones
To watch the children growing and see the women sewing
There'll be laughter when the bells of freedom ring

[Chorus]
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company, it needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
Oh
I'd like to know where the riverboat, the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
I'd like to know where the riverboat, the riverboat
The riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said now, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend

[Outro]
(The riverboat sails tonight)
(That's just fine alright)
Oh, slip us a rope
Sail on round, sail on round, sail on round, sail on round
(Sail)
Sail on round the bend
(The riverboat sails tonight)
Oh, I said
That's just fine alright

[Verse 1]
Lady love rides a big red Cadillac
Buys the hoedown show salt and beans
Goes to church to pray for Lucifer
She milked the male population clean

[Chorus]
So ride in line, shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise

[Verse 2]
Come on down, come on down from the ladder
Henry get your head, get your head out of them clouds
What she wants is to go kissing on a swine herd
You might as well kiss the boss man's cow

[Chorus]
So ride in line, shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
All those city women want to make us poor men
And this land's got the worse for the worrying
Yeah, I got married at the early age of fourteen
And I've been worrying about the way you'll be loving them

[Chorus]
Yeah, so ride in line, shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise, oh, yeah
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise, yeah, oh

[Verse 1]
I was one as you were one
And we were two so much in love forever
I loved the white socks that you wore
But you don't wear white socks no more, now you're a woman
I joked about your turned-up nose
And criticized your school girl clothes
But would I then have paced these roads to love you

[Chorus]
For seasons come and seasons go
Bring forth the rain the sun and snow
Make Valerie a woman
And Valerie is lonely

[Verse 2]
No more to roam on the snow hills of Hienton
Undecided with the guardians of the older generation
A doormat was a sign of welcome
In the winter months to come
And in the summer laughing
Through the castle ruins we'd run
For the quadrangle sang to the sun
And the grace of our feeling
And the candle burned low as we talked of the future
Underneath the ceiling
There were tears in the sky
And the clouds in your eyes, they were just cover
For your thighs were the cushions
Of my love and yours for each other

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The songs still are sung
It was fun to be young
But please don't be sad where ever you are
I am who I am
You are who you are

[Outro]
Now Valerie's a woman
Now Valerie's a woman
Now Valerie's a woman

[Verse 1]
Who'll walk me down to church
When I'm sixty years of age
When the ragged dog they gave me
Has been ten years in the grave
And señorita play guitar
Play it just for you
My rosary has broken
And my beads have all slipped through

[Verse 2]
You've hung up your great coat and
You've laid down your gun
You know the war you fought in
Wasn't too much fun

[Chorus]
And the future you're giving me
Holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living
Sixty years on

[Verse 3]
Yes, I'll sit with you and talk
Let your eyes relive again
I know my vintage prayers
Would be very much the same
And Magdelena plays the organ
Plays it just for you
Your choral lamp that burns so low
When you are passing through

[Chorus]
And the future you're giving me
Holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living
Sixty years on

[Verse]
Peering out of tiny eyes
The grubby hands that gripped the rail
Wiped the window clean of frost
As the morning air laid on the latch
A whistle awakened someone there
Next door to the nursery just down the hall
A strange new sound you never heard before
A strange new sound that makes boys explore
Tread neat so small those little feet
Amid the morning his small heart beats
So much excitement yesterday
That must be rewarded, must be displayed
Large hands lift him through the air
Excited eyes contain him there
The eyes of those he loves and knows
But what's this extra bed just here
His puzzled head tipped to one side
Amazement swims in those bright green eyes
Glancing down upon this thing
That make strange sounds, strange sounds that sing
In those silent happy seconds
That surround the sound of this event
A parent's smile is made in moments
They have made for you a friend
And all you ever learned from them
Until you grew much older
Did not compare with when they said
This is your brand new brother

[x3]

[Chorus]
Have you ever lived in a cage
Where you live to be whipped and be tamed?
For I've never loved in a cage
Or talked to a friend or just waved
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha

[Verse 1]
Well, I walk while they talk about virtue
Just raised on my back legs and snarled
Watched you kiss your old daddy with passion
And tell dirty jokes as he died
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha

[Verse 2]
But I'm damned when I really care there
For the cellar's the room in your lives
Where you lace yourself with bad whiskey
And close the cage doors on your life
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Well I pray while you bathe in bad water
Sing songs that I learnt as a boy
Then breaks all the bones in my body
On the bars you can never destroy
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha

[Chorus]
Have you ever lived in a cage
Where you live to be whipped and be tamed?
For I've never loved in a cage
Or talked to a friend or just waved
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha

[Outro]
Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, ah-ha
Oh-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, ah-ha

[Verse 1]
No man's a jester playing Shakespeare
'Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon
The crown that you once wore
And sooner or later
Everybody's kingdom must end
And I'm so afraid your courtiers
Cannot be called best friends

[Chorus]
Caesar's had your troubles
Widows had to cry
While mercenaries in cloisters sing
And the king must die

[Verse 2]
Some men are better staying sailors
Take my word and go
But tell the ostler that his name was
The very first they chose
And if my hands are stained forever
And the altar should refuse me, yeah
Would you let me in, would you let me in, would you let me in?
Should I cry sanctuary?

[Chorus]
Caesar's had your troubles
Widows had to cry
While mercenaries in cloisters sing
And the king must die, yeah!
The king must die
The king must die, oh, yeah

[Bridge]
No man's a jester playing Shakespeare
'Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon
The crown that you once wore
The king is dead
The king is dead
The king is dead
The king is dead

[Outro]
Long live the king

[Verse 1]
Gulliver's gone to the final command of his master
His watery eyes had washed all the hills with his laughter
And the seasons can change all the light from the grey to the dim
But the light in his eyes will see no more so bright
As the sheep that he locked in the pen

[Chorus]
There's four feet of ground in front of the barn
That's sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm
But now it lies empty so cold and so bare
Gulliver's gone but his memory lies there

[Verse 2]
By passing the doors of his life was a stage I remember
And in later years he would cease to bare teeth to a stranger
For sentiment touched him as Cyclamen holds him
And later men came from the town
Who said clear the child this won't take a while
And Gulliver's gone with the dawn

[Chorus]
There's four feet of ground in front of the barn
That's sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm
But now it lies empty so cold and so bare
Gulliver's gone but his memory lies there

[Verse 1]
It seems as though I've lived my life
On the bad side of the moon
To stir your dregs in sickness still
Without the rustic spoon
Common people live with me
Where the light has never shone
And the hermits flock like a hummingbirds
To speak in a foreign tongue

[Chorus]
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

[Chorus 2]
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life

[Verse 2]
There isn't no need for watchdogs here
To justify our ways
We live our life in manacles
The main cause of our stay
Exiled here from other worlds
My sentence comes too soon
Why should I be made to pay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

[Chorus 1]
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

[Chorus 2]
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life

[Intro with piano lead]

[Verse 1]
Why's it never light on my lawn?
Why does it rain and never say, "Good day" to the newborn?
On the big screen, they showed us a sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one

[Chorus]
And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

[Verse 2]
I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn
If anyone can cry, then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye

[Chorus]
And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

[Verse 3]
Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was reborn before all life could die
The phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the phoenix bird can fly, then so can I

[Chorus]
And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

[Verse 1]
She chose the soft center
And took it to bed with her mother
And the ideal confusion
Was just an illusion
To gain further news of her brother
And the comfort of mother
Was just an appeal for protection
For the cat from next door
Was found later at four
In surgical dissection

[Chorus x2]
And I don't want to be
The son of any freak
Who for a chocolate center
Can take you off the street
For soon they'll plough the desert
And God knows where I'll be
Collecting submarine numbers
On the main street of the sea

[Verse 2]
The Vicar is thicker
And I just can't see through to him
For his cardinal sings
A collection of hymns
And a collection of coins is made after
And who wrote the Bible
Was it Judas or Pilate
Well one cleans his hands
While the other one hangs
But still I continue to stand

[Chorus x2]
And I don't want to be
The son of any freak
Who for a chocolate center
Can take you off the street
For soon they'll plough the desert
And God knows where I'll be
Collecting submarine numbers
On the main street of the sea

[Verse 1]
Look up little brother
Can you see the clover
No not over there
A little bit left and over there
Now look and see the lilac tree
The lily pond, the skylark's song
The open air but no one cares
If branches live and die out there

[Chorus]
Remember when you were nine
And I was ten
We would run into the wood
No we never will again
And Lady, what's tomorrow
What's tomorrow anyway
If it's not the same as now
It's the same as yesterday
Yes Lady, what's tomorrow
Will it be the same as now
Will the farmer push the pen
Will the writer pull the plough

[Verse 2]
Look up little brother
Can you see the clover
Oh sorry but it's over
Now there's concrete and no clover

[Chorus]
Remember when you were nine
And I was ten
We would run into the wood
No we never will, we never will again
And Lady, what's tomorrow
What's tomorrow anyway
If it's not the same as now
It's the same as yesterday
Yes Lady, what's tomorrow
Will it be the same as now
Will the farmer push the pen
Will the writer pull the plough
Oh Lady, what's tomorrow

[Verse 1]
I pulled out my Stage Coach Times
And I read the latest news
I tapped my feet in dumb surprise
And of course I saw they knew
The Pinkertons pulled out my bags
And asked me for my name
I stuttered out my answer
And I hung my head in shame

[Chorus]
Now they've found me
At last, they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
Well, I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

[Verse 2]
Now I've seen this chain gang
Lord, I say let me see my priest
I couldn't have faced your desert sand
Old burning brown backed beast
The poor house they hit me for my kin
And claimed my crumbling walls
Now I know how Reno felt
When he ran from the law

[Chorus]
Now they've found me
At last, they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
Well, I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Now they've found me
Lord I say at last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Lord, I say now they've found me
Well, I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

[Chorus]
Lord, I say, now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
And I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

[Verse 1]
In the quiet silent seconds I, I turned off the light switch
And I, I came down to meet you in the half light the moon left
While a, a cluster of night jars sang some songs out of tune
A mantle of bright light shone down from a room

[Chorus]
"Come down in time", I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
"Come down in time" was the message she gave
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way

[Verse 2]
Well, I don't know if I should have heard her as yet
But a, a true love like hers is a, a hard love to get
And I, I've walked most all the way and I, I ain't heard her call
And I, I'm getting to thinking if she's coming at all

[Chorus]
"Come down in time", I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
"Come down in time" was the message she gave
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way

[Outro]
There are women, women and some hold you tight
While some leave you counting the stars in the night

[Verse 1]
Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
Village children fight each other for a share
And the 6:09 goes roaring past the creek
Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week
I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well, she's really going fine for eighty-four
Well, she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
Poor old girl, she needs a hand to run the farm

[Chorus]
And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comforts in a truck that's going home

[Verse 2]
Down at the well, they got a new machine
The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen
Yeah, but that ain't natural, yeah, well, so old Clay would say
You see, he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

[Chorus]

[x2]
And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comforts in a truck that's going back home

[Verse 3]
Now the old fat goose is flying across the sticks
The hedgehogs done in clay between the bricks
And the rocking chairs are creaking on the porch
Across the valley moves the herdsman with his torch

[Chorus]
And it's good old country comfort in my bones
It's the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comforts in a truck that's going home
Oh, country comforts in a truck that's going back home, yes, it is
Country com-comforts in a truck that's going back home

[Verse 1]
"I'll catch the tram line in the morning
With your leave", Van Bushell said
He had further heard the cock crow
As he stumbled out the shed
Then blind Joseph came towards him
With a shotgun in his arms
He said, "You'll pay me twenty dollars
Before you leave my farm"
Van Bushell saw a hook
Which replaced Joseph's hand
He said, "Now calm you down, my brother
Let's discuss this man to man"
It's no good you getting angry
We must try to act our age
You're pursuing your convictions
Like some hermit in a cage

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the son of your father
You try a little bit harder
Do for me as he would do for you

[Chorus]
With blood and water, bricks and mortar
He built for you a home
You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own

[Verse 2]
Well, slowly Joseph barely lowered the rifle
And he emptied out the shells
Van Bushell, he came towards him
He shook his arm and wished him well
He said, "Now, hey, blind man, that is fine
But I sure can't waste my time
So move aside and let me go my way
I've got a train to ride"
Well, Joseph turned around
His grin was now a frown
He said, "Let me just refresh your mind
Your manners, boy, seem hard to find"

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well there's two men lying dead as nails
On an East Virginia farm
For charity's an argument
That only leads to harm
So be careful when they're kind to you
Don't you end up in the dirt
Just remember what I'm saying to you
And you likely won't get hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the son of your father
Oh, try a little bit harder
You gotta do for me as he would do for you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own
You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own, yeah

[Verse 1]
I viewed in my presence
My hand on my forehead
And sighting the liners
Of mad merchant seamen
In search of the living
Or the spices of China
Lucy walked gently
Between the damp barrels
And shut out my eyes
With the width of her fingers
Said she'd guessed the number
Of bales in the back room

[Chorus x2]
While the seagulls were screaming
Lucy was eating
Then we hauled up our colours
The way the mother had told us
And together we just watched the sails

[Verse 2]
Lucy I said
In a passage of cotton kegs
Can we hold hands
I'm sure that it's warmer
Then the gulls ate the crumbs
Of Lucy's sandwich

[Chorus]
While the seagulls were screaming
Lucy was eating
Then we hauled up our colours
The way the mother had told us
And together we just watched the sails

[Verse 1]
I took myself a blue canoe
And I floated like a leaf
Dazzling, dancing half enchanted
In my Merlin sleep
Crazy was the feeling
Restless were my eyes
Insane, they took the paddles
My arms they paralyzed

[Chorus]
So where to now, St. Peter?
If it's true, I'm in your hands
I may not be a Christian
But I've done all one man can
I understand I'm on the road
Where all that was is gone
So where to now, St. Peter?
Show me which road I'm on
Which road I'm on

[Verse 2]
It took a sweet young foreign gun
This lazy life is short
Something for nothing always ending
With a bad report
Dirty was the daybreak
Sudden was the change
In such a silent place as this
Beyond the rifle range

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I took myself a blue canoe

[Verse 1]
In Orient where wise I was
To please the way I live
Come give the beggar chance at hand
His life is on his lip
Three score a thousand times
Where once in Amazon
Where Eldorado holds the key
No keeper holds my hand

[Pre-Chorus]
Unchain the gate of solitude
The ruler says you run
Run hard unto the scaffold high
Your chance to jump the gun

[Chorus] 

[x2]
Oh how high the scaffold grows
The plant life of your widow
In black lace curtains brought you near
From out the plate glass window

[Verse 2]
The Minotaur with bloody hands
Is enraged by the sun
Caged he by the corpses
Brought forth by the dawn
In Orient is as I told
The buckshee hangman swears
For open crypts to silence
Nylon knots to sway by prayer

[Pre-Chorus]
Unchain the gate of solitude
The ruler says you run
Run hard unto the scaffold high
Your chance to jump the gun

[Chorus] 

[x2]
Oh how high the scaffold grows
The plant life of your widow
In black lace curtains brought you near
From out the plate glass window

[Outro]
In Orient where wise I was
To please the way I live
Come give the beggar chance at hand
His life is on his lip

[Verse 1]
The words I have to say
May well be simple but they're true
Until you give your love
There's nothing more that we can do

[Chorus]
Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No one could offer you more
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?

[Verse 2]
You say it's very hard
To leave behind the life we knew
But there's no other way
And now it's really up to you

[Chorus]
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
You know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen?

[Chorus]
Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No one could offer you more
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?

[Verse 1]
Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway

[Verse 2]
For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors of the world outside
Thinking of the way that the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn from purple into grey

[Pre-Chorus]
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
Fly away again

[Chorus]
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you've left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you've left so very far behind

[Verse 3]
Just let me wake up in the morning to the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die in the brightness of my day
I wanna hear the pealing bells of distant churches sing
But most of all, please free me from this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again

[Chorus]
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the things you've left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the things you've left so very, so very far behind

[Verse 1]
Lately, I've been thinking
How much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in a cornfield
Brightening the daybreak

[Pre-Chorus]
Living like a lusty flower
Running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, oh
Like a puppy, child

[Chorus]
And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other

[Verse 2]
I can see you sitting, eating
Apples in the evening
The fruit juice, flowing slowly, slowly, slowly
Down the bronze of your body

[Pre-Chorus]
Living like a lusty flower
Running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, oh
Like a puppy, child

[Chorus]
And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other

[Verse 3]
Oh, if only I could nestle
In the cradle of your cabin
My arm's around your shoulder, whoa
The window's wide and open
While the swallow and the sycamore, whoa
Are playing in the valley
Oh, I miss you, Amoreena
Like the king bee misses honey

[Chorus]
And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other
And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other, oh

[Outro]
Lately, I've been thinking, oh
How much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in a cornfield
Oh, brightening the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower
Running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, whoa
Like a puppy, like a puppy, child, oh

[Verse 1: Johnny Cash & June Carter]
If I drove a truck
And I were a waitress
And I ordered coffee
And I poured you some
Then you'd stop by on your way sometimes later
And if we arm-wrestled
I'd say that you won

[Chorus: Johnny Cash & June Carter]
I need my baby, ride easy, ride high in the saddle all day
If your loving is good
And your cooking ain't greasy
We’ll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away

[Verse 2: Johnny Cash & June Carter]
If I were a winsome pale senorita
And I a bull-fighter, way down in the sand
While the band kept on playing that Old Paso Doable
Would you throw me a flower
Would you take my hand?

[Chorus: Johnny Cash & June Carter]
I need my baby, ride easy, ride high in the saddle all day
If your loving is good
And your cooking ain't greasy
We’ll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away

[Verse 3: Johnny Cash & June Carter]
If I ran the country
I'd be your first lady and I’d pick up the white house while you were away
Waiting while you’re passing time with world leaders
Left alone together alone we might lay

[Chorus: Johnny Cash & June Carter]
I need my baby, ride easy, ride high in the saddle all day
If your loving is good
And your cooking ain't greasy
We’ll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away
If your loving is good
And your cooking ain't greasy
We’ll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away
We’ll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away (away, away)

[Verse 1]
Why hello, say, can I buy you another glass of beer?
Well, thanks a lot, that's kind of you, it's nice to know you care
These days there's so much going on
No one seems to wanna know
I may be just an old soldier to some
But I know how it feels to grow old

[Verse 2]
Yeah, that's right, you can see me here most every night
You'll always see me staring at the walls and at the lights
Funny, I remember, oh, it's years ago, I'd say
I'd stand at that bar with my friends who've passed away
And drink three times the beer that I can drink today
Yes, I know how it feels to grow old

[Bridge]
I know what they're saying, son
There goes old man Joe again
Well, I may be mad at that I've seen enough
To make a man go out his brains
Well, do they know what it's like to have a graveyard as a friend
'Cause that's where they are, boy, all of them
Don't seem likely I'll get friends like that again, yeah

[Verse 3]
Well, it's time I moved off
But it's been great just listening to you
And I might even see ya next time I'm passing through
You're right, there's so much going on
No one seems to want to know
So keep well, keep well old friend
And have another drink on me
Just ignore all the others
You got your memories
You got your memories

[Verse 1]
You tell me there's an angel in your tree
Did he say he'd come to call on me?
For things are getting desperate in our home
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody now, bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

[Chorus]
Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky
Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside

[Verse 2]
Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today
My wife cried when they came to take me away
But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn, burn, burn, burn, down the mission walls

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody, bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

[Chorus]
Burn down the mission, Lord
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky
Burn down the mission, Lord
If we're gonna stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside

[Verse 1]
We have drifted apart
Broken hearts, me and you
After all of this time
I'm satisfied inside to know
This memory that I had
It's more good than bad
You taught me how to sing
And bring you love

[Chorus]
After all this time
You're still a friend of mine
So I believe in someone
After all

[Verse 2]
Our love didn't last long
What went wrong?
Who's to say?
If you never been by
How then could I
Begin to say

[Chorus]
After all this time
You're still a friend of mine
So I believe in someone
After all
After all this time
You're still a friend of mine
So I believe in someone
After all
That big eight-wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
I'm movin' on, I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high, for my little old sky
And I'm movin' on

That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the southland, we're comin' to you
I'm movin' on, oh, hear my song
You had the laugh on me, now I'm settin' you free
So keep movin' on

Mister fireman, won't you please listen to me
Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll
Keep movin' on

Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattler the fastest in the southern land
It keeps movin' me on, it keeps going on
You gonna ease my mind and put me there on time
And keep rollin' on
I've told you baby, from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
You've broken your vow and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on

You've switched your engine now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
So I'm movin' on, you done your daddy wrong
I warned you twice, now you can settle the price
But I'm movin' on

But someday baby, when you've had your play
You want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on, you stayed away too long
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
Keep movin' on

[Verse 1]
Has anybody here seen Razor Face?
I heard he's back, looking for a place, to lay down
Must be getting on
Needs a man who's young to walk him around
Needs a man who's young to walk him around

[Verse 2]
Oh, it must be hard for the likes of you
To get by in a world that you just can't see through
And it looks so cold
How does it feel to know you can't go home
How does it feel to know you can't go home

[Chorus]
Come on, Razor Face, my old friend
I'll meet you down by the truck stop inn
With a bottle of booze in the back of my car
You're a song on the lips of an aging star
Razor Face, ooh! Amazing grace, protects you like a glove
And I'll never learn the reason why I love your Razor Face

[Verse 1]
Has anybody here seen Razor Face?
I heard he's back, and looking for a place, to lay down
Must be getting on
Needs a man who's young to walk him around
Needs a man who's young to walk him around

[Chorus]
Come on, Razor Face, my old friend
I'll meet you down by the truck stop inn
With a bottle of booze in the back of my car
You're a song on the lips of an aging star
Razor Face, ooh! Amazing grace, protects you like a glove
And I'll never learn the reason why I love your Razor Face

[Outro]
I love your Razor Face
I love your Razor Face
Ooh, I love Razor Face
Love your Razor Face
I did love your Razor Face
I love your Razor Face

[Verse 1]
I was down in music city 'bout a week ago
I wanted to see the brand old Loper show
So I held a cap and I headed down to Opryland
They said they sold their last ticket the day before
So I kinda just hung around the backstage door
And down the steps she came, man oh man
My favourite female country star
She waved her fans and headed for her car
Her tire, unlike her body, was very flat
She said, could you change my tire
I said your wish is my desire
As she raised the lid, I grabbed her bumper jack
She said I sure do appreciate you changing my tire

[Chorus]
If I told you who it was, if I told you who it was
You'd say I was making it up
You've seen her on the screen and in country magazines
You'd think I was making it up
She said it was our little secret and by golly
I'm gonna keep it
Anyway you wouldn't believe it
If I told you who it was

[Verse 2]
She said you need a lift and I said well
You can drop me of at the York motel
So we headed down Briley parkway in the town
I told her I got all your records ma'am
She smiled and said well I be damned
She said, you're kind of cute fella, wanna mess around
When we got to my room just the people lied
I said sure wish I could've heard you sing tonight
She smiled at me and said what do you wanna hear?
Well if I was one of them country music folks
I'll tell you, she'd sure get my vote for the best performance of the year

[Chorus]
If I told you who it was, if I told you who it was
You'd say I was making it up
You've seen her on the screen and in country magazines
You'd think I was making it up
She said it was our little secret and by golly
I'm gonna keep it
Anyway you wouldn't believe it
If I told you who it was

[Verse 2]
Well I tell you this much
When I put my arms around her and squeezed her real tight
She looked up at me with those big beautiful eyes
Took a deep breath and a sigh and said:
"Howdy I'm just so proud to be here!"

[Chorus]
If I told you who it was, if I told you who it was
You'd say I was making it up
You've seen her on the screen and in country magazines
You'd think I was making it up
She said it was our little secret and by golly
I'm gonna keep it
Anyway you wouldn't believe it
If I told you who it was

[Verse 1]
I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word, I'm a madman, don't you know

[Verse 2]
Once a fool had a good part in the play
If it's so would I still be here today?
It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way
They think it's very funny everything I say
Get a load of him, he's so insane
You better get your coat, dear, it looks like rain

[Chorus]
We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The In-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water

[Verse 1]
I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word, I'm a madman, don't you know

[Verse 3]
The ground's a long way down but I need more
Is the nightmare black or are the windows painted?
Will they come again next week, can my mind really take it?

[Chorus]
We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The In-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water

[Chorus]
When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And thank her for the good years that we had
Gently break the news that you don't love me
And give my best regards to your good old dad

[Verse 1]
I always liked your family
We got along just splendidly
Though your brother
Kind of rubbed me the wrong way
I remember that your eyes turned green
When they crowned your sister County Queen
Though she couldn't hold a candle
To your beauty any day

[Chorus]
When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And thank her for the good years that we had
Gently break the news that you don't love me
And give my best regards to your good old dad

[Verse 2]
Back when we could laugh and play
On family reunion day
Didn't we all look funny
In our 1950's clothes
Your daddy wore that greasy stuff
Your brother drank more than enough
Your mom wore penny loafers
With runners in her 'hose

[Chorus]
When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And thank her for the good years that we had
Gently break the news that you don't love me
And give my best regards to your good old dad
When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And give my best regards to your good old dad

[Verse 1]
When I look back, boy, I must have been green
Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
Looking for an answer, trying to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights, honey, I was blind

[Chorus 1]
They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh, change is gonna do me good
You better get back, honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

[Verse 2]
Well, I read some books and I read some magazines
About those high-class ladies down in New Orleans
And all the fools back home, well, said I was a fool
They said, oh, "Believe in the Lord" is the golden rule

[Chorus 2]
They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, ooh, oh, change is gonna do me good
(Ooh, baby)
They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh, oh, change is gonna do me good

[Verse 3]
They said, stay at home, boy, you gotta tend the farm
Living in the city, boy, is, is gonna break your heart
But how can you stay when your heart says no
Ha, how can you stop when your feet say go

[Chorus 1]
You better get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, ooh, oh, the change is gonna do me good
You better get back, honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

[Outro]
Oh yeah, get back, honky cat
Get back, honky cat, get back, whoo
Get back, honky cat
Get back, honky cat, get back, whoo
Oh, get back, honky cat, get back
Get back, honky cat, whoo
Oh yeah, redneck ways and
Whoo

[Verse 1]
She gave me my walking papers
And ran off with someone new
Cuz he bought her things
My wages couldn't buy
So I turned to ups and downers
And everything between
Still I can't get her good lovin'
Off my mind

Well today I bought a Cadillac
The kind she's always wanted
I called and asked her
If she'd like to ride
She said this is our last date
I said that's alright with me
Cause tonight I'm driving her
Out of my mind

[Chorus]
Yeah I'll take her on a scenic cruise
Right off of Lookout Mountain
Cause she said I never took her out
When she was mine
She'll see all seven states
As we drive to the pearly gates
Tonight when I drive her
Out of my mind

[Verse 2]
All the papers will read "Lovers leap
Again off Lookout Mountain"
Cause i wrote a note
That called it suicide
But my epitaph will say
He killed his pain yesterday
When he finally drove that woman
Off his mind

Well now here she comes to greet me
Dressed to kill and so am I
Hope she asks me if this
Cadillac will fly
And I know that I'll die laughin'
When I show her that it will
When I drive that woman
Right out of my mind

[Chorus]
Yeah I'll take her on a scenic cruise
Right off of Lookout Mountain
Cause she said I never took her out
When she was mine
She'll see all seven states
As we drive to the pearly gates
Tonight when I drive her
Out of my mind

[Verse 3]
They'll say Johnny Cash was quite a smash
Down here in Chatanooga
Last night when he drove her
Out of his mind
Yeah that Cadillac dealer's in for a big surprise too
99 dollars down, 99 dollars a month
Yeah it's gonna be just gorgeous

[Outro]
Ooh to the pearly gates
Ooh to the pearly gates
Ooh to the pearly gates
Ooh to the pearly gates
Ooh to the pearly gates

[Verse 1]
Cool grass blowing up the pass
Don't you know I'm feeling mellow?
Oh, I love your roman nose
The way you curl your toes, baby
Make me feel so mellow

[Verse 2]
It's the same old feeling I get when you're stealing
Back into my bed again
With the curtains closed
Oh, and the window froze
By the rhythm of the rain

[Chorus]
Ooh, you make me mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time

[Verse 3]
Going down to the stores in town
Getting all the things we need
Oh, don't forget the beer
Oh, my little dear
It helps to sow the mellow seed

[Verse 4]
And it can't be bad, all the love I've had
Coursing through my life
Oh, down in the pass
Where the wind blows fast
And mellow, mellow's feeling right

[Chorus]
Oh, I make you mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time

[Electric Violin Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time
Oh! You make me mellow
Oh! You make me mellow
Rocking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time

[Verse 1]
I'm getting bored
Being part of mankind
There's not a lot to do no more
This race is a waste of time
People rushing everywhere
Swarming around like flies
Think I'll buy a .44
Give 'em all a surprise

[Chorus]
I think I'm gonna kill myself
Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died
Yeah, I'm gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
I'd like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues

[Verse 2]
A rift in my family
I can't use the car
I gotta be in by ten o'clock
Who do they think they are?
I'd make an exception
If you wanna save my life
Brigitte Bardot gotta come
And see me every night

[Chorus]
I think I'm gonna kill myself
Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died
Yeah, I'm gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
I'd like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues

[Piano Solo]

[Outro]
On the state of teenage blues
Kill myself
Suicide
What a scandal if I die

On the state of teenage blues

[Verse 1]
Momma I guess you heard
I got married in Tennessee
I got a blue eyed girl
Who thinks the world of me

We got a cabin in the country
And a creek that rolls near by
And a dog that won't even bark at a firefly

Our clothes lines hang just outside our back door
And theres a tire that swings in the air 10 feet or more
Theres a church I can't seem to find on Sunday morning
But I sure found the place I belong in

[Chorus]
And we wear blue jeans and big green things
Spend the summer time naturally high
By, chopping wood for next winters fire
Saving our money for the county fair
George Jones is supposed to be there
We got, forty acres of corn on the ground
Tennessee taters we sell by the pound
Proud as we can be, to live in Tennessee

[Verse 2]
Momma you and Dad gotta come stay with us sometime
I know you'll love that sweet little gal of mine
You and her could take about babies
Make some homemade apple pie
While me and Dad take a walk maybe talk about old times

[Chorus]
And we wear blue jeans and big green things
Spend the summer time naturally high
By, chopping wood for next winters fire
Saving our money for the county fair
George Jones is supposed to be there
We got, forty acres of corn on the ground
Tennessee taters we sell by the pound
Proud as we can be, to live in Tennessee

We are proud as we can be to be from Tennesse
We are proud as we can be to be from Tennesse

[Verse 1]
I got frostbitten in the winter
Ice skating on the river
With my pretty little black-eyed girl
She'd make your darn toes curl just to see her, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a fringe front on my buggy
I got a frisky little colt in a hurry
And a pretty little black-eyed Susie by by by my side

[Chorus]
Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine

[Verse 2]
I'm an old hayseed harp player
I'm the hit of the county fair
With my pretty little black-eyed girl
Living proof as she swirls, she's a dancer, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a fringe front on my buggy
I got a frisky little colt in a hurry
And a pretty little black-eyed Susie by by by my side

[Chorus]
Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time, oh
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine
Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine

[Verse]
I have to say, my friends
This road goes a long, long way
And if we're going to find the end
We're going to need a helping hand
I have to say, my friends
We're looking for a light ahead
In the distance, a candle burns
Salvation keeps the hungry children fed

[Chorus]
It's gotta take a lot of salvation
What we need are willing hands
You must feel the sweat in your eyes
You must understand salvation

A chance to put the devil down
Without the fear of hell
Salvation spreads the gospel 'round
And free you from yourself

[Solo]

[Chorus]
It's gotta take a lot of salvation
What we need are willing hands
You must feel the sweat in your eyes
You must understand salvation

[Verse]
I have to say, my friends
This road goes a long, long way
And if we're going to find the end
We're going to need a helping hand
I have to say, my friends
We're looking for a light ahead
In the distance, a candle burns
Salvation keeps the hungry children fed

[Chorus]
It's gotta take a lot of salvation
What we need are willing hands
You must feel the sweat in your eyes
You must understand salvation

Oh, it's gotta take a lot of salvation
What we need are willing hands
You must feel the sweat in your eyes
You must understand salvation

[Verse 1]
I work for the foundry for a penny and a half a day
Like a blind street musician, I never see those who pay
It's dirty work in Birmingham, better deal for a Sheffield man
If he can rivet then his kids can buy
Candy from the candy man

[Pre-Chorus]
And the van that comes around weekends
Selling fancy city things
Sold by the man with the trilby hat
And the whiskers spread like wings
You can hear him sing
Oh, you can hear him sing

[Chorus]
Can I put you on? People, can I put you on?
Tell you that I love you, people
Sing a salesman's song and put you on

[Verse 2]
And a second cousin works in the pits in Newcastle on Tyne
And he don't care if it rains outside, there's coal dust on his mind
It's dirty work in Manchester but the crew gets paid its gelt
Bang on the bell on Friday
You buys a little something for yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
And the van that comes around weekends selling fancy city things
Sold by the man in the trilby hat and the whiskers spread like wings
You can hear him sing
Oh, you can hear him sing

[Chorus]
Can I put you on? People, can I put you on?
Tell you that I love you, people
Sing a salesman's song and put you on

[Pre-Chorus]
And the van that comes around weekends selling fancy city things
Sold by the man in the trilby hat and the whiskers spread like wings
You can hear him sing
Oh, you can hear him sing

[Chorus]
Can I put you on? People, can I put you on?
Tell you that I love you, people
Sing a salesman's song and put you on

[Outro]
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, people, can I put you on?)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, people, can I put you on?)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, people, can I put you on?)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, people, can I put you on?)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, people, can I put you on?)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, people, can I put you on?)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, people, can I put you on?)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, people, can I put you on?)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, people, can I put you on?)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, people, can I put you on?)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, people, can I put you on?)

[Verse 1]
There's a river running sweat right through our land, through our land
Driven by a man with a bullwhip in his hand, in his hand
And I've taken just as much as I can stand, I can stand
Oh, we've got to free our brothers from their shackles, yeah, if we can, if we can

[Verse 2]
Most nights I have to watch my woman cry, oh, she cries
Every day I watch the colonel smile, oh, he smiles
His painted ladies riding in from town, in from town
Oh, I swear one day i'm gonna burn the whorehouse to the ground, to the ground

[Chorus]
Slave, slave
To fight the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave

[Verse 3]
There's a rumor of a war that's yet to come, yet to come
That may free our families, free our families and our sons, and our sons
It may lay green lands to barren waste, all to waste, all to waste
Oh, the price of release is a bitter blow to face, oh, to face

[Chorus]
Slave, slave
To fight the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave

[Slide Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Slave, oh, slave
To fight the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave, slave
To fight the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave

[Verse 1]
Tune in, wouldn't it be something
Rumours spreading into panic
I've seen movements in the clearing
Someone sent you something satanic
I have to leave you, radar's calling
Outside somebody landed
Crazy wavelengths leave you helpless
Oh don't forget me I'm so stranded

[Chorus]
I wouldn't fool you but I've seen the saucers
So many times I'm almost in tune
Watching them flying in formation
Thinking how I could be so immune
I've seen them I've been there with them
I can tell you all you want to know
Something touched me and I was only sleeping
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you like to go

[Verse 2]
Stars climbing into their planets
Systems won, controlled from birth
Empty living on this highway
Can you see me mother earth
It's so endless whirling onwards
Wonder what's cooking at home tonight
Maybe if I promise not to say a word
They can get me back before the morning light

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Tread on my face if you like, little lady
Turn me inside out if you have to, baby
But don't you cross me off your list
Ooh, I am young and I ain't never been kissed
Never been kissed by a lady called Amy

[Verse 2]
You're far out, you're fab and insane
A woman of the world, it's quite plain
My dad told me Amy's your name
Said he'd break my neck if I played your game
But he can bust my head 'cause I, I love you all the same

[Chorus]
Amy, I know you don't have to show your affection
'Cause the big boys like you and to you, I'm an infection
So if you don't want me around
I think I'll run along and drown
You can't want this bum in town, Amy

[Electric Violin Solo]

[Chorus]
Amy, I know you don't have to show your affection
'Cause the big boys like you and to you, I'm an infection
So if you don't want me around
I think I'll run along and drown
You can't want this bum in town, Amy

[Verse 3]
I'm beaten on the streets because I loves you
I watch you go to work in the summer
I don't whistle at you down the street
I would if I could but I can't whistle, you see

[Outro]
Amy, I may not be James Dean
Amy, I may not be nineteen
And I may still be in romper boots and jeans
But ooh, Amy, you're the girl that wrecks my dreams

Amy, I may not be James Dean
Amy, I may not be nineteen
And I may still be in romper boots and jeans
But ooh, Amy, you're the girl that wrecks my dreams

[Verse 1]
And now I know
"Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow
In New York City

[Pre-Chorus]
Until you've seen this trash can dream come true
You stand at the edge while people run you through
And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you
I thank the Lord there's people out there like you

[Chorus]
While Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't, and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

[Verse 2]
This Broadway's got
It's got a lot of songs to sing
If I knew the tunes, I might join in
I'd go my way alone
I'd grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown in New York City

[Pre-Chorus]
Subway's no way for a good man to go down
Rich man can ride, and the hobo, he can drown
And I thank the Lord for the people I have found
I thank the Lord for the people I have found

[Chorus]
While Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't, and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

[Verse 1]
And now I know
"Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow
In New York City

[Pre-Chorus]
Subway's no way for a good man to go down
Rich man can ride, and the hobo, he can drown
And I thank the Lord for the people I have found
I thank the Lord for the people I have found

[Chorus]
While Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't, and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

[Outro]
They know not if it's dark outside or light

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I got a busted wing and a hornet sting
Like an out-of-tune guitar
Ooh, she got a Hercules on her side
And Diana in her eyes
Some men like the Chinese life
Some men kneel and pray
Ooh, well, I like women and I like wine
And I've always liked it that way
Always liked it that way

[Pre-Chorus]
(Doo-wop, shoo-wop)
(Doo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, ah)

[Chorus]
I can't dig it, the way she tease
That old tough-man routine up her sleeves
Livin' and a-lovin', kissin' and a-huggin'
Livin' and a-lovin' with a cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules

[Verse 2]
Oh, and it hurts like hell to see my girl messin' with a muscle boy
No Superman gonna ruin my plans
Playin' with my toys
Rich man sweatin' in a sauna bath
Poor boy scrubbin' in a tub
Me, I stay gritty up to my ears
Washin' in a bucket of mud
Washin' in a bucket of mud

[Pre-Chorus]
(Doo-wop, shoo-wop)
(Doo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, ah)

[Chorus]
I can't dig it, the way she tease
That old tough-man routine up her sleeves
Livin' and a-lovin', kissin' and a-huggin'
Livin' and a-lovin' with a cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules

[Guitar solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
(Doo-wop, shoo-wop)
(Doo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, ah)

[Chorus]
But I can't dig it, the way she tease
That old tough-man routine up her sleeves
Livin' and a-lovin', kissin' and a-huggin'
Livin' and a-lovin' with a cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
(Oh, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Boston at last, and the plane's touching down
Our hostess is handing the hot towels around
From a terminal gate to a black limousine
It's a ten minute ride to the Holiday Inn

[Verse 2]
Boredom's a pastime that one soon acquired
Where you get to the stage where you're not even tired
Kicking your heels till the time comes around
To pick up your bags and head out of town

[Chorus]
Slow down, Joe, I'm a rock and roll man
I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
And you ain't seen nothing till you've been
In a motel, baby, like the Holiday Inn

[Chorus]
Slow down, Joe, I'm a rock and roll man
I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
And you ain't seen nothing till you've been
In a motel, baby, like the Holiday Inn

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't even know if it's Cleveland or Maine
With the buildings as big and rooms just the same
And the TV don't work and the French fries are cold
And the room service closed about an hour ago

[Verse 1]
Tune me in to the wild side of life
I'm an innocent young child, sharp as a knife
Take me to the garretts where the artists have died
Show me the courtrooms where the judges have lied
Let me drink deeply from the water and the wine
Light colored candles in dark dreary mines
Look in the mirror and stare at myself
And wonder if that's really me on the shelf

[Chorus]
And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere, let's get there soon
Oh, this song's got no title, just words and a tune

[Verse 2]
Take me down alleys where the murders are done
In a vast high powered rocket to the core of the sun
Want to read books in the studies of men
Born on the breeze and die on the wind
If I was an artist who paints with his eyes
I'd study my subject and silently cry
Cry for the darkness to come down on me
For confusion to carry on turning the wheel

[Chorus]
And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere, let's get there soon
Oh, this song's got no title, just words and a tune
I was sitting in the classroom
Trying to look intelligent
In case the teacher looked at me
She was long and she was lean, she's a middle-aged dream
And that lady means the whole world to me
It's a natural achievement
Conquering my homework
With her image pounding in my brain
She's an inspiration for my graduation
And she helps to keep the classroom sane

Oh, teacher, I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight, come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you

I have to write a letter, ooh
Tell about my feelings
Just to let her know the scene
Focus my attention on some further education
In connection with the birdies and the bees
Oh, so I'm sitting in the classroom, woo!
I'm looking like a zombie
I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I've got John Wayne stances, I've got Erroll Flynn advances
And it doesn't mean a doggoned thing
Oh, teacher, I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you

Oh teacher I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you

[Verse 1]
There's a fly in the window, a dog in the yard
And a year since I saw you
There's a trunk in the corner I keep all my letters
My bills and demands I keep too

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I can't help thinking about the times
You were a wife of mine
You aimed to please me, cooked black-eyed peas-me
Made elderberry wine

[Chorus]
Drunk all the time, feeling fine on elderberry wine
Those were the days, we'd lay in the haze
Forget depressive times
How can I ever get it together without a wife in line?
To pick the crop and get me hot on elderberry wine

[Verse 2]
Round a tree in the summer, a fire in the fall
Flat out when they couldn't stand
The bottle went round like a woman down south
Passed on from hand to hand

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x2]

[Outro x5]
Elderberry wine

[Verse 1]
We've moved on six miles from where we were yesterday
And yesterday is but a long long ways away
So we'll camp out tonight beneath the bright starlight
And forget rotten peaches and the places we've stayed

[Verse 2]
I left from the dockland two years ago now
Made my way over on the S.S. Marie
And I've always had trouble wherever I've settled
Rotten peaches are all that I see

[Chorus]
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit, since the world begun
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the one
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun

Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit, since the world begun
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the one
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun

[Verse 3]
There ain't no green grass in the U.S. state prison
There is no one to hold when you're sick for your wife
And each day out you'll pick, you'll pick rotten peaches
You'll pick rotten peaches for the rest of your life

[Verse 4]
Oh, I've had me my fill of cocaine and pills
For I lie in the light of the Lord
And my home is ten thousand, ten thousand miles away
And I guess I won't see it no more

[Chorus]
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit, since the world begun
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the one
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun

Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit, since the world begun
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the
Jesus I'm the one
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun

[Verse 1]
Your old man got mad when I told him we were leaving
He cursed and he raged and he swore at the ceiling
He called you his child, said honey get wise to his game
He'll get you in trouble I know it, those bums are all the same
There's a greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
So tell him goodbye, we got to go west on that bus

[Chorus]
And it's all over now
Don't you worry no more
Going to go west to the sea
The greyhound is swaying
And the radio is playing
Some blues for baby and me
And the highway looks like it never did
Lord it looks so sweet and so free
And I can't forget that trip to the west
Singing blues for baby and me

[Verse 2]
Saw your hands trembling, your eyes opened in surprise
It's ninety in the shade babe, and there ain't a cloud in the sky
I called you my child, said honey now this is our game
There's two of us to play it and I'm happy to be home again
There's a greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
So tell him goodbye, we got to go west on that bus

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
When she gets up in the morning
It's enough to wake the dead
Oh she turning on the radio
And dancing on my head
It's no good living in the sun
Playing guitar all day
Boogalooing with my friends
In that erotic way

[Chorus]
Come on, Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
Dancing with your darling
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
Everybody say
We're all happy in Jamaica
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way

[Verse 2]
Let the ladies and the gentlemen
Be as rude as they like
On the beaches, oh in the jungle
Where the people feel alright
So do it in Jamaica
Got plenty for you and me
Honky tonking with my baby
In that deep blue sea

[Chorus]
Come on, Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
Dancing with your darling
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
Everybody say
We're all happy in Jamaica
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
Dancing with your darling
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
Everybody say
We're all happy in Jamaica
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way

[Verse 1]
Walk a mile in my tennis shoes
Tina Turner gave me the highway blues
But I don't love nobody but you honey
I'm a true rat for the things I done
Second cousin to a son of a gun
I'm going to wipe out your mama if she puts me on honey

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a midnight creeper
Ain't gonna lose no sleep over you
When there's a nightmare I'm there
Tempting you to blow a fuse
Well there's no more sleeping
When I'm midnight creeping over you
Watch out honey, watch out honey
Watch the things you do

[Verse 2]
Long haired ladies well they look so fine
Locked in my cellar full of cheap red wine
But, I don't think those ladies they really mind honey
I still don't know why you hate me so
A little bit of fun never stopped no show
Well I, I just wanna loosen up my soul honey

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Watch out honey, watch out honey
Watch the things you do

[Verse 1]
I can see by your eyes you must be lying
When you think I don't have a clue
Baby, you're crazy
If you think that you can fool me
Because I've seen that movie too

[Chorus]
The one where the players are acting surprised
Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles, with the knives in their eyes
Well, their actions become so absurd
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
That I've seen that movie too
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
I've seen that movie too

[Verse 2]
It's a habit I have, I don't get pushed around
Stop twinkling your star like you do
I'm not the blueprint for all of your B-films
Because I've seen that movie too

[Chorus]
The one where the players are acting surprised
Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles, oh, with the knives in their eyes
Oh, their actions become so absurd
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
That I've seen that movie too
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
I've seen that movie too

[Outro]
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
I've seen that movie too
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
I've seen that movie too

[Verse 1]
Oh my love
I have cursed the stars above
That lead my heart to you
But as hard as I try
Still my love will not die
And the stars still shine on through 

[x2]

[Chorus]
Oh my dear
Now this ship's too hard to steer
The tide has turned, turned on you
I have been through the lies
That I've seen in your eyes
But the truth still shines on through
But the truth it still shines, shines on through

[Verse 2]
So shine, shine on through the days we have to fill
Though we took our love so daringly
And gave it up uncaringly
There are feelings left not even we can kill

[Chorus]
Oh my friend
So at last we reach the end
The lights go down on cue
I have wasted my time
But it tasted oh so fine
That my love still shines, shines on through
And my love still shines, shines on you

[Verse 1]
Have you heard the dogs at night
Somewhere on the hill
Chasing some poor criminal
And I guess they're out to kill
Oh there must be shackles on his feet
And mother in his eyes
Stumbling through the devil-dark
With the hound pack in full cry

[Chorus]
Have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change?
Don't you hear him any more?
Praying "Lord, you gotta help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs
Sweet Jesus, I'll be your friend"

[Verse 2]
Now have you ever seen the white teeth gleam
While you lie on a cold damp ground
You're taking in the face of a rifle butt
While the wardens hold you down
And you've never seen a friend in years
Oh, it turns your heart to stone
You jump the walls and the dogs run free
And the grave's gonna be your home

[Chorus]
Oh, have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change?
Don't you hear him any more?
Praying "Lord, you gotta help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs
Ooh, sweet Jesus, I'll be your friend"

[Chorus]
Oh, have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change?
Don't you hear him any more?
Praying "Lord, you gotta help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs
Sweet Jesus, I'll be your friend"

[Verse 1]
It seems like yesterday
I heard people say
Son you were born a stray, someday you'll settle down
I guess there'll come a time
Maybe I'll tow the line
Right now I'm doing fine
Rollin' from town to town

[Chorus]
I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes

[Verse 2]
Guitars and ringin' tones
Are in my blood and in my bones
Show me a bus and I'll call it home
I don't wanna change

[Chorus]
I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes

[Verse]
Oh the lonely day
When they put me in my grave
There ain't a word you need to say just
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes

So let that moulder run
Headed out towards the sun
I'm in the mood for movin' on
I'll be back some day

[Chorus]
I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes

[Verse 1]
Well, there's slim times when my words won't rhyme
And the hills I face are a long hard climb
I just sit cross-legged with my old guitar
Ooh, it kinda makes me feel like a rock'n'roll star

[Verse 2]
Well it makes me laugh, Lord, it makes me cry
And I think, for once, let me just get high
Let me get electric, put a silk suit on
Turn my old guitar into a tommy gun

[PreChorus]
And root-toot-shoot myself to fame
Every kid alive gonna know my name
An overnight phenomen like there's never been
A motivated supersonic king of the scene

[Chorus]
I'll be a teenage idol, just give me a break
I'm gonna be a teenage idol, no matter how long it takes
You can't imagine what it means to me
I'm going to grab myself a place in history
A teenage idol
That's what I'm gonna be

[Instrumental]
(Oh yeah)

[Verse 3]
Well, life is short, and the world is rough
And if you're going to boogie, boy, you got to be tough
Nobody knows if I'm dead or alive
I just drink myself to sleep each night

[Verse 4]
And so I pray to the teenage god of rock
If I make it big, let me stay on top
You gotta cut me loose from this one room dive
Put me on the ladder, keep this boy alive

[PreChorus]
And root-toot-shoot myself to fame
Every kid alive gonna know my name
An overnight phenomen like there's never been
A motivated supersonic king of the scene

[Chorus]
I'll be a teenage idol, just give me a break
I'm gonna be a teenage idol, no matter how long it takes
You can't imagine what it means to me
I'm going to grab myself a place in history
A teenage idol (ha, yeah, ooh)
That's what I'm gonna be

[Verse 1]
If it came to pass
That they should ask
What could I tell them?
Would they criticize
Behind my back
Maybe I should let them

[Chorus]
Oh, if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

[Verse 2]
If they could face it
I could take it
In their eyes
Oh, I know I'd make it
Their tiny minds
And sacred cows, just fake it

[Chorus]
Oh, if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

[Bridge]
But I know the way
They want me
In the way they publicize
If they could turn
Their focus off
To the image in their eyes
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
That a full-blooded city boy
Is now a full-blooded city man

[Outro]
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul

[Verse 1]
I heard from a friend you'd been messing around
With a cute little thing I'd been dating uptown
Well I don't know if I like that idea much
Well you'd better stay clear I might start acting rough
You out of town guys sure think you're real keen
Think all of us boys here are homespun and green
But that's wrong my friend so get this through your head
We're tough and we're Texan with necks good and red

[Chorus]
So it's Ki yi yippie yi yi
You long hairs are sure gonna die
Our American home was clean till you came
And kids still respected the president's name
And the eagle still flew in the sky
Hearts filled with national pride
Then you came along with your drug-crazy songs
Goddammit you're all gonna die

[Verse 2]
How dare you sit there and drink all our beer
Oh it's made for us workers who sweat spit and swear
The minds of our daughters are poisoned by you
With your communistic politics and them negro blues
Well I'm gonna quit talking and take action now
Run all of you fairies clean out of this town
Oh I'm dog tired of watching you mess up our lives
Spending the summertime naturally high

[Chorus]
So it's Ki yi yippie yi yi
You long hairs are sure gonna die
Our American home was clean till you came
And kids still respected the president's name
And the eagle still flew in the sky
Hearts filled with national pride
Then you came along with your drug-crazy songs
Goddammit you're all gonna die
Goddammit you're all gonna die
Oh Lord Goddammit you're all gonna die
Listen now
And now that it's all over
The birds can nest again
I'll only snow when the sun comes out
I'll shine only when it starts to rain

And if you want a drink
Just squeeze my hand
And wine will flow into the land
And feed my lambs

For I am a mirror
I can reflect the moon
I will write songs for you
I'll be your silver spoon

I'm sorry I took your time
I am the poem that doesn't rhyme
Just turn back a page
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away

[Verse 1]
You wore a little cross of gold around your neck
I saw it as you flew between my reason
Like a raven in the night time when you left
I wear a chain upon my wrist that bears no name
You touched it and you wore it
And you kept it in your pillow all the same

[Chorus]
My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird

[Verse 2]
The white walls of your dressing room are stained in scarlet red
You bled upon the cold stone like a young man
In the foreign field of death
Wouldn't it be wonderful is all I heard you say
You never closed your eyes at night and learned to love daylight
Instead you moved away

[Chorus]
My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird

[Outro]
My high-flying, high-flying bird
My high-flying, high-flying bird
My high-flying, high-flying bird
My high-flying, high-flying bird

[Verse 1]
I was justified when I was five
Raising Cain, I spit in your eye
Times are changing, now the poor get fat
But the fever's gonna catch you when the bitch gets back (oh)

[Verse 2]
Eat meat on Friday, that's alright
I even like steak on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social do's
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue, ooh

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, oh, the bitch is back
Stone-cold sober, as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do, oh

[Verse 3]
I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul by dropping names
I don't like those, my God, what's that?
Oh, it's full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back (oh)

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, oh, the bitch is back
Stone-cold sober, as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do, oh
(Oh)

[Saxophone Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, oh, the bitch is back
Stone-cold sober, as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do, oh

[Outro]
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back

[Verse 1]
Captain Fantastic raised and regimented, hardly a hero
Just someone his mother might know
Very clearly a case for corn flakes and classics
"Two teas both with sugar please", in the back of an alley
While little Dirt Cowboys turned brown in their saddles
Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer
For it's hay make and "Hey mom
Do the papers say anything good?
Are there chances in life for little Dirt Cowboys?
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods?"

[Chorus 1]
Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing
City slick Captain
Fantastic the feedback, the honey the hive could be holding
For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
And the '68 summer festival wallflowers are thinning

[Chorus 2]
For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town

[Verse 2]
And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us
Hmm, couldn't fool us
For we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire
Hand in hand went music and the rhyme
The Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring
From here on sonny sonny sonny, it's a long and lonely climb

[Chorus 2]
For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town
For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town

[Outro]
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town

[Verse 1]
Snow, cement
And ivory young towers
Someone called us Babylon
Those hungry hunters tracking down the hours

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But where were all your shoulders when we cried?
Were the darlings on the sideline
Dreaming up such cherished lies
To whisper in your ear before you die?

[Chorus]
It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
Have a ball y'all
See the letches crawl with the call girls under the table
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
Junk, angel
This closet's always stacked
The dealers in the basement
Filling your prescription for a brand new heart attack

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But where were all your shoulders when we cried?
Were the doctors in attendance
Saying how they felt so sick inside
Or was it just the scalpel blade that lied?

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
I don't want to wake you
But I'd like to tell you that I love you
That the candlelight fell like a crescent
Upon your feather pillow
For there's more ways than one
And the ways of the world are a blessing
For when Pinky's dreaming
She owes the world nothing
And her silence keeps us guessing

[Chorus]
Pinky's as perfect as the Fourth of July
Quilted and timeless, seldom denied
The trial and the error of my master plan
Now she rolls like the dice in a poor gambler's hands

[Verse 2]
You don't want to tell me
But somehow you've guessed that I know
Oh when dawn came this morning
You discovered a feeling that burned like a flame in your soul
For there's toast and honey
And there's breakfast in bed on a tray
Oh it's ten below zero
And we're about to abandon our plans for the day

[Chorus]
I'm back on dry land once again
Opportunity awaits me like a rat in the drain
We're all hunting honey with money to burn
Just a short time to show you the tricks that we've learned

If the boys all behave themselves here
Well, there's pretty young ladies and beer in the rear
You won't need a gutter to sleep in tonight
Oh, the prices I charge here will see you alright

So she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you

Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game
Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game
Forget us, we'll have gone very soon
Just forget we ever slept in your rooms
And we'll leave the smell of the sea in your beds
Where love's just a job and nothing is said

So as she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you

Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game
Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game

[Verse 1]
I'm going on the circuit
I'm doing all the clubs
And I really need a song, boys
To stir those workers up
And get their wives to sing it with me
Just like in the pubs
When I worked the good old pubs in Stepney
Oh, could you knock a line or two
Together for a friend?
Sentimental, tear-inducing
With a happy end
And we need a tune to open
Our season at Southend
Can you help us?

[Chorus]
It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das (la-de-da...)
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars

[Verse 2]
I like the warm blue flame
The hazy heat it brings
It loosens up the muscles
And forces you to sing
You know it's just another hit and run
From the tin pan alley twins
And there's a chance that one day
You might write a standard, lads
So churn them out quick and fast
And we'll still pat your backs
'Cause we need what we can get
To launch another dozen acts
Are you working?

[Chorus]
It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das (la-de-da...)
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars
It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das (la-de-da...)
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars

[Outro]
(La-de-da...)
Swinging stars, swinging stars
It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark-

[Verse 1]
Some punk with a shotgun killed young Danny Bailey
In cold blood, in the lobby of a downtown motel
Killed him in anger, a force he couldn't handle
Helped pull the trigger that cut short his life
And there's not many knew him the way that we did
Sure enough he was a wild one, but then aren't most hungry kids?

[Chorus]
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
Dillinger's dead, oh
I guess the cops won again
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in

[Verse 2]
We're running short of heroes back up here in the hills
Without Danny Bailey, we're gonna have to break up our stills
So mark his grave well 'cause Kentucky loved him
Born and raised a proper, I guess life just bugged him
And he found faith in danger, a lifestyle he lived by
A running gun youngster in a sad restless age

[Chorus]
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
Dillinger's dead
I guess the cops won again
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in

[Verse 1]
There's a dusty old gutter he's lying in now
Mmm, He's blind and he's old
And there's a bottle that rolls down the road
Me, I'm young and I'm so wild
And I still feel the need
Of your apron strings once in a while
For there's taxi cabs a-hooting
But I can't be foot-loose forever
My suitcase it's a cheap one
My darling, she's a dear one
My head's feeling light as a feather

[Chorus]
Take my ears and tell me when the whistle blows
Wake me up and tell me when the whistle blows
Long lost and lonely boy
You're just a black sheep going home
I want to feel your wheels of steel
Underneath my itching heels
Take my money
Tell me when the whistle blows

[Verse 2]
Part of me asked the young man for the time
With a cool vacant stare
Of undue concern, he said nine
It's not so bad but I really do love the land
And rather all this than those diamante lovers
In Hyde Park holding hands
Blowing heat through my fingers
Trying to kill off this cold
Will the street kids remember?
Can I still shoot a fast cue?
Has this country kid still got his soul?

[Chorus]
Take my ears and tell me when the whistle blows
Wake me up and tell me when the whistle blows
Long lost and lonely boy
You're just a black sheep going home
I want to feel your wheels of steel
Underneath my itching heels
Take my money
Tell me when the whistle blows
Take my money
Tell me when the whistle blows

[Verse 1]
I've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck
I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck
That ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard
But I'm gonna put buckshot in your pants if you step into my yard
When I watch the police come by and move you on
Well, I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become
Well, you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear
But all you got was a mop-up job washing other people's stairs

[Pre-Chorus]
I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
Oh! (oh!)

[Chorus]
I'm gonna tell the world you're a dirty little girl
Someone grab that bitch by the ears
Rub her down, scrub her back, and turn her inside out
'Cause I bet she, I bet she
I bet she, oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in a year

[Verse 2]
Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls
That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl
And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself
So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped

[Pre-Chorus]
I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
Oh! (oh!)

[Chorus]
I'm gonna tell the world you're a dirty little girl
Someone grab that bitch by the ears
Rub her down, scrub her back, and turn her inside out
'Cause I bet she, oh, I bet she, let me tell you now
I bet she, oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in a year

[Chorus]
Oh ho
Ah ho!
'Cause I bet she, oh, I bet she
I bet she, oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in a year

[Outro]
Dirty little girl (girl)
Oh ho (oh ho)
Dirty little girl (girl)
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Dirty, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Girl, girl, girl, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Oh, oh, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Girl, girl, girl, dirty, dirty little girl

[Verse 1]
Raised to be a lady by the golden rule
Alice was the spawn of a public school
With a double barrel name in the back of her brain
And a simple case of mummy-doesn't-love-me blues
Reality it seems was just a dream
She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene

[Pre-Chorus]
But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey)
You know what I mean

[Chorus]
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice they say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away

[Verse 2]
Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart
It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girl's bed
And it was only last Tuesday
Oh, they found you in the subway dead
And who could you call your friends down in SoHo
One or two middle-aged dykes in a go-go

[Pre-Chorus]
But what do you expect from a 16-year-old yo-yo?
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey)
Oh, don’t you know?

[Chorus]
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they'd say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away

[Verse 1]
When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna, lord, you really shoulda been there
Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer, and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there, rollin' 'round the basement floor (Ooh)

[Chorus]
And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear (sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)

[Piano riff]

[Verse 2]
I never realized the passin' hours of evening showers
A slip noose hangin' in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning, damn it! Listen to me good
I'm sleepin' with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive
(Oh!)

[Chorus]
Someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)

[Piano riff]

[Bridge]
And I would've walked head-on into the deep end of the river
Clingin' to your stocks and bonds
Payin' your H.P. demands forever
They're comin' in the mornin' with a truck to take me home
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength, and run the field you play alone

[Chorus]
Someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye

[Outro]
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)

[Verse 1]
As I lay dreaming in my bed
Across the great divide
I thought I heard the trawler boats
Returning on the tide
And in this vision of my home
The shingle beach did ring
I saw the lights along the pier
That made my senses sing

[Chorus]
Oh oh Grimsby, a thousand delights
Couldn't match the sweet sights
Of my Grimsby
Oh England you're fair
But there's none to compare with my Grimsby
Through nights of mad youth
I have loved every sluice in your harbor
And in your wild sands from boyhood to man
Strangers have found themselves fathers

[Verse 2]
Take me back you rustic town
I miss your magic charm
Just to smell your candy floss
Or drink in the Skinners Arms
No Cordon Bleu can match the beauty
Of your pies and peas
I want to ride your fairground
Take air along the quay

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I can hound you if I need to
Sip your brandy from a crystal shoe
In the corner
In the corner
While the others climb reaching dizzy heights
The world's in front of me in black and white
I'm on the bottom line
I'm on the bottom line
I'd have a cardiac if I had such luck
Ooh! Lucky losers, lucky losers landing on skid row
Landing on skid row
While the Diamond Jims and the Kings road pimps
Breath heavy in their brand new clothes
I'm on the bottom line
I'm on the bottom line

[Chorus]
And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive, you need a meal ticket
To stay alive, you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain, no regret, no regret
When the line's been signed, you're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest

[Verse 2]
Shake a hand if you have to
Trust in us and we will love you anyway, anyway
Don't leave us stranded in the jungle
With fifty percent that's hard to handle
Ain't that so?
Ain't that so?

[Chorus]
And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive, you need a meal ticket
To stay alive, you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed, you're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest
Meal ticket

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
(Gotta get a meal ticket)

[Chorus]
And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive, you need a meal ticket
To stay alive, you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed, you're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest

[Outro]
Meal ticket
Meal ticket
Meal ticket
Meal ticket
Meal ticket

[Verse 1]
I could really get off being in your shoes
I used to be stone sold on rhythm and blues
A heard of a place at the back of town
Where you really kick the shit when the sun goes down

[Pre-Chorus]
I really got buzzed when your sister said
"Throw away them records `cause the blues is dead
Let me take you, honey, where the scene's on fire"
And tonight I learned for certain that the blues expired

[Chorus]
Oh, your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
She out-bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist but she got more soul than me

[Verse 2]
Somebody help me because the bug bit me
Now I'm in heaven with the aching feet
But I'll be back tonight where the music plays
And your sister rocks all my blues away

[Pre-Chorus]
I really got buzzed when your sister said
"Throw away them records `cause the blues is dead
Let me take you, honey, where the scene's on fire"
And tonight I learned for certain that the blues expired

[Chorus]
Oh, your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
She out-bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist but she got more soul than me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Oh, your sister can't surf but she can rock and roll
She out-bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist but she got more soul than me

[Chorus]
Oh, your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
She out-bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist but she got more soul than me

[Verse 1]
I wonder who's sleeping in your sheets tonight
Whose head rests upon the bed
Could it be a close friend I knew so well
Who seems to be so close to you instead
Close to you instead

[Chorus 1]
I'm blue tonight, I'm red when I'm mad
I'm green when I'm jealous, yellow when I'm sad
I guess I cannot have everything
So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty and you were seventeen

[Chorus 2]
So out of choice I chose rock and roll
But it pushed me to the limit everyday
It turned me into a gypsy, kept me away from home
From there on, there seemed no use for you
For you to stay

[Verse 2]
And if I shower around 3 a.m
It's just to wash away
The trace of a love unwanted
Oh in the times I went astray
The times I went astray

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
Ooh,Ooh,Ooh,Ooh,Ooh,Ooh
So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty and you were seventeen

[x6]

[Verse 1]
There was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on
And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news

[Verse 2]
Well, they've locked up their daughters
And they battened the hatches
They always could find us but they never could catch us
Through the grease-streaked windows of an all-night cafe
We watched the arrested get taken away
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat
As the whores and the drunks filed in from the street

[Chorus]
'Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire
If you ask how I am then I'll just say "inspired"
If the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side
Then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died

[Break]
Ooh (Ooh)
Ooh
Ooh (La, la, la)
Ooh (la, la, la)

Ah
Ah
La-la-la-la-la...

[Chorus]
'Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire
If you ask how I am then I'll just say inspired
If the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side
Then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died

[Outro]
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you dream, sometimes it seems
There's nothing there at all
You just seem older than yesterday
And you're waiting for tomorrow to call
You draw to the curtains and one thing's for certain
You're cozy in your little room
The carpet's all paid for, God bless the TV
Let's go shoot a hole in the moon

[Chorus]
Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the TV, shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight

[Verse 2]
Nine o'clock mornings, five o'clock evenings
I'd liven the pace if I could
Oh, I'd rather have a ham in my sandwich than cheese
But complaining wouldn't do any good
Lay back in my armchair, close eyes and think clear
I can hear hoof-beats ahead
Roy and Trigger have just hit the hilltop
While the wife and the kids are in bed

[Chorus]
Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the TV, shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight

[Verse 1]
My bulldog is barking in the backyard
Enough to raise a dead man from his grave
And I can't concentrate on what I'm doing
Disturbance going to crucify my days
And the days they get longer and longer
And the nighttime is a time of little use
For I just get ugly and older
I get juiced on Mateus and just hang loose

[Chorus]
And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinnertime and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and have a real good time
I'm a genuine example of a social disease

[Verse 2]
My landlady lives in a caravan
Well, that is when she isn't in my arms
And it seems I pay the rent in human kindness
But my liquor also helps to grease her palms
And the ladies are all getting wrinkles
And they're falling apart at the seams
Well, I just get high on tequila
And see visions of vineyards in my dreams

[Chorus]
And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinnertime and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and have a real good time
I'm a genuine example of a social disease

[Verse 2]
And the ladies are all getting wrinkles
And they're falling apart at the seams
Well, I just get high on tequila
And see visions of vineyards in my dreams

[Chorus]
And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinnertime and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and I have a heart of gold
I'm a genuine example of a social disease

[Outro]
I'm a genuine example of a social disease

[Verse 1]
Sober in the morning light
Things look so much different
To how they looked last night
A pale face pressed to an unmade bed
Like flags of many nations flying high above her head
The cellophane still on the flowers
The telegram still in her hand
As whispers circulate all day
Their back-stage baby princess passed away

[Chorus]
And you can cage the songbird
But you can't make her sing
And you can trap the free bird
But you'll have to clip her wings
Because she'll soar like a hawk when she flies
But she'll dive like an eagle when she dies

[Verse 2]
Promises of no more lies
Fell flat upon an empty stage
Before the audience arrived
A return in time to the cheaper seats
She never knew what lay beneath
Just a dated handbill they found between the sheets
Let down before the final curtain
A shallow heart that left her cold
She left in rouge upon the mirror
A circled kiss to the faithful fans who'd miss her

[Chorus]
And you can cage the songbird
But you can't make her sing
And you can trap the free bird
But you'll have to clip her wings
Because she'll soar like a hawk when she flies
But she'll dive like an eagle when she dies

[Verse]
Is there anything left?
Maybe steak and eggs
Waking up to washing up
Making up your bed
Lazy days
My razor blade
Could use a better edge
It's enough to make you laugh
Relax in a nice cool bath
Inspiration for navigation
Of our new found craft
I know you
And you know me
It's always half and half

[Chorus]
And we were, oh, oh, so, you know
Not the kind to dawdle
Will the things we wrote today
Sound as good tomorrow?
We will still be writing
In approaching years
Stifling yawns on Sundays
As the weekends disappear

[Bridge]
We could stretch our legs if we'd half a mind
But don't disturb us if you hear us trying
To instigate the structure of another line or two
'Cause writing's lighting up
And I like life enough
To see it through

[Chorus]
And we were, oh, oh, so, you know
Not the kind to dawdle
Will the things we wrote today
Sound as good tomorrow?
We will still be writing
In approaching years
Stifling yawns on Sundays
As the weekends disappear

[Outro]
We could stretch our legs if we'd half a mind
But don't disturb us if you hear us trying
To instigate the structure of another line or two
'Cause writing's lighting up
And I like life enough
To see it through
'Cause writing's lighting up
And I like life enough
To see it through

[Verse 1]
Hello, baby, hello
Haven't seen your face for a while
Have you quit doing time for me
Or are you still the same spoiled child?
Hello, I said hello
Is this the only place you thought to go
Am I the only man you ever had
Or am I just the last surviving friend
That you know?

[Chorus 1]
Harmony and me, we're pretty good company
Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee, I really love you and I wanna love you forever
And dream of never, never, never leaving harmony

[Verse 2]
Hello, baby, hello
Open up your heart and let your feelings flow
You're not unlucky knowing me
Keeping the speed real slow
In any case I set my own pace by stealing the show
Say hello, hello
Ah!

[Chorus 2]
Harmony and me, we're pretty good company
Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee, I really love you and I want to love you forever
And dream of never, never, never leaving harmony

[Outro]
Never leaving harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Ah-ah!
Yell help, too many cooks and a bird in the bush, yell help
Yell help, if your mirror busts and your cat gets cussed, yell help

Because down the road you find someone else who's looking
Down the road you find another sweet lady cooking
So i gotta yell help

Yell help, some shelter from the storm like the travel agent warned
Yell help, if you can help your superstitions they gonna keep you warm

Because down the road you find someone else who's looking
Down the road you seen another sweet lady cooking
So i gotta yell help

I wish tonight wasn't wednesday night
I wish it wasn't the thirteenth of july (yell help)
And you're looking at the guy whose eyes can't deny
That he wishes he were somewhere else tonight (x2)

Well i met this woman down in new orleans
Lord she built just like a dream
Even wore stockings that had seams
And she was ugly
Now hell i don't mind women of her kind
I'll even pay sometimes for a woman that's ugly
She built like a steamroller
Just the kind to mow you over anytime
Hey the moment might arrive
On bourbon street
Well the ugliest woman you'll ever meet
But she's mine all mine and she's ugly
So i better yell help

[Outro]
Yell Help!

[Verse 1]
Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

[Verse 2]
The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened
It's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

[Chorus 1]
Did we, didn't we, should we, couldn't we?
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says:
"Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes?"

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
But our Empty Sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile

[Verse 3]
Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh
We all fall in love sometimes

[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
I have picked wild roses
Far into september
But I had no one to give the flowers to
I needed a celebration
A September coronation
And I admitted to myself I needed you

[Verse 2: June Carter]
I've watched the gentle winds change
The colors shades of meadows
Ive seen the dew on flowers that had no name
But I let my vase stay empty like my lonely empty heart
Picking flowers for yourself is not the same

[Chorus]
Don't you think its come our time to be together
Lets gather up our scattered words of love and make them rhyme
Let's go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases
Don't you think its come our time

[Verse 3]
Would you take this small bouquet that leaves a fragrance on my fingers
And a feeling that your love is close at hand
Thank you for the flowers, now lets walk through the meadows
Through the brook where our demands caress the sand

[Chorus]
Don't you think its come our time to be together
Lets gather up our scattered words of love and make them rhyme
Let's go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases
Don't you think its come our time
Don't you think its come our time

[Verse 1]
Can you tell me how old Dan might've done it
If he'd been here now, holy cow
My stars might've been read on the planet Mars
'Cause I don't have foresight to see
If we'll still be together in the twenty-first
In the twenty-first century, oh no

[Verse 2]
He's our flyin' ace, Pilot of the Future
In an endless space, holy cow
My eyes never saw a rocket that was quite that size
'Cause I don't have the energy
To be cat and mouse for the champions
For the champions of destiny, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
So long, Captain Dan
I fail to see what motivates your hands
Goodbye, restless night
You know I love Dan Dare, but I couldn't make his flight
So long, so long, yeah

[Chorus]
Dan Dare doesn't know it
He doesn't know it, he doesn't know it
But I like the Mekon

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, so long, Captain Dan
I fail to see what motivates your hands
Goodbye, restless night
You know I love Dan Dare, but I couldn't make his flight
So long, so long

[Chorus]
Dan Dare doesn't know it
He doesn't know it, he doesn't know it
But I like the Mekon

[Chorus]
Dan Dare doesn't know it
He doesn't know it, he doesn't know it
But I like the Mekon

[Chorus]
Dan Dare doesn't know it
Doesn't know it, doesn't know it
But I like the Mekon

[Chorus]
Dan Dare doesn't know it, know it
Doesn't know it, know it, doesn't know it, know it, doesn't know it
But I like the Mekon

[Outro]
(Dan Dare doesn't know it, know it, doesn't know it, know it)
(Doesn't know it, know it, doesn't know it)
(Dan Dare doesn't know it, know it, doesn't know it, know it)
(Doesn't know it, know it, doesn't know it)

[Verse]
I used to know this old scarecrow
He was my song
My joy and sorrow
Cast alone between the furrows
Of a field no longer sown by anyone
I held a dandelion
That said the time had come
To leave upon the wind
Not to return
When summer burned the earth again
Oh...
Oh...

[Chorus]
Cultivate the freshest flower
This garden ever grew
Beneath these branches
I once wrote such childish words for you
But that's okay
There's treasure children always seek to find
And just like us
You must have had
A once upon a time

[Outro]
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh... (lovely, lovely, ay-oh, lovely, lovely, ay-oh)
Oh... (lovely, lovely, ay-oh, lovely, lovely, ay-oh)
Oh... (lovely, lovely, ay-oh, lovely, lovely, ay-oh)
Oh... (lovely, lovely, ay-oh, lovely, lovely, ay-oh)
Oh... (lovely, lovely, ay-oh, lovely, lovely, ay-oh)
Oh... (lovely, lovely, ay-oh, lovely, lovely, ay-oh)
Oh... (lovely, lovely, ay-oh, lovely, lovely, ay-oh)
Oh... (lovely, lovely, ay-oh, lovely, lovely, ay-oh)

[Verse 1]
I see your teeth flash, Jamaican honey, so sweet
Down where Lexington cross 47th street
Oh, she's a big girl, she's standin' six-foot-three
Turnin' tricks for the dudes in the big city

[Chorus]
Island girl
What you wantin' with your white man's world?
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from your racket boss
He want to save you, but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man's world

[Verse 2]
Well, she's black as coal, but she burn like a fire
And she wrap herself around you like a well-worn tire
You feel her nail scratch your back just like a rake
Oh, he one more gone, he one more John who make the mistake

[Chorus]
Island girl
What you wantin' with your white man's world?
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from your racket boss
He want to save you, but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man's world

[Chorus]
Island girl
What you wantin' with your white man's world?
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from your racket boss
He want to save you, but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man

[Verse 1]
Yeah I looked at my watch and it said a quarter to five
The headlines screamed that I was still alive
I couldn't understand it, I thought I died last night
Oh, I dreamed I'd been in a border town
In a little cantina that the boys had found
I was desperate to dance just to dig the local sounds

[Pre-Chorus]
When along came a señorita
She looked so good that I had to meet her
I was ready to approach her with my English charm
When her brass knuckled boyfriend grabbed me by the arm
Oh, he was so macho

[Chorus]
And he said grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
We no like to with the gringo fight
But there might be a death in Mexico tonight
If you can't grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
Take my advice, take the next flight
And grow your funk, grow your funk at home
I mean, the situation was ridiculous

[Verse 2]
Well, I looked for support from the rest of my friends
For their vanishing trick they get ten out of ten
I knelt to pray just to see if He would comprehend
Oh, I dreamed I'd been in a border town
In a little cantina that the boys had found
I was desperate to dance just to dig the local sounds

[Pre-Chorus]
When along came a señorita
She looked so good that I had to meet her
I was ready to approach her with my English charm
When her brass knuckled boyfriend grabbed me by the arm
Oh, and it hurt so much

[Chorus]
And he said grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
We no like to with the gringo fight
But there might be a death in Mexico tonight
If you can't grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
Take my advice, take the next flight
And grow your funk, grow your funk at home
I mean, the situation was ridiculous
Ya know, I think I really like...

[Outro]
I'll grow some funk
Yea, I'll grow some funk of my own
Oh, I'll grow some funk
I'll grow some funk of my own
I'll grow some funk
Of my own
Of my own
Of my own
Of my own
I'll grow some funk
I'll grow some funk

[Verse 1]
Like a corn in a field I cut you down
I threw the last punch too hard
After years of going steady, well I thought that it was time
To throw in my hand for a new set of cards
And I can't take you dancing out on the weekend
I figured we'd painted too much of this town
And I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon
And I knew then I had lost what should have been found
I knew then I had lost what should have been found

[Chorus]
And I feel like a bullet in the gun of Robert Ford
I'm low as a paid assassin is
You know I'm cold as a hired sword
I'm so ashamed can't we patch it up
You know I can't think straight no more
You make me feel like a bullet honey in the gun of Robert Ford

[Verse 2]
Like a child when his toy's been stepped on
That's how it all seemed to me
I burst the bubble that both of us lived in
And I'm damned if I'll ever get rid of this guilt that I feel
And if looks could kill then I'd be a dead man
Your friends and mine don't call no more
Hell, I thought it was best but now I feel branded
Breaking up's sometimes like breaking the law 

[x2]

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
They must've had the whole thing planned
There must have been a hundred
If we make a stand
I think we'll be outnumbered
If I'd had the chance
Then I could understand
Why I'm a juvenile delinquent
In an east end gang

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you think you've seen gasoline
Burning in my eyes
Don't be alarmed, and tell yourself
It's good to be, it's good to be alive

[Chorus]
It's just another street kid on your tail
Running on the wrong side of the rails
With my boot lace tie and my hand-me-downs
You know I run the toughest bunch this side of town
Those street kids making news just being around

[Verse 2]
I've been bottled and been brained
Squealers can't be trusted
Ooh, if we fight tonight
You can bet we'll all be busted
I'd like to break away
From the rut I'm in
But beggars can't be choosers
Yeah, and I was born to sin

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you think you've seen gasoline
Burning in my eyes
Don't be alarmed, and tell yourself
It's good to be, it's good to be alive

[Chorus]
It's just another street kid on your tail
Running on the wrong side of the rails
With my boot lace tie and my hand-me-downs
You know I run the toughest bunch this side of town
Those street kids making news just being around

[Post-Chorus]
Let's hear it for the street kids
Making news just being around
Let's hear it for the street kids
Making news just being around
Let's hear it for the street kids

[Pre-Chorus]

[Outro]
Just another street kid making news just being around
Just another street kid
Just another street kid
Just another street kid making news just being around
Just another street kid
Just another street kid
Just another street kid making news just being around
Street kid
Street kid
Making news just being around
Street kid
Street kid
Street kid
Making news just being around
Street kid
Street kid
Street kid
Making news just being around
Just another street kid
Just another street kid
Just another street kid making news just being around
Making news just being around

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy, staring at the same four walls
Waiting for the working day to end
Then I get home so wasted, worn out, I curse at you and tell you
How I've done the work of ten to fifteen men

[Pre-Chorus 1]
How I've struggled for my money, sweated blood to get us by, yeah
Well I'm tired of it honey, Think I'm gonna have to leave here for a while

[Chorus 1]
All you hear are hard luck stories
And the ways I look at life
And the way I think the world treats me
And the way that I treat my wife

[Verse 2]
I never seem to look at you, and see that somewhere underneath
A pair of tired eyes are crying out
Well you know I work hard all day long, let me kiss you once with meaning
Just to kill this nagging doubt

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well you don't deny I do you proud
And you expect me to be tired
You say there's no future in our lives
While i persist i'm putting out the fire

[Chorus 2]
All you hear are hard luck stories
Just a few well chosen words
Because you're still the woman of a working man
You've got the heart of a working girl

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
All you hear are hard luck stories
And the ways I look at life
And the way I think the world treats me
And the way that I treat my wife

[Verse 1]
Don't close the shades, I'm scared of the darkness
I'm cold as a razor blade, inches from madness
Don't let me sleep here, they're all trying to kill me
I've seen the walls moving, they've all heard me screaming, screaming

[Chorus]
Feed me
Feed my needs and then just leave me
Let me go back where you found me
Because I miss my basement
The sweet smell of new paint
The warmth and the comforts of home
So feed me
Give me my treatment and free me
My arms are so hungry so feed me

[Verse 2]
The room's so distorted, and filled with mad shadows
I feel like a carcass, white like a marrow bone
It all seems so long ago, I remember them laughing
I heard the ambulance scream, I saw the red light flashing, flashing

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Feed me

[Verse]
Take the wheel I hear the timbers creaking
Take the wheel I think this ship is sinking
Jamaica seems so far and I've been thinking
Old billy bones has gone to sea and quit his dockside drinking

[Chorus]
Check It out, check it out, check it out

[Verse 2]
And when I'm dead who'll fly the white bird home
I'm not the ancient mariner your children know
And the sea's the field these old jack tars have sown
Because billy bones just wants to know who'll fly the white bird home

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh your majesty, your majesty
I heard the bosun cry
Old billy bones has washed ashore
Upon a foreign tide

[Chorus] x2

[Bridge]

[Outro]
Check It out, check it out, check it out
Check It out, check it out, check it out
Check It out, check it out, check it out
Check It out, check it out, check it out

[Verse 1]
Wow
She's such a charmer oh no
Wow
She's such a charmer oh no
Why she's always looking at me
Why she's always looking at me
Wow
She's such a charmer oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
Wow
She stole my karma oh no
Sold it to the farmer oh no
Why she's always looking at me
Why she's always looking at me
Wow
She's such a charmer oh no, oh no

[Verse 3]
Born
In West Virginia oh no
Married
To the preacher oh no
Why she's always looking at me
Why she's always looking at me
Wow
She's such a charmer oh no, oh no
{Outro}
Why she's always looking at me
Why she's always looking at me
Wow
She's such a charmer oh no, oh no

[Verse 1]
On a bench, on the beach just before the sun had gone
I tried to reach you, plain faced and falling fast
You looked so vacant like an empty shell
Whose life had passed upon the ocean
Before light shook the sky, down by the docks I saw
The masts unfolding
Don't turn away, please understand, it's a life and a living
And a way to keep the wolves away from hungry hands, from hungry hands

[Chorus]
Crazy water takes my fishing boat on Monday morning
Dangerous dreaming
If we all believe in the things you believe you're seeing
Oh, we'd never drop our nets in the crazy water, crazy water

[Verse 2]
Tangled lives, lonely wives
Shoreline widows pray for the souls of missing whalers
Endless nights on an endless sea where nothing lives between us
Just the breakers on the ocean
Separating you and me, ooh, separating you and me

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Bridge]
Crazy water

[x8]

[Outro]
In the crazy, crazy water
In the crazy, crazy, crazy water
Crazy, crazy, crazy water

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Tonight, do we have to fight again?
Tonight, I just wanna go to sleep
Turn out the light, but you wanna carry grudges
Oh, nine times outta ten, I see the storm approaching
Long before the rain starts falling

[Verse 2]
Tonight, does it have to be the old thing?
Tonight, oh, it's late, too late
To chase the rainbow that you're after
I'd like to find a compromise, ooh, and place it in your hands
My eyes are blind, my ears can't hear
Oh, and I cannot find the time

[Chorus]
Tonight, just let the curtains close in silence
Tonight, why not approach with less defiance?
The man who'd love to see you smile
Who'd love to see you smile tonight

[Chorus]
Tonight, just let the curtains close in silence
Tonight, why not approach with less defiance?
The man who'd love to see you smile
The man who'd love to see you smile
The man who'd love to see you smile tonight

[Verse 1]
Saw a Cadillac for the first time yesterday
I'd always seen horses, buggies, bales of hay
Because progress here, don't move with modern times
There's nothing to steal
So, there's not a great deal of crime

[Chorus 1]
It sure is hell living in a one horse town
There's half a mile of Alabama mud bed ground
Nothing much doing of an afternoon
Unless you're sitting in a rocking chair, just picking a tune

[Chorus 2]
And they aren't too well acquainted with the stars and stripes
But if you want to hear Susanna, then they'll pick all night
They'll pick all night

[Verse 2]
Because it's no dice living in a one horse town
Laid back, as my old coon hound
And I just can't wait to get out of this one horse town
There's nothing to steal cause there's simply nothing much around

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
The last I heard of you
You were somewhere on a cruise in Mediterranean
So imagine my surprise
To see you very much alive in the English rain again

[Chorus 1]
And I can still recall wet afternoons
When we were small and simply childish
But you've created your own ghost
And the need you have is more than most to hide it

[Chorus 2]
Oh, chameleon, you're stealing your way back into my eyes
Beyond a shadow of a doubt, you're a devil, you're a devil in disguise
Do you really change me or am I going crazy?
Chameleon, chameleon, chameleon, you're free again, my child

[Verse 2]
I remember still those lazy summer days
We'd kill out hunting danger
And we were alien to all outsiders
We had no desire to talk to strangers

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Chameleon 

[x9]

[Verse 1]
Crime in the streets
I read about it everyday in the papers
And justice needs and justice wants

[Bridge]
But just in times, yes, too late here
Oh, feels like I wasn't born there
(Feels like I wasn't born there)
I feel just like a Boogie Pilgrim, oh, huh, yeah

[Chorus]
Boogie Pilgrim, hustled to get it, to get it together
Down on the jive talk, down on the weather
Boogie Pilgrim, oh, brother I never felt better

No, I never felt better

[Verse 2]
Low life's complete
When you've lived that way out on the sidewalk
(Walking on the sidewalk everyday)
Oh, I got the speed, baby, you got the need, ah,uh

[Bridge]
But the need in me needs nothing
(But you know that I need nothing)
But I know that you all want something
Oh, just like Boogie Pilgrim, Boogie Pilgrim

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Yeah, I know I'm better
(Don't you know that I never felt better)
No, I'm never, never, never felt better
(Don't you know that I never felt better)

Don't you know that I never felt better 

[x4]

[Chorus]
Boogie, Boogie, Boogie Pilgrim, yeah
Oh, lord I never felt better, yeah
(Don't you know that I never felt better)

Ooh hoo, ooh hoo, ooh hoo

[Chorus]

Yeah
(You know that I never felt better)

[Outro]
Boogie Pilgrim

[x16]

[Verse 1]
Showboat coming up the river
See her lanterns flicker in the gentle breeze
I can hear the crickets singing in the evening
Old Dixie Lily moving past the cypress trees
My little boat she rocks easy
I've been catching catfish in the creek all day
Oh and I've never seen ladies like those on the big boats
Must be fancy breeding lets you live that way

[Chorus]
Dixie Lily, chugging like a grand old lady
Paddles hitting home in the noonday sun
Ploughing through the water with your whistles blowing
Down from Louisiana on the Vicksburg run

[Verse 2]
Papa says that I'm a dreamer
Says them skeetas bit me one too many times
Oh but I never get lonesome living on the river
Watching old Lily leave the world behind

[Chorus]

[x2]
Oh ma cameo molesting
Kee pa a poorer for tea
Solar prestige a gammon
Lantern or turbert paw kwee

Solar prestige a gammon
Kool kar kyrie kay salmon
Har ring molassis abounding
Common lap kitch sardin a poor floundin

Cod ee say oo pay a loto
My zeta prestige toupay a floored
Ray indee pako a gammon
Solar prestige a pako can nord

Solar prestige a gammon
Kool kar kyrie kay salmon
Har ring molassis abounding
Common lap kitch sardin a poor floundin

Solar prestige a gammon
Kool kar kyrie kay salmon
Har ring molassis abounding
Common lap kitch sardin a poor floundin

[Verse 1]
I've a constant ache in the morning light
It's on account of the night before
Some Park Lane lady in a shady bar
Took a fancy to the watch I wore
But I can still remember how she laughed at me
As I spun around and hit the bed
She said thank you honey, forget about the money
This pretty watch'll do instead

[Chorus]
City living woman, you're so static
Matching your men with a hook and eye
If you're gonna spend the summer in New York City
Them women oh oh oh they're gonna slice your pie

[Verse 2]
Said you're so static, baby I've had it
Rolling in a yellow cab
Downtown hustlers trying to pull some muscle
If they catch you, oh oh oh it could turn out bad
It's a show me what you want, I'll show you what I've got
I can show you a real good time
She's a friend indeed of a friend in need
But you'll be sorry when she leaves you crying

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
You don't pass your time in limbo
Or hang out with the crowd
Sitting on the stoop like a little girl
Who took the wrong road into town
But you got that short cut way about you
And no one's going to stare you down
You cook much better on a lower flame
You burn much better when the sun goes down

[Chorus]
And heaven can wait
But you ought to be a saint
I got your very best intentions
Helping me along
And if I ever fail to mention
You were an overnight sensation
Well take it from me
My baby's a saint 

[2x]

[Verse 2]
I believe you were a new arrival
On the fast train passing through
And you traded in your luck for survival
To sweeten up the witch's brew
You had a better way of working magic
A little mystery in your eyes
Instead of rolling over you remained the same
You took the whole world by surprise

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Now, it was just like Frankie and Johnny
And it was just like Stagger Lee
Dolly Summers was a simple girl
From a mid-west family
With a stucco home and her own Mustang
And a charge account at sears
She had everything that a girl could want
To live happy for the rest of her years
But the thing that she wanted most of all
Was the thing that she had lost
To the arms of a downtown black jack hustler
By the name of Candy floss
They'd slipped town on a late night train
Heading for the west
Dolly slipped behind the wheel of her mustang
With a piece between her breast

[Chorus]
She put a pistol in her shoulder holster
She took her car up from Santa Fe
Yesterday morning she was washing dishes
Now she's hunting down a runaway
Don't judge a man by a misdemeanor
You may be sorry when his light goes out
Don't put that pistol in your shoulder holster
You can never, never tell if the Law's about

[Verse 5]
If it seemed just like a movie
Or a night of bad TV
They should have had a picture of Dolly's face
As she drove across the country
With daggers drawn for her fallen man
An venom in her heart
It was nearly dawn when she caught them up
Making out in a picnic park
But the thing that shook her rigid
As she fumbled for her gun
Was the state of the man that she'd married once
And thought of as the only one
And as she looked back on the chances
That she'd passed up at home
Well, she quietly dumped pistol in a ditch
And she headed home alone

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You can never, never tell if the Law's about 

[x8]

[Verse 1]
Say what you will but I'm a stinker
I come crawling up out of my hole
Dirt in my toes, dirt up my nose
I'm a perfect curse to pest control
Seeds and weeds and muddy meals
Crawling around the earth
Down in the ground where the sun don't pound
I hibernate in English turf

[Chorus]
Better believe it, I'm a stinker
Burning vermin stink
Watch me get as high as a heat wave honey
Tell me what you hound dogs think

[Verse 2]
Set in my styles with a beady eye
I got connections with the underground
Call me a common rodent boy
Sitting here safe and sound

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Some mole hill mother sauntered by
Acting like the ace of spades
Don't give that cutey no reason to shoot me
When I'm living on the eggs she laid

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Through a mutual agreement, we got that aching feeling
To look up one another one more time
Tracking down the zip codes
Sealing down those envelopes
Lack of communication on the telephone line
But don't judge us by distance
Or the difference between us
Try to look at it with an open mind
For where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world
Well we've both ridden the wagon bit the tail off the dragon
Borne our swords like steel knights on the highway
Washing down the dirt roads
Hosing off our dirty clothes
Coming to terms with the times that we couldn't but we tried

[Chorus]
Where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world

[Verse 2]
Door to door they would whisper, will they ever get together
Their rooms are different temperatures I'm told
There's a change in their thinking
And their habits seem uneven
But together the two of them were mining gold

[Chorus]

[x2]
But where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world

[Outro]

[x3]
Two rooms at the end of the world

[Verse 1]
I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

[Verse 2]
Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

[Verse 3]
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, yeah
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

[Verse 1]
"An extremely quiet child" they called you in your school reports
"He's always taken interest in the subjects that he's taught"
So what was it that brought the squad car screaming up your drive
To notify your parents of the manner in which you died
At St. Patrick's every Sunday, Father Fletcher heard your sins
"Oh, he's unconcerned with competition he never cares to win"
But blood stained a young hand that never held a gun
And his parents never thought of him as their troubled son

[Chorus]
"Now you'll never get to Heaven" Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
"Grow up straight and true blue
Run along to bed"
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking

[Verse 2]
They had you holed up in a downtown bar screaming for a priest
Some gook said "His brain's just snapped" then someone called the police
You'd knifed a Negro waiter who had tried to calm you down
Oh you'd pulled a gun and told them all to lay still on the ground
Promising to hurt no one, providing they were still
A young man tried to make a break, with tear-filled eyes you killed
That gun butt felt so smooth and warm cradled in your palm
Oh your childhood cried out in your head "they mean to do you harm"

[Chorus]
"Don't ever ride on the devil's knee" Mama said
Remember mama said
Ticking, ticking
"Pay your penance well, my child
Fear where angels tread"
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking

[Verse 3]
Within an hour the news had reached the media machine
A male caucasian with a gun had gone berserk in Queens
The area had been sealed off, the kids sent home from school
Fourteen people lying dead in a bar they called the Kicking Mule
Oh they pleaded to your sanity for the sake of those inside
"Throw out your gun, walk out slow just keep your hands held high"
But they pumped you full of rifle shells as you stepped out the door
Oh you danced in death like a marionette on the vengeance of the law

[Chorus]
"You've slept too long in silence" Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
"Crazy boy, you'll only wind up with strange notions in your head"
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking

[Verse 1]
It's paradise here where the sun meets the sea
There's nothing to fear and so much to be
But soon I must go, say goodbye to it all
That homeland of mine is beginning to call

[Chorus]
Goodbye doesn't mean this has to be the end
Fading dreams grow cold as ice
And I got a feeling we will meet again
When we return to paradise

[Verse 2]
The wind in our hair and the sun in our eyes
There's no need for tears and no time for lies
So reach out your hand and I'll reach out my heart
Remember me while we are apart

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Outro]
I'm heading homeward
Leaving sunshine and heading for rain
But we'll return to paradise again

[Verse 1]
I got feet sticking out of my shoes
I got heat more than I can use
I got love, I got all I need
I got soles that are wearing thin
I got holes where the rain gets in
I got you and that's enough for me

[Chorus]
I don't care, I don't care 

[x3]
I don't care, long as I got your love

[Verse 2]
Clothes that are falling apart
I got a car that refuses to start
I got love, I do the best I can
I got bills piling up in the hall
I got paint peeling off the wall
I got you, I'm a happy man

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
It isn't going to be easy from now on
You've been messing around while I've been gone
But sometimes telling the truth can be unkind
Folks who suffer guilt can be so blind
It isn't going to be easy I can tell
Just how empty I'm feeling you know damn well
I'm telling you it ain't gonna be easy from the start
Look out honey you're playing with my heart
It isn't going to be easy and that's for sure
Changing things back the way they were before
Once you've lifted the lid on such pain
It isn't easy to put it back again
It isn't going to be easy to forget
Now you've been seeing a man that I am not met
I'm telling you that it ain't gonna be easy from the start
Look out baby, you're playing with my heart
It isn't going to be so easy this time around
Turning back the clock on what's gone down
Oh there comes a time when you need to make a stand
You got to play your cards or fold a losing hand

[Chorus]
And it isn't going to be easy and that's no lie
But if you're willing to try it so am I
It ain't gonna be so easy from the start
You better look out darling, you're playing with my heart

[Chorus 2]
It isn't going to be easy, it isn't going to be easy

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
It isn't going to be so from the start
It isn't going to be easy from the start
It isn't going to be isn't going to be easy be so easy
Easy easy easy easy easy easy yeah
It isn't going to be so easy

[Chorus 3]

[x2]
It isn't going to be so easy from the start, you got my heart
And it isn't going to be so easy from the start
It isn't going to be so easy from the start
It isn't going to be so easy easy from the start
Even from the start

[Verse 1]
Part-time love is bringin' me down
'Cause I just can't get it started with you, my love
Did I hear you sayin' that I'm too hard-hearted
Wipe those stars from your eyes
And you'll get quite a surprise
Because you'll see everybody's got a part-time love

[Verse 2]
You've been seen runnin' around
There's not much I don't a-hear of, and a-still, you try
Tellin' me all the things I must stay clear of
Don't tell me what to do
When you been doin' it too
Because you, me and everybody's got a part-time love

[Bridge]
Fallin', I'm fallin', can't get free
Baby, if you keep on stallin'
Oh, how can I make you see
That you, me and everybody needs a part-time love

[Verse 3]
Part-time love
I seem to be pullin' in the wrong direction with you, my love
Whatever I do, you raise the same objection
Now, I've got someone at home
But she's got a love of her own
Because you, me and everybody got a part-time love

[Outro]
I'm waitin', I'm waitin' all the time
And it's gettin' so frustratin'
Love, well it ain't no crime
Because you, me and everybody needs a part-time love
No, you, me and everybody's got a part-time love
No, you and me and everybody needs a part-time love
You, me, everybody got a part-time love

[Verse 1]
When it's springtime down in Georgia
It's winter time up in Maine
You can go from snow to sunshine
If you board a southbound train
You get used to taking orders
But it's sometimes kind of rough
I got everything that a man could need
But it still isn't quite enough

[Chorus]
Taking about oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel my life is rolling on
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before I'm gone

[Verse 2]
When it's nighttime down in Georgia
It's daytime in L.A
Where they never seem to do much
But they sure got lots to say
The times are changing down in Georgia
Though not always for the best
Give me thirty five good acres lord
And let progress take the rest

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel that life has passed me by
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before I die 

[x2]

[Verse]
I recall how it used to be
In my younger days
I built a wall all around my heart
To keep the pain away
I built it tall and I built it wide
I left no room for doubt
Your love still found its way inside
And couldn't get back out
I'm breaking down the barriers
Making up my mind
I'm breaking down the barriers of time
I'm taking down the barriers
And loving what I find
I'm breaking down the barriers that lie
Between your love and mine
I guess you know you were not the first
You may not be the last
But you have shown me a better way
And now I'm learning fast
You got to go where the feeling flows
I take it while it's hot
You got to give if you want to get
And I want all you got

[Verse 1]
I built a wall in China, I sank an ocean liner
I've wrecked homes, I've burned thrones, chasing the crown
I've put thorns in your feet, I spread plague in the streets
I've sprung traps, confused maps, chasing the crown

[Chorus]
Chasing the crown 'til he bites the apple
I was licking my lips 'til the sun come down
I'm chasing the crown, crown, I'm chasing the crown
I'm taking a turn in the right direction
By leaving his soul in the lost and found
I'm chasing the crown, I'm chasing the crown

[Verse 2]
I saw the tea float in Boston, I saw the live wire shock 'em
I made them float, I made them drown, chasing them 'round
I laid the desert sands, I froze the polar caps
Well, they'd dry out, and I'd shout "Hey, I'm chasing the crown"

[Chorus]
Chasing the crown 'til he bites the apple
I was licking my lips when the sun come down
I'm chasing the crown, crown, I'm chasing the crown
I'm taking a turn in the right direction
By leaving his soul in the lost and found
I'm chasing the crown, I'm chasing the crown (Hey)
(Hey)

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
I'm chasing the crown 'til he bites the apple
I was licking my lips 'til the sun come down
I'm chasing the crown, crown, I'm chasing the crown
I'm taking a turn in the right direction
By leaving his soul in the lost and found
I'm chasing the crown, I'm chasing the crown

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
I built a wall in China, I sank an ocean liner
I've wrecked homes, I've burned thrones, chasing the crown
I've put thorns in your feet, I spread plague in the streets
I've sprung traps, I've confused maps, chasing the crown
I saw the tea float in Boston, I saw the live wire shock 'em
Made them float, made them drown, chasing them 'round
I built a wall, I built a wall in China
I'm chasing the crown

[Verse 1]
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much love, little Jeannie
And you take it where it strikes
And give it to the likes of me
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much love, little Jeannie
So I see you when I can
You make me all a man can be

[Chorus]
And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others who would treat you cruel
And oh, Jeannie, you were always someone's fool

[Verse 2]
Little Jeannie
You got so much time, little Jeannie
Though you've grown beyond your years
You still retain the fears of youth
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much time, little Jeannie
But you're burnin' it up so fast
Searchin' for some lasting truth

[Chorus]
And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others who would treat you cruel
But oh, Jeannie, I will always be your fool

[Chorus]
And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others, and I've known quite a few
But oh, Jeannie, I'm still in love with you

[Coda]
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love, I'm so in love
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love, I'm so in love

[Verse 1]
You've a certain sartorial eloquence
And a style that's almost of your own
You've got the knack of being so laid-back
It's like talking to the great Unknown
You've got a self-sufficient swept-back hairdo
Pretty certain that you've got it made
Oh your life-style shows in the clothes you chose
Sitting pretty in the masquerade

[Chorus 1]
Sing it
Don't you want to play this game no more
Don't you want to play no more
Don't you want to play this game no more
Don't you want to play no more

[Verse 2]
You remain the only main contender
Though you never, you never meant to lose at all
Down at the mouth yet unsurrounded
Adamant before the fall
Though when you go you know I might be lonesome
But I'll keep it under close control
Go and get your kicks and babe let's call it quits
I believe I'm feeling indisposed

[Chorus 2]
Don't you want to play this game no more
When you go you know I might be lonesome
But I'll keep it under close control
Go and get your kicks and babe let's call it quits
I believe I'm feeling indisposed

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
Don't you want to play this game

[x2]

[Chorus 2]
When you go you know I might be lonesome
But I'll keep it under close control
Go and get your kicks and babe, let's call that quits
I believe I'm feeling indisposed, sing it

[Chorus 1]

[x2]

[Outro]
Don't you want to play no more

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Dust settles on a thin cloud
Sends a fog drifting to a worn out crowd
I've had my face in a mirror for twenty four hours
Staring at a line of white powder
High-priced madness pays the tab
I've scraped too much of nothing from your plastic bag
I'm a catatonic son of a bitch who's had
A touch too much of white powder

[Chorus 1]
And she's a habit I can't handle
For a reason I can't say
I'm in love with a wild white lady
She's as sweet as the stories say

[Chorus 2]
White powder, white lady
You're one and the same
Come on down to my house won't you
And hit this boy again

[Chorus 2]
White powder
(White powder)
White lady
(White lady)
You're one and the same
Come on down to my house, won't you?
And hit this boy again

[Verse 2]
Shock waves to a tired brain
Sends that hungry lady to my door again
She's my shelter from the storm when I feel the rain
Entertaining white powder
I feel I'm dry-docked and tongue-tied
Heaven sends a stretcher for the kids to ride
I might just escape while the others might die
Riding on a high of white powder

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
I feel I'm dry-docked and tongue-tied
Heaven sends a stretcher for the kids to ride
I might just escape while the others might die
Riding on a high of white powder

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[x3]
White powder
White lady
(White lady)
Hit this boy again

[Verse 1]
Dear God, are you there
Can you hear me, do you care
Dear God, here are we
Less than perfect, far from free

[Chorus]
Oh we take what we get and we don't take no more
But we sometimes forget what it was you created us for

[Verse 2]
Dear God, now's the time
If you're listening, show some sign
Dear God, hear me plead
Don't desert us in our need
Dear God, lend a hand
Is this really what you planned
Dear God, in you we trust
Though we've failed you, don't fail us

[Chorus]
Oh we take what we get but we can't take much more
Do you sometimes forget what it was you created us for, dear God

[Outro]
I hope and pray you'll lead us to a brighter day
Out of the darkness and light up our way, dear God
I hope and pray you'll lead us to a better way
Love is the answer so light up our way, dear God
Light up our way dear God, dear God
Love is the answer so light up our way, dear God

[Verse 1]
Never meant to be so friendly
Never made the room look nice
Never heed a word of warning
Never take my own advice
I got a brand-new problem
Pretty and she's 5 foot 10
I been in love three times this week
I'm just about to fall again

[Chorus 1]
I don't want to fall in love
Never going to fall in love, again
I don't want to fall in love
Never going to fall in love
I'm never going to fall in love, again

[Verse 2]
Never meant to be so sexist
It's so hard to overcome
Trying hard to fight the feeling
Lechery can be such fun
Because everywhere there's lots of foxes
And every cat I meet's a tom
I wish she didn't make me rabid
I wish she wouldn't turn me on

[Chorus 2]
Because everywhere there's lots of foxes
And every cat I meet's a tom
I wish she didn't make me rabid
I wish she wouldn't turn me on

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
If you want my loving take me back
If you miss my touch little girl take me back
When the dreams you lean on are beginning to crack
Open up your heart little girl and take me back
If you want my loving then take me back
If you're on your own little girl take me back
When the nights grow longer turning blacker than black
Open up your heart little girl and take me back

[Chorus]

[x2]
Playing a part you're well prepared for, there you stand
With all I ever cared for in your hand
I'm waiting all the time
For some kind of sign from you
And I'll go on and on this way
Waiting for the day
When I will hear you say
You'll take me back

[Verse 2]
If you want my loving well take me back
If you're feeling down little girl
Then you'll take me back
When you look around you for the love that you lack
Open up your heart little girl
You got my heart little girl
Make a start little girl
And say you'll take me back
Take me back

[Verse 1]
You've been crying, and I'm crazy about you
I've been lying, and hanging you up, because
I'm deep on the inside, but flash on the outside
I am the thunder, and you are my lightning
Give me the love, baby, give me the key to your heart

[x2]
Give me the love, give me the key to your heart
Months of watching, and hours of hoping
That you'd want me, when you see me again
For I am an eagle, but my wings are all tied up
You got the power to fly me again
You've been trying to build walls all around you
But you're lying, because I've already been through
And I've seen you trying to capture that feeling
But you're chasing what you've never believed in
Months of watching
And hours of hoping
That you'd want me
When you see me again
For I am an eagle
But my wings are all tied up
You got the power
To fly me again

[Chorus]

[x2]
So, give me the love, baby
Give me the key to your heart
Give me the love, baby
Give me the key to your heart
Give me the love
Give me the key to your heart

[Verse 2]
You've been trying
To build walls all around you
But you're lying
Because I've already been through
And I've seen you trying
To capture that feeling
But you're chasing
What you've never believed in

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Bridge]
Tell me you love me
Tell me you need me

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
I've got a good by-line, they all know my name
The queen of the sly line, I feed on your fame
But I got my heart in the right place, it's all in the game
If you're doing fine boy, you got my vote
But step out of line boy and I'll go for your throat
Because I got my heart in the right place, so give me a quote

[Chorus]
I'll ask you some questions, I'll tell you some lies
You'll open your heart like a friend
I'll make up some answers you won't recognise
The you I create with my pen
But my heart's in the right place now and again

[Bridge]
My heart's in the right place, know what I mean
My heart's in the right place on page seventeen

[Chorus]
I'll ask you some questions, I'll tell you some lies
You don't understand, but you will
I'll make up some answers, cut you down to size
Then I move in for the kill
But my heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place, it's part of the skill

[Verse 2]
Heart's in the right place
I'm going to destroy you and your reputation
Don't count for nothing with me
Because I'm an old bitch you see and my heart's in the right place
Don't you agree

[Outro]
Heart's in the right place, just wait and see
Heart's in the right place, don't you agree

[Verse 1: 2D]
When you're smoking tin foil in the morning
It's gonna be a cold day
When you're keeping everything inside you
It can only hurt you

[Chorus 1: 2D]
Unrelated sounds
The sun will shine again
You hold it in your hands

[Verse 2: 2D]
This land is a young land, let it stay that way
Its pollution only turns you into
Something you don't want to see in the water
A reflection of them that you receive

[Chorus 2: 2D]
You don't own the sun
And the sun won't shine again
So maybe you're all in love
With aluminium

[Interlude: Ghostigital]
The cling and a clang is the metal in my head when I walk
I hear a sort of, this tinging noise
"Cling clang" The cling clang
So many things happen while walking
The metal in my head clangs and clings as I walk
Freaks my balance out
So the natural thought is just clogged up, totally clogged up
So we need to unplug these dams and make the natural flow
It sort of freaks me out
We need to unplug the dams
You cannot stop the natural flow of thought with a cling and a clang

[Chorus 3: 2D]
And wake me up again until
We're aluminium
You hold it in your hands
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again

[Verse 1]
Remember Belgium and the Brussels Museum
Where we piled on the front steps like stray cavaliers
Our code of living meant little to others
The few francs we saved bought some cheap souvenirs

[Chorus]
But the red lights where the cat fights make it just like Belgium
See us face down on the floor of another cheap barroom
Streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change
And your sweet madame makes it seem just like Belgium

[Verse 2]
Just like a hustler when they look attractive
It's nothing more than a slap on the back
The price tag of being just a little bit different
The first rule to learn is to keep your own distance

[Chorus]

[x2]
But the red lights where the cat fights make it just like Belgium
See us face down on the floor of another cheap barroom
Streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change
And your sweet madame makes it seem just like Belgium
Just like Belgium

[Outro]
Oh, it's just like Belgium

[x2]
Isn't that just like Belgium
Oh, it's just like Belgium
Isn't that just like Belgium

[Verse 1]
I read about how you're slow with the truth
Like any old Aesop's Fable
But when you're turtlesque, I'm a hare's breath
Into payment under the table
But some journalist got his mug shot kit
And his briefcase on his lap
But I'm tired of being linked with the K.G.B
And all that political crap

[Chorus]
Because I've seen your fascist faces
On the cover of the national papers
Staring out in black and white
From the tall gray walls on the other side
When I see your fascist faces
Then I know I've had enough
Trying to trace it or erase it
Is it foolproof or a bluff

[Verse 2]
If the boy had been blessed he'd have been arrested
On a charge of wearing red shoes
But if your pants are blue you got nothing to lose
It'll make you a patriot through and through

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
When I see your fascist faces

[Verse 1]
How come you're so understanding
When I tell you all my lies?
And pretending to believe them
See through all my alibis
And I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end, Chloe

[Verse 2]
How you handle what you live through
I can never hope to learn
Taking all the pain I give you
Loving blindly in return
And I need you more than ever
I will always be your friend, Chloe
Chloe

[Chorus]
Chloe, what you gonna do 'bout me?
Chloe, what you gonna do?
What you going to do 'bout me?

[Verse 3]
You're the lifeline that I cling to
When I feel like giving in
When the dreams that I rely on
Start to wear a little thin
Then I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end, Chloe, mm
Chloe

[Chorus]
Chloe, what you gonna do 'bout me?
Chloe, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do about me?

[Verse 4]
And I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end, Chloe, mm
Chloe

[Chorus]
Chloe, what you gonna do 'bout me?
Chloe, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do 'bout me?
What you gonna do 'bout me?

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood an log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go
Go Johnny go go go

[x4]
Go go Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sat beneath the tree by the railroad track
An engineer could see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
The People passing by, they would stop and say
Oh my, how that little country boy could play
His mother told him, someday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
And maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Just like a broken marriage, when two people just don't care
Like when the cupboard is empty or there's no food in the Frigidaire

[Chorus 1]
I'm a page from the end of the story
No closer to my hope and glory
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

[Verse 2]
How come it gets so disturbing, when two ships pass in the storm
Who knows how high the crow flies, who knows where this refugee was born

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
And just for the sake of all these reasons
Rains wash out the fires within
Fires that help to keep you moving
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

[Verse 3]
You don't deserve that treatment, I can't pretend I was that nice
I'm no E ticket ride to Disneyland, I'm no cushy first class flight
I'm a day behind your restless wings
You, you rather have the wealth of kings
Me, I'd rather be on the heels of the wind

[Chorus 2]
And just for the sake of all these reasons
Rains wash out the fires within
The fires that help to keep you moving
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

[x2]

[Chorus 2]
And just for the sake of all these reasons
Rains wash out the fires within
Fires that help to keep you moving
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

[Outro]
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

[x3]
Well mama, just a kick away, just a kick away
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

[Verse 1]
Staring all alone and your grace and style
Cut me to the bone with your razor blade smile
I watched you playing pool
It's all around the school that I love you
I love your gypsy hair and dark brown eyes
Always unprepared for your pointed replies
Cynical and lean
I lie awake and dream about you

[Chorus]
If you only knew what I'm going through
Time and again I get ashamed to say your name
It's hard to grin and bear when you're standing there
My lips are dry, I catch your eye and look away

[Verse 2]
Sitting in my room, I've got it bad
Crying for the moon, they think I'm mad
They say it isn't real but I know what I feel and I love you

[Chorus]
If you only knew what I'm going through
Time and again I get ashamed to say your name
It's hard to grin and bear when you're standing there
My lips are dry, I catch your eye and look away

[Outro]
Sitting in my room, I've got it bad
Crying for the moon, they think I'm mad
But I would give my life for a single night beside you

[Verse 1]
Being wiry and thinking loudly
About the things sent to make you move
You can't help it, there's no one in the world
Knows you just, just the way you do

[Chorus 1]
So we keep darting through the holes
As the hunter and the fox
Run the gauntlet's savage road

[Verse 2]
Winter's heavy and partly cloudy
And the snowfall leaves the tracks that catch a few
Bit if you're wiley, you will leave them lying
Snared up in the traps that they set for you
And it's an evergreen affair
As temptation taunts the fox
Into the hunter's waiting lair

[Chorus 2]
And for mile after mile you'll never see me tire
You'll never see me slow down, for a while
Because I am the fox, like it or not

[Chorus 3]
I'm always going to be there running over the rock
Yes I am the fox, a fascinating cross
Of sharp as a whip and tough as an ox
Yes I am the fox

[Verse 3]
It may sound crazy but it's often lonely
And the restless heart should be captured once in a while
Then you can use them, and you often fool them
Into believing whatever you desire

[Chorus 4]
So I'll keep moving through the night
The hunter and the hunted
On their designated flights

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 4]

[Outro]
The designated flights

[Verse 1]
They must have loved each other once
But that was many years ago
And by the time I came along
Things were already going wrong
I felt the pain in their pretense
The side they tried hard not to show
But through the simple eyes of youth
It wasn't hard to see the truth

[Chorus]
And in the end nobody wins
When love begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins

[Verse 2]
They must have loved each other once
Before the magic slipped away
And as their life became a lie
What love remained began to die
I used to hide beneath the sheets
I prayed that time would find a way
But with the passing of the years
I watched as laughter turned to tears

[Chorus]
And in the end nobody wins
When love begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins

[Verse 3]
We used to love each other once
With all the passion we possessed
But people change as time goes by
Some feelings grow while others die
But if we learn from what we see
And face the truth while we still can
Then though the passion may be gone
Some kind of love can still live on

[Chorus]
And in the end nobody wins
When love begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins

[Outro]
Nobody wins, nobody wins
La-la-la-la, la-la, la-la
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins
(Nobody wins) Nobody wins
(Nobody wins) Nobody wins
(Nobody wins) Nobody wins
(Nobody wins) Nobody wins
(Nobody wins) Nobody wins

[Verse 1]
City boy, city girl
Arm in arm in our city world
A lot of love, a lot of hope
Hope our love don't go up in smoke
I feel so good, yeah I feel so fine
I know I'm yours and I know you're mine
Feeling good, yeah I'm feeling fine
Now you're mine, now you're mine, now you're mine

[Chorus 1]
Warm love in a cold world

[x2]
Hope we're going to make it

[x2]

[Chorus 2]
Warm love in a cold world

[x2]
Girl we got to make it

[x2]

[Chorus 3]
Warm love in a cold world
Sure we're going to make it

[x3]
We're going to make it

[Verse 2]
Never knew, but thanks to you
I'm finding out just what love can do
You picked me up, I've come alive
I'm seeing life in another light
Feel so good, yeah I feel so fine
I know I'm yours and I know you're mine
Feeling good, yeah I'm feeling fine
Now you're mine, now you're mine, now you're mine

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Verse]
You've been crying
And there isn't no use denying
It was me
Who put you through this misery
And I'd like to say I'm sorry
But I can't, no I can't
Nothing's going to change me
Baby, that's the way I am
I was born bad
Always been the same, yes I was born bad
Never gonna change cause I was born bad
Only me to blame cause I was born bad
Yes I was born bad
Always been my habit, I was born bad
Just can't seem to help it, I was born bad
Always going to happen, I was born bad
Because I was born bad
I mistreat you
And you know I always cheat you
But that's me
And that's the it's always been
And I'd like to say I'm sorry
But I can't, no I can't
Nothing's gonna change me
Baby, that's the way I am

[Verse 1]
We still sit at separate tables
And we sleep at different times
And the warm wind in the palm trees
Hasn't helped to change our minds
It was the lure of the tropics
That I thought might heal the scars
Of a love burned out by silence
In a marriage minus heart

[Pre-Chorus]
And I call the kids on the telephone
Say there's something wrong out here
It's July but it's cold as Christmas
In the middle of the year

[Chorus 1]
The temperature's up to ninety five
But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes
And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here
So how come it's cold as Christmas in the middle of the year?

[Verse 2]
I dreamed of love in a better climate
And for what it's really worth
I put faith in the star we followed
To this Caribbean surf
But there's an icy fringe on everything
And I cannot find the lines
Where's the beauty in the beast we made
Why the frost in the summertime

[Pre-Chorus]
And I call the kids on the telephone
Say there's something wrong out here
It's July but it's cold as Christmas
In the middle of the year

[Chorus 2]
The temperature's up to ninety five
But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes
And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here
So how come it's cold as Christmas in the middle of the year?

[Chorus 1]
The temperature's up to ninety five
But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes
And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here
So how come it's cold as Christmas in the middle of the year?

[Hook]
(Ooh!)

[Ad-libs until fade-out]
Cold as christmas in the middle of the year
Cold as christmas in the middle of the year
Cold as christmas in the middle of the year
Cold as christmas in the middle of the year

Cold as christmas!
(Cold as christmas in the middle of the year)
Cold as christmas in the middle of the year

[Verse 1]
Isn't no loving tonight
My woman says she isn't my woman
I sure put up a fight
To keep it right
I used a whole lot of pride to get her
I used a whole pack of lies and begged her
She just threw me the key
And said she's free

[Chorus 1]

[x2]
Thunder in the night
Thunder in the night again
Thunder in the night again

[Chorus 2]
Frightening lightning hit me again
It's burning much deeper this time
I got them storm clouds hanging right over my head
And it's going to rain harder this time

[Chorus 3]

[x2]
Thunder, thunder

[Verse 2]
Out here searching the streets
I got to find my woman and tell her
I never wanted to cheat
But she cheated me
I never knew just how much I loved her
I never knew till I went and lost her
Now it's all too late
She's gone away

[Chorus 1]

[x2]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[x2]

[Chorus]

[x4]
Night life, hot spot light
I've got to make them dance tonight

[Verse 1]
I know that the competition's heavy
I know that these guys are cool
But I'll show this kid is more than ready
I sure got something to prove
Right now I'm just another guy
I don't mean nothing to them
But when they see me dance
When they see me dance

[Chorus]

[x4]

[Verse 2]
Right now the music's moving higher
I feel them stepping up the beat
These shoes will set the floor on fire
Everybody on your feet
You thought that you'd seen the best
Well I can tell you, forget the rest
When you see me dance

[x2]

[Chorus]

[x4]

[Verse 1]
He said I want to grow up
And look like Robert Mitchum
And I hope that when I'm gone
There'll be some say that I miss him
He must have been romantic
He must have sensed adventure
And I feel the steel of his strong will
In the frame around his picture

[Chorus]
And he's one more arrow flying through the air
One more arrow landing in a shady spot somewhere
Where the days and nights blend into one
And he can always feel the sun
Through the soft brown earth that holds him
Forever always young

[Verse 2]
He could have been a boxer
But the fight game seemed so dirty
We argued once he knocked me down
And he cried when he thought he'd hurt me
Strictly from the old school
He was quiet about his pain
And if one in ten could be that brave
I would never hate again

[Chorus]

[Outro]
One more arrow 

[3x]
Forever always young

[Verse 1]
Street guys, walking, dancing
Sidewalk, music, hot thing
They got their boxes tuned into their favorite show
As they truck on down the road
Is that the radio
Yes that's the radio
Let it go, let it go, let it go

[Chorus]
Street boogie got a hold on me
Street boogie going to set me free
Street boogie keep a hold on me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright with me
Street boogie, it's the city beat
Street boogie, on the boogie street
Street boogie, yeah and that's for me
Street boogie
Street boogie
Street boogie
Street boogie

[Verse 2]
Traffic, skater, rolling
Sharing, music, sure thing
He got his shoulder holster turned a way up loud
As he wheels his way around
Is that the radio
Yes that's the radio
Catch the sound, catch the sound, catch the sound

[Chorus]
Street boogie got a hold on me
Street boogie going to set me free
Street boogie keep a hold on me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright with me
Street boogie, it's the city beat
Street boogie, on the boogie street
Street boogie, yeah and that's for me

[Bridge]
Boogie, street boogie
Boogie, street boogie
Boogie, street boogie
Boogie, street boogie

[Chorus x2]
Street boogie got a hold on me
Street boogie going to set me free
Street boogie keep a hold on me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright with me
Street boogie, it's the city beat
Street boogie, on the boogie street
Street boogie, yeah and that's for me
Street boogie

[Verse 1]
You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing
You just fade away

[Chorus]
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

[Post-Chorus]
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You starting down the road, leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

[Chorus]
You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

[Post-Chorus]
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

[Post-Chorus]
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
You said you'd never fake it
You swore we'd always make it last
And it sounded so real
And I fell into your love trap
Blind, yes, I was the perfect fool
I believed every word
And it never occurred to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Is this a game?
Are you just playin'?
Will I be losin' you?

[Chorus]
Oh, am I a victim of love, victim of love?
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only usin' me?
Victim of love, victim of love
What a fool you made of me

[Verse 2]
My friends warned me about ya
I laughed, how could I doubt your love?
Then I saw you with him
And my world crumbled around me
I felt life slip away from me
There's a void inside me
Where my heart used to be

[Pre-Chorus]
So now, this was a game
You were just playin'
And now I'm losin' you

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm a victim of love, victim of love
Well, you took me for a ride
Victim of love, victim of love
Well, I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
You were only usin' me
Victim of love, victim of love
What a fool you made of me

[Chorus]
Oh, am I a victim of love, victim of love?
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only usin' me?
Victim of love, victim of love
What a fool you made of me

[Pre-Chorus]
So now, this was a game
You were just playin'
And now I'm losin' you

[Outro]
Oh, am I a victim of love, victim of love?
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only usin' me?
Victim of love, victim of love
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only usin' me?
Victim of love, victim of love
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied

[Verse 1]
Six o'clock alarm
I get the wake up call
Let that sucker jingle-jangle
Ring right off the wall
I'm too low for zero
I'm too tired to work
Tied one on with a friend last night
And wound up losing my shirt

[Chorus]
I'm too low for zero
I'm on a losing streak
I got myself in a bad patch lately
I can't seem to get much sleep
I'm too low for zero
I wind up counting sheep
Nothing seems to make much sense
It's all just Greek to me
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero

[Verse 2]
Cutting out cups of coffee
Switching off the late night news
Putting the cat out two hours early
It isn't any use
I'm too low for zero
Insomnia attacks
Watching flies with my eyes till sunrise
It's daylight when I hit the sack

[Chorus]
I'm too low for zero
I'm on a losing streak
I got myself in a bad patch lately
I can't seem to get much sleep
I'm too low for zero
I wind up counting sheep
Nothing seems to make much sense
It's all just Greek to me
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero

[Chorus]
I'm too low for zero
I'm on a losing streak
I got myself in a bad patch lately
I can't seem to get much sleep
I'm too low for zero
I wind up counting sheep
Nothing seems to make much sense
It's all just Greek to me
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero

[Outro]
For zero, for zero, for zero
I'm too low for zero
I'm too low for zero
I'm too low for zero
I'm too low for zero
I'm too low for zero
I'm too low for zero

[Verse 1]
It's a hot summer night in the blackboard jungle
Crime sits heavy on the city shoulder
Can't get no work, I can't get a job
I just sit and play my radio in the parking lot
Well they're breaking down doors in foreign countries
Everybody thinks somebody's hiding something
There's talk on the street and the nation is worried
But you can't talk back when you're dead, when you're dead and
Buried

[Chorus]
And Everybody's restless
Everybody's scared
Everybody's looking for something that just ain't there
Everybody's restless

[Verse 2]
Everybody's scared, they think we're all in danger
Everyone's taking cover from someone else's anger
The walls have ears, Big Brother's watching
They tell us that we're poisoned from everything that we're
Touching
Well we could be children from the way we're acting
We feed ourselves lies and then we scream for action
We just breed and we lose our nerve
And there's bombs going off in every corner of the world

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Well he could almost taste the money
But he was sitting in a den of thieves
Looking for the great awakening
Trying to find a way to leave
But that's when he got religion
And the light went on inside
He said somebody up there likes me
Now he's working for the holy guide
He got drunk but he don't remember
That he'd been drinking in a bar downtown
When he thought he heard a choir of angels
Singing in the Tiki Lounge
And that's when he got religion
From no salesman on TV
Just a tap on the shoulder in the parking lot
He still drinks but he does believe

[Chorus 1]
Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man
Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man

[Verse 2]
Well, she was silent as he paid her
But the thanks she got was next to none
And as her car pulled out of the motel
She felt the presence of someone

And that's when she got religion
In the front of a compact Ford
Just a gentle voice on the stereo (stereo)
Now she's a working girl who loves the lord

[Chorus 2]
Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man

Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man

[Slide guitar solo: Davey Johnstone]

[Verse 4]
And that's when she got religion
In the front of a compact Ford
Just a gentle voice on the stereo (stereo)
Now she's a working girl who loves the lord

[Chorus 3]
Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man

Religion
Mm-hm-hm
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man

[Outro]
(Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me, I could honestly say
That things can only get better

[Pre-Chorus]
And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide

[Chorus]
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

[Verse 2]
Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

[Pre-Chorus]
Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself

[Chorus]
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

[Harmonica solo: Stevie Wonder]

[Pre-Chorus]
Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself

[Chorus]
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

[Outro]
(Laughing like children, living like lovers)
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
(Laughing like children, living like lovers)
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

[Verse 1]
We're caught up in a web, you and I
Since Crystal came between us
The knots of friendship seem to be untied
And it hurts me most to cheat and that's no lie
She can swing us both forever
In the long run she's the one who must decide

[Chorus]
And if she leaves me handle her with care
Don't hurt little Crystal
And if she calls you long distance just be there
Oh Crystal
The world is your oyster, you're a pearl
But he's a jewel and my friend
I'm sure that in the end, Crystal you'll be his little girl
Oh Crystal

[Verse 2]
You're stronger than me but I'm sure
That the fight would fall to no one
The cold hard truth is stronger than us all
And it breaks my heart to see us go this far
We're just captives in our separate cells
And without her there's no peace behind these bars

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh Crystal

[x4]

[Verse 1]
Well, she looked a peach in the dress she made
When she was still her mama's little girl
And when she walked down the aisle, everybody smiled
At her innocence and curls
And when the preacher said, "Is there anyone here
Got a reason why they shouldn't wed?"

[Pre-Chorus]
I shoulda stuck up my hand
I shoulda got up to stand
And this is what I should have said

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
Long before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine
Don't say, "I do", say, "bye, bye, bye"
And lemme kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!

[Verse  2]
Underneath her veil, I could see a tear
Tricklin' down her pretty face
And when he slipped on the ring, I knew everything
Would never be the same again
But if the groom woulda known, he'd have had a fit
About his wife and the things we did

[Pre-Chorus]
And what I planned to say
Yeah, on her weddin' day
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
Long before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine
Don't say, "I do", say, "bye, bye, bye"
And lemme kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
Long before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine
Don't say, "I do", say, "bye, bye, bye"
And lemme kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!

[Outro]
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!

[Verse 1]
You're cruel, you do
You do, you do me wrong
You hurt me, you flirt with
Any old face that comes along

[Chorus]
But I won't be your whipping boy
No I won't be your whipping boy
Break me like a little toy
Run me till my feet are sore
But I won't be your whipping boy

[Verse 2]
You're wild, you're sly
What you done to me
I was thirty, I look like fifty
But I feel like sixty three

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's this illegal kind of loving
That keeps my motor running
From the start to the finish line
It's a trashy kind of me that likes to believe
That I'm still trying, I'm still trying
I'm still trying, yes I'm trying
You're dirty, but you're worth it
But you're way, you're way too young
I could do time if they found out
Look out, San Quentin here I come

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I won't be your whipping boy

[Verse 1]
I got home today, took a look around
Trying to find that girl of mine, she could not be found
All her things were gone, she just left a note
It don't take no mastermind to figure what she wrote

[Chorus]
She said, "Dear John, I'm moving on
By this time I'm going to be long gone
Dear John, c'est la vie, dear John
So long, you've seen the last of me"

[Verse 2]
I don't want her back, I won't even try
This time isn't just au revoir, this time it's goodbye
We could not go on, living like we were
I was just about to write a 'Dear John' note to her

[Chorus]
I was going to say, "Dear John, I'm moving on
By this time I'm going to be long gone
Dear John, c'est la vie, dear John
So long, you've seen the last of me"

[Chorus]
She said, "Dear John, I'm moving on
By this time I'm going to be long gone
Dear John, c'est la vie, dear John
So long, you've seen the last of me"

[Chorus]

[x2]
Dear John, I'm moving on, by this time I'm going to
Be long gone, dear John, c'est la vie, dear John, so long
Dear John, I'm moving on, by this time I'm going to
Be long gone, dear John, c'est la vie, dear John, so long

[Chorus]
I don't want to worry you none but I got the hurt on the run
I just cut out the poison that was in me so long
Watching you tear out my heart only gave me the last laugh
Watching you tear out your hair is gonna be the best part
Oh I've been shaken down by a spiteful child
I've slapped a worried frown on that evil smile
I've been taken down by a spiteful child
I've turned the tables round and it drives you wild
Oh you spiteful child

[Verse 1]
You'd better be ready to run, now I've got you under the gun
I put my money on vengeance before this race had begun
Breaking the spirit in me only added to your conceit
Playing you at your own game is going to make it complete

[Bridge]
Oh I've been shaken down by a spiteful child
Turn the tables round and it drives you wild
Oh you spiteful child

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Spiteful

[Chorus 1]
I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
You were the one to blame for tearing my world apart
I got a heart so true, you got a heart of ice
A little more love from you, it could have been paradise

[Chorus 2]
I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
And if it's all the same maybe we should part
And I'm singing do do do
I'm singing do do do

[Bridge]
You had to tie me down inside a cage of doubt
I'm sick of being kicked around so this is where I get out

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
Oh oui baby you tried to hold me but you were slowly
Driving me insane
Oh oui baby

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
I couldn't take your pain, you couldn't take my love
So I'm going to quit this game `cause baby I've had enough

[Chorus 2]

I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart

[x4]

[Outro]
And I'm singing do do do
I'm singing do do do

[Verse 1]
Your accountant called this morning
There was springtime in his heart
He couldn't wait to tell me
How he'd pulled our lives apart
And the letter from your lawyer
Lies unopened on the tray
I may get around to reading it later today
Walking round the lonely rooms
I see everything the same
But suddenly it matters
What was purchased in my name
Whether this or that was paid for
Belongs to me or you
Can the seven years together be divided by two

[Chorus]
It says something for the legal boys
But nothing much for us
That all we had together
Is so quickly ended thus
The legal boys have won again
And you and I have lost
They can't tell us how it happened
But they'll let us know the cost
Oh they'll let us know the cost, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
There's a lot I'd like to tell you
But I can't get past your guards
I do not speak their language
And they hold all the cards
I would rather call you darling
Than defendant in the case
But lovers left here long ago
And clients took their place

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I've been beaming aboard her for a light year
From a strange craft
She's got a subtle touch on the silver key
To a clockwork heart

[Chorus]
I am your robot 

[2x]
I am your robot man
I am your robot 

[2x]
I am your robot man

[Verse 2]
You went and flipped the switch and turned me positive
When I was negative
I've been stumbling around like a metal man
On the graveyard shift

[Chorus]

[2x]

[Bridge]
I am your robot and I'm programmed to love you
My serial number is 44357

[Outro]
I am your robot

[Verse 1]
Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a deep, blue sea
On a blue, blue day
Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
When the mornin' comes
I'll be far away
And I say

[Chorus 1]
Blue eyes, holdin' back the tears
Holdin' back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone again

[Verse 2]
Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a clear, blue sky
Watchin' over me
Blue eyes
Ooh, I love blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be
I will see

[Chorus 2]
Blue eyes, laughin' in the sun
Laughin' in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home, and I am home again

[Chorus 2]
Blue eyes, laughin' in the sun
Laughin' in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home again

[Verse 1]
Hey there, Georgie
Got a couple of things to say
One, you're my friend, and two, it's hurting me
Seeing you act this way
But my hands are tied and I can only try
To talk you out of a fall
Because the reputation of the woman you're dating's
About as nasty as the Berlin wall

[Pre-Chorus]
Slow down, Georgie, she's poison
Oh, man, you've got to watch yourself
She's going to get in your head, she's going to crawl in your bed
You're just a stepping stone for someone else

[Chorus]
Slow down, Georgie, she's poison
She's just another divorcee
An undercover lover of a hundred other little fish in the sea
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
You better cut her loose
Before she gets her hooks in you
If you gave her the world and it was covered in pearls
She'd only ask for the moon
She's got you hypnotised with her big brown eyes
And a body that could stop a clock
But if you think your face ain't gonna be replaced
Georgie, boy, you're in for a shock

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well, it isn't my job to rain on your parade
But if the chips were down you'd do the same for me
It's always been that way
She's got you paralysed with a pack of lies
About honour and the single girl
And if you buy that line, you must be out of your mind
You must be living in another world

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
What happened here as the New York sunset disappeared?
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain

[Verse 2]
And what's it for? This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk, nothin' grows no more
Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one, no one can replace

[Chorus]
And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', "oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?"

[Verse 3]
And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear
Who lived there? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

[Chorus]
And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', "Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?"

[Chorus]
And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', "Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out?
Can you come out to play?"

[Outro]
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?

[Verse 1]
See the changes here on every street
As time goes marching to a different beat
Moving on into the restless age
As the kids today find their feet
(Long enough to hold on)
Young enough to chase our dreams
We were captured by romantic things
Touched by love until it made us cry
How our hearts could fly without wings

[Chorus 1]
Oh won't somebody tell me
Tell me where have all the good times gone
Say that you remember
Remember all those good old Four Tops songs
Won't somebody tell me
Where have all the good times gone

[Verse 2]
Stolen moments in the smoky room
Monday mornings that would come too soon
Crazy summers that would never end
When the time was spent loving you
(Yeah we had a good time)
Some things never seem to last
Ain't it funny how we missed the past
Love has changed but the clock still turns
While the flame still burns for you

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
They've gone away
Gone they've gone away 

[2x]
They've gone away

[Verse 3]
It's hard enough to lose the game
And sad to see it played again
What makes you happy for a while
Is gonna make you smile through the rain

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Won't you please tell me where have all the good times gone

[Verse 1]
All quiet on the Western Front, nobody saw
A youth asleep in the foreign soil, planted by the war
Feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth
See the stems of Europe bend under force

[Chorus]
All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front

[Verse 2]
So tired of this garden's grief, nobody cares
Old kin kiss the small white cross, their only souvenir
See the Prussian offense fly, weren't we grand
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands

[Chorus]
All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front

[Verse 3]
It's gone all quiet on the Western Front, male angels sigh
Ghosts float in a flooded trench as Germany dies
Fever reaps the flowers of France, fair-haired boys
String the harps to Victory's voice, joyous noise

[Chorus]
All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front

All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front

[Verse 1]
There's a light on in your window
There's a shadow on the street
Two silhouettes tell me it's over
The shadow knows that shadow's me
I won't crawl I caused you trouble
Well that's the last thing I'll ever do
But before I leave your life completely
Tell me who wears these shoes, darling
Lord knows the days just get longer
The nights grow cold with you on my mind
And I feel like an old jukebox
Playing the same song all the time
If these crazy dreams don't kill me
It's more than I can take from you
Not knowing where or when I'll see you
Not knowing darling who wears these shoes

[Chorus 1]
My friends all say don't go to pieces
I say that's fine but if I lose
I want to know who's in my foot steps
I want to know who wears these shoes

[Chorus 2]
My friends all think I must be crazy
I see the facts but if it's true
I want to know who's in my footsteps
I want to know who wears these shoes, darling

[Chorus 3]
Ohh, and it's a chilling feeling
When I can't see him
What do I do
When I face the two of you

[Chorus 3]
Ohh, and it's a chilling feeling
When I can't see him
What do I do

[x2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
Darling, come on no I've got nothing to do
I want to know I want to know who wears my shoes
Come on no I've got nothing to do
I want to know I want to know who wears my shoes
I got to blue whether it's true
I got to blue whether it's true I want to know
Nothing to do I want to know I want to know
Who wears these shoes I got to blue

[Chorus 4]

[x3]
Whether it's true I got to blue
Whether it's true I want to know
Nothing to do I want to know I want to know
Who wears these shoes I got to blue

[Verse 1]
They used to say that boys are tough as nails
In every way he keeps his heart as guarded as a jail
Now things have changed, I feel so old
Like any girl could drag my heart across the coals
I was always there in the thick of things
I always had the heart of every woman on a string
The danger zone shone from my eyes
It seemed like every inch I gained became a mile

[Chorus]
It's not the night reaching in and touching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
It seems that time has killed that cruel streak in me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
It's not the light shining in and catching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
But time has come and cast a spell on me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be

[Verse 2]
And now I know what lonely means
I used to give so little and gain everything
The darkest part of every day
Is the shadow of another girl as she turns and walks away
Can't say I blame them all for being hurt
After all I treated each and every one like dirt
Who wants a heart that's never home
I face the facts and lock myself into a life alone

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
She looked so easy because she looked so young
With a geisha smile made in Taiwan
She got cherry bombs inside her eyes
And the luck of the Irish on her side
Don't let her tell you that she loves your mind
She's got her price, she can turn on a dime
Those crocodile tears ain't tears of pain
Look a little closer, that's acid rain

[Chorus]
And I don't know
Why little frigerator you're so cold
Go little frigerator go
Get away from my soul
Little frigerator you're so cold

[Verse 2]
She's calculated with the kiss of death
Got a digital mind and expensive breath
She's an empty shell, you're a piece of meat
Just another statistic on her readout sheet

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Chorus]
Deny the passenger, who want to get on 

[x3]
Want to get on
He want to get on
Want to get on
He want to get on

[Verse 1]
To make a chain of fools
You need a matching pair
One hypocritical fool
And a crowd that's never there
There's anger in the silence
There's wheels upon the jail
A black train built of bones
On a copper rail

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Company conductor
You need the salt of tears
Falling on a ticket
That no one's used in years
Non-commercial native
It's tattooed in your veins
You're living in a blood bank
And riding on this train

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The spirit's free, but you always find
Passengers stand and wait in line
Someone in front and someone else behind
But passengers always wait in line

[Verse 1]
Lipstick and lashes, the traces of stardom
Lit up on a billboard so everyone sees them in neon
Behind the counter she stares out the window
Up at the billboard that's like a reminder in neon

[Chorus 1]
She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon
For two cents of danger she'd trust anybody
She'd smoke like a gun if it meant she might wind up

[Verse 2]
In neon the dreams in the light of a promise that dies
A shimmering city, a glimmer of hope and a lie
In neon the name's gone there's no reason why anymore
Trust them and wind up alone behind a locked door

[Chorus 2]
In neon

[x2]

[Verse 3]
Pictures and patterns, the touches of glamour
Cut into a fashion that flashes above them in neon
A hot cup of coffee held in her fingers
A perfect complexion that lingers above her in neon

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
It used to be a sweet sensation
No price too high for love
Now I pay for this bitter taste
And the price is not enough
Such cruel sport for your kicks
Such hard knocks on my heart
How long before the pain ends
Tell me where living starts

[Chorus]
And lovers leap off burning buildings
Waking up on a sky high wire
Desperation leaves us clinging
On the edge of a house on fire
Lovers leap off burning buildings
Live our life on borrowed time
Every flame that ever moved you
Touched your lips but never mine
Lovers leap off burning buildings

[Verse 2]
No room for conversation
Cold stares and angry words
Fall in pieces from our faces
We read "do not disturb"
Some lovers just go hungry
Others beg for just a bite
You use me under pressure
To whet your appetite

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
It's closing time the boys are all together at the bar
Staring in their glasses
Looks like another layoff at the yard
Yesterday I heard union hall come down
They hit it with a wrecking ball
And they try but nothing changes in this town

[Chorus]
Cap in hand stood in line
Your family ties are the chains that bind
The endless wheel goes round and round
Chances are you'll never leave this town
Oh oh no

[Verse 2]
Like a river now the empty streets are flooded out with rain
It's falling on the playground
While the kids get wet playing the same old games
Locked away so many things remind them of war
They tap the pavement with their canes
The good old days ain't so good no more

[Chorus]

[x4]

[Verse]
Do you pray to someone new
When you're locked up in the rock
Is the golden age dead and gone
Are the hands stuck on the clock
Can you talk to Buddy's bones
When you spin a forty five
The king ain't dead, he's just asleep
Somewhere in the after life
And look at them boys in leather jackets
Second skin, not fade away
Danger girls love leather jackets
Play back to back, and that'll be the day
Leather jackets, that'll be the day
We all need to smell the heat
You know that things go better with chrome
Is Memphis real or just a song
Three thousand miles from home
Be a cool jerk, don't work
When fashion makes you change
Keep the faith, don't waste
Another nickel on another name
And idolise twisted cars
Like taxi cabs and spiders
Eternity's just down the road
They're looking for more riders

[Verse 1]
I found a black beret on the street today
It was lying in the gutter all torn
There's a white flag flying on a tall building
But the kids just watch the storm
Their dirty faces pressed on the windows
Shattered glass before their eyes
There's a mad dog barking in a burned out subway
Where the sniper sleeps at night

[Chorus]
No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven
No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven

[Verse 2]
There are many graves by a cold lake
As the beds were when your babies are born
And your rag doll sits with a permanent grin
I saw a black cat tease a white mouse
Until he killed it with his claws
Seems a lot of countries do the same thing
Before they go to war

[Chorus]
No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven
No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven

[Outro]
Let them cry to Heaven
Let them cry to Heaven
Let them cry to Heaven

[Verse 1]
Sling your hook in with him baby
He's a real sharp-shooter now
If he's out there hiding in the tall grass
Tell him I said he was a coward
This ain't any old western honey
It's the twentieth century now
But if he thinks he's some kind of tough cowboy
And he's hurt her then I want to know how

[Chorus]
Did he shoot her with his compromise
Like a heart attack he can paralyse
Or did he hang her in a noose
On the telephone line
Did he shoot her with a 45
Did he leave his mark right between her eyes
Oh did he shoot that girl
That used to be mine

[Verse 2]
Tell him I'm ready any time he chooses
The pay-off for the things, for the things he's done
He ain't messing with no two-bit bandit
Armed with a couple of guns
If he wants to see it as a two reel movie
He's living in the head of someone else
But better take him down and dust him honey
I want to hear the truth for myself

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
Did he shoot her 

[x2]

[Verse 1]
You say today was not so easy
Pressure tends to get the best of you
Well don't let them break your spirit
Keep the faith and you will come on through

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll head home for the weekend
You're tired and you know I'll understand
Just be waiting on the front steps baby when I get there
And take a giant step into my hands

[Chorus]
And slip into my soul glove
Pull it on we got a tight fit
Never take it off
And baby if the seam's rough
And honey if the skin's soft
You and me we go together
Oh like a soul glove

[Verse 2]
Look at me don't you believe me
Cheating hangs a noose around your neck
To shave in someone else's mirror
Is one desire I haven't dreamed of yet

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'll head home for the weekend
You're tired and you know I'll understand
Just be waiting on the front steps baby when I get there
And take a giant step into my hands

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironin' out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
'Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know

[Chorus]
Turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh)
Sad songs say so much

[Verse 2]
If someone else is sufferin' enough, oh, to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

[Chorus]
So turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh...)
You know sad songs say so much

[Bridge]
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say (ah...)
Sad songs, they say so much

[Chorus]
So turn 'em on (turn 'em on), oh, turn 'em on (turn 'em on)
Turn on those sad songs (sad songs)
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh...)
You know sad songs say so much

[Outro]
When all hope is gone
You know sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)
When everything you do is goin' wrong
Sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)

[Verse 1]
Hey Nikita, is it cold
In your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know
Oh, I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart, a captive in the snow

[Chorus]
Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

[Verse 2]
Do you ever dream of me?
And do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire
Nikita, do you count the stars at night?
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

[Chorus]
Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

[Chorus]
Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Never know anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

[Outro]
(Nikita) Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
(Nikita) Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
(Nikita) Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row

[Chorus 1]
Your mother's eyes look straight through me
Whenever we meet
Your father swears it'll never be
As long as he breaths
And how many times have they told you
That you're too young
How, how I've ached to hold you
But you're too young

[Verse 1]
If we don't buy what's right or wrong
Then we are sinners
We were never two to tag along
But we were always winners
And how many people, have told you
That you're too young
And how many jealous hands would love to hold you
Because you're too young

[Chorus 2]
Well you're too young to love me
And I'm too old for you
At least that's what they tell us
It's in their book of rules
That you're too young, too young baby you're too young
We could try it for a while
But they'd get us in the long run
They say that you're too young, baby you're too young

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse]
She's a real ball-buster, don't trust her
She's in a most peculiar phase
You can rear end her oh it'll send her
She wants you, she'll have you her own way
Don't untie her, don't defy her
Because she'll bring you down to your knees
You can beat her but don't mistreat her
Oh don't believe that woman please
Don't trust that woman
Don't trust that woman boys
Because she'll burn you
Turn you into little toys
Don't trust that woman
Don't trust that woman boys
Because she'll hurt you
And turn you into little toys
Don't trust that woman boys
She's a man-eater, oh don't you cheat her
She'll cut you just to watch you bleed
A woman half crazy, oh then again lazy
With an appetite to feed
She's a liar oh you can't buy her
Because she'll bring you down to your knees
Don't untie her, don't defy her
Oh don't believe that woman please

[Outro]
Mean sister, tongue-twister
She takes it easy but she makes it hard
Soul sister, two-fister
She takes it easy but she makes it hard

[Verse 1]
There are ladies, illegal X's
Mona Lisa's, well connected
They may be shady, English roses
Blue blooded, turned up noses
Money talks, see what it catches
Postage paid, no strings attached
She's a honey, she's a tramp
Roaring twenties, molls and vamps

[Chorus]
Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up, I only get one chance
Beasts and beauties, but they all can dance
Wrap her up, I'll taker her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up
Give her to me, wrap her up

[Verse 2]
Is she foreign, legs eleven
Italian girls, take me to heaven
You pretty babies, from Paris, France
Crazy horses, love to dance

Wrap her up

[Verse]
It's so hard to say goodbye
When there's nothing left to give
When this house is just a hill of bones
Where you and I once lived
If we put it back together
By the skin of our teeth
You'd still pull it all apart
Bit by bit, piece by piece
And I'll go it alone
Call this house my home
Build it up again with someone new
Build it brick by brick
Till I find a girl that fits
This home's a whole lot better without you
There's no passion alive
When you count your phony schemes
And the cars you drive to buy your friends
They don't ever come back clean
If the cards on the table
Always turn up spades
The cards that always cheat the hearts
The spades you play just dug my grave

[Verse 1]
Well you come on like a comet, ideas in your head
Starving for affection, waiting to be fed
Crazy like a full moon, eyes open wide
Taking in everything you need to stay alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Who leads who, who knows where
If you leave me now will I see you again

[Chorus]
I'm telling you love bites
Like a satellite
Going round and round
It's something, something you can't fight
Oh in the daylight
And even in the dark night
I want you to surround me
Surround me like a satellite

[Verse 2]
Oh you move like a shadow of your own design
Do you want to trap me in between the lines
I don't walk on water if you think I can
If you want a miracle call up a Superman

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Are we there
Is this love
Is this a space race
That we're both part of

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Well I'm running away
From this house on the hill
There's a devil inside
Sitting on the windowsill
And it's a wild Friday night
And I'm all on my own
I knocked on every door in town
There ain't one little girl that's home

[Chorus]
And everybody's got a date
And the ones that ain't are tired
What the hell do you do on a weekend, honey
When your heart's on fire
And you can go from Tokyo to Rome
Looking for a girl
But it looks to me like the weekend means
Heartache all over the world
Girls, girls, girls
Have pity on me
Oh, it looks to me like the weekend means
Heartache, heartache all over the world

[Verse 2]
He's got lipstick on his collar
She's got fishnets on her legs
I'm at home and I've got nothing
Just a cold and aching head
There must be something dirty
Just blame it on the magazines
Don't read that trash, it'll drive you crazy
'cause the cops invade your dreams

[Chorus]
And everybody's got a date
And the ones that ain't are tired
What the hell do you do on a weekend, honey
When your heart's on fire
And you can go from Tokyo to Rome
Looking for a girl
But it looks to me like the weekend means
Heartache all over the world
Girls, girls, girls
Have pity on me
Oh, it looks to me like the weekend means
There's heartache, heartache all over the world
(Girls, girls, girls)
(Tokyo to Rome)
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
And you can go from Tokyo to Rome
Looking for a girl
But it seems to me like the weekend means
Heartache all over the world
Girls, girls, girls
Have pity on me
Oh, it seems to me like the weekend means
Heartache, heartache all over the

[Outro]
(Girls, girls, girls)
(Heartache, heartache, heartache all over the world)
(Girls, girls, girls)
(Heartache, heartache, heartache all over the world)
(Girls, girls, girls)
(Heartache, heartache, heartache all over the world)
(Girls, girls, girls)
(Heartache, heartache, heartache all over the world)

[Chorus 1]
I spy headlines, newsprint tells lies
Tell me what the papers say
Save lives don't drive, everybody's got to die someday
At least that's what the papers say

[Verse 1]
Coal mines closed down
Nobody's working underground today
More jails, peace for sale
Japanese still killing whales
Teen dreams
On two inch screens
Lipstick boys all look like queens
Least that's what the papers say

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[x2]
Dope and pills, guns kill
Death just buys cheap thrills
Coal mines, closed down
Nobody's working underground today
Teen dreams, on two inch screens
Lipstick boys all look like queens
Least that's what the papers say

[Verse 1]
Well I'm keeping off the streets since you came to town
Since you claimed my heart from the lost and found
I have said goodbye to my fooling around
Now you and me babe we got candy by the pound
You and me babe we got candy by the pound
Well I never knew it could feel so good
Be the king of the hill in my neighbourhood
Rain on my roof what a sweet sound
Oh with you underneath it's like candy by the pound
With you underneath it's like candy by the pound

[Chorus 1]
You can tell everybody that this girl of mine
Is sweeter than the grapes hanging from the vine
Love like wine honey drinking till I drown
Keep it coming baby like candy by the pound

[Chorus 2]
Oh no what's come over me
If I am dreaming then let me sleep
Oh wow I'm heaven bound
Love is getting sweeter than candy by the pound

[Verse 2]
Now I'm ducking in the alley of common sense
Hiding from the claws of my old girlfriend
She's screaming murder beating my door down
While I'm right behind it I'm eating candy by the pound
I'm right behind it eating I'm candy by the pound

[Chorus 1]
You can tell everybody that this girl of mine
Is sweeter than the grapes hanging from the vine
Love like wine honey drinking till I drown
Keep it coming baby like candy by the pound

[Chorus 2]
Oh no what's come over me
If I am dreaming then let me sleep
Oh good God, I'm heaven bound
Love is getting sweeter than candy by the pound
Love is getting sweeter than candy by the pound
Your love is sweeter, it's so much sweeter
It's sweeter than candy by the pound
Your love is sweeter, it's so much sweeter
It's sweeter than candy by the pound
Love is so much sweeter, baby
Love is so much sweeter, baby
Love is so much sweeter, baby
Sweeter baby
Love is so much sweeter, baby
Sweeter than candy by the pound
Sweeter than candy by the pound
Sweeter than candy by the pound
Sweeter than candy by the pound
Sweeter than candy by the pound

[Verse 1]
Oh no I don't want it
You can take it all
I'll put my money where my mouth is
Put your suitcase in the hall
Oh you robbed me blind
Of what little hope remained
You put a gun to my head
A bullet through my brain

[Chorus]
You can't shoot down the moon
Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us
But the empty space remains
You can't shoot down the moon
Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us
But the empty space remains

[Verse 2]
Just as long as you're around
We live on borrowed time
I'll put my money where my mouth is
You're guilty at the scene of the crime
I never say more than I need
The mystery runs deep
The dangers buried below
The secrets that you keep

[Chorus]
You can't shoot down the moon
Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us
But the empty space remains
You can't shoot down the moon
Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us
But the empty space remains

[Interlude]

[Outro]
You can't shoot down the moon
Oh, some things never change
We can build a bridge between us
But the empty space remains
You can't shoot down the moon
Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us
But the empty space remains
You can't shoot down the moon

[Verse 1]
This isn't no battle honey, this isn't no fight
How come you take it so hard when I stay out all night
If I take a drink, is that against the law
And if I have a good time, do you call that an act of war
Well you better believe it boy, this house is your home
I didn't build it up for you to live here on my own
And if you think it's easy to forget about me
You'd better think twice, you'd better believe it's an act of war

[Pre-Chorus]
We're living on the front line you and me
Fighting on this battleground of misery
Oh go ahead bring on your artillery
And we'll make this an act of war

[Chorus]
Give it all you've got because I'm all dug in
Keep the punches coming I can take them on the chin
Winner takes all, let the best man win
And we call it an act of war
Well I'm a man of convenience I work a long hard day
After twelve long hours haven't I got the right to play
If living together is getting in the way
Then I call that an act of war

[Verse 2]
Well if that's your game then honey two can play
I'm going on the town tonight and have some fun my way
Ain't no way baby this girl's going to stay
I call it, I call it an act of war

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And it looks like time ain't been on our side
If we could turn the clock back
We might survive this act of war

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
It's an act of war
An act of war

[x2]
It's an act of war
Call it an act of war
Act of war
Call it an act of war

[x2]
It's an act of war
Get your girlfriend
Get your husband
I call it an act of war
An act of war, yeah

Lay my body on a feather bed
And spoil me

Angeline
Get to work when the whistle screams, Angeline

Somewhere in the future, there's more pay
Give me more cash, bring me sour mash

Let me use you like a sex machine, Angeline

[Verse 1]
Here am I, standing by
To see if you still love me
Why conceal, you still feel
The need to push and shove me
Take love for better, take love for worse
But never ever take love for granted

[Chorus]
Make love and promise it will always be
More than just a memory of

[Verse 2]
Love will grow, it comes and goes
Emotions can deceive you
Well this I vow, here and now
My love will never never never leave you
Take love for better, take love for worse
But never ever take love for granted
Make love and promise it will always be
Ours for all eternity

[Chorus]

[Outro]

[Repeats until fade]
More than just a memory of love

[Verse 1]
I'll say it again this is not my city
I don't belong looking for a town of plenty
There weren't these thieves
We had some thing in common
Goals to achieve
We had some thing in common
In a town of plenty

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you see it, this is not my writing
I only asked if this was a town of plenty
There were many archives
We had no media
Only art survived there
Yeah we had no media
In a town of plenty

[Chorus]
And laid across the airstrip
Were the passports and the luggage
All that once remained
Of a rugged individual
And laid across the airstrip
Were the passports and the luggage
I came looking for a town of plenty

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll say it again, this is not my city
I only asked if this was a town of plenty
There were many archives
We had no media
Only art survived there
Yeah we had no media
In a town of plenty

[Chorus]
And laid across the airstrip
Were the passports and the luggage
All that once remained
Of a rugged individual
And laid across the airstrip
Were the passports and the luggage
I came looking for a town of plenty

[Intro]
Nobody left in the airport lounge
They cleaned the ashtrays
TV's just wound down

[Chorus]
I've got to wait till morning
I've got to last the night
I've only got one book
To see me through my flight

[Verse 1]
But when I get to Paris
We'll paint all our portraits
In brush-strokes of yellow
And christen the canvas
The left bank is crying
For colour to crown it
Like the roof of a palace
We'll drink in the amber
When I get to Paris
You were the best of Montmartre Street life
You signed the tablecloth
Art has its price
It's so hard to hold on
To the ghost of your breed
It takes ambition
To call the colours you need

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I don't know why
I just know I do
I just can't explain
In this language that I use
Something leaves me speechless
Each time that you approach
Each time you glide right through me
As if I was a ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
If I only could tell you
If you only would listen
I've got a line or two to use on you
I've got a romance we could christen

[Chorus]
And there's a word in Spanish I don't understand
But I heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading man
He said it with devotion, he sounded so sincere
And the words he spoke in Spanish brought the female lead to tears
A word in Spanish, a word in Spanish

[Verse 2]
If you can't comprehend
Read it in my eyes
If you don't understand it's love
In a thin disguise
And what it takes to move you
Each time that you resist
Is more than just a pretty face
To prove that I exist

[Pr-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When manners make no difference
And my gifts all lay undone
I trade my accent in on chance
And fall back on a foreign tongue

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse]
Without you I no longer swim upstream
Where are you when I try to fill the spaces in between
The red letter days and all the pain
And while I remain shipwrecked everything has changed
And I fall apart
With this threat of indecision
Hanging in my heart
This house can get so lonely
When the day grows dark
And it seems to be the night time
When I fall apart
Can't you tell the shadows no longer comfort me
I don't feel the need to cling to anyone I see
This fool's suffered gladly each and every day
I don't wish to reconsider, I wish they'd stay away
I've no care to count the stares that pity me
I'll wash your hurt away just you wait and see
For every rose you give her I'll give her three
But in the meantime I'll just wish that she was me

[Verse]
I used to think that New York City
Fell from grace with God
And innocence abroad
Waged a war for the underdog
When the snow falls
And Central Park looks like a Christmas card
I just looked beyond the bagman
And the madness that makes this city hard

I heard a basketball
Somewhere out beyond a chain link fence
Inner city prisoners
Argue for the right of self defense
But there's a fast break
And every work of art wakes something in the soul
Just focus on the brush strokes
And the bouquets that the dancers hold

[Chorus]
Spanish Harlem still sounds good to me
Yeah Mona Lisa's getting older
Standing in the shadow of Miss Liberty
While I walk along the west side
Down through Little Italy
Searching for the city
That took away the kid in me

[Chorus]
Spanish Harlem still sounds good to me
Yeah Mona Lisa's getting older
Standing in the shadow of Miss Liberty
While I walk along the west side
Down through Little Italy
Searching for the city
That took away the kid in me

[Chorus]
Spanish Harlem still sounds good to me
Yeah Mona Lisa's getting older
Standing in the shadow of Miss Liberty
While I walk along the west side
Down through Little Italy
Searching for the city
That took away the kid in me

[Verse 1]
I won't see you until Christmas
I breathe coal dust, I get blisters
But the foreman he don't worry
He say work, boy, there's no hurry
Don't that big red sun
Look a lot like fire
When you come out of the ground
After 48 hours

[Refrain]
Going down down down down down
Going down in Durban deep
Going down down down down down
There's no mercy in my sleep

I just hear that drill and hammer
I feel the killing heat
Going two miles down to the heart
Of Durban deep

[Verse 2]
I was born on amen corner
I pound rock face, I get lonely
But my family, they go hungry
Sill the boss man he call us lazy
Don't the old blue heaven
Look a lot like your eyes
When you're blinded by the brightness
Of the Transvaal sky

[Refrain]
Going down down down down down
Going down in Durban deep
Going down down down down down
There's no mercy in my sleep

I just hear that drill and hammer
I feel the killing heat
Going two miles down to the heart
Of Durban deep

[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
Going down down down down down
Going down in Durban deep
Going down down down down down
There's no mercy in my sleep
I just hear that drill and hammer
I feel the killing heat
Going two miles down to the heart
Of Durban deep

[Verse 1]
I've always said that one's enough to love
Now I hear you're braggin' one is not enough
Well, somethin' tells me you're not satisfied
You got plans to make me one of four or five

[Verse 2]
I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood
But you won't catch me carvin' up my love
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit
If it takes more than me, let's a-call it quits

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
It gets so hard sometimes to understand
This vicious circle's gettin' outta hand
Don't need an extra eye to see
That the fire spreads a-faster in a breeze

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
No, I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just a-have to quit 'em if you want me back
'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, if you wanna spread it around, sister, that's just fine
But I don't want no second hand a-feedin' me lines
If you wanna hold someone in the middle of the night
Call out the guards, turn out the light

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
No, I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just have to quit 'em if you want me back
No, I don't wanna go on with you like that

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah

[Outro]
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
Go on with you like that
Oh yeah
Takin' me back

[Verse 1]
I never dreamed I could cry so hard
That ain't like a man
I could fly like a bird some days
Had a place where I could land
I could have sworn we were all locked in
Ain't that what you said?
I never knew it could hurt so bad
When the power of love is dead

[Pre-Chorus]
But giving into the nighttime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You gotta wade into the water
You gotta learn to live again

[Chorus]
And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands

[Verse 2]
I never knew love like poison
That burned like a fire
All I ever wanted was a reason
To drown in your eyes
I never knew sleep so restless
Empty arms so cold
That's not the way it's supposed to be
It ain't the spell that I was sold

[Pre-Chorus]
But giving into the nighttime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You got to wade into the water
You got to learn to live again

[Chorus]
And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands

[Pre-Chorus]
But giving into the nighttime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You got to wade into the water
You got to learn to live again

[Chorus]
And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands

[Chorus]
(And reach out for her healing hands)
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands

[Bridge]
Rock me now (come on, come on, come on)

[Chorus]
And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands

[Outro]
Rock me now...

[Verse]
Look at me twice with wildcat eyes
Promise me everything except a blue night
Shudder like ice in cut crystal glass
Melt in embraces of crazy eyed past
And whisper, whisper, whispering whispers
Tantamount to a lie with lingering breath
Walking fingers run, hungry scratches left
Dull chimes ringing like an empty voice
A distant smile framed, her lips are soft and moist
With whispers, whispers, whispering whispers
And whisper in a rhythm your lies
Keep comfort for others
Hurt me with the night
Whisper like cold winds close to the bone
Save heaven for lovers, leave me alone
With your whispers, whispers, whispering whispers

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Outside I can hear the fireworks
Beyond the paper walls
Where the symbols painted black and white
Run together when the rain falls
And the wind chimes across Kyoto
Each time the earth moves
Was it the quake that shook me
Or was it something to do with you

[Chorus]
And the hot wind heats the bamboo blinds
And your almond eyes always shine
Sitting cool behind your painted fan
All the secrets of the east
Conceal the beauty and the beast
For tender is the man in her Japanese hands

[Verse 2]
Flesh on silk looks different
Than on a cotton sheet back home
Where no one wears their hair like yours
Beneath those oriental combs
And with your thirsty fingers
Running up and down my spine
You forget the western woman
When you're sleeping on Kyoto time

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And the sky explodes
And the moon grows cold
To the distant sound of drums
And the sky explodes
And the moon grows cold
As the dragons on the mainland
Wait to heat the sun

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
When the shades are drawn
And the light of the moon is banned
And the stars up above
Walk the heavens hand in hand

There's a shady place
At the end of the working day
Where young lovers go
And this hot little trio plays

[Chorus 1]
That's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

Ooh, where we meet
Ooh, where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

[Verse 2]
From the alleyways
Where the catwalks gently sway
You hear the sound of Otis
And the voice of Marvin Gaye

In this smoky room
There's a jukebox plays all night
And we can dance real close
Beneath the pulse of a neon light

[Chorus 2]
That's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

Ooh, where we meet
Ooh, where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

[Bridge]
There's a downtown smell of cooking
From the flame on an open grill
There's a sax and a big bass pumping
Lord, have mercy
Ooh, you can't sit still
Oh, you can't sit still

[Saxophone solo: Vince Denham]

[Chorus 3]
Oh, that's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you, rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

Ooh, where we meet
Hooh! Where we meet
Mean and you, rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

[Ad-libs]
Oh, oh, yeah!
You can't sit still
Where we meet
In the club at the end of the street

You can't sit still
Where we meet
In the club at the end of the street
Can't sit still

Where we meet
At the club at the end of the street
Where we meet
Where we meet
At the club at the end of the street
Oh!
You can't sit still

[Verse 1]
Say goodbye to loneliness
Say goodbye to Marlon Brando
Say goodbye to latitudes
And the confusion that surrounds you

Say goodbye to misery
Say goodbye to the morning news
Say goodbye to prime time
And the fools that choose to view

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Say goodbye to Wendy
Say goodbye to Rhonda
Say goodbye to the Beach Boys
From the Palisades to Kona

[Verse 2]
Say goodbye to Glasnost
Say goodbye to Malathion
Say goodbye to the clowns in congress
And the belt around Orion
Say goodbye to the tabloids
Say goodbye to diet soda
Say goodbye to new age music
From the Capa to the Coda

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Say goodbye to gridlock
Goodbye to Dolly's chest
Goodbye to the ozone layer
If there's any of it left

[Chorus]
Don't it make you wanna crawl back to the womb
Find a sanitarium rent yourself a room
This overload is edging me further out to sea
I need to put some distance between overkill and me
Me!

[Verse 3]
Say goodbye to Jackie
Collins, say goodbye to illiterate fools
Goodbye to evangelists and
Geeks with power tools

Goodbye to statuettes
Say goodbye to lists
Say goodbye to articles on
Who the senator kissed

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Say goodbye to hair styles
Goodbye to heaven's gate
Goodbye to Rocky Five
Six, Seven and Eight

[Chorus]
Don't it make you wanna crawl back to the womb
Find a sanitarium rent yourself a room
This overload is edging me further out to sea
I need to put some distance between overkill and me
Me, yeah!

[Guitar solo: Davey Johnstone]

[Chorus]
Don't it wanna make you crawl back to the womb
Find a sanitarium rent yourself a room
This overload is edging me further out to sea
I need to put some distance between overkill and me
Overkill and me

[Synth intro]
Hey, there

[Verse 1]
I see you tempt the night
I see you take a bite
You can tell me you were home
But the camera never lies

You walk out in disguise
To pull the wool over my eyes
You play me for a fool
To believe your alibis

[Chorus 1]
And you can count on being safe as houses
Underestimate my eyes
But you can't argue with the image
The camera never lies

There's no distance put between us
Safe enough for you to hide
I'm watching all of your secrets
The camera never lies

[Short piano solo: Elton John]

[Verse 2]
I recommend first prize
For acting so surprised
For acting like you love me
The camera never lies

I'll take my wounded pride
I'll take it on the chin
Your profile fills the frame
How good you look on film

[Chorus 2]
And you can count on being safe as houses
Underestimate my eyes
But you can't argue with the image
The camera never lies

There's no distance put between us
Safe enough for you to hide
I'm watching all of your secrets
The camera never lies

[Short piano solo: Elton John]

[Bridge]
Smoke screens and sweet deceiving
Replace the face of trust
The shutter falls each time you meet him
(Ooh)
A negative becomes my plus
(Aah)

[Chorus 3]
And you can count on being safe as houses
Underestimate my eyes
But you can't argue with the image
The camera never lies

There's no distance put between us
Safe enough for you to hide
I'm watching all of your secrets
The camera never lies

[Chorus repeats]
I'm watching all of your secrets
The camera never lies

[Short piano solo]

I'm watching all of your secrets
The camera never lies

[Synth hook]

I'm watching all of your secrets
Oh! The camera never lies

[Verse 1]
Like a thief he's come, like a thief he's gone
He's stolen your tears one by one
You're proud to love him, it's a foolish sign
You're a broken heart at the scene of the crime
And the night drags on, and the fever burns
Come to your senses, everybody learns
You sleep in sweet fire lost and blue
You're an empty doll in the power of a fool

[Chorus]
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go praying he'll come back
Take a deep breath and deny
You could love a man like that
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go waking with a dream
There's no tenderness that's left
In the cracks you step between

[Verse 2]
If it looks like rain, if it makes no sound
It's an echo of pain on common ground
Love's like a junkie, addiction's a fact
Passion's a monkey you can't keep off your back

[Chorus]
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go praying he'll come back
Take a deep breath and deny
You could love a man like that
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go waking with a dream
There's no tenderness that's left
In the cracks you step between

[Verse 3]
But he takes love and he turns it cold
He's just an iceman honey, ain't got no heart of gold
But he sees you and he runs from you
Come on and shake this shadow that you're clinging to
And he'll hurt you
And he'll run from you
Come on and shake this shadow that you're clinging to

[Chorus]
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go praying he'll come back
Take a deep breath and deny
You could love a man like that
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go waking with a dream
There's no tenderness that's left
In the cracks you step between

[Verse 1]
Shakey wake up thirsty from a night in the bar
And snake hips Joe is Mr. Cool
Out on the boulevard
The pimp from the Jack of Diamonds
Just got another Jane Doe
She just got off the last bus from Montecedo
Sailor boys find trouble in the alien state
It's one on one from Las Palmas to the Golden Gate
Fly boys on the corner waiting for a ride
For twenty bucks he'll pull the cork on the man inside

[Chorus]
Because we're rolling in heavy traffic
Judy's in the jump seat and Jody's in the bucket
Billy likes to drive and Jackie's just high
And Cindy thinks we're all gonna commit suicide
Because we're rolling in heavy traffic
Yeah we're rolling in heavy traffic

[Verse 2]
Mack he's got his Marlboros tucked up in his sleeve
He's shacked up in his basement making P.C.P
He used to shake the french fries
Down on 12th and Maine
And now he stays up nights on apple juice and cocaine

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Help me information
Get emotion on the line
This war that's raging in my heart's
Getting harder all the time
Our painted smiles are cracking
Our worried friends just frown
We got a runaway train on an empty track
That's trying to run us down
And I'm a stone's throw from hurting
Everything we put together
Knee deep in learning about burning this bridge forever
I'm a stone's throw, a stone's throw
A stone's throw from hurting
And I know it's never going to get no better
Crippled conversation hangs inside this house
Our voices just get ugly
When our love gets all talked out
Your goodnight kiss ain't hungry
Our touches don't connect
We're just a couple of kids with a broken toy
That our idle fingers wrecked

[Chorus]

[x2]
Some things get broken
When stones get thrown
Some things get better
When you leave what you love
And you let what you love alone

[Verse 1]
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands

[Pre-Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through

[Chorus]
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

[Verse 2]
Mutual misunderstandin'
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns

[Pre-Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through

[Chorus]
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

[Pre-Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through

[Chorus]
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

[Outro]
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all

[Verse 1]
There's another one due in three month's time
She'll have to paint the spare room blue
She'll work a little overtime
And hope it all works out for Frank and her
If she can keep him home nights
Away from those factory girls

[Chorus 1]
And the gas bills come and the money burns
And Frank just keeps complaining
How little they both earn
And mother drops by Mondays
Just to nag about the world
Then she stays to nag at Dallas
Because she hates those Texas girls

[Chorus 2]
Poor cow
You'll get your dumb man
You'll see your whole life coming at you
In the back of his hand
Poor cow
It's a monkey see town
You'll walk down the aisle
In the hand me down gown
Of some poor cow

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
Oh them rich bitch girls
Ain't like our lass
Got no spine for labour
Like us working class
Us gamey lot
Still got our pride
We got our health
It's just the truth that's died

[Chorus 2]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Well, she swept through the church
Like a sweet Sunday prayer
While the choir sang "Son of Heaven"
And the groom just walked on air

I was killing time with Jesus
When the wedding bells began
And I saw the most beautiful woman
Getting married to a handsome man

[Chorus 1]
She walked like a mystery
And she passed like summer rain
And she said "I do" like an angel
But I never knew her name

Oh, the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name

[Verse 2]
In the shadow of the holy
Oh, I heard my tell-tale heart
Whisper words that never reached her
As her vows were made at last

Oh, the preacher with his blessing
Pronounced them man and wife
And I saw the most beautiful woman
Make a promise to be kept for life

[Chorus 2]
She walked like a mystery
And she passed like summer rain
And she said I do like an angel
But I never knew her name

Oh, the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name

[Instrumental bridge]
(Ooh-ah!)

[Chorus 2]
She walked like a mystery
And she passed like summer rain
And she said I do like an angel
But I never knew her name
Oh, the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name

Like a mystery
Like summer rain
And she said I do like an angel
But I never knew her name

Oh, the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
Oh! I'm in love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name

(Ooh!)
Never knew her name
(Ooh!)
Never knew her name
(Ooh!)
I never knew her name
(Ooh!)

[Verse 1]
You're a cool little one
My dark southern breeze
Sweeps through my fingers
And it amazes me
Dixie shadowland
Your envy shelters me
Lay down your burden
Mystery of ebony

[Chorus 1]
And it amazes me
Oh! It amazes me
Maybe the heat babe could be this tune
It amazes me
It amazes me
What drives me crazy
Is that big fat yellow moon

[Verse 2]
Look up that pale light
Well she's waking the trees
I'm drifting in your hoodoo
And it amazes me
That magnolia state
Got a hold on me
I got no blues to preach
Just Mississippi company
There is no magic potion
No gri-gri on her side
She's bound to my salvation
Sweet little mama
Take me down by the river tonight
And it amazes me

[Verse 1]
No ceiling on hard living
Peace keepers keep on breathing
Can't deny eye for eye
It's open season
Dictate to my reason
She devils ruling Britain
Hey girl stick it in your purse
Call it treason
Band aids on dead doorways
No heroes in the Bat Cave
Don't give me Tears For Fears
Give me tears of rage
Fires burn with black smoke
Oil slicks put us on the ropes
Man it's hard to handle
When the bank's broke

[Chorus]
Don't kow-tow, don't bow down
Loosen up, get the lead out
Backs up let them shout
Backs up sweat it out
When your back's up, sweat it out
Backs up, sweat it out

[Verse 2]
Hope froze in the cold weather
No ice on a greasy river
Liberty and John Doe
Stand and Shiver
War waits when the lines form
The baby sitter in a uniform
Knocking down your door
For your rice and corn

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
The mother of invention made it good for me
Tighter in the rear
Longer in the seam
Kicked out yards of leather
Wrapped around her waist
Trimmed it to perfection
And left a little space
Yeah they got competition now
All across the world
But there hasn't been no looking back
Since God invented girls

[Chorus]
Now I know what Brian Wilson meant
Every time I step outside
I see what Heaven sent
There may be seven wonders
Created for this world
But one is all we need
Since God invented girls

[Verse 2]
Higher on the heel, paler than pure cream
Leaner on the sidewalk
Cutting through the steam
After claws and feathers
He took skin and bone
Shaped it like an hourglass
And made the angels moan
Oh here's a little heat boys
To straighten out them curls
Now there haven't been no angels round
Since God invented girls

[Chorus]
Now I know what Brian Wilson meant
Every time I step outside
I see what Heaven sent
There may be seven wonders
Created for this world
But one is all we need
Since God invented girls
Now I know what Brian Wilson meant
Every time I step outside
I see what Heaven sent
There may be seven wonders
Created for this world
But one is all we need
Since God invented girls

[Verse 1]
I got to quit this habit
It's like some drug for you
You've been my sweet sweet addict
I've been your little white boy blue
You've got the same obsession
We ain't no cat and mouse
You linger on my lips like confession
You laid the traps in this house
And it's no use each way we lose
You and me at the crossroads of Blue Avenue
Hit and run hearts collide here
True love passes through
Looks like we've got a wreck babe

[Chorus]
Up on Blue Avenue 

[x3]

[Verse 2]
Two hearts get entangled
Dirty minds they go to town
Everyone's got an angle
Little lies get spread around
Let them say what they want
You and me we already knew
Takes more than hocus pocus babe
To save you from Blue Avenue

[Verse 1]
There's a breakdown on the runway
And the timeless flights are gone
I'm a year ahead of myself these days
And I'm locomotive strong
My city spread like cannon fire
In a yellow nervous state
I can't cut the ties that bind me
To horoscopes and fate

[Chorus]
And I won't break and I won't bend
But someday soon we'll sail away
To innocence and the bitter end
And I won't break and I won't bend
And with the last breath we ever take
We're going to get back to the simple life again

[Verse 2]
When we break out of this blindfold
I'm gonna take you from this place
Until we're free from this ball and chain
I'm still hard behind the eight
My city beats like hammered steel
On a shallow cruel rock
If we could walk proud after midnight
We'd never have to stop

[Chorus]

[x4]
And I won't break and I won't bend
But someday soon we'll sail away
To innocence and the bitter end
And I won't break and I won't bend
And with the last breath we ever take
We're going to get back to the simple life again

[Verse 1]
I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

[Chorus]
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby, you're the one

[Verse 2]
There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
For each man, in his time, is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long, lost heart within his reach

[Chorus]
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one

[Chorus]
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
Oh, you're all I ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one

[Chorus]
All I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
Oh, you're all I ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one

[Verse 1]
There's a hungry road I can only hope's
Gonna eat me up inside
There's a drifting spirit coming clean
In the eye of a lifelong fire
Tell Monday I'll be around next week
I'm running ahead of my days
In the shotgun chance that scattered us
I've seen the error of my ways
Well we've wrapped ourselves in golden crowns
Like sun gods spitting rain
Found a way home written on this map
Like red dye in my veins
In the hardest times that come around
The fear of losing grows
I've lost and seen the world shut down
It's a darkness no one knows

[Chorus]

[x3]
And I've poured out the pleasure and dealt with the pain
Standing in a station waiting in the rain
I'm starting to feel a little muscle again
But love is lost like a runaway train
Oh I'm out of control and out of my hands
I'm tearing like a demon through no man's land
Trying to get a grip on my life again
Nothing hits harder than a runaway train

[Verse 1]
Tonight it's hot down here
I can almost smell the rain
And I can almost taste the fear
Behind your name
Fans turning on the ceiling
I feel sticky as a chili dog
White boys howling in the evening
On that hollow log

[Chorus]
Tall tales down the river
Say we aim to bury the truth
But the right hand just delivered
The devil in a suit
And he talks big in Whitewash County
Talks sweet as sugar cane
Got a past that's filled with lightning
Got a future filled with rain

[Verse 2]
Bug buzzing in an empty glass
Fiddle scratching some lazy tune
We're just some place that history passed
New dust, new broom
And it's a high hot buttered moon
He's got a shiny new wax face
Swears the South's gonna rise again soon
All over the place

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Rain down on Whitewash County
Smell the air coming up the line
Well you've changed your face so often
But you never change your mind

[Verse 1]
Have you seen the North
That cold grey place
Don't want its shadow anymore
On my face
A man grows bitter
We're a bitter race
Some of us never get to see
A better place
In the Northern Skies
There was a steel cloud
It used to follow me around
But I don't see it now
There's a farm in the rain
And a little farmhouse
There were a young man's eyes
Looking south

[Chorus 1]
The North was my mother
But I no longer need her
You trade your roots and your dust
For a face in the river

[Chorus 2]
And a driven rain that washes you
To a different shore
There's a North in us all
But my North can't hold me anymore

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
She may be lost
She may be out of bounds
All her tenderness and charms could be something
A man like me has never found
But in her woman's way
She's still a little girl
The things that she wants, the things that she needs
Oh well the choice is hers

[Chorus]
Because you can't take a woman
When she doesn't want you
And you can't be a man
If you're blind to reason
Man might be strong
But true love is stronger
You gotta play it straight
When a woman doesn't want you

[Verse 2]
Her voice invites
Her eyes say more than words
But her needs and complications
Can tear away the memory of last night's girl
And if you're weak
Yeah we're all weak sometime
The best things can wait
The best times they come
Oh when strength is kind

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And if you can't read her
Leave her alone
And if you don't know by now
She's not someone's prize
And you can't take her home

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
The church bells ring out morning glory
When summer bends to the winter's rage
Emily walks through the cemetery
Passed a dog in an unmarked grave
The old girl hobbles, nylons sagging
Talks to her sisters in the ground
I saw a lie in the mirror this morning
I heard a prophesy all around

[Chorus]
And Emily they come and go
The shadows and the distant sounds
But Emily don't be afraid
When the weight of angels weighs you down

[Verse 2]
Emily prays to a faded hero
In a little frame clutched to her gown
Hears the voice of promise in his memory
Tonight's the night they let the ladder down
In a cage sits a gold canary
By a wicker chair and a rosewood loom
As a soul ascends abord the evening
Canary sings to an empty room

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
I'm staring down a mile of disappearing track
Is this the best that we could do
I'm leaning through the rain but you ain't looking back
What did I ever have to prove
Because it feels like electricity hitting an open field
When am I ever going to to learn
Married life's two people trying to grab the wheel

[Chorus]
Oh and we must have got lost
Living on Dark Street
Looking for an exit
Sleeping on the concrete
You can't see it with your eyes
You can't find it with your feet
All I know is that we're lost baby
And we're living on Dark Street

[Verse 2]
All the layoffs and the pay cuts cripple me inside
I pay the price for living everyday
Trying to keep us all together along with a little pride
What'll it take to make you stay
But I've dreamed about an island
And all I got's a bucket of sand
I'd give my eyes to give you all your dreams
Now I get to see my family slipping through my hands

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[x2]
Isn't nothing like the real thing, baby
Isn't nothing like the real thing

[Verse 1]
I got your picture hanging on my wall
But it can't seem to come to me
When I call your name
I realized it's just a picture in a frame
I read your letters but you're not here
They don't move me, they don't groove me
Like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Bridge]
I play my games of fantasy
I pretend I don't see reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

[Verse 2]
I got some memories to look back on
Though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware
Nothing can take the place of you being there
No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much
To make me feel better
Let's stay together

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
I'm so
So glad we got the real thing, baby

[x2]
Isn't nothing like the real thing

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Rolling over trying to sleep
And understanding women
Thinking of you out there somewhere
Looking for a new beginning

[Chorus]
Just let me be the final word
In the book we haven't written
I won't be another page
In understanding women

[Verse 2]
I could drive to Mexico
On understanding women
Throw myself against the waves
And answer up to heaven
How come her heart's so stubborn
And what's so wrong with giving
Ask the big sky talking
About understanding women
And I'm not just anyone who ever stood outside your door
And I'm not any man you've ever known before
Don't judge this picture by the frame
Every man is not the same
Some men reach beyond the pain
Of understanding women

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Yesterday you came to lift me up
As light as straw and brittle as a bird
Today I weigh less than a shadow on the wall
Just one more whisper of a voice unheard
Tomorrow leave the windows open
As fear grows please hold me in your arms
Won't you help me if you can to shake this anger
I need your gentle hands to keep me calm

[Chorus]
Because I never thought I'd lose
I only thought I'd win
I never dreamed I'd feel
This fire beneath my skin
I can't believe you love me
I never thought you'd come
I guess I misjudged love
Between a father and his son

[Verse 2]
Things we never said come together
The hidden truth no longer haunting me
Tonight we touched on the things that were never spoken
That kind of understanding sets me free

[Chorus]
Because I never thought I'd lose
I only thought I'd win
I never dreamed I'd feel
This fire beneath my skin
I can't believe you love me
I never thought you'd come
I guess I misjudged love
Between a father and his son

[Verse 1]
Look at you, could I have been so foolish and so green
A face that smiled at every passing scene
Look at you, you're lost behind the web of woven time
When each emotion pinball in your mind

[Chorus]
Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile
I was the judge and jury at your trial
Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn
Now I have the time to stand and learn

[Verse 2]
But you and I have come so far
With a shaken faith
From the pain of a broken heart
Toward feeling great
Feel like life has just begun
No more singing duets for one
I hold your picture here beside the bed
You had a party raging in your head
Look at me, I look at you with vacancy and hurt
And here today all I can do is learn

[Chorus]
Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile
I was the judge and jury at your trial
Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn
Now I have the time to stand and learn

[Outro]
I have this picture of me looking at you
Looking at me
And I would like to say
Goodbye sweet memory

[Verse 1]
Are you still in control of the boat that you row
Or do you still cling to me when its sinking
I never condemned you, I only consoled you
When candlelight made me a King

[Chorus]
For the wide-eyed and laughing
Passed like a season, erasing a passion to sin
For no one knew better than the tea leaves and the tarots
That the wide-eyed and laughing
Were just one step ahead of the wind

[Verse 2]
And the hearts that you played on the porch swing for me
Was a song that I'd heard in the past
For I had an audience somewhere inside you
That applauded whenever you laughed

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Gone is a word that I now rarely use
Though sometime in the course of a day
I go racing back like a man possessed
By the wide-eyed and laughing
Daughters of some different age

[Verse 1]
He died when the house was empty
When the maid had gone
He put a pen to paper for one final song
He wrote, "oh babe, it's the only way
I know it's wrong but I can't stand
To go on living
To go on living
Living life this way"

[Chorus]
"And I don't know what the time is
Or what the next line is
Or how you're gonna take the news
But if I had my life again
I wouldn't change a thing
I'd let nobody, I'd let nobody
Stand inside my shoes"

[Verse 2]
"Oh
Something's gotten hold of me
This home is not the home it used to be
I've gathered dust
Like the dying flowers
And I've drunk myself sober
After hours and hours"
"Oh
Something's gotten hold of me
This home is not the home it used to be
(It's not the same)
I've gathered dust
Like the dying flowers (oooh)
And I've drunk myself sober (oooooh)
After hours and hours"

"Oooooooh
After hours and hours"

[Intro]
Shoorah 

[x2]

[Verse]
She grows, she's grown like pampas
Tall in the wind, she's simple and spiteful
She's all girl, woman and mother
She's had my children and she's been my lover
No no no no, no no, she don't like to fight it
Once you've been bitten, you get excited
Ma-ma-ma-ma-mama, she really likes her
She comes for coffee, and my mama asked me

[Chorus]
So where's the shoorah she sang?
You know I hear it again, my friend
Where's the shoorah, she came upon it
Waiting to sing her back
Because she likes to sing about
Where's the shoorah she sang?
Over and over and over
Where's the shoorah she sang?

[Bridge]
Shoorah

[x3]

[Verse]
She grows, she's grown like pampas
Tall in the wind, she's simple and spiteful
She's all girl, woman and mother
She's had my children and she's been my lover
No no no no, no no, she don't like to fight it
Once you've been bitten, you get excited
Ma-ma-ma-ma-mama, she really likes her
She comes for coffee, and my mama asked me

[Chorus]
So where's the shoorah she sang?
You know I hear it again, my friend
Where's the shoorah, she came upon it
Waiting to sing her back
Because she likes to sing about
Where's the shoorah she sang?
Over and over and over
Where's the shoorah she sang?

[Outro]
Oh, Shoorah
Shoorah

[Verse 1]
I'll take a rainy day
To make a champagne shower
Poach some horn and tusk
To build an ivory tower
Been to Philadelphia
The day it was closed
I walked to New Orleans
Down a Louisiana road

[Chorus 1]
The skeletons they hung from the bushes and the trees
But not a skull among 'em said boo to me
In a time of wine and cheap cigars
I'm on top of the world
Top of the world Ma

[Chorus 2]
Look Ma no hands
Look Ma ain't life grand
I'm a super power, I'm a handy man
Didn't I turn out, didn't I turn out to be
Everything you wanted Ma
Ain't you proud of me

[Verse 2]
It takes a silver tongue
To have the Midas touch
Not your alchemist
Making gold from rust
Been down in Roswell
When the Martians came
I sailed to Mandeville
Across Lake Pontchartrain

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Didn't I turn out, didn't I turn out to be
Everything you wanted Ma
Aren't you proud of me

[Verse 1]
Torn from their families
Mothers go hungry
To feed their children
But children go hungry
There's so many big men
They're out making millions
When poverty's profits
Just blame the children

[Chorus]
If there's a God in heaven
What's he waiting for?
If he can't hear the children
Then he must see the war
But it seems to me
That he leads his lambs
To the slaughter house
And not the promised land

[Verse 2]
Dying for causes
They don't understand
We've been taking their futures
Right out of their hands
They need the handouts
To hold back the tears
There's so many crying
But so few that hear

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]

[x6]
If there's a God in heaven
Well, what's he waiting for?

[Verse 1]
Oh, he was a light star
Tripping on a high wire
Bulldog stubborn
Born uneven
A classless creature
A man for all seasons
But don't bet them
They can't take him to the very bottom
Because they made him
And they'll waste him
And I don't believe
That I want to watch them

[Chorus]
Because the fifties shifted out of gear
He was an idol then
Now he's an idol here
But his face has changed
He's not the same no more
And I have to say
That I like the way his music sounded before

[Verse 2]
He was tight-assed
Walking on broken glass
Highly prized
In the wallet size
The number one crush
In a schoolgirl's eyes
But don't pretend that it won't end
In the depth of your despair
You went from lame suits
Right down to tennis shoes
To peanuts
From the lion's share
Alright

[Chorus]
Because the fifties shifted out of gear
He was an idol then
Now he's an idol here
But his face has changed
He's not the same no more
And I have to say
That I like the way his music sounded before

[Verse 1]
She slid down to the city limits
Monkey time in fifteen minutes
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Don't let me down
Please stick around
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance

[Chorus]

[x2]
Strobe light on funky feet
Soul children in the disco heat
Top dog, top cat
Move that muscle and shake that fat
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance

[Verse 2]
Chicago, L.A
Everyplace, everyway
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Illinois, Santa Fe
Do do do do do do do what I say
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance

[Outro] 

[x22]
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance

[Chorus 1]
My baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes, and she knows how to use it
My baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes, and she knows how to use it

[Verse 1]
I was lonely once in this great big world
Just a nowhere man without a girl
Until that lucky day when she came my way
And she smiled at me as if to say

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
She's the only one, makes me feel so good
Can't believe my love so I knock on wood
All my silent fears seem to fly away
And she smiled at me as if to say

Your baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes for me

[Bridge]
No more lonely nights just waiting for the telephone to ring
No more lonely days, my baby's taking care of everything
I'm telling you people

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[x2]

[Chorus]
When I was a little bitty baby
My Momma done rocked me in the cradle
In them old cottonfields back home
It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cottonfields back home

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you now well I got me in a mess
I caught a nail in my tire doing lickety splits
I had to walk a long long way to town

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Came along a nice old man
Well he had a hammer
Wait a minute mister, can you get me some direction
I'm gonna wanna be right off for home
Oh, let them cotton balls get rotten
I got you baby, who needs cotton
In them old cottonfields back home
Well, it sure feels good to breathe the air back home
You should have seen their faces when they seen how I'd grown
In them old cotton fields back home

[Chorus 1]
My Lady D'Arbanville
Why do you sleep so still?
I'll wake you tomorrow
And you will be my pill, yes, you will be my pill

[Chorus 2]
My Lady D'Arbanville
Why do you grieve me so?
But your heart seems so silent
Why do you breathe so low, why do you breathe so low?

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
My Lady D'Arbanville
You look so cold tonight
Your legs feel like winter
Your skin has turned to white, your skin has turned to white

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
I love you, my lady
Though in your grave you lie
I'll always be with you
This rose will never die, this rose will never die

[Verse 1]
I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, costs nothin' to touch
War makes money, cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father, and that means somethin' to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Churches and dictators, politics and papers
Everything crumbles sooner or later

[Chorus]
But love
I believe in love

[Verse 2]
I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
Love is simple, hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease

[Pre-Chorus]
Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone

[Chorus]
Without love
I believe in love

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Without love, I wouldn't believe
In anythin' that lives and breathes
Without love, I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here

[Pre-Chorus]
Without love, I wouldn't believe
I couldn't believe in you and I wouldn't believe in me

[Chorus]
Without love
I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love

[Verse 1]
I was made in England
Out of Cadillac muscle
I had a quit-me father
I had a love-me mother
I had Little Richard
And that black piano
Oh, that sweet Georgia Peach
And the boy from Tupelo

[Chorus]
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England

[Verse 2]
I was made in England
Out of Cadillac muscle
Face down on a playground
Crying, 'God, send me a brother'
Not a bloody nose
For rock 'n' roll
Give me that sweet Georgian Peach
And the boy from Tupelo

[Chorus]
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Yeah!

[Verse 3]
I was made in England
Like a blue Cortina
But a Yankee summer
Had a way about her
You had a scent for scandal
Well here's my middle finger
I had forty years of pain
And nothing to cling to

[Chorus]
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England

[Bridge]
If you're made in England
You're built to last
You can still say 'homo'
And everybody laughs
But the joke's on you
You never read the song
They all think they know
But they've all got it wrong

[Chorus]
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England (sing it!)
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Yeah!

[Outro]
I
Was
Made
In
England!

I
Was
Made
In
England!

I
Was
Made
In
England!
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, oh
Oh
I was made in England
Whoa, rock on, boy, yeah
Hey

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel too old to work
Too young to die
But I'll drink wine and whisky
I'll keep smoking 'till I die
I wear a suit of sadness
Made by experience
For I believe that in the end
Time will heal what men can't mend

[Chorus]
I'm a natural sinner
Born a sinner's son
Evil's been my motto
Distrust everyone
I'm a natural sinner
Born a sinner's son
Evil's been my motto
Distrust everyone

[Verse 2]
Big men with small minds
Now, they're not hard to find
Now they ain't got no good side
It plain greed that covers up what's inside
Now ride the confusion
Withhold your trust
Struck with your own hand
When, you think the cause is just

[Chorus]

[x5]

[Verse 1]
This is my house
This is where I live
That is the winter
Those are the trees
I can hear them breathe

[Chorus]
This is my bed
This is where I sleep
That was the dark
Those are my dreams
They belong to me

[Verse 2]
This is my floor
This is where I lie
This is a square room
That was a bright light
These are not my eyes
What is my soul
Where is my tired heart
That is the question
Where is the answer
Inside my house
And I sit by the window
And I wish I was rain
I want to fall from the sky
I want to get wet all over again
Because this my house
It belongs to me
Inside my head
It's all that's left
This is my house

[Chorus]

[Outro]
This is my house

[x4]

[Verse 1]
There's nowhere in the world that
I would rather be than with you my love
And there's nothing in the world that
I would rather see than your smile my love

[Chorus]
For united we stand, divided we fall
And if our backs should ever be against the wall
We'll be together, together, you and I

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 2]
And if the world about you falls apart
My love, then I'll still be here
And if the going gets too hard along
The way, just you call, I'll hear

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Verse 1]
You don't love him any more
He threw your rag doll out the door
I keep my distance
I held my breath
Love always ends up
Hanging by a thread

[Pre-Chorus]
Love hurts so much
Love leaves a scar
'I don't love you' is like a stake
Being driven through your heart

[Chorus]
But I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel, but I don't care
I wanted you
And I'm cold
Cold
Cold

[Verse 2]
You said, "Don't cry to me"
He said, "I'm a dead man if you leave"
I have no feelings, I have no heart
Love always cuts out
The warm and tender part

[Pre-Chorus]
Love hurts so much
Love cuts so deep
It's a hot sweat and a cold shake
Like drowning in your sleep

[Chorus]
But I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel, but I don't care
I wanted you
And I'm cold
Cold
Cold

[Pre-Chorus]
Love hurts so much
Love leaves a scar
'I don't love you' is like a stake
Being driven through your heart

[Chorus]
I don't care
I came back for you
I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel
But I don't care
I wanted you
And I'm cold
Cold
Cold

[Outro]

[x3]
I'm cold
Cold
So cold
Cold
Ohh I'm cold
Honey, I'm cold
So cold
I'm so cold
Cold
Ohh I'm cold
I'm so cold
Cold
Ohh I'm so cold
Cold
I'm cold
Cold

[Verse 1]
What's your name?
My name is pain
Where do you live?
I live anyplace
Where were you born?
In the state of fear
How old are you?
Nineteen hundred and ninety-four years

What's your plan?
My plan is pain
When will you leave?
I'll never go away
How will you breathe?
You'll give me life
How will you see?
Sitting in the temple right between your eyes

[Chorus]
My name is pain
You belong to me
You're all I wanted
I'm all you'll ever be
From the beginning
In a world without end
I am the air
I am pain

[Verse 2]
Pain is love
Pain is pure
Pain is sickness
Pain is the cure
Pain is death
Pain is religion
Pain is life
Pain is television

Pain walks
Pain crawls
Pain is peace
Pain is war

Where were you born?
In the state of fear
How old are you?
Nineteen hundred and ninety-four years

[Chorus]
My name is pain
You belong to me
You're all I wanted
I'm all you'll ever be
From the beginning
In a world without end
I am the air
I am pain

[Chorus]
My name is pain
You belong to me
You're all I wanted
I'm all you'll ever be
From the beginning
In a world without end
I am the air
I am pain

From the beginning
In a world without end
I am the air
I am pain

I am pain
I am pain
I am pain
I am pain

[Verse 1]
737 coming out of the sky
Won't you take me down
To Memphis on a midnight ride?

[Chorus]
I want to move, yeah
Playing in a travelling band, yeah
Well, I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelling band

[Verse 2]
Take me to the hotel
Baggage gone, oh well
Come on, come on
Won't you get me to the room?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Listen to the radio
Talking about the last show
Someone got excited
Had to call the state militia

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Here we come again on a Saturday night
With your fussing and your fighting
Won't you get me to the right

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Well, I'm playing in a travelling band
Playing in a travelling band

[x2]

[Chorus]
Well, I'm playing in a travelling band
Well, I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelling band

[Verse 1]
Deep inside
My soul fights a war
I can't explain
I can't cross over any more
All I see are dirty faces
Rain and wire
And common sense in pieces
But I try to see through Irish eyes
Belfast

[Verse 2]
Look outside
Summer's lost and gone
It's a long walk
On a street of right and wrong
In every inch of sadness
Rocks and tanks
Go hand in hand with madness
But I never saw a braver place
Belfast

[Chorus]
And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smoking black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers
Every foot of this world
Needs an inch of Belfast

[Verse 3]
Who's to say
On whom heaven smiles
Our different ways
We try hard to recognise
No more enchanted evenings
The pubs are closed
And all the ghosts are leaving
But you'll never let them shut you down
Belfast

[Chorus]
And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smoking black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers
Every foot of this world
Needs an inch of Belfast

[Verse 4]
The enemy is not at home
A jealous green
Streaks down this faulty diamond
No bloody boots or crucifix
Can ever hope to split this emerald island
But I never saw a braver face
Belfast

[Verse 1]
Must have been the right month
Must have been a good time
Must have counted every cloud in the sky that night
Every single glass of wine
Must have learned some home truths
Sitting in that cool grass
Must have counted every blade in that emerald field
Every shooting star that passed

[Pre-Chorus]
Should have had a talk with God
Sitting in the great unknown
Watching all the lovers in the world get together
Sitting in Heaven all alone

[Chorus]
And we were love's knot after summer
Tied together in the dead of winter
Wrapped up with spring fever in the air
Bound together in the autumn
Every month means a little something
But January is the month that cares

[Verse 2]
Must have kissed you until I hurt you
Must have been a wild night
Must have rolled in the ashes at the break of day
Rag dolls in the mornin' light
Must have found a secret place
Hiding in our own world
Must have counted every smile on your sweet, sweet lips
Every single sound we heard

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Grey London morning
Wet London streets
Rain on the window
Wind in the trees
It's my time to write
It's your time to call
There's something about distance
That gets to us all

[Verse 2]
Dark clouds above me
Little people below
All walk with a purpose
With someplace to go
It's my place to paint
My own selfish scene
On this cold lonely canvas
It's just the weather and me

[Chorus]
And latitude
Fold back the morning and bring on the night
There's an alien moon
That hangs between darkness and light
Latitude
Between me and you
You're a straight line of distance
A cold stretch of black across blue
Latitude

[Verse 3]
Cracks in the sidewalks
Dogs on the run
An old poster reading
"Give us your sons"
Window frames capture
Moments in time
But latitude captures
The heart and the mind

[Chorus]
And latitude
Fold back the morning and bring on the night
There's an alien moon
That hangs between darkness and light
Latitude
Between me and you
You're a straight line of distance
A cold stretch of black across blue
Latitude

[Chorus]
And latitude
Fold back the morning and bring on the night
There's an alien moon
That hangs between darkness and light
Latitude
Between me and you
You're a straight line of distance
A cold stretch of black across blue
Latitude
Latitude
Latitude
Latitude

[Verse 1]
And every time I get to thinking
Every thought of you I want to shout aloud
Then I think about the love I have inside me
How you brought what's inside out
Now love's made it to the outside
I want to tell the world of everything I've found
Somehow your love released a spring wound up inside me
You turned my living upside down

[Chorus]
And I can't tell the bottom from the top
Am I standing on my head or on my heels
Is it cloudy, is it bright
Is it day or is it night
Am I wrong or am I right
And is it real

[Verse 2]
Tell me where you learned the magic
The spell you used the day you made me fall
Maybe now I know that love is no illusion
I'm upside down but ten feet tall

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
On and on I've drifted with the tide
I didn't know that love could move me so
You fed my life with love and much more besides
And you showed me which way to go

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
We've been crippled in love
Short changed, hung out to dry
We've chalked on the walls
A slogan or two about life
Stood dazed in the doorway
The king and queen of clowns
We've been flipped like a coin
Both of us landing face-down

[Chorus]
So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you

[Verse 2]
We've been living with sorrow
Been up, down and all around
We've buried our feelings
A little too deep in the ground
Stood dazed in the doorway
The king and queen of clowns
We've been flipped like a coin
Both of us landing face-down

[Chorus]
So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you

[Bridge]
But tied to the same track
The two of us look back
At oncoming trains ahead
How many more times
Can we lay on the line
Watching our love hang by a thread

[Chorus]
So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you

[Chorus]
So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you

[Verse 1]
Good morning world, it's a brand new day
I'm packing my bags and I'm going away
I'm moving my legs and my city tired bones
I got to get away from the busy man's phones

[Chorus]
Got to make a move where the living is wild and free
If you want to get happy, then people, come along with me
A fee, fa, fou, fa, fa, fa, fa, fouu

[Verse 2]
Run along boy, set a place for me
I'm getting so tired of the company
I'm getting 

[?] looks from the big white man
I got to get away just as fast as I can

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Good morning freedom, got to break away
Got to break away, got to break away
Good morning freedom, it's another day
It's another day, it's another day
Good morning freedom
A fee, fa, fou, fa, fa, fa, fa, fouu

[Verse 3]

[?] is the same old game
A city tired living is the game to play
Loving thy neighbor is the real life thing
There's only one way to get the people to sing

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Man stands in all his glory
Sitting at the crossroads of the same old story
Man got his make-up, wears it like a mask
Hides inside a child, lives inside a glass
Man breathes his own deceit
Man worships his own defeat

[Chorus]
Oh I'm a man
I know what it feels like
I'm a man working on the living part of life
You see through me
I understand
Don't lose hope
If you can
Have a little faith in man

[Verse 2]
Shakespeare's men got all the lines
Modern man lives back in time
Man got bravado in his big steel hands
Runs with the wolf, sleeps with the lamb
Man falls, cuts and bleeds
Man stumbles on his own belief

[Chorus]
Oh I'm a man
I know what it feels like
I'm a man working on the living part of life
You see through me
I understand
Don't lose hope
If you can
Have a little faith in man

[Bridge]
He's the hoax
Behind the thrill
The poison arrow
The bitter pill
Hard to swallow
Hard to kill
Hard to understand
He's the light
Behind the hill
The broken promise
The iron will
Hard to kill
Hard to understand

[Chorus]
Oh I'm a man
I know what it feels like
I'm a man working on the living part of life
You see through me
I understand
Don't lose hope
If you can
Have a little faith in man

[Chorus]
Oh I'm a man
I know what it feels like
I'm a man working on the living part of life
You see through me
I understand
Don't lose hope
If you can
Have a little faith in man

Have a little faith in man
Young, gifted and black
Oh, what a lovely precious dream
To be young, gifted and black
Open your heart to what I mean

In the whole world you know
There's a million boys and girls
Who are young, gifted and black
And that's a fact

Young, gifted and black
We must begin to tell our young
There's a world waiting for you
This is a quest that's just begun

When you feel really low
Yeah, there's a great truth you should know
When you're young, gifted and black
Your soul's intact

Young, gifted and black
How I long to know the truth
There are times when I look back
And I am haunted by my youth?
Oh but my joy of today
Is that we can all be proud to say?
To be young, gifted and black
Is where it's at

[Verse 1]
Some lie about who they love
Some lie about the truth
Some lie to save their lives
Some lie about their youth

[Verse 2]
Some lie about age and beauty
The conquest of sex
Most lie about the night before
A woman lies for a party dress

[Pre-Chorus]
I've lied for a stolen moment
I've lied for one more clue
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you

[Chorus]
And we lie, lie, lie
On a streetcar named desire
Oh we lie, lie, lie
For that sweet bird of youth
I could be great like Tennessee Williams
If I could only hear something
That sounds like the truth

[Verse 3]
Some lie in the face of death
Some lie about their fame
Some kneel and lie to God
Some lie about their name

[Verse 4]
Some lie in words and speeches
With every living breath
The young lie with their guitars
The old lie for a little respect

[Pre-Chorus]
I've lied to lie with danger
I've lied for a drug or two
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you

[Chorus]
And we lie, lie, lie
On a streetcar named desire
Oh we lie, lie, lie
For that sweet bird of youth
I could be great like Tennessee Williams
If I could only hear something
That sounds like the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
I've lied for a stolen moment
I've lied for one more clue
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you

[Chorus]
And we lie, lie, lie
On a streetcar named desire
Oh we lie, lie, lie
For that sweet bird of youth
I could be great like Tennessee Williams
If I could only hear something
That sounds like the truth

[Verse 1]
Hey you, you're a child in my head
You haven't walked yet
Your first words have yet to be said
But I swear you'll be blessed
I know you're still just a dream
Your eyes might be green
Or the bluest that I've ever seen
Anyway you'll be blessed

[Chorus]
And you, you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky
Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that, promise you that, promise you that
You'll be blessed

[Verse 2]
I need you before I'm too old
To have and to hold
To walk with you and watch you grow
And know that you're blessed

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
In the summertime when the weather is high
You can stretch right up and touch the sky
When the weather's fine
You got women, you got women on your mind
Have a drink, have a draft
Go out and see what you can find
If her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal
If her daddy's poor, just do what you feel
Speed along the lane, do a ton or a ton and twenty-five
When the sun goes down, you can make it
Make it good and then they buy
We're not grey people, we're not dirty we're not mean
We love everybody, but we do as we please
When the weather's fine, we go fishing or go swimming in the sea
We're always happy, Life's for living, yeah that's our philosophy

[Chorus]
Sing along with us, de de de-de-dee
Da da da-da-da, yeah we're hap-happy
Da da da-da-da-da-da da da-da da

[x2]

[Verse 2]
When the winter's here, yeah it's party time
Bring you bottle, wear your bright clothes cause it will soon be summer time
And we'll sing again, we'll go driving or maybe we'll settle down down
If she's rich, if she's nice, bring your friends and we'll all go into town

[Verse 1]
We are still all right
We took it on the chin
But in the thirteenth hour
No one ever wins
But we're strong enough
Like traffic all tied up
And when the static clears
The radios still buzz

[Chorus]
And I stop and I breathe
Because you wanted me
And I wanted you so bad
And I stop and I breathe
Because I still believe
No one really knows what it is that we have

[Verse 2]
Like blood in a vein
We chased this one down
And in the darkest long night
We turned it all around
And it was coal-dusted snow
That covered the fields
But the corn it still grew
And the injury healed

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
There's a place up ahead and I'm going
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're going
Leave the sinking ships behind

[Chorus]
Come on to rise and win
We're going up around the bend

[Verse 2]
Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the getting's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neon's prime to wood

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You can ponder perpetual motion
It's your mind on a crystal day
Always time for a good conversation
There's an ear for what you say

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead and I'm going
Come along, come along with me

[Chorus]

[Verse]
I guess you're okay
You seem to feel better these days
I've known you for so long
I've seen your brightness go from blue to grey
You know that's true
You can shake your head but I can prove
I've seen things through your eyes
You think you win but in the end you lose

[Chorus]
And there's no second guess
We take no second bets
Chances are we're a long way from happiness
Don't cover up the road to love
With words that can't express
The truth implies you're high and dry
And you're a long way from happiness

[Bridge]
I'm one step behind
Looking out for you all the time
I'll put my faith in you
And steer you clear of love that leaves you blind

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1: Elton John]
I can't control this flesh and blood
That's wrapped around my bones
It moves beneath me, like a river
Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues

[Pre-Chorus: Luciano Pavarotti]
La promessa non fu chiara
S'erra solo impressa in me
Vidi solo il gelo dentro me
Quella notte dise a me

[Chorus: Luciano Pavarotti]
Vivrem comme cavalli
Liberi dai recinti di ferro
Che piu non voglio
Rinnegare i sensi
Su dai fuggiam
Vivrem comme cavalli

[Verse 2: Elton John]
We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net
I stood in line to join the trial
One more customer of fate
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of a wagon train
On the road to the golden gate

[Pre-Chorus: Luciano Pavarotti]
Nel deserto la nave abbandonai
Per me aveva senso
Son stato troppo tempo nella bestia
Ed ora saro libero

[Chorus: Elton John]
Someday, we'll live like horses
Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses someday

[Outro: Luciano Pavarotti]
Liberi dai ricenti di ferro
Che piu non voglio
Rinnegare i sensi
Su dai fuggiam
Vivrem comme cavalli

[Verse 1]
And when we start we say forever
We say we care, we need, we feel
You read the movement of our eyes
But in our hearts we still believe
The end will come, before we know
The silent rule of love applies
We light the fuse and let it burn out
We just accept that love must die

[Chorus]
And so they say "The end will come for us"
And so the world slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
(Aaa)
But I don't believe, I don't believe, that the end will come for us
(Aaa)
No I won't believe the end will come for us

[Verse 2]
The end will come like sudden rain
The end is never what it seems
We sink the ship before we sail
We just accept what failure means

[Chorus]
And so they say "The end will come for us"
And so the world slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
(Aaa)
But I don't believe, I don't believe, that the end will come for us
(Aaa)
No I won't believe the end will come for us

[Chorus]
And so they say, "The end will come for us"
And so the world slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
(Aaa)
But I don't believe, I don't believe, that the end will come for us
(Aaa)
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
(Aaa)
But I don't believe, I don't believe, that the end will come for us
(Aaa)
No I won't believe the end will come for us

[Chorus 1]
If you want it, here it is, come and get it
Make your mind up fast
If you want it anytime, I can give it
But you better hurry because it may not last

[Chorus 2]
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch
Will you walk away from a fool and his money
If you want it here it is, come and get it
But you better hurry because it's going fast

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch
Will you walk away from a fool and his money, sonny
If you want it here it is, come and get it
But you better hurry because it's going fast
You better hurry because it's going fast
Fool and his money, sonny

[Outro]
If you want it here it is, come and get it
But you better hurry because it's going fast
You better hurry because it's going fast

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can we do
Tears from your little sister
Crying cause she doesn't have a dress
Without a patch for the party to go
Oh but you know she'll get by

Because she's living

[Chorus]
In the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's going to buy her a dream to cling to
Mama's going to love her just as much as she can and she can

[Verse 2]
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'll lose it in the snow on the ground
Out walking your dog to find a job
Trying to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
And it chills you to the bone
You better go home where it's warm
You can live

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Living on dreams ain't easy
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
You can take them in stride, for family pride
You know that faith in your foundation
And with a whole lot of love and a warm conversation
And a 

[unverified] prayer making you strong
Where you belong

Where you can live

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Many a tear has to fall
But it's all in the game
All in the wonderful game
That we know has love
You have words with him
And your future's looking kind of dim
But these things
Your heart can rise above
Once in a while he won't call
Oh but it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet okay

[Chorus]
And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away

[Bridge]
Come on sing it now
Do-do-do-do-do do doo, oh yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
So long, boy you can take my place
I've got my papers, I've got my pay
So pack my bags and I'll be on my way
To Yellow River
Put my gun down, the war is won
Fill my glass high, the time has come
I'm going back to the place that I love
Yellow River

[Chorus 1]
Yellow River
Yellow River is in my mind and in my eyes
Yellow River
Yellow River is in my blood, it's the place I love

[Chorus 2]
Got no time for explanations
Got no time to lose
Tomorrow night you'll find me sleeping underneath the moon
At Yellow River

[Verse 2]
Cannon fire lingers in my mind
I'm so glad that I'm still alive
And I've been gone for such a long time
From Yellow River
I remember the nights were cool
I can still see the water pool
And I remember the girl that I knew
From Yellow River

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
We bet on our lives and we bet on the horses
In that upstairs apartment
On Orlando and 4th
And the rent was due and the rent man was knocking
Like a Chinese proverb
We were always searching
Nightlife's a no-win but nobody noticed
How we killed off the bottles
Looking good on the surface
The dog days barked and the house cat got old
We were Bonnie and Clyde
In the emperor's new clothes

[Chorus]
And the tears never came
They just stayed in our eyes
We refused to admit that we wore this disguise
Every inch of us growing
Like Pinocchio's nose
As we walked around in the emperor's new clothes

[Verse 2]
We flew by our wits and by the seat of our pants
In the state of illusion
In the nation of chance
And the repo was hauling the wreck we'd been driving
As the dashboard Madonna
Smiled back at us kindly
We cheated the system never batting an eyelid
Seeing only the good
Through the holes in our shoes
And our halos were rusty but we wore them proudly
We were two little gods
In the emperor's new clothes

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We were Bonnie and Clyde
In the emperor's new clothes

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Emperor's new clothes 

[2x]

[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm a dark diamond
I've turned hard and cold
Once was a jewel with fire in my soul
There's two sides of a mirror
One I couldn't break through
Stayed trapped on the inside, wound up losing you

[Chorus]
Tell me how does it work
How do you make things fit
Spent all my life trying to get it right
I've put it together and it falls apart
I thought to myself I might understand
But when the wall's built
And the heart hardens
You get a dark diamond
Dark diamond

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm a dark diamond
But you're something else
You read me more than I read myself
The one star I could count on
Only comet I could trust
You burnt through my life to the true meaning of love

[Chorus]

[2x]

[Verse 1]
Seen him playing in his backyard
Young boy just starting out
So much history in this landscape
So much confusion, so much doubt
Been there drinking on that front porch
Angry kids, mean and dumb
Looks like a painting, that blue skyline
God hates fags where we come from

[Chorus]
'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

[Verse 2]
See two coyotes run down a deer
Hate what we don't understand
You pioneers give us your children
But it's your blood that stains their hands
Somewhere that road forks up ahead
To ignorance and innocence
Three lives drift on different winds
Two lives ruined, one life spent

[Chorus]
'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

[Bridge]
Somewhere that road forks up ahead
To ignorance and innocence
Three lives drift on different winds
Two lives ruined, one life spent

[Chorus]
'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

[Outro]
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

[Intro]
Oh, oh

[x4]

[Verse 1]
I don't know what to say
I don't know where the light shines
It's a gray dawn risin' on a green hill
And there's so much behind us
I don't know where we go
I sure feel there's something out there
There's a great awakening and a new morning
And your spirit's pounding loud and clear

[Chorus 1]
If the river can bend
I'll find you waiting
Home at last from the wild sea
All the twists and turns
We've made together
All the boats you rocked, with your harmony

[Chorus 2]
If the river can bend
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
If the river can bend
(Ooh)
If the river can bend
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ha, if the river can bend

[Verse 2]
Come and embrace the struggle
But win or lose we live here
Build a new beginning on an old rock
Breathe deep of the sweet fresh air

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[x2]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
Yeah, yeah
If the river can bend
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[x2]

[Chorus 2]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Pull my coat around me
Feel the cold wind haunt me
Streets are empty just like me
The murmur of an echo
Seems to come from every window
Is loneliness the same as being free?

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess I must have been dreaming
To think that I believed in you at all
Now I just can't fight it
As the shadow of the night begins to fall

[Chorus]
Love's got a lot to answer for
Oh, I just can't sleep with this feeling anymore
Let the cold night air cool the heat
Of two hearts gone to war
For no matter who wins in the end
Love's got a lot to answer for

[Verse 2]
All I need is darkness
The best of all protection
Freedom's like the stars in the sky
Alone and cold and burning
Each one keeps it's distance
If only we were stars, you and I

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
There was a time I was everything and nothin' all in one
When you found me, I was feelin' like a cloud across the sun

[Verse 2]
Well, I need to tell ya how you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight, you just shine like a beacon on the bay

[Chorus]
And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

[Verse 3]
With a smile, you pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty, I'm speechless, and I don't know where to start

[Chorus]
And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

[Chorus]
And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Oh, takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

[Outro]
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
(The way you look) Way you look tonight
The way you look tonight

[Verse 1]
Oh, it's carnival night
And they're stringing the lights around you
Hanging paper angels
Painting little devils on the roof
Oh the furnace wind
Is a flickering of wings about your face
In a cloud of incense
Yea, it smells like Heaven in this place

[Chorus 1]
I can't eat, can't sleep
Still I hunger for you when you look at me
That face, those eyes
All the sinful pleasures deep inside

[Chorus 2]
Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
Underneath my skin
Oh you were always my original sin
And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin
This dangerous game
Oh you were always my original sin

[Verse 2]
A dream will fly
The moment that you open up your eyes
A dream is just a riddle
Ghosts from every corner of your life
Up in the balcony
All the Romeo's are bleeding for your hand
Blowing theater kisses
Reciting lines they don't understand

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
There's some things I don't have now
Some things I don't talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides
There's consequences I'm scared to taste
Cold hard truths I can't face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass
And everywhere I look there's something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
Don't answer the question of where we belong

[Chorus]
How come birds
Don't fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
Can't explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

[Verse 2]
These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark
And everything I hear never makes any sense
Another old prophet perched on the fence
A cupful of pencils and a self help guru
Don't answer the question of what I am to you

[Chorus]

[2x]

[Verse 1]
On and on
The story of our lives goes on and on
The path of time
The sunsets up ahead roll along
In your eyes
The option of a warm embrace implies
You're my friend
Happy endings keep our love alive

[Chorus]
And tell me do I fit in the big picture
Do I have a shot at the big part
'Cause I've been up all night looking at the big picture
I've got some good lines for my big star

[Bridge 1]
Want to be your main man in the big picture
What a deal
To get a part like this

[Verse 2]
Day to day
The shifting wind just blows us on our way
Here and there
Our pockets full of things to say
Oh my love
I proudly represent you in this world
Little satellite
Brightest star tonight, oh my love

[Chorus]
And tell me do I fit in the big picture
Do I have a shot at the big part
'Cause I've been up all night looking at the big picture
I've got some good lines for my big star

[Bridge 2]
Hope I got a future in the big picture
At the last embrace
From the first kiss

[Chorus]
And tell me do I fit in the big picture
Do I have a shot at the big part
'Cause I've been up all night looking at the big picture
I've got some good lines for my big star

[Verse 1]
Baby you're missing something in the air
I got a name but it don't matter
What's going on? It's cold in here
You have a life but it's torn and tattered
Maybe you're losing pieces of your heart
You have a world but it stopped turning
You lose the day and gain the dark
Love was a fire but it stopped burning

[Chorus]
Spare your heart, save your soul
Don't drag your love across the coals
Find your feet and your fortune can be told
Release, relax, let go
And hey now let's recover your soul

[Verse 2]
Lazy old sunset sinking like a tear
Alone at night in a losing battle
That perfect world is never clear
You have to fight for the things that matter

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
Hey now let's recover
Hey now let's recover your soul
And hey now let's recover your soul

[Verse 1]
Take me for granted, I think that I could stand it
After all these rough seas, left me reckless and abandoned
Say the spirits willing, chance a new beginning
Break down the cold front, give me peace and understanding

[Pre-Chorus]
And you wait, and you wonder
Will she still beat the drum and bring the thunder?
Will she still be the star and see me through?
Because I can't steer my heart clear of you

[Chorus]
No I can't steer my heart clear of you
It's the way it's been, ever since you sailed
Out of a storm and into view, and should I drift away
The compass holds the clue, you control the weather
And I can't steer my heart clear of you

[Verse 2]
Make me your penance, show me your innocence
Everything is history, from the aching to the pleasure
We enjoy the torture, the slow pain that it taught us
Everything gets twisted, let me burn or bring me water

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
No I can't steer my heart clear of you
It's the way it's been, ever since you sailed
Out of a storm and into view, and should I drift away
The compass holds the clue, you control the weather
And I can't steer my heart clear of you
You control the weather, and I can't steer my heart clear of you

[Verse 1]
It's written clear, across the room
In silent words the blind could understand
I came here to relax and find
A sleep that soaks me up
Like surf and sand
And you appear as I descend
A soft outline all poised and a feather light
I come into the darkness now
To conjure up a dream
And close my eyes

[Chorus]
And don't disturb me if you dare
And join me if you have the nerve
I'll show you where the best of me has been
Behind my eyes I'll wait for you
Imagine just what we could do
Come join me in my wicked dream

[Verse 2]
Don't send me back to real life
The daily grind just leaves me feeling numb
Leave me in my wicked dream
Where pressure cracks and beauty
Comes undone

[Chorus]
And don't disturb me if you dare
And join me if you have the nerve
I'll show you where the best of me has been
Behind my eyes I'll wait for you
Imagine just what we could do
Come join me in my wicked dream

[Chorus]
So don't disturb me if you dare
And join me if you have the nerve
I'll show you where the best of me has been
Behind my eyes I'll wait for you
Imagine just what we could do
Come join me in my wicked
Come and join me in my wicked
Come and join me in my wicked dream

[Verse 1]
I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

[Verse 2]
And I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Toughening up around my heart

[Chorus]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

[Verse 3]
I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh man, I've seen so much traffic

[Chorus]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

[Bridge]
So bring it on, I've been bruised
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth
I'm ready for the rougher stuff
No sweet romance, I've had enough
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

[Chorus]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

[Chorus]
I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

[Verse 1]
I'm weary and I'm staying up late
And the rain hits my roof so hard
You know I'm no longer thirty
These days I'm happy to play
One or two hands of cards
I hate flies in the kitchen buzzing
Disturbing the peace I've found
Fortune and fame is so fleeting
These days I'm happy to say
I'm amazed that I'm still around

[Chorus]
And the weight of the world is off my back
When we fell, we got up
And crawled out the cracks
Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back

[Verse 2]
Humidity hangs like a curtain
Oh, it fogs up my glasses sometimes
You know I've still got my eyesight
These days I'm happy to see
A sunset instead of a line

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
There's a long list of names
That i don't recall
Even though my memory's good
The rain washed away
The lemons and weeds
When the weight of the world weighed more than it should
I hate flies in the kitchen buzzing
Disturbing the peace I've found
Fortune and fame is so fleeting
These days I'm happy to say
I'm amazed that I'm still around
And the weight of the world is off my back
When we fell, we got up
And crawled out the cracks
Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back

[Outro]
Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back

[Verse 1]
There's a porch swing in tupelo
In the shade of the south
Where the sweet honey drips off that old hush-your-mouth
It's a slow road on down
That old natchez trace
Through alabama cotton fields to a state of grace
It's a crisp golden autumn
On the tennessee line
Rolling down to mississippi like you headed back in time
Town's closed on Sunday
Everybody's in church
It's empty as the moon this place here on earth

[Chorus]
And this place don't change
Some places move slow
I'm just rocking myself on this porch swing in tupelo
I got nothing to do except hang in the breeze
Ghosts of the old south are all around me
Yea swing high, yea swing low
Here on this porch swing in tupelo

[Verse 2]
His mama must have loved him
That truck driving boy
With the grease monkey look and the rock and roll voice
Well i was just thinking about him
Because I guess he sat here
Singing all praise to god through poverty's tears

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Outro]
Here on this porch swing in tupelo

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Well, they say that it's a fact
If you watch the sky at night
And if you stare into the darkness
You might see celestial light
And if your heart is empty
And there's no hope inside
There's a chance you'll find
An answer in the sky
Well, they say that it's a shame
If you have nothing to believe
And if you can't hold on to something
You might as well die where you sleep
You don't need a prayer
And there's no price to ask why
Sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky

[Chorus 1]
And it's all so much bigger than it seems
And it all overwhelms us now and then
And I'm banking on a chance that we believe
That good can still control the hearts of men

[Chorus 2]
Sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
This life's a long old road
We shouldn't have to walk alone
But if you find the right companion
You won't feel so worn out when you've grown

[Chorus 3]

[x2]
All life is precious
And every day's a prize
And sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky

[Chorus 2]

[x2]
And sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky

[Verse 1]
Your bags out on the bed
Your closet's all cleared out
You say you're going to jacksonville
Because our love's all worn out
You're searching in my eyes
To try and find a tear
But the well of my forgiveness
Has dried up with the years

[Pre-Chorus]
You might still look pretty
In that lacey little dress
But I think you've got your signals crossed
If you think that I'm a mess

[Chorus]
I am not going to die, I am not going to cry
I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve
You can take the car, but you won't break my heart
Oh and darling turn the lights out when you leave
I am not going to going to shake, I am not going to break
I am not going to fall down on my knees
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed
Oh and darling turn the lights out when you leave

[Verse 2]
It's like a prime time movie
You play the part so well
You do believe you're Heaven sent
And living here is hell
I hear it's hot in Florida
And it's raining here tonight
But the sun going to shine tomorrow
And I'm going to do alright

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed
Oh and darling turn the lights out when you leave

[Verse 1]
I'm not the same as I used to be
All the things you've heard seem hard to believe
Haven't always been good, never really been bad
Most times I've been happy, yea sometimes I've been sad
Sure I've made mistakes, haven't we all
I've been loose as a cannon and dumb as a wall
Haven't always been sober in counting my ducks
And if I look back now I've had my share of luck

[Chorus]
But the change didn't come over night
I've been searching for you all my life
All the habits that I couldn't handle
I've swept them under the rug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug

[Verse 2]
I'm going to stay now, I really like it here
I may paint your picture, and i might grow a beard
There were times i was crazy couldn't handle my life
Don't think you'd have liked me not at any old price

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And I've taken the pills
I got burnt out and chilled by the cold
But I've no regrets and that being said
You know cheap thrills can get pretty old

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus]

[Outro]
In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug

[Verse 1]
She threw back that shiny hair
Like the mane on a delta queen
Gonna spend my last dime on a telephone call
Because she's the wildest thing I've ever seen
She was just plain mister once
Got herself fixed up real good
Just a little boy lost in the land of the free
A wiggle and a walk away from womanhood

[Chorus]
Now they call her the cat
And that's a stone fact
They took a little of this
She got a little of that
Now billy got a kitty
He got something to scratch
So they call her, yeah they call her the cat

[Verse 2]
She just does that double act
She got babs and joan down pat
She got hips like mick, she's a rolling stone
Never seen a woman shake like that
She was just plain mister once
Got herself fixed up real good
Just a little boy lost in the land of the free
A wiggle and a walk away from womanhood

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
She's so fine that the water line
Don't separate hot and cold
She got stitched up bitchy by an old m.D
Now she's headed out to Hollywood or so I'm told

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
And that's a stone fact
They took a little of this
She got a little of that
Now billy got a kitty
He got something to scratch
So they call her, yeah they call her the cat

[Verse 1]
Me and you we're not that pretty
Me and you could use a lift
I'm out here on the corner crying
I got ribbons but I got no gift
Me and you we're all we've got
Me and you could be our curse
We've got bleeding hearts and flowers
You got strings but you got no purse

[Chorus]
We're just freaks in love, saints above shine on our sweet life
Happy is the union of fools and freaks alike
And fearless are the idiots among the hawks and doves
We're on the outside looking in a couple of freaks in love

[Verse 2]
There's a wonder in this weakness
It's so beautiful sometimes
Across the universe we're lightning
In the race we're a step behind
Me and you we're not for everyone
Me and you we're damaged goods
We're antique and unacceptable
And just misunderstood

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Outro]
We're on the outside looking in a couple of freaks in love

[Verse 1]
Breaking down never seems to be that hard
Falling short is always in the cards
I'm on the road, sunrise is at my back
Lost it all somewhere between the cracks
I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we deliver
Then there are the lucky ones

[Chorus]
And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me, I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful, thankful
I'm thankful, so thankful
I'm thankful, I've got all that I'm allowed

[Verse 2]
Leaving town gets to feel just like a job
My desire never winds up on top
I can say now I didn't want the moon
It's out of reach somewhere beyond this room
I always hoped that i'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we're delivered
Then there are the lucky ones

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]]
I always try to make things clear
Then I watched as progress starts
I only hope I'm standing here
When heaven finally comes to call

[Verse 1]
Some days I think it's all a dream
The things I've done, the places that I've been
This life of mine seemed surreal at times
Wasted days and nights in someone else's mind
Could it be I'm not for real?
I've slapped my face to check out how I feel
There's hostages to prove it's true
Who lives behind the mask was never proved

[Chorus]
Come on Robert Johnson
Though we're worlds apart
You and I know what it's like
With the devil in our heart
You sold your soul at the crossroads
Kept a little of mine on hand
I'm wading out this muddy water
Been stranded in the Wasteland

[Verse 2]
Rattling chains all around my bed
Ghosts can laugh but they're already dead
I'm not dying and I'm far from gone
The blues man spent his candle but his pain lives on

[Chorus]

[3x]

[Verse 1]
Did you see the first man on the moon?
Have you seen the first light of day?
When there wasn't someone stuck inside
Something like the moon
Something like a star that's lost its way
Did you go to Dallas on that day?
Have you been to where they broke a dream?
Where there really isn't room for doubt?
Somehow we got lost
And the truth is buried somewhere in between

[Chorus]
And everyone, everywhere
Take time and dry your eyes
Because too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
Just look into that beautiful blue
That beautiful blue, blue sky
And know too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried

[Verse 2]
The mystery of why they had to leave
I'm only one of thousands saying why
Why a balcony in Memphis, Tennessee
Seems trapped in time
Just an angry finger pointing at the sky
Would you wait to stand inside his shoes?
And is the best all you have to give
The barefoot man lived a simple life
I guess he knew
Some things die so other things might live

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 1]
You can take her
Make her change her name
You and your old money
Dance around the flame
But you can never, never love her like me
You can charm her
Calm her when she's wild
Show a little comfort
Play with her inner child
But you can never, never love her like me

[Chorus]
So I just close my eyes and steal her away when you sleep
Sneak her in my dreams every single day of the week
You may have her in real world but if you could only see
How we rock this room in the twilight zone
And you can never, never love her like me

[Verse 2]
You can warm her
Charm her with your style
I know you convinced her
She's the love of your life
And no, you'll never, never love her like me
You can bless her
Keep her conscience clean
You can undress her
Go all the places I've been
But you'll never, never love her like me

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
It's getting dark in here
Don't want to leave
Shadow's falling
And I believe
Winds picking up
Thing's so unclear
I'm afraid of my shadow
And it's getting dark in here
I'm scared of strangers
On the street
World's so ugly
I can't breath
Moon's so spooky
I'm close to tears
I've lost it all
And it's getting dark in here

[Chorus]
And the wait isn't worth what i'm getting
Sometimes i feel i'm on fire
I've been handed a curse and a blessing
My life's been stripped down to the wire
And i'm trying to get back and hold on
Find someone somewhere who cares
But the sun's always setting on my life
And it's sure getting dark in here

[Verse 2]
Don't talk about angels
Or how i'll be saved
I'm no coward
But i'm not that brave
Rags are blowing
Rain's getting near
I'm done with running
And it's getting dark in here

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
Yeah, the sun's always setting on my life
And it's sure getting dark in here

[Verse 1]
I'm stoned in the twilight
Screaming on the inside
Give me your water, help me survive
Going to miss the sunlight
When I lose my eyesight
Give me my red shoes, I want to dance
They search for an answer
But that old man wouldn't listen
Back then I was handsome
Back then he was ignorant

[Chorus]
And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed
Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore

[Verse 2]
Had garlands in the wings back then
All the pretty little things back then
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings
After curtain calls and bows
I can't see the front row now
Hand me my red shoes just one more time
They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listen

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listen

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore
I can't wear them anymore 

[2x]

[Verse 1]
I can't keep this from you
I've held it in so long
It's time to tell the truth
Keeping it from you is wrong
I can't keep this from you
It's so simple I'm afraid
When I tell you how I feel
You'll just laugh and call me crazy

[Chorus]
And I can't keep
This love a secret
And I don't want
To go on longing
I just want a chance for me to prove
My love and I can't keep this from you

[Verse 2]
I can't keep this from you
It's hard to breathe in here
I just seem to act the fool
Every time I feel you near
I can't keep this from you
No matter what you say
Anything is better now
Than going through my life this way

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And I love every move you make
Can't you hear every heart you break?
And don't you know when I hear your name?
Just the sound of it shoots me down in flames

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
I just want a chance for me to prove
My love and I can't keep this from you
Oh no i just can't keep this from you

[Verse 1]
It's a case I guess of paradise lost
Ten years back on the hands of the clock
In that little house on Mansfield
On your old block
Sometimes the magic of the past is all we've got
Just you and me at a crossroads then
Isn't it funny how we were old friends
Accidentally thrown together
Did we intend
To be the romantic novel you never want to end

[Chorus 1]
And it's the contact of the eye that meets across a crowded room
And how I kind of wound up the lyrics to your tune
You said, 'Funny but it feels like I've known you all my life
And how it might feel to kiss you on the mouth tonight

[Chorus 2]
In between the Star of David and the California moon
The Santa Ana winds blew warm into your room
We were crazy, wild and running
Blind to the change to come
In that little house on Mansfield
We'd wake at the break of dawn
In an Indian summer gone

[Verse 2]
In the candlelight I can recall
Your naked shadow looking ten feet tall
Like a wild pony dancing
Along the wall
Off balance I found love the only place to fall

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
We'd wake at the break of dawn
In an Indian summer gone
We heard Richard Nixon say, “Welcome to the USA”
The common sense I sometimes lack
Has opened up a seismic crack
We’ve fallen in and I can’t pull back
And I guess we’ll have to stay

In open arms we put our trust they put us on a big red bus
Twin spirits soaking up a dream
Fuel to feed the press machine
After years that were long and lean
We’re finally on our way

And Richard Nixon’s on his knees he’s sent so many overseas
He’d like to know if you and me could help him in some way
A little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do
A small diversion caused by two
Pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say, “Welcome to the USA”

Neither of us understood the way things ticked in Hollywood
We just loaded in and grabbed the bat
With little room to swing a cat
And pretty soon we were “Where it’s at”
Or so the papers say
And all around us suntanned teens, beauty like we’d never seen
Our heroes led us by the hand
Through Brian Wilson’s promised land
Where Disney’s God and he commands
Both mice and men to stay

And Richard Nixon’s on his knees he’s sent so many overseas
He’d like to know if you and me could help him in some way
A little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do
A small diversion caused by two
Pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say, “Welcome to the USA”

In a bright red Porsche on Sunset I saw Steve McQueen
I guess he’s just about the coolest guy I’ve ever seen
And for you and me that speeding car is how it’s going to be
I see no brakes just open road and lots of gasoline

Oh, We heard Richard Nixon say, “Welcome to the USA”
The common sense I sometimes lack
Has opened up a seismic crack
We’ve fallen in and I can’t pull back

Pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say, “I’ve gotta go but you can stay”
Pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say, “I’ve gotta go but you can stay”

[Verse]
"Say that boy's a wonderment"
"No! The kid's a freak"
But that kid he don't care none
His black hands resting on the keys
Hopping like a big old frog
And hissing like a train
Entertaining royalty
All points east, west and in-between
General he's a fine old man
Treat him like his own
"Boy wouldn't know from money"
Just throw old Blind Tom a bone
From the times of King Cotton
May we present to you
All you Jim Crow monkeys
From Harlan County down to Tuscaloo
Pay me anything you like
I'll pay it back to you
Be careful what you call me though
Some things cut clear on through
I may be an idiot
I may be a savant
I didn't choose this life for me
But it's something that I want
Cocks that old big head aside
Grunts a word or two
Keeps them guessing every night
Is he really going to make it through
Faint hearts with their fans out
Starched collars and cigars
He weren't no use for slaving
"I wouldn't want him in my yard"

[Verse 1]
I hung out with the old folks
In the hope that I'd get wise
I was trying to bridge the gap
Between the great divide

[Verse 2]
Hung on every recollection
In the theater of their eyes
Picking up on this and that
In the few that still survived

[Chorus]
Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away

[Verse 3]
They bend like trees in winter
These shuffling old grey lions
Those snow-white stars still gather
Like the belt around Orion

[Verse 4]
Just to touch the faded lightning
Of their powerful design
Of a generation gathering
For maybe the last time

[Chorus]
Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away

[Bridge]
Oceans away
Where the green grass sways
And the cool wind blows
Across the shadow of their graves
Shoulder to shoulder back in the day
Sleeping bones to rest in earth, oceans away
Oceans away

[Chorus]
Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away

[Verse 1]
Freedom for the scapegoat leaving Reading Jail
Rheumy eyes just pierced his heart like crucifixion nails
Shaking fists and razors gleamed
You never stood a chance
When the ink ran red on Fleet Street
You turned your eyes to France

[Verse 2]
Humbled far from Dublin, chased across the waves
Your biting wit still sharp enough
To slice through every page
Destitute and beaten by the system of the crown
The bitter pill you swallowed
Tasted sweeter going down

[Chorus 1]
And looking back on the great indifference
Looking back at the limestone walls
Thinking how beauty deceives you
Knowing how love fools us all

[Verse 3]
A golden boy in velveteen landed in New York
The past was so seductive
When they paid to hear you talk
Baccarat and champagne flutes
Tobacco from Virginia
Long before the lords and law
Branded Oscar Wilde a sinner

[Chorus 2]
And looking back on the cold bleak winter
Looking back on those long dark days
Felt like the head of John the Baptist
In the arms of Salome

[Bridge]
Don't turn around it's a white gull screaming
Don't cry out loud you never know who's listening
You've seen it all the exiled Unforgiven
From the stately homes of England to her prisons

And looking back at the hardened lifers
Looking back on the wretched poor
Thinking maybe they were my saviors
Strange to think I'll miss them all
Strange to think I'll miss them all

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
Lily pulled a horseshoe from a pile of junk
Said "I'm going to keep this good luck
Piece of iron inside my truck"
The boy just whispered "OK"
And grabbed his old black dog
As we piled on in and cut out through
That late November fog
Dull as a plough share rusting in the yard
Old Cotton grinned and waved goodbye
While the auctioneers all played cards
On every other Sunday
I'd walk down to Moe's and back
Eat a t-bone steak, watch a picture show
For a dollar and a half

[Chorus]
Come on little sister get up off my knee
Going to settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Going to set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

[Verse 2]
That fog came out of nowhere
Short of what I can tell
Hand to hand we passed that bucket
Up and down from the well
"Gone to California"
Used to be what folks would say
Down around these parts if it was me
I'd have hoped that westbound stage

[Chorus]
Come on little sister get up off my knee
Going to settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Going to set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

[Verse 3]
One less hallelujah
A little less sympathy
Lily and Jake, the old black dog
A pinewood box, a rocking horse
All gone to Jubilee

[Chorus]
Come on little sister get up off my knee
Going to settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Going to set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

[Verse 1]
I put my life on hold and took you home
Good sense shot down I placed you on a throne
Where was the wheel that kept me on the road
The force of nature preventing overload
So don't you know I've been dressed to kill
If you got the tools be careful what you build
When the arrow's in the bull's-eye every time
It's hard assuming that the archer's blind

[Chorus]
My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand

[Verse 2]
I was full of foreign notions at the start
There was never once
When I was off my guard
For any ghost of every poet in the ground
There's one like me
To buy the guys a round

[Chorus]
My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand

[Verse 3]
I'm going down
You and me together going down
It's not what I'd been told about this town
That when you least expect if you can drown
In quicksand
My quicksand

[Chorus]
My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand
My quicksand
My quicksand

[Verse 1]
I blew the dust out of the corners
Threw some dead wood on the fire
Tuned the radio to silence
Watched the evening sun expire
Should have called you up this morning
But I'm such a fool at times
I still search my shaving mirror
Looking for your face with mine

[Chorus]
And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight

[Verse 2]
Chalk up one more crazy notion
Imagination running wild
But if I needed confirmation
I would have gone that extra mile
You're the last chance on the highway
I'm that open stretch of road
You're the diner in my rear-view
A cup of coffee getting cold

[Chorus]
And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight

[Verse 3]
Bruised in this cold war of words
We've come undone two loose ends alone
Possessed by that curse you've endured
The spell that I cast couldn't make you come home

[Chorus]
And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight

[Verse]
I'm looking, I'm looking back
I'm trying to imagine this and that
The simple mathematics making up the map
Insurance of protection from immediate collapse
I'm watching, I'm watching you
A voyeur from a different point of view
The solitary eyes that I've been looking through
Committed to connecting the old ways to the new
And I see things
Through a curtain blowing back against the rain
Through the crack in a door that heaves with pain
And through every gap that gives away
Some secret in the dark
I'll come away with something
To keep you in my heart
I'm searching, I'm setting out
To prove without a shadow of a doubt
The age-old contradiction that's hovering about
A whisper in the darkness
Holds more truth than a shout
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for
Telltale footsteps on the bedroom floor
A broken hearted lover simply looking for
Relief that's temporary from her dirty little war
And I see things
From the ceilings of a hundred hotel rooms
From a satellite that's bouncing off the moon
And from every telescope
That's focused in on someplace dark
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart
Yes I see things
From the highest branch that looks directly in
Through a hawk's eyes gliding silent on the wind
And in every secret rendezvous where illicit lovers park
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart

[Outro]
Voyeur 

[x3]

[Verse 1]
Spare the rod don't spare the fool
If you take the breaks you're given
You get to make the rules
Take a chance and make it fast
If you break some bones on landing
You know you're built to last

[Verse 2]
Fight the tide and find the shore
If the gift horse isn't smiling
Just learn to ride some more
Common sense is a rule of thumb
If the suckers throw a red flag
Blow them all to Kingdom Come

[Chorus]
And take this dirty water
Running like a river
In and out of everything
We helped to put together
Take this dirty water
Help to keep it clean
Get back to the wellspring
Purify the stream

[Verse 3]
Search out days that never end
If it's only for the chance
To feel just like a child again
Tell a lie that speaks the truth
If the heart becomes a prisoner
Your soul will turn you loose

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Forgotten scars remind us of
Too much war, too little love
Beneath the fault-line truth to burn
Within the page so much to learn

[Verse 2]
Wounded birds look to us
Who can heal? Who to trust
Bring down the giants old and new
Strike up the band and waltz on through

[Chorus]
I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through

[Verse 3]
Love in ruins, torn apart
Victims of the careless heart
Skating on the cold grey ice
Before the flood toward the light

[Verse 4]
Muddy boots to shiny shoes
Headlines screaming out the news
From dirt and damp to hardwood floors
Beyond the burned out broken walls

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

And the dancers danced on through

[Verse 1]
I carried you in my arms
Through the hotel to our room
The night was filled with music
Those old historic tunes
Songs of revolution
Filled our hearts and fed our souls
As the fireworks exploded
Like those cannons long ago

[Chorus]
See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See them shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight

[Verse 2]
Five hundred wooden saints below
The color's cracked and dry
You said their stories should be told
Did they suffer when they died?
Give us your tradition
Give us hope and send us home
We'll be the cracked bells tolling
The voice of dust and bones

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The pillow that you dream on
Lies rolled up on the floor
You tossed it at the TV screen
At the drug lord and his war
Thinking of the courtyard
Forced a tear from your eye
The white shirts in the moonlight
The warm forgiving smiles

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Took a high dive arcing out wide
Into the crowd
Out to the sound of their wild applause
But you've heard it before
And you've seen it all
From up there on the diving board

[Verse 2]
You'd free fall into the ether
Above the people
Out on a limb fragile and adored
But who below knows that
You're still a mystery
Way up on the diving board

[Pre-Chorus]
Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me?
When I was sixteen
And full of the world and its was noise

[Chorus]
But you beat the drum
You fell in love with it all
The planets alight
Those dizzy heights
And the view from the diving board

[Verse 3]
Took the grand prize you and your eyes
Butterfly light
Escaping the reach
Of their fangs and their claws
Such a pale little thing
In your lily-white skin
High up on the diving board

[Pre-Chorus]
Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me?
When I was sixteen
And full of the world and its was noise

[Chorus]
But you beat the drum
You fell in love with it all
The planets alight
Those dizzy heights
And the view from the diving board

[Pre-Chorus]
Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me?
When I was sixteen
And full of the world and its was noise

[Chorus]
But you beat the drum
You fell in love with it all
The planets alight
Those dizzy heights
And the view from the diving board
And the view from the diving board

[Verse 1]
The sound of one heart breaking, the sound of someone waking
To the cold hard truth before the sun goes down
If I could ever catch you a little bit of that
I'd wrap it up and bury it in the deep dark ground
On the ledge with one last chance to beg
To the deepest root of the oldest tree
If we could only bottle a little bit of rain
Wrung out from the history in its ancient leaves

[Chorus]
All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

[Verse 2]
The never ending stories of the victor and the spoils
The treasure and the lesson to be learned
If I could ever wrap up a little piece of this
I'd strike a match and watch the contents burn

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 3]
Love will always lead to a candlelit bedroom
Only if you want it bad enough
Every waking moment you believe that
You must have a little faith in the light of love
Every waking moment you believe that
You must have a little faith in the light of love

[Verse 1]
I'm moving out of Tombstone, yeah, with the sun behind my back
I'm tired of people talking of things that I lack
Ever since a week ago, the day he passed away
I've been taking too much notice of the things they've had to say
And all they say is, "You ain't half the man he used to be
He had strength and he worked his life to feed his family"
So if that's the way it has to be, I'll say goodbye to you
For I'm not that guy, or so it seems, to fill my old man's shoes

[Chorus]
Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed
They'd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains
Oh, it's hard and I can't see what they want me to do, Lord, Lord
They seem to think I should step into the old man's shoes

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus/Fade out]
Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed
They'd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains
Oh, it's hard and I can't see what they want me to do, Lord, Lord
They seem to think I should step into the old man's shoes
Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed
They'd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains
Oh, it's hard and I cannot see what they want me to do, Lord, Lord
They seem to think I should step into the old man's shoes

Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed
Oh, they'd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains
Oh, it's hard and I cannot see what they want me to do, Lord, Lord
They seem to think I should step into the old man's shoes

Lord, I said
Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed

[Verse 1]
You hear it every day
Once upon a time they say
Once upon a time in this place
I looked and saw on your face
A smile that spoke to me
In oh so many ways
The Sunday morning bells
Rang out that all was well
Sunshine across the yard
We’d rest when we worked hard
We take a little time off
To appreciate the day

[Chorus]
And love builds a garden
Grew it from the ground up
Each one of us knowing
Every inch of it was us
We pulled it all together
Hoping and believing
That love built this garden
For the two of us to dream in

[Verse 2]
We’d get a little rain
Then the sun came out again
But a frost it’s hard to fight
Once it takes hold flowers die
There’s only so much you can do
To keep some things alive

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sad to say, it’s true
Without a lover who
Cares as much
Well I guess, I guess it goes to prove

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
No more Valentine's Day
No more Christmas cards
I've thrown them all away
No more sequined stars
No birthday wishes
No more surprises
Who needs them anyway
No reason to get excited
Yes I gave you everything
I gave you earth and sky
And everything in between
That walks or crawls or flies
No Easter mornings
It's your cross now
Keep it all for yourself
It's overrated anyhow

[Chorus]

[x2]
But keep my Valentine
I'll keep my bleeding heart
Just let me out of here
Before that sentimental music starts
And your regrets
Fall like empty lines
Like the lies we write on Valentines

[Verse 1]
I can feel the time closing in
I can feel the years crawling through my skin
And if I doubt myself I can count on the rain
To cover the tears of this ageing game
But I can count on you to play your part
I don't miss a beat of your animal heart
And when you push from behind I know I can
Cover a mountain with the palm of my hand

[Chorus]
And oh, babe, you can make history young again
You could rewrite, you could decide
The things that should or shouldn't have been
You could look at me in the scheme of things
Oh, oh, babe, you could make history young again

[Verse 2]
I can watch the weeks sweeping by
I can recollect the hearts hanging out to dry
When the world shuts down I can touch my fears
I can hear lost youth ringing in my ears
But I lost nothing when I gained you
You just blew me away with yesterday's news
When you run your fingers down my spine
It's like throwing a switch on the hands of time

[Chorus]
And oh, babe, you can make history young again
You could rewrite, you could decide
The things that should or shouldn't have been
You could look at me in the scheme of things
Oh, oh, babe, you could make history young again

[Verse 3]
Ancient minds, ancient lives
Got a way of coming around
If I knew then what I know now
I'd make it back to you somehow

[Chorus]
And oh, babe, you can make history young again
You could rewrite, you could decide
The things that should or shouldn't have been
You could look at me in the scheme of things
Oh, oh, babe, you could make history young again

[Verse 1]
It's just like Noah's ark
There's two of every kind
Pretty girls and boys in drag
Walking a fine thin line
Shaking hands and bussing cheeks
Licking their lips like they could eat
Me alive in a couple of weeks
Yea just like Noah's ark
Italiano promotion men
Chomping a big cigar
Slapping backs and making cracks
About the fags in the bar
Radio boss dipping his nose in a little white packet
You put it out son and we'll all back it
Yea it's just like Noah's ark

[Chorus]
And the waves are crashing round us
But we're ready for the flood
And we don't need a sign like an olive branch
In the beak of a snow white dove
We're not as dumb as we might look
You can't keep us in the dark
With me and you it's two by two just like Noah's ark

[Verse 2]
These four walls have seen
The cockettes and the casters
From San Francisco to Ohio
I've seen beauty and disaster
Cocky young roosters and little chicks
Flashing smiles, shaking them hips
Trying to hook it up for the late night shift
Here in Noah's ark

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And we wrote it as we saw it from the centre of the stage
All access to the liars who claim they wrote a page
But for every tiny dancer there's a dog that's had its day
The truth is never quite the same as what the papers say

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I remember it like it was yesterday
Snow in the park and skaters on the ice
Long black cars standing side-by-side
Loading up the boys at night
Turned up our collars to the chill of the wind
Caught an innocent smile from a taxi at the lights
Not something you'd see on a New York street
It's such an uncommon sight

[Chorus]
But I wouldn't have it any other way
This city's got a thing about it, don't try to understand it
New York city I'd really like to stay
New York city I wouldn't have you
I wouldn't have you any other way

[Verse 2]
Oh the subway rumbled underneath
Italian lights where joey gallo died
And the man on the door down at 54's
Letting only the pretty inside
I'd wake with a stranger under the covers
Late in the day and longing for the night
Just like the snowfall there's so many bodies
But somehow it feels so right

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And I can feel the magic
And read a million lips
And no matter what might happen
They'll never sink this ship

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Nostradamus said, "I predict
That the world will end at half past six"
What he didn't say was exactly when
Was he listening to the radio?
Was he listening to the government?
Well he got us spooked anyway
We'd been running hot up until today
But a wind of change blew across our sales
We were coasting on a winning streak
We were kings until the power failed

[Chorus]
We've been living in a tinderbox
And two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox (tinderbox)
Two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox

[Verse 2]
Godzilla came in disguise
Tore the building down right before our eyes
Kept the needle out of the red balloon
Was he worried we might go too far
Maybe wind up rhyming moon and June
The sun descends down in Mexico
While a fancy car back on Savile Row
Shows the price of fame leads to overkill
Things are going to have to change
Some holes along the road get filled

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Pressure's going to cook us if we don't unlock it
Gun's going off if we don't uncock it
We've got to climb out of the other one's pocket
Or we're going to burn, out on this beautiful rocket

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
The sun is up and the shades are all pulled down
I'm more paranoid with every little sound
Like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around
And a siren wailing on the other side of town
Oh the tvs on and the colors really hurt my head
If I could think straight I'd wish I was dead
Or curled up naked in my lover's bed
Instead I'm hanging over hell suspended by a single thread

[Chorus]
And I don't recall who said it at this time
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down

[Verse 2]
With a rolled up note I'm hovering on that line
Three days on a diet of cocaine and wine
And a little weed just to level me sometime
I put the clock in the drawer because I've cancelled out the time

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So don't knock on my door, don't try to call
I'm holed up in this room talking to the wall
When you're high as this you think you know it all
When you're this deep in there's no place else to fall

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
And still that saying gets inside my mind
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down

[Verse 1]
He wasn't famous but I sure did love him
I've got his picture in a little frame
He lost his life to a big disease before it even had a name
But there's so many more and I've lost count
The hows and whys aren't important now
All that matters is they came around
And brightened up our lives
She was twenty one with her life ahead
You don't need to know her name
She breathed her last on the cold stone floor of a Hollywood arcade
But fate's right hand isn't always just
Puts a lot of pressure on your faith and trust
She was just a little girl isn't that enough
To rage against the day

[Chorus]
And how did we get so lucky?
Targets on the rifle range
Who makes the call and who gets to choose?
Who gets to win and who gets to lose?
It's like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues
And blues never fade away
Hey hey the colors run when the rain falls
But blues never fade away

[Verse 2]
He shone so bright with a lust for life
Like the sun king that he was
His passions hung upon his walls and were printed onto cloth
And for reasons i never understood
About the choices made between the bad and good
I've tried to figure out but
The pain never goes away

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And there's marble markers and little white crosses
Along the beaten path
And I've spread their ashes on the wind
And I miss John Lennon's laugh

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I've seen the bridge and the bridge is long
And they built it high and they built it strong
Strong enough to hold the weight of time
Long enough to leave some of us behind

[Chorus]
And every one of us has to face that day
Do you cross the bridge or do you fade away
And every one of us that ever came to play
Has to cross the bridge or fade away

[Verse 2]
Standing on the bridge looking at the waves
Seen so many jump, never seen one saved
On a distant beach your song can die
On a bitter wind, on a cruel tide

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And the bridge it shines
Oh cold hard iron
Saying come and risk it all
Or die trying

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I'm no longer counting I'm not keeping score
I could say my list of lovers doesn't matter anymore
But some are always in my heart
And some I'm not so sure
Either way they all left their mark
And for some I found a cure

[Chorus]
From one you learn something
Another you learn, nothing
And there's one who might teach you everything
But before I learned to listen
And if indeed someone said it
Then I guess i must have lost it on the wind

[Verse 2]
Back when I was younger each one was a prize
Love just came along and hit you right between the eyes
And one was just a trophy catch
And one was like a curse
Some would want to bleed you dry
Some might quench your thirst

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
In cold water I went fishing in warm seas I cast a line
And swore the heart I was reeling in was perfect at the time
You couldn't tell me I was wrong, you couldn't tell me anything
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind

[Verse 1]
I'm still in love with you, oh, shooting star
And when I start to wonder where you are
There you are, there you are, shooting star
You may have seen me at the early show
I sat and watched you from the second row
Oh, you were mine long ago way back when
Even then we both knew you'd go far, oh, shooting star
And with the spotlight shining in your eyes
It's sometimes hard to find your way
But maybe some night you might
Think of me, shooting star
And when that moment comes at last
And you remember who you are

[Chorus]
Here I'll be, shooting star, shooting star

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Hey how about this
A little conversation tonight
Thinking aloud how we struggled to find
Our place in the dizzy heights
Don't often do this
We never really get the chance
Nearly froze to death on oxford street
Now we're sitting in the south of France
Talking through the evening
It's good to shoot the breeze
Just you and me on a balcony
And cicadas singing in the trees

[Chorus]
Old '67 what a time it was
What a time of innocence, what a time we've lost
Raise a glass and have a laugh, have a laugh or two
Here's to old '67 and an older me and you

[Verse 2]
Sentimental twilight
Conversing on those virgin days
Laughing about how the two of us sound
Like a Tennessee wWlliams play
Honest, it's amazing
That we can get together at all
For in between the saddle and the grand piano
We can read the writing on the wall
Talking through the evening
Sitting here side by side
Just you and me on a balcony
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I've been out here on this road some
Can't help feeling I've been showin' my friends around
I've seen it growin' from next to nothin'
Into a giant, eatin' up your town
Called up the tea leaves and the tarots
Asked the gypsy what she sees in the palm of our hands, oh yeah
She saw a mountain and wild deer runnin'
A crazy kid becoming a better man

[Pre-Chorus]
But we stuck around for the fireworks
Waitin' to explode
Shaped our futures, you a tumbleweed
And me on a yellow brick road
Pleasin' the people some of the time
For better or for worse
An urban soul in a fine, silk suit
And a heart out west in a Wrangler shirt

[Chorus]
And you can't go back
And if you try, it fails
Lookin' up ahead
I see a rusty nail
A sign hangin' from it
Sayin', "Truth for sale"
And that's what we did
No lies at all, just one more tale
About the captain and the kid

[Verse 2]
We've been missin', at times, in action
Can't imagine what he said he might do for you, oh yeah
The devil got to come to the party sometimes
But he never got to wear our shoes
Oh, we've conjured up what we created
Way back then, when I was standin' up in six-inch heels
Now you're ridin' off into the sunset
And I'm still spinnin' like a Catherine wheel

[Pre-Chorus]
But we stuck around for the battle
Waitin' for a plan
To turn you into the brown dirt cowboy
And me into a rocket man
It pleases the people some of the time
Diggin' into our roots
But I got a brand new pair of shoes
And you're on a horse in old cowboy boots

[Chorus]
And you can't go back
And if you try, it fails
Lookin' up ahead
I see a rusty nail
A sign hangin' from it
Sayin', "Truth for sale"
And that's what we did
No lies at all, just one more tale
About the captain and the kid

[Chorus]
No, you can't go back
And if you try, it fails
Lookin' up ahead
I see a rusty nail
A sign hangin' from it
Sayin', "Truth for sale"
And that's what we did
No lies at all, just one more tale
About the captain and the kid

[Verse 1]
The fuse is set and checked once more
Then left beside a back street door
And in the cold gray light, someone sees a shadow
Run through the night and out of sight
They hide inside a smoke filled room
To hear at last the blast of doom
And so the deed is done, they listen
To the final countdown begun, three, two, one
Madness, it's a kind of madness
That turns good men bad
And we're helpless, caught up
In the madness of a world gone mad
The roar of fire rings out on high
And flames light up the black night sky
A child screams out in fear, a hopeless cry for help
But no one is near enough to hear
As walls collapse and timbers flare
The smell of death hangs in the air
When help at last arrives they try to fight the flame
But nothing survives of all those lives

[Chorus]
And it's madness, every time a victim dies
There is madness, burning in a blind man's eyes
And it's madness, hidden in the hate and pain
There is madness, burning in a wild man's brain

[Chorus]
And it's madness, every time the bullets start
There is madness, burning in a poor man's heart
And it's madness, something that we can't control
There is madness, burning in a madman's soul, madness

[Intro]
Ta-hahaha, 28 grams nigga-a, the fuck you wanna do nigga? I'm coning a joint while we talk right now nigga, fuck wrong with you. A zip at a time bitch, put that lil ass shit away.

[Bridge]
Let's have fun

[Verse 1]
What is you saying, my money insane
I'm fresh off a plane, I'm rolling a plant
Girl why is you playin', let's stick to the plan
The weed is so good that it stick to my hand
It come from the land, I know I'm the man
Bought a few packs, so they threw a few in
I don't understand, I know what you payin'
I smoke till it's gone, then grow it again

[Hook]
It ain't nothing to get that zip off
It ain't nothing to get that zip off

[Verse 2]
I was smoking trees at the party, I get gnarly
I got hundred pounds of weed, talking shawty, what you need?
Kush be so strong, hit it once, it's hard to breathe
Have you coughing up a lung, so much smoke you tryna leave
Blowing up a nigga phone, what I tell your ass?
Talking about that pack, I ain't tryna sell your ass
Goddamn, Rollie on my wrist, doobie in my fist
Sipping on the Cris, definitely going to jail if I take a piss
It ain't nothing to get that tip off
Arm out the window, it ain't nothing to get that clip off
It ain't nothing to knock your clique off
Put it in her mouth, I swear she tried to suck my dick off
GODAMN!

[Hook]
It ain't nothing to get that zip off
It ain't nothing to get that zip off
28 grams in a ziplocc
It ain't nothing to get that zip off

[Verse 3]
Got one rolled up, you should roll one too
Let's get fucked up, girl you know how we do
What time? What place? Drink gin, no chase
First time all up, next time, call us
Don't hit the bong, get this smoke, it's bad
Say you smoking strong but you wrong, you've been smoking trash
It ain't in my lungs if it ain't that pressure
First thing in the morning, grab my joint from off the dresser
Keep my OG in a jar cause I like it fresh
Said he’d hit the weed, he ain’t ready yet
Steady flexing on these children like I'm Willie Nelson
No discretion come to drugs, I got a big selection
YES!

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Tyler]
A millionaire, I'm a real young billionaire
Boys Club, Polos and Underwear
My instrumentals can't compare to weak samples, niggas flare
Piano notes the hand sheet cuz i'm a fucking band geek
Real square to be exact
Nigga, asthma attack
I overdose on Prozac cuz i'm a fucking maniac
For a million females, bitches pussy kiss kiss
Talking that she gay knowing damn, well she like dick
In and out her like Itchy And Scrath
Drop the snare cuz the bass is coming back...

[?]
Like you motherfuckers nino
Cuz i have an Odd Future like i been fuckin' Miss Cleo
You niggas is

The Ralph Lauren is 2 hundred dollars
All you motherfucking hypebeast is zeros

You don't make sense like a fat bitch wearing a thong

[Bridge: Tyler]
Motherfucker, i'm i'll

[Verse 2: Tyler]
A milli and 2 milli and 3 milli
I pop whelies on BMX
Eat McFlurry, skate niggas, dirty dirty
Thrash hard, throwing bows
Getting bitches, getting hoes
Eating pussy, manajatwa to licking and sucking toes
I got the fucking flow like rivers
Make you and your bitch quiver, on a blanket
Fat bitches eating banquets
Like it's all that you can eat
My dick is all that i can skeet
And your grandmother's hair
And that bitch truth or dare, me
Like the motherfucking game, i make it rain
With no money, yeah it's funny
Cuz i'm broke and this ain't a fucking joke
Like a hoax, i got the hose
I got my show and i'm the host
Motherfuckers stay here, i'm out like a ghost
And...

[Bridge: Tyler]
Motherfucker, i'm i'll

[Verse 3: Tyler]
They ask the boy cuz the 

[?]
I'm playing with these damn diseases
And sicker than disease
The way that i stroke in piano keys
Just like...
A kid at the oakland DEEP WEB TOUR stop asked me if i would “change my clothes once i made a million.”

I decided to write this:





I guess i wrote all this to say that my attire is deliberate as much as it isn’t.  clothes aren’t really important.  they’re fun and can accentuate the parts of u or ur personality u want people to notice. i do love and appreciate good, well made/ designed clothes. but they’re not necessary. like a lot of things. like art. like us.  that’s kinda what makes it special

"will u change ur clothes once u reach a million?"

I spent 1.2 million out of my own pockets on the DEEP WEB TOUR before wordpress came in and helped with the rest.  because this tour is me.  we use clothes to make a statement about ourselves. that’s what they’re for.  and my clothes, right now, are me

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
I'd die for my motherfuckin' nigga
Jump in front of a bullet for my motherfuckin' nigga
On the stand I'd lie for my motherfuckin' nigga
Rob a bank, I'd drive for my motherfuckin' nigga
Real talk, I don't really fuck with too many niggas
Cause niggas drop a dime on you like a couple nickels
I be laughin' to the bank like the fuckin' money tickle
Drivin' something that you ain't, top off, suck a nipple
And I never put a ho before my bro, don't beef over no ho
And my niggas sell them keys if you can't open your door
Hope you ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
When it rains it pours, it's dry for me and my fuckin' niggas
I kill for my motherfuckin' niggas, vice versa
Eyes red from the kush I blew, white person
Got my middle finger on the trigger
And with my little finger to you niggas
I swear it's fuck all y'all niggas
Except my niggas

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan & Lil Wayne]
I said that I'mma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin outside all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My motherfuckin' niggas!)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga
Yeah bitch, we're high, we're drunk. as fuck. there’s no police fuck man. the day is great. today is large..
(chorus:)
I’ve been hustling like everyday
Doin' time on my grind trynna make a pay
Hey I’m still postin’ on the same block
The same hoodn still duckin' from the same cops
I try hard but the life that I live man ain't all it's seemin'
Sometimes I pray to God I’m dreamin’
But I ain’t try to get out but I can’t damn


Verse 1 (Big Bang)
Ay, yo im Stuck in a situation; hustlin’ to get this paper
Less of a dyin' breed they say that the hood’s in danger
Thats why im in the streets from dawn to dusk. if they could the government would drop a bomb on us
How you supposed to dream big when you’re stuck in a nightmare. stay strapped cuz around here they dont fight fair
Paranoid gotta watch for the cops. cuz they sure dont got abomb playin rocks in the socks gotta probably pretend to tell'em you just a plea.They try to hit you wit six but you will only do three there’s no justice when theyre lockin up just us
The label us as thugs gangstas and hustlas hittin me wit possession now im under arrest. and the reason why i smoke is to deal with the stress. the only things gonna change is what i been wishin: life over hustlin',stuck in the system

Chorus}
Verse 2 (Big Bake)
Well, if there’s hell here it is my home oh so known its where the drug dealers get it in. tryin to make a livin, but i need to make a killin. ya pocket pissin, the projects is a vision
Babies born into hustlas, they the cousins of the customers
The police always f*ck with us but what the f*ck you want from us
You wanna see us suffering the drugs are just the cover up
They always tear us down the moment we think we comin up. if only I can make a couple bucks
To get my grandmother up and out the hood and get her that house she always wanted out in the woods
My intentions are good, though they treat me as the bad guy
Just another black guy tryin to get his stacks high.just another pull over I’m pretty sure its that guy
Not the life I wanted but the life I live
Musics my only way out tell'em bout it wiz

[Hook]

Verse 3 (Big Bang)

I’ve been .. vision
The way I’m living ..but the same time in prison ..
‘cause I’m seeing that they need something
Now who am I not to supply to get this money I’m not a dummy
I know this is a vicious cycle .. stronger with the bottom line
..survival that’s why I try to be the bets man that I can
I’m not looking for every man woman to understand
Listen this is my struggle
Why they see so many niggas lock the way
..pretty box .. i said ..is coming, but while I live people .. for nothing
I’m smoking guns .. I’ma just do it not talking ..
Watch my movements because the proof is always in ..

[Intro]
But it hurts to think you're somewhere on a search for me
I'm right here with no words to speak
Daydreaming about what could never be
It will never be
But I wonder, do you think of me?
Do you think of me? 'Cause I'm thinking of

[Bridge]
All I wanted was to keep this love alive (Yeah)
And all I wanted was to be there by your side (Yeah yeah)
I know better than to keep on telling lies
Should have swallowed my pride
But I think sometimes that

[Chorus]
Maybe it was best, it was best that we let it go
Maybe it was best, it was best that we let it go
But it hurts to think
You're somewhere on a search for me
I'm right here with no words to speak
Daydreaming about what could never be
It will never be
But I wonder
Do you think of me?
Do you think of me?
'Cause I'm thinking of you
Maybe it was best, it was best that we let it go
Maybe it was best, it was best that we let it go

[Verse 1]
I think it's best that we let it go
No stress than the mess we was headed for
'Cause only trouble had vision in the telescope
A peace of mind better than mission impossible
Who want a possible?
I take a bird in the hand if it's toucan
But two can't play the star in a new band
Rockin wit you, get it poppin' wit you
When da gossip hit you, I don't wanna say I shoulda coulda woulda would
Any nigga in his right mind wanna keep a grudge
Deadly flow, kid, you ain't never seen a dove
Dancing over trouble what its papas daughter
Rolling Stones, she can't hide in a Louis clutch
The bigger man when I look back at it pretty much
Another chance at it, pass on it like a bud
Just hit the gas on it, man, shortly to the club
I think it's best it was best that we split up

[Chorus]
Maybe it was best, it was best that we let it go
Maybe it was best, it was best that we let it go
But it hurts to think
You're somewhere on a search for me
I'm right here with no words to speak
Daydreaming about what could never be
It will never be
But I wonder
Do you think of me?
Do you think of me?
'Cause I'm thinking of you
Maybe it was best, it was best that we let it go
Maybe it was best, it was best that we let it go

[Verse 2]
And, all I ever wanted was a good girl
Good girls come within, I got a tell a little girl
Shawty lil mama, let's try to save the drama
I know I ain't a saint, but still believe in karma
I'm gon' try to get my shit together
Oh yeah, I know its misery
So what the hell I tell her?
Hello, good morning
I was out with my homie for his birthday
But that excuse had neva had me comin' home late
You straight, I'm straight, I don't wanna deal with it
Yeah, she told me that a couple times, I'ma live with it
No, yo let me know, I might come visit
That's when you know you got the rope around your neck
Pitchin, scratching, choking whatever
Hangin' from the tree, the next time I know better
Face tattooed on me should've got letters
Dead to her face if I could, I'll tell her

[Chorus]
Maybe it was best, it was best that we let it go
Maybe it was best, it was best that we let it go
But it hurts to think
You're somewhere on a search for me
I'm right here with no words to speak
Daydreaming about what could never be
It will never be
But I wonder
Do you think of me?
Do you think of me?
'Cause I'm thinking of you
Maybe it was best, it was best that we let it go
Maybe it was best, it was best that we let it go

[Verse 1]
She picks up the phone
In my head I know I'm wrong
I just want to know what she's heard
I'm pacing back and forth, cause I know that I've been caught
Trying to think of the perfect words

[Chorus]
So I can come to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes
I'ma run to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes
Time is not on our side
'Cause she's waving goodbye goodbye
She's waving goodbye goodbye
Smartphones, dumb shit

[Verse 2]
Never knew I call so if she heard it all
I'm all out of luck tonight
I can say it was a joke but who am I kidding she ain't slow
Only way to make it right

[Chorus]
Is if I can come to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes
I'ma run to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes
Oh gonna tell you whatever it takes
Whatever it takes, whatever it takes
Whatever it takes, take
Whatever it takes
Oh girl
Smartphones, dumb shit

[Bridge]
Don't you wave goodbye goodbye, smartphones, dumb shit
Don't you wave goodbye goodbye smartphones, dumb shit
Aw man I got to think of something
I'm about to lose it all
I swear that shit really didn't mean nothing
It all started with a pocket call

[Chorus]
So I'ma run to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say, yeah
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes
I'ma run to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
I'm gonna say whatever it takes
Time is not on our side
'Cause she's waving goodbye goodbye
She's waving goodbye goodbye
Smartphones, dumb shit
Smartphones, dumb shit
Smartphones, dumb shit

[Chorus]
Don't cry, my sweet girl
Nothing I say is written in stone
Don't cry, my sweet love
You won't really be alone

[Verse]
I'll help you pack your things
I'll walk with you out to the car
I'll hold on to the ring
I won't forget the way things are
My sweet love
Your disappointed eyes
Are haunting me like my big lies
I see you glaring now
I see you staring in the fire
My sweet love

[Chorus]
Don't cry, my sweet girl
Nothing I say is written in stone
Don't cry, my sweet love
You won't really be alone

[Bridge]
My sweet love, my sweet love

[Outro]
Don't cry, my sweet girl
You won't really be alone
Don't cry, my sweet girl
You won't really be alone
Don't cry, my sweet girl
You won't really be alone

[Intro: Madonna]
My love's a revolver, revolver, revolver...
My love's a revolver, revolver, revolver...

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Oops, I guess I'll shot ya
My finger's on the trigger
I had a bullet with your name on it
Click-click
I'm a sex pistol
My love should be illegal
Real deal, baby
I'm no counterfeit
Click-click

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
Ay-oh-ee-oh
My body's fully loaded
And I've got more ammo
Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
Ay-oh-ee-oh
You're an accessory to murder, 'cause

[Chorus: Madonna]
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
I let it bang bang

[Verse 2: Madonna]
You've been hit by a smooth criminal
A bad girl, I gotcha crying to your mumma
Saying "I can't believe it" (I can't believe it)
I've seen your type, bring a knife into a gun fight
Caught up in the law right
I think I'm in love and I

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
Ay-oh-ee-oh
My body's fully loaded
And I've got more ammo
Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill

[Chorus: Madonna]
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
I let it bang bang

[Post-Chorus: Madonna]
I let it bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
I shoot 'em bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
I line 'em up and watch them fall

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Bang
Tha shooting name is Wayne
The victim didn't complain, she just screamed "shoot again"
I gave her extra rounds, my barrel twist around
I am Mr. shoot 'em down, I leave hearts on tha ground
My love is a weapon, and yes I use it well
Then I let the rose petals cover up the bullet shells
I never shoot and tell, I only shoot to kill
And the vest ain't gonna help it even if it's made of steel

[Chorus: Madonna, Madonna & Lil Wayne]
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?

I line 'em up and watch them fall
Hey, I shoot 'em bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
I line 'em up and watch them fall

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy? Yeah

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
These streets is Jurassic, cowards get asthematic
Astronauts hover throughout the atmosphere
That's the ghetto bird. Pull up on the curve
"Wassup homie!", smoke a nigga then dip
It's the immaculate, verbal assassin
Strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent
This the Jesus of Nazareth
Spittin' gold policies to a world unknown
In a cherry low low, with four zones of weed
No sticks, no seeds
Prestigious when I pulsate the 50 states
My need for speak can corral the largest crowds
Mosh pit, with a big dick screamin' "Bitches ain't shit!"
She gobble gobble for hours, I jumped in the shower
I dismantle, devour hardest Emcees, softer than clam chowder
No challengers can compete, their childish and weak, detrimental
Hazardous hazard to instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein

[Hook]
I'm Corrupted
I'm Corrupted

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Gimme a hundred g's, for every emcee I dropped to their knees
Verbally useless
"Oh you got the juice!?" I squeeze you juiceless
Catch you, hang you, from any nooses
Been the truth since "Snoop and Tha Pound" was fuckin over Ruthless
Young and I'm ruthless
21 with 21 guns, shot and saluted for Pac
Lyrical cyclops, lasering in on paper and fraudulent friends
Bitch you's a bitch in disguise, and bitches get ten
Bullets to their midsection, Mr. Lethal Injection
In the regal higher than church steeples
I swear to God, can ya lyrics in a jar
I'm a pterodactyl tearin ya squad like pardon
Me and Terrace Martin enacting Martin
Cannibal coexisting with the coldest, that mean I'm the sickest
And Thera-flu won't do, whenever I'm kicking the wickedness
Explosive, cinematic, smoking
Like the barrel of this TEC aimin at ya neck

[Hook]
I'm Corrupted
I'm Corrupted

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm from C-O-M-P-T-O any nigga can get it
The lil homie strapped and he with it
At the Avalon's swap meet, "wassup fool!?"
Blunt longer than Rosecrans
I grab the devil then slow dance
Practice trigonometry
Practice my aim on rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches
You are counterfeit, worthless piece of verses surf this
West Coast with a big scope kill all yal
It's Top Dawg, TDE, CPT
Quick to tell a bitch jump on my dick A-S-A-P
Complete havoc composer, disorder: rhyme addict
Slaughter houses full of Joeys, Joells, and Royces for ya
Live from the area code of 310
Laughing all the way to the bank with 3 elmos
Three 64's, 1 bottle of goose
I'm the truth
You can put ya hand on the bible and shoot

[Hook]
I'm Corrupted

[Chorus 1]
It is not the truth
It is not the truth, now, baby
It is not the truth, now
What I say?

[Chorus 2]
Eat watermelon
Eat peaches and cream
Eat ripe tomatoes
You know what I mean

[Chorus 1]

[Verse]
Your majesty
Your curvaceousness
Your highness
Your soulfulness

[Chorus 3]
Make love to me, babe
Make love to me
Make me feel all right, now
Make me feel so good

[Chorus 1]

[X2]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 1]

[Intro]
(Hey love...hey love)

[Verse 1]
Hey love (Hey love)
May I have a word with you? (Hey love)
I'd like to tell you, yeah (Hey love)
Just what I've been going through (Hey love)
My nights are so long
As I watch each hour go by
Hoping and praying
That someday I will be your guy

[Chorus]
Hey love
You're my one true soul desire
Hey love, baby
Can you feel this burning fire?

[Verse 2]
Hey love (Hey love)
There's one thing I find so true (Hey love)
When you are near me (Hey love)
I go through a change or two (Hey love)
Hearing your footsteps
I hurry to catch your eye
And I stand there waiting, yeah
But girl, you just walk on by

[Chorus]
Say love
With a cold heart you are dealing
Hey love, yeah yeah
It's an awful hurting feeling

[Outro]
Hey love (Hey love)
Don't pass me without some sign (Hey love)
Just look me over, yeah yeah (Hey love)
You might want to change your mind (Hey love)
Hey love (Hey love)
My pretty little lovely one (Hey love)
Hey

[Verse 1]
Whoa, oh, oh, yeah
Mmm, hmm, Sylvia
You know you're getting to me now
Mmm, mmm, Sylvia
You gently touched my heart somehow

[Chorus]
Yesterday, you made me happy as a child at play
Just like the summer sun that warms my heart
And move on, now you are gone

[Verse 2]
Whoa, oh, oh, Sylvia
You're everything that I adore
That sweetest song, the kind is sparking me even more, yeah
Tenderly, that's how you whispered that you love me
As if a raindrop kissed my ear and disappeared, now you are gone

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
You know I love my little Sylvia

[Chorus]
Whoa, oh, oh, yeah
And yesterday I fell in love with you all the way
Tenderly, you lit a spark here in my heart, now you are gone

[Outro]
Mmm, hmm, Sylvia
I gently miss Sylvia
I'm crazy about you, Sylvia
You know I love my little Sylvia

[Verse 1]
Like a long lonely stream
I keep running towards a dream
Moving on, moving on
Like a branch on a tree
I keep reaching to be free
Moving on, moving on

[Chorus]
'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

[Verse 2]
Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load
Moving on, moving on
Like this tired troubled earth
I've been rolling since my birth
Moving on, moving on

[Chorus]
'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
I know there's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

[Bridge]
You know when times are bad
And you're feeling sad
I want you to always remember

[Chorus]
Yes, there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
I know there's a place in the sun

[Verse 1]
How many roads must a man walk down before they call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must those cannonballs be fired before they're forever banned?
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Let me tell you that the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Oh, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
(Well. how many years?)
How many years must a mountain exist before it is washed to the sea? Yeah
How many years can a man exist before he's allowed to be free? Yeah
Now, how many times can a man turn his head and he pretends that he just doesn't see?
Whoa, yeah

[Chorus]
You know the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Uh-huh

[Outro]
Uh-huh
And let me tell you it's blowin' (Blowin')
Blowin' (Blowin')
And it's blowin'
Oh, the answer is blowin' in the wind
And it's blowin', yeah yeah yeah
The answer is blowin' in the wind

[Verse 1]
I know I've been mean to you lately
And I made you so sad
And I know your love was true, baby
And this makes me feel bad
'Cause now I see I'm about to lose you
And it's driving me mad
You're all I ever had, girl

[Chorus]
Everybody needs somebody like you, oh baby
Everybody needs somebody, and I need you

[Verse 2]
You know, darlin'
Hadn't thought much about it when I left you behind
But now I'm almost certain, baby
When I left, you were cryin'
Oh, I ask myself, how could I do it?
How could I be so blind?
So selfish and unkind

[Chorus]
Everybody needs somebody like you
You'd better believe, darlin'
Everybody needs somebody, and I need you
Ooh yeah...ooh yeah
Everybody needs somebody like you
Somebody...

[Verse 3]
Take these arms and hold you tight
And these lips that can explain
How someone that means you right
Can cause you so much pain
Oh, the only plea to enter for myself
Is that I'm not to blame
Temporarily insane, girl

[Chorus]
Everybody needs somebody like you, oh baby
Everybody needs somebody, and I need you
Yes, I do, darlin'
Everybody needs somebody like you
Oh baby, I need you

[Intro]
Baby, baby, sign my contract on love
Baby, baby, sign my contract on love
Baby, baby, sign my contract on love
Baby, baby, sign it
Sign it, sing it, sing it

[Verse 1]
You say you love me
And I believe it's true
But before I let myself go
Here's what you've got to do

[Chorus]
(Sign it, sign it, sign it, sign it)
You've got to sign
(You, you, you'd better sign it)

Write it in your heart
(You, you, you'd better sign it)
That you'll never do anything
To ever make us part
(Sign it, sign it, sign it, sign it)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know it may seem strange to you
Yeah, but I've lost a love so many times before
Yeah, and now that I know the score
No one's gonna hurt me no more
And I'm taking all my chances with romances

[Chorus]
(Sign it, sign it, sign it, sign it)
You've got to sign
(You, you, you'd better sign it)
My contract on love
(You, you, you'd better sign it)
Write it in your heart
(You, you, you'd better sign it)
That you'll never do anything
To ever make us part
(Sign it, sign it, sign it, sign it)

(Sign it, sign it, sign it, sign it)
You've got to sign
(You, you, you'd better sign it)
My contract on love
(You, you, you'd better sign it)
Write it in your heart
(You, you, you'd better sign it)
That you'll never do anything
To ever make us part
(Sign it, sign it, sign it, sign it)
(Sign it, sign it, sign it, sign it)
You've got to sign
(You, you, you'd better sign it)
My contract on love

Write it in your heart

That you'll never do anything
To ever make us part

[Chorus]
Hold me, darling hold me
And I'll always be here to be your guy
Closer, baby come closer
Let me be the one you love and be right here by your side

[Verse]
Why should you be lonely when I need you so?
Give my arms a chance, I know I'll never let go

[Chorus]
So hold me, baby hold me
Say you'll never let me go

[Verse]
Why should you be lonely when I need you so?
Give my arms a chance, I know I'll never let go

[Chorus]
So hold me, baby hold me
Say you'll never let me go

[Outro]
You know I love you so
(I'll never-never let you go)
I'll never let you go
(Oh baby-baby, hold me)
Why should we be apart?
(I'll never-never let you go)
I've given you my heart
(Oh baby-baby, hold me)
Don't go away today
(I'll never-never let you go)

[Intro]
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight

[Verse 1]
I'm a poor man's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hanging on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight because my heart is true

[Chorus]
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight

[Verse 2]
She's a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
She says no one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poor man's son
Can't give her the things that money can't buy
But I'll never, never make my baby cry

[Chorus]
And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, hahahahaha, yeah
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, way out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, clean out of...

[Verse 1]
Someday at Christmas men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free

Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

[Chorus]
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

[Verse 2]
Someday at Christmas we'll see a land
With no hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment, one prayer away
From our world today

[Chorus]
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

[Verse 3]
Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Hate will be gone and love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart

[Chorus]
(Someday all our dreams will come to be)
(Someday in a world where men are free)
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime
Someday at Christmastime

[Verse 1]
City sidewalks
Busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas

Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear

[Chorus]
Silver bells (silver bells), silver bells (silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (ring-a-ling), hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

[Verse 2]
Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you hear

[Chorus]
Silver bells (silver bells), silver bells (silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (ring-a-ling), hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

[Chorus]
Silver bells (silver bells), I hear silver bells (silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (ring-a-ling), hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Silver bells (silver bells), I hear silver bells (silver bells)...

[Verse 1]
I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pigtails
I knew I loved her even then

[Verse 2]
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boo-hooed it
But I told them time and time again
"Don't you know I was made to love her
Build my world all around her"
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years

[Verse 4]
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 5]
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, hey
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere

[Verse 6]
I was knee-high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there

[Verse 7]
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah!
Ah, I was made to love her
Build my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh baby, I was made to please her
You know Stevie ain't gon' leave her, no
Hey, hey, hey, ooh wee, baby

[Verse 1 - Stevie Wonder]
Come they told me
Pa rum pum pum pum
A new born King to see
Pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring
Pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the kIng

[Chorus - Stevie Wonder]
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum

[Verse 2 - Stevie Wonder]
So to honor Him
Pa rum pum pum pum
When we come

Little baby
Pa rum pum pum pum
I am a poor boy too
Pa rum pum pum pum
I have no gift to bring
Pa rum pum pum pum
That's fit to give our King

[Chorus - Stevie Wonder]
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum

[Verse 3 - Stevie Wonder]
Shall I play for you
Pa rum pum pum pum
On my drum

Mary nodded
Pa rum pum pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time
Pa rum pum pum pum
I played my drum for Him
Pa rum pum pum pum
I played my best for Him

[Chorus - Stevie Wonder]
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum

[Outro - Stevie Wonder]
Then He smiled at me
Pa rum pum pum pum
Me and my drum
Oh yeah, well...
What you want, baby, I got it
What you need, you know I got it
All I'm asking for
Is just a little respect when I get home
Yeah, when I get home
Yeah yeah

You can do me wrong while I'm gone
You can do me wrong if you want
I ain't gonna do you wrong 'cause I don't wanna
All I'm asking for
Is just a little respect when I get home
When I get home, yeah, oh yeah

I'm about to give you all of my money
But all I'm asking in return, honey
Is to give me my respect when I get home
Oh yeah, got to have respect

Yeah yeah yeah, give it to me
Oh baby, you know I need it
Ooh, your kiss is sweeter than honey, baby
But guess what, so is all my money
All I want you to do for me
Is give it up when I get home
Yeah baby, a little respect, darlin'

[Harmonica solo]

Hey, little respect, darlin'
What I want, yeah, I really need it now
Give it up to me, 'cause I got to have it, baby
Really, really need it, oh yeah
When I get home, I really need it
In the morning, in the evening
Come on, please, please Stevie
Oh yeah, baby love
Just a little respect when I get home

[Verse 1]
I've got sunshine, on a cloudy day
When its cold outside, I've got the month of May

[Chorus]
I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (My girl, my girl)
Talking 'bout my girl (My girl)

[Verse 2]
I've got so much honey, the bees envy me, mmm-hmm
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees

[Chorus]
Well, I guess you'll say
What pretty little girl can make me feel this way?
My girl (My girl, my girl)
Talking 'bout my girl (My girl)
Ooh, hoo hoo, yeah yeah

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey...
Hey, hey, hey...
Ooh yeah

[Verse 3]
I don't need money, fortune or fame, oh no
'Cause I've got all the riches, baby
One man can claim

[Chorus]
Well, I guess you'll say
What can make Stevie feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talking 'bout my girl

[Outro]
(Talking 'bout my girl)
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl
I've even got the month of May with my girl
(my girl, my girl)
Talking 'bout, talking, talking 'bout my girl
Oh, ho, my girl

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you about a girl I know
She is my baby and she lives next door
Every morning before the sun comes up
She brings my coffee in my favorite cup

[Chorus 1]
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

[Verse 2]
When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know she'll stick with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say she told me so

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four, I hear her on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
And whispers "Stevie, every thing is all right"

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
Now, baby when you sigh
(when you sigh)
I want to sigh with you
When you cry
(when you cry)
I want to cry some, too

[Chorus]
Now, ain't that love
(ain't that love)
Oh, ain't that love that I feel
(that I feel)
In my heart for you

[Verse 2]
When your friends
(when your friends)
Turn their back on you
I'll be here
(I'll be here)
Just to see you through

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now when you walk
(when you walk)
I want to walk with you
When you talk
(when you talk)
Want to talk some, too

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
If you ever
(if you ever)
Ever need a friend
I'll be with you
(be with you)
Yes, until the end

[Chorus]

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Baby, won't you let me hold your hand
I want to squeeze you as tight as I can
Baby, don't you need my by your side
To protect you and be your guide
Baby, I'm so in love with you
I'd do anything you tell me to

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh, that I feel in my heart for you

[x3]
Don't you do it, don't you break my heart
Oh baby, don't you do it, darlin'
Don't you break my heart
Don't you do it, baby
Don't you break my heart

Well, I sacrifice to make you happy
Kept nothin' for myself
Now you wanna leave me
For the love of someone else
My pride is all gone, whether right or wrong
I need you, baby, girl, to keep on keepin' on
Girl, I tried to do my best
Tried and tried to do my best
Don't you do it, baby
Don't you break my heart
Oh, don't you do it, baby

My biggest mistake was lovin' you too much
And lettin' you know
'Cause now you've got me where you want me
And you wanna let me go
If my heart was made glass, then you'll surely see
Heartaches and misery, girl, you've been causin' me
Girl, I tried to do my best
Tried and tried to do my best
Don't you do it, darlin', don't you break my heart
Oh, don't you do...
Go down to the river, and, and there I'll be
Well, I'm gonna jump in, darlin', if you don't see by me
Open up your eyes; can't you see I love you, love you, love you?
Open up your heart, darlin'; can't you see I need you, baby?
I'm no good without you, just can't do without you
Stevie's no good without you, life's no good without you
Hey, baby, don't do it, oh, don't you break my heart, ha
Don't do without you, can't be without you

[Verse 1]
Whoo, well, don't you know, baby
Child, don't you know baby
Oh, don't you know baby
Little girl, little girl, don't you know
Please listen to me baby
Girl, I'm in love with you so
Turn your lamp down low
I said turn your lamp down low
Wooo, turn it down

[Chorus 1]
Please turn your lamp down low
Come on baby
Girl I'm in love with you so

[Verse 2]
Now I know I've been away
For such a long, long time
But now baby
I can't get you off of my mind

[Chorus 2]
So come on, please baby come on
Come on, come on
Love your daddy all night long

[Verse 3]
Now if you love me
Like I love you
We can do all the things that we
Used to do

[Chorus]

[Solo - Piano]

[Verse 4]
Say, have you heard baby
Ray Charles is in town
Let's mess around until the midnight hour
See what he's putting down

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
You hear me talking, baby
Baby please come on

[Verse 1]
I know you told me
Such a long time ago
Oh, that you didn't want me, girl
No, you said you didn't love me no more

[Chorus]
And I know it's something
What is it that makes me love you the way I do?
Must be that I'm a fool for you
I said I'm a fool for you

[Verse 2]
I know you told me
You didn't want me around
Ooh, but I know, girl
I know you got another guy across town, oh yeah

[Chorus]
And I know it's something
What is it, what is it that makes me love you the way I do?
Must be that I'm a fool for you
Such a fool for you

[Bridge]
Did you ever wake up in the morning, baby
Just about the break of day
With nothing on your mind
But love, love, sweet love
And find your baby's gone away?
Then you break down, go and start crying
Like you never cried before
Even cry so loud, yeah
You wake up all the people upstairs and all next door
Ever since I was one, two, three, four, five-years-old, baby
You know I've been a fool for you
Deep, deep down in my soul, baby
I'm a fool for you

[Outro]
And I, I know it's something
Oh, it's something that you got that I love
Makes me do what I do
'Cause I'm a fool for you
I, I, I'm a fool for you, yeah
I know I'm a fool for you

[Verse 1]
Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine

[Chorus]
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
Your love and so is love

[Verse 2]
I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci with tears in my eyes
You look the same
You're a lot the same
But my heart says "No, no, you're not the same"

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Your words don't mean what they used to me
They were once inspired, now they're just routine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over

[Verse]
It brings a tear
Into my eyes
When I begin
To realize
I've cried so much
Since you've been gone
I guess I'm drowning in my own tears
I sit and cry
Just like a child
My pouring tears
Are running wild
If you don't think
You'll be home soon
I guess I'll drown in my own tears
I know it's true
Into each life
Some rain, rain must pour
I'm so blue
Here without you
It keeps raining
More and more
Why don't you
Come on home
Oh yes, so I won't
Be all alone
If you don't think
You'll be home soon

[Outro]
I guess I'll
(Drown in my own tears)
Ooh, don't let me
(Drown in my own tears)
When I'm in trouble, baby
(Drown in my own tears)
Oh, yeah, baby don't let me
(Drown in my own tears)
I guess I'll drown in my own tears
Oh, mmh

[Verse 1]
Ah, listen everybody, especially you, girl
Is it right to be left alone
While the one you love is never home?
I love too hard, my friends sometimes say
I believe, I believe that a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside to see you treat me so unkind
Somebody somewhere tell her it's unfair

[Chorus]
Can I get a witness? (Somebody, somebody)
Can I get a witness, yeah (Come be my witness)
Somebody (Somebody, somebody)
I want a witness (Come be my witness)

[Verse 2]
Is it right to be treated so bad
When you give it everything you had?
Even tossed in my sleep
'Cause I haven't seen my baby all week
And you chicks do agree
That is ain't the way love's supposed to be, let me hear you
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Up early in the morning with her on my mind
Just to find out all night that I've been cryin'
But I believe, I believe a woman's a man's best friend
So I'm gonna stick by her 'til the very end
She's caused so much misery
I forget how love's supposed to be
Somebody somewhere, tell her it's unfair

[Chorus]
Can I get a witness? Oh, I want a witness
(Somebody, somebody)
Somebody (Come be my witness)
All right (Somebody, somebody)
I really, really need a witness (Come be my witness)

[Verse 3]
Everybody knows, especially you girls
A love can be sad, half a love is twice as bad
Now you chicks, you do agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah
I want a witness (Somebody, somebody)
Need right now (Come be my witness)
Gotta get it somehow (Somebody, somebody)
Oh yeah (Come be my witness)
I need a witness, yeah (Somebody, somebody)
Give it to me, yeah (Come be my witness)
I need a witness now (Somebody, somebody)
I pity the fool
I said I pity the fool
Oh, oh, I pity the fool
You know I pity the fool
Who falls in love with you
And expects for you to be true
Oh, I pity the fool

Look at the people
I know you're wondering what they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me
Look at the people
I know you're wondering what they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

Look at the people
I know you're wondering
What they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me
Oh, I pity the fool
My, my, my, my, my, my, I pity the fool
Oh, I pity the fool
You know I pity the fool
'Cause she'll break your heart one day
And then she'll laugh and walk away
Oh, I pity the fool

I want you to look at the people
I know you're wondering what they're doing
They're just standing there
Standing there, watching you make a fool of me
Just look at the people
I know you're wondering what they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

Oh, I pity the fool
Baby, baby, you know I pity the fool
La la la la la, I pity the fool

[Verse]
Frankie & Johnny were sweethearts
At least, that's the way the story goes
Frankie bought everything for Johnny
From his sports-car to his Ivy League clothes
Oh, he was a man alright
Oh, but he was doing wrong
Just to show you what came happen
A friend came running to Frankie
Said you know I wouldn't tell you no lie
I saw your man riding in his Jaguar
With a chick named Mary Bley
Oh, if he was your man honey
Let me tell you he was doing you wrong
Let me tell the story
Frankie ran around the corner
And peeked in a swinging place
And there she saw Johnny with a woman
He had his arm around her waist
Oh, he was a man alright
But Frankie could see that he was doing wrong
Oh, let me tell you
Frankie reached down in her pocketbook
And up with a long 44
She shot once, twice, three times
And Johnny fell on the hardwood floor
Oh, he was a man alright
But she shot him because he was doing wrong
But the last thing he told her was

[Bridge]
Frankie, you know I love you
Why, honey why did you do that
Frankie, I was telling her about you
Frankie, you know I love you
Frankie, you know that I love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Frankie you know good well that I love you
Frankie I'll always love you baby
Frankie, you know I can't do without you
Frankie, you know I love you
I'm your man and I know I was doing wrong

[Verse 1]
One little Christmas tree was standing alone
Waiting for someone to come by
One little Christmas tree that never had grown
Cried as he looked up to the sky

Oh please Mr. Father tree, the tallest of all
I'm so afraid and so alone
Could one little Christmas tree so tiny and small
Light up someone's home 'cause

[Chorus]
One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little child can find a toy
One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little heart can find some joy

[Verse 2]
One little angel who was riding a star
Cried as she looked down at the tree
Oh please Mr. Father tree wherever you are
May I give him the star you gave to me
Then in the heavens came a voice from afar
A voice that was heard throughout the world
Go down little angel girl and give him your star
Tonight he'll light the world 'cause

[Chorus]
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So those who are lost may find their way
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So all men may see on Christmas day

One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So those who are lost may find their way
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So all men may see on Christmas day

One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So those who are lost may find their way

[Chorus]
Please, please, please
Please, please, please
Honey, please don't go
Oh no no, I love you so
(Baby, please don't go)

[Verse 1]
Baby, you done me wrong
I said you done me wrong
Darling, you know you done me wrong
Oh yes you did, girl
Took my love and now you're gone
(Baby, please don't go)

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard sleeping tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every Mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Chorus]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

[Harmonica solo]

[Chorus]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

[Verse 1]
Your precious sweetheart, she's so faithful, she's so true
Oh yeah
Her dreams are tumbling, her world is crumbling because of you, uhh uh
One day you'll hurt her just once too much
And when you finally lose your tender touch, hey, hey

[Chorus]
Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo- Be-Doo-Da-Day
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray, oh yeah
Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo- Be-Doo-Da-Dee
You going to send your baby straight to me

I'm going to give her all the lovin' within my heart, oh yeah

And when she tells you she's cried her last tear
Heaven knows I'm going to be somewhere near, oh yeah

Heartaches are calling tears are falling because of you
Hey, yeah
And when you're gone you'll know I'm the one to go to her rescue

You're going to leave her once too many times and when you come back

Her feet may wander, her heart may stray, yeah yeah

Love's gon' send your baby straight to me
Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo- Be-Doo-Da-Day...

[Verse]
Close your eyes, beddy bye tin soldier
Mommy says that it's time for sleep
If my folks were wiser and older
They'd know kids and toys don't need sleep

Don't be bad little cotton dolly
See how nice Mickey Mouse sleeps now?
Even my brass drummer boy has stopped all his noise
Cause he knows it's past bedtime for toys

[Speaking]
Ya know, every Christmas Santa Claus goes all over the world with his reindeer
Sled, and a big bag of toys and he'll come to your house this year too
But sometimes, just sometimes, he doesn't have enough time to see every little boy and girl because the world is so big
So maybe we should sing a song for all the children that Santa didn't visit

Bless the child who has no tin soldier
No brass drummer boy to put to bed
He will still grow wiser and older
Loving one small rag doll instead
He won't have a cotton dolly
Mickey Mouse won't come to his house
Hold that rag doll to your heart, nothing can destroy
The beauty one shall find in one small toy

[Intro]
Sunset, sunset
It's sunset, it's sunset

[Verse]
You went and left happy
You're all alone
You turned and walked away
About this time of day
It was always sunset

[Chorus]
Sunset
I didn't want you to see me cry
So I turned my head
To hide the tears in my eyes
When evening shadows fall
That's when I miss you most of all

Sunset
I didn't want you to see me cry
So I turned my head
To hide the tears in my eyes
When evening shadows fall
That's when I miss you most of all

[Outro]
And oh, it's sunset
Oh, sunset

[Intro]
Do do do do do

[Verse 1]
I never, never had a dream come true
In my every dream, I'm loved by you
And we're free as the wind
And true love is no sin
Therefore, men are men, not machines

[Chorus]
I never, never had a dream come true

[Verse 2]
Without you, the world out there is painted shades of blue
Since our roads never crossed
I work just to please the boss
Think I might as well get lost in my dreams

[Chorus]
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
I never, never had a dream come true

[Verse 3]
Yes, I'm going to dream about you baby my whole life through
Seems my folks are ashamed
Said I ain't worth a thing
But I'm glad I'm chained to my dreams

[Outro]
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Keep on dreaming
Do do do do do
Sing along with me
Do do do do do
Keep on dreaming

[Verse 1]
Twinkle twinkle
Little me
I have a lovely light
I'm the star
Upon your tree
That makes your Christmas bright
Twinkle twinkle little me
I left the milky way
Just so I could come and be with you on Christmas day

[Chorus 1]
Angels brought me where you are
And heaven gave me light
I'm that friendly little star
You wish upon each night

[Chorus 2]
Twinkle twinkle little me
I have a present too
If you give unselfishly
And make a wish come true
I'll always shine for you

[Talking]
Hi kids!
Look out your window
You see that little star way up there?
The one that's all alone
Well that's me
That's right
And this Christmas, I'm coming all the way down
To where you are
Just to light up your Christmas tree
And I hope
To light up your hearts

[Chorus 2]
Well, twinkle twinkle little me
I have a present too
If you give unselfishly
And make a wish come true

[Outro]

Hey, you were good at playing the fox girl
When I was good, you threw me a bone
But I ain't playing hard for nobody
Girl just wait 'til I get you home
I'll show you the way to love somebody
Like you've never ever been shown before
Because my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you

Hey baby, you played the part with Jimmy and Freddie
You tried to make me look like a fool
But I took care of Cindy and Susie
Just to show you I can be twice as cruel Baby
If you want to learn how to love me
I'll teach you in my own private school
Because my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you

(You met your match) When you play with my affection
(You met your match) When you tried to make me walk the line
When you decided you would hurt me
That's when your grape fell off the vine
Your mama told me that I better be mellow
She said you're just a baby maybe too green
I told her Jimmy, Freddie, Teddy and Victor
They know better, mama shake off that dream
I told her that you really were cooking
My love is burning for a turn at the steam
Hey, because my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you

(You met your match) When you told me you loved me
(You met your match) When you told me that you wouldn't let go

[Outro]

And now I'm worried that you can see

[Verse 1]

(Hey) While you see it your way (Hey)
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone

[Refrain]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Verse 2]

[Refrain]
We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong

Always treats me like a fool
Kick me when I'm down, that's your rule
I don't know why I love you
But I love you, ooooooh

With another guy, you laugh in my face
Lord how long must I be disgraced
Because I love you
Oh baby, baby, baby

I don't know why I love you
I don't know
You and me baby, oh
I don't know why I love you baby
But I love you baby
Oh darling, darling, darling

You throw my heart down in the dirt
You made me crawl on, on this cold black earth, baby
No I never, I never knew how much love could hurt
Till I loved you baby
Till I loved you baby, baby

[Verse 4]
Oh baby, I can't stop
I can't stop crying, can't you see
Here I'm pleading on my knees
I'm on my knees
Won't you help me, help me please
Because I love you, how I love you baby, whoahhh
Sure enough, baby, yeah

[Outro]
I don't know, you don't know
We don't know nothin' about it
Can't do nothing about it
I don't know baby, I don't know
Oh baby, I don't know, I don't know
You don't know nothing about it
Nobody can do nothing about it
I don't know baby

[Intro]
Ah-hey!
Oh yeah, baby!

[Verse 1]
Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours! Mmh!
Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours! Ahh!

[Chorus]
Here I am, baby, oh oh
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)
Here I am, baby

You got my future in your hands, hey hey
I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, ah hey, yeah yeah
Didn't I? Oh baby

[Verse 2]
Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
Ahh, I’m yours!
Ooh wee baby, you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Here I am, baby, whoa-oh
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, ahh

Signed, sealed, delivered, I’m yours!
Here I am, baby, ahh
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

[Verse]
The shadow of your smile when you are gone
Will color all my dreams and light the dawn
Look into my eyes, my love, and see
All the lovely things you are to me
Our wistful little star was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips and so did I

[Chorus]

[x2]
Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The Shadow of your smile

[Outro]
The Shadow of your smile

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Heaven help the child who never had a home
Heaven help the girl who walks the streets alone
Heaven help the roses if the bombs begin to fall
Heaven help us all
Heaven help the black man if he struggles one more day
Heaven help the white man if he turns his back away
Heaven help the man who kicks the man who has to crawl
Heaven help us all

[Chorus]
Heaven help us all, heaven help us all, help us all
Heaven help us, Lord, hear our call when we fall
Oh yeah, help us all

[Verse 2]
Heaven help the boy who won't reach twenty-one
Heaven help the man who gave that boy a gun
Heaven help the people with their backs against the wall
Lord, Heaven help us all
Heaven help us all, yeah, oh, hurry

[Chorus]
Heaven help us all, Lord, heaven help us all, help us all
Heaven help us, Lord, hear our call when we fall
Oh, help us all

[Verse 3]
Now I lay me down before I go to sleep
In a troubled world, I pray the Lord to keep
Keep hatred from the mighty
And the mighty from the small
Heaven help us all
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Heaven help us all, help us all
Heaven help us all
Ah, I need you, Lord, to help us all
Heaven help us all
I need you, Lord, need you now
Heaven help us all
Desperately Lord, hear me, need you now
Heaven help us all
Help me Lord

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah
Candles burning low
Lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choirs singing carols
Right outside my door

[Chorus]
All these things and more
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

And ya know what I mean
I see your smiling face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love ya madly
It seems I love you more
The little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure

[Chorus]
All these things and more, darling
(All these things and more, darling)
Whoa
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah ha ha
I feel like running wild
(Running wild)
As anxious as a little child
Greet you neath the mistletoe
Kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas baby
(wish you a Merry Christmas baby)
And such happiness in the coming year
(Happiness in the coming year)
Oh baby
Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet silent night
Fill the tree with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

[Chorus]
All these things and more, baby
(All these things and more, baby)
Whoa
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Oh baby baby

[Outro]
Yeah
Candles burning low
Lots and lots of snow
Alright
Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas choirs singing
Coo
Christmas mistletoe

[Verse 1]
We are idle strangers
Married to our dangers
Into space we go to change our ways
Flying to our heavens
We are all together
Into hell we chase the light of day

[Chorus 1]
Look around and you'll see
Ruins of the human history
Look around and you'll find
Time is only floating in your mind
You will find
Searching for time
Empty is your mind

[Verse 2]
We are charmed by living
Dazzled into giving
All the waste we plan to ignore
Coldness is the virtue
Measured for the untrue
Love is used for something but what for?

[Chorus 2]
Look around and you'll see
Ruins of the human history
Look around and you'll find
Time is only floating in your mind
You will find
Searching for time
Empty is your mind
Look around

[Verse 1]
Isolated junk yard
Letting out the garbage
Eating through the core of life
Sweet fragrance irritates
In a stale room, death awaits
Persecute your own self pride

[Verse 2]
Suffocate the new high
Ride a thorny mule that cries
Dig your grave and step right in
Like a Judas, pay the price
Thirty pieces for a ride
Here's the fire, take a chew

[Chorus]
Do yourself a favor
Educate your mind
Get yourself together
Hey, there ain't much time
Ah, do yourself a favor
Educate your mind
Ah, get yourself together
Hey, there ain't much time

[Verse 3]
Shredded know-how give away
Species of the human race
Those funky winds of ups and downs
Hall of grit is known too well
Heaven still is your hell
Poison slowly, slowly drowns

[Verse 4]
Let the devil step right in
Lucifer's your only friend
Ain't a soul gonna pity you
Hurdle over time to death
With open arms, it waits, I bet
Don't you wish you could reach ground?

[Chorus]
Do yourself a favor
Educate your mind
Get yourself together
Hey, there ain't much time
Do yourself a favor
Educate your mind
Ah, get yourself together
Hey, there ain't much
Hey, there ain't much time
There ain't much time

[Interlude 1]
Hey, don't you feel yourself goin' down?
You're goin' down
Hey, don't you feel yourself goin' down?
You're goin' down
Hey, don't you feel your brains, baby?
You're goin' down

[Chorus]
Do yourself a favor
Educate your mind, dummy
Ah, get yourself together
Hey, there ain't much time
Ah, do yourself a favor
Educate your mind
Ah, get yourself funky together
Hey, there ain't
There ain't much time

[Interlude 2]
One, two
Three, four
Five, six, seven
Eight, nine, ten
Uh, what's that letter
Comes after ten?
Ah, don't worry, don't worry
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't worry, don't worry
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve
Don't you know I don't believe
I'll ever go to hell?

[Outro]
Do yourself a favor
Do yourself a favor
Yeah, yeah, educate your mind
Do yourself a favor
Do yourself a favor, do yourself a favor
Educate your mind, dummy

The preceding has been put here on tape
To let you all know that I say it to her because I love having her around
Can you dig it? Can you get to that? Even when she's messing around
He likes having her around even when she's messing around
Which is very often, that's what she's doing
The motion of music when she's messing around

[Verse 1]
Think of me as your soldier
The man whose life is for you
And the sweet love
That's greater than time has known
Think of me as your soldier
Through worlds of hate I'm for you
Tho' the darkness hits me ever hard
I'll stand long

[Chorus]
And we'll be lovers seeing love by heaven's light
Lovers dreaming dreams each blessed by night
I will find the promised paradise
With you there I'll spend my life

[Verse 2]
In our hearts there are no others
We are bound as two lovers
To give the great eternal love

[Chorus]
And we'll be lovers seeing love by heaven's light
Lovers dreaming dreams each blessed by night
I will find the promised paradise
With you there I'll spend my life

[Outro]
Think of me, girl, as your soldier
Through worlds of pain I'm for you
To give an endless love

[x3]
To you

[Verse 1]
Mary wants to be a superwoman
But is that really in her head?
But I just want to live each day to love her
For what she is
Mary wants to be another movie star
But is that really in her mind?
And all the things she wants to be
She needs to leave behind

[Chorus]
But, very well, I believe I know you very well
Wish that you knew me, too, very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Very well, and I think I can be very well
Wish that you knew me, too, very well
And I think I can cope with everything going through your head

[Verse 2]
Mary wants to be a superwoman
And try to boss the bull around
But does she really think that she will get by with a dream?
My woman wants to be a superwoman
And I just had to say goodbye
Because I can't spend all my hours starting to cry

[Chorus]
But, very well, I believe I know you very well
Wish that you knew me, too, very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Very well, think that I know you very well
Wish you knew me like I know you, very well
But I think I can deal with everything going through your head
(Your filthy head)

[Bridge]
Very well, dum dum da, dum dum da
Very well, wish you knew me too very well
And I wish I could think of everything going through your head
Very well, dum dum da, dum da, dum da
Dum dum da, dum da, very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head

[Verse 3]
When the summer came you were not around
Now the summer's gone and love cannot be found
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my love?
When the winter came, you went further south
Parting from love's nest, leaving me in doubt
Where are you when I need you, like right now?
Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect love's past
When the winter came, you were not around
Through the bitter winds, love could not be found
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my love?
Oh, I need you, baby; I need you, baby
Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect love's past, oh
Spring will fill the air, you will come around
Is it summer love that will let me down?
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my love?
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
Where are you when I need you, like right now?
Right now, right now, right now

[Outro]
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my dear?
I need you, baby; I need you, baby; I need you, baby
I need you, baby; I need you, baby; I need you, baby
Oh, where were you when I needed you last winter, last winter
Yeah, need you, baby, need you, need you, baby
Oh, you want me to need you, baby
Oh, where were you when I needed you last, dear, yeah

[Verse 1]
Never been too much for watching
Because there's too many things to view
And when eyes begin to wander
They more than likely never get through
But beyond my own temptation
I'm enticed by what I see
And I won't feel satisfaction
Until she's where I want her to be

[Chorus]
I gotta have you, I gotta have you
I gotta have you for me
You are a sight for sore eyes to see
I got to make you my reality, okay
I gotta have you, I gotta have you
I gotta have you for me
You are a sight for sore eyes to see
Come on girl, make you my reality

[Verse 2]
Never been too much for talking
Because there's too many things to say
And by the time that I start speaking
The right moment has slipped away
But I must break this old tradition
And try to muster up the words
And though someone else may have said them
I'll say them in way you've never heard

[Chorus]
I gotta have you, I gotta have you
I gotta have you for me
You are a sight for sore eyes to see
I got to make you my reality, alright
I gotta have you, I gotta have you
I gotta have you for me, yeah
You are a sight for sore eyes to see
Come on girl, make you my reality, yes

[Bridge]
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby baby

[Verse 3]
Never been too much for touching
Because there's too many things to feel
Plus there's too much disappointment
When you find out those feelings ain't real
But here's a time when inner senses
Are gonna have to shine the light
Because I have overly committed
Myself in thinking that you're alright, that's why

[Chorus]
I gotta have you, I gotta have you
I gotta have you for me
You are a sight for sore eyes to see
I got to make you my reality, please baby
I gotta have you, I gotta have you
I gotta have you for me, yeah
You are a sight for sore eyes to see
Come on girl, make you my reality, yes

[Outro]
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be Steve's reality, baby
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby, yeah
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby
Gotta be

[Chorus]
And if you really love me won't you tell me
And if you really love me won't you tell me
And if you really love me won't you tell me
Then I won't have to be
Playing around

[Verse 1]
You call my name
Ooh so sweet
To make your kiss incomplete
When your mood is clear
You quickly change your ways
Then you say I'm untrue
What am I supposed to do
Be a fool who sits alone waiting for you

[Chorus]
And if you really love me won't you tell me
And if you really love me won't you tell me
And if you really love me won't you tell me (yeah)
Then I won't have to be
Playing around

[Verse 2]
I see the light of your smile
Calling me all the while
You are saying baby
It's time to go
First the feeling's alright
Then it's gone from sight
So I'm taking out this time to say
Ooh oh

[Chorus]
And if you really love me won't you tell me
And if you really love me won't you tell me
And if you really love me won't you tell me, baby tell me
Then I won't have to be
Playing around
Playing around (oh Yeah)
Playing around

[Outro]
Hey yeah
Goofing around no
Oh baby
Playing around no
Let me know how you feel baby (ooooh ooh)
Hey oh baby
Playing around no (oh oh)

[Verse 1]
Though they say you're not my friend
You've been here through thick and thin
And for that little girl I love you
And all I want to do is talk about you

I'm here to say
I love you more each day
And I just want to tell the world
That I love you so

[Verse 2]
Though they put me down because
I love you as much as I do
But they don't know what you've done for me
You've made such a happy man out of me

And I'm here to say
Love you every day, yeah
And I just want to tell the world
That I love you so, baby

[Chorus]
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
Oh yeah
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 3]
Though they say that I am wrong
'Cause my love is strong
But there's only one that I place above you
It's God that I place above you

Girl, I just wanna say
Love you more each day, yeah
I just want to tell the world
That I love you so, oh yeah

[Verse 4]
Some folks say that it's strange
But my whole life you have changed
You've saved all the pain the world's put on me
All I want to do is talk about you

And I'm here to say
Love you every day, yeah yeah
Telling everybody that
I love you so, oh oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
Oh yeah
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
I love every little thing about you, baby
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
I love, yeah, I love, have mercy, baby
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
Every damn thing about you, baby
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
Everything about you...

[Outro]
Ooh, mmm, sugar, all right, cookie, puddin', oh yeah
Mmm, candy, all right
And big old piece of cake

[Chorus 1]
Sweet little girl, you know your baby loves you
Your love is driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
Sweet little girl

[Chorus 2]
Sweet little girl, you know your baby Steve is true
Your love is driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
Girl, I'm in love

[Verse 1]
Hey, my sweet, sweet mamma
You know you drive your baby mad
Oh my sweet, sweet mamma
You're driving me mad

[Interlude]
Come on baby, you know your baby loves you
I've given you cookies and candy, and the woofer, and you
Still don't want to be good. Come on now honey-sugar, you know
Your baby loves you, more than I love my clavinet
So baby, do me good, do me good baby

[Chorus 1] 

[x2]

[Verse 2]
Well, you got good loving
You know you make your baby mad
Whoa, you got good loving
The best that I've ever had

[Interlude]
Come on now baby, you hear the phone ring
And sometimes you don't even answer and you know
I love you and you just treat me all kind of ways
Come on now, honey-sugar, you know your baby waiting on your love doll
You know you got my load. Can't you hear me talking to you, honey?
I try to treat you good and give you everything you want and sometimes
I see you making love with your love doll
But I still love you more than I love my clavinet
Come on now honey-sugar you know your baby love
You know just the other day I was
Gonna take you to go see a movie
Sweet Sweetback, cause I thought it might
Give you some inspiration
Cause we ain't made love in so long
Come on now sweet little sugar
Honey baby, now what if you knew I was going to put my harmonica down
Just to make love to you
Come on now honey, you know the woofer's waiting on you
Come on now baby, you know your baby loves you
Even more than he loves his clavinet
Don't make me get mad and act like a nigga

[Verse 1]
I opened my mind
Peace I could not find

[Chorus 1]
Then something out of the blue
Said I needed you

[Verse 2]
Time swept me away
Merged me into pain

[Chorus 2
Then something out of the blue
Said you need me too

[Verse 3]
Oh what joy it brings to me
To know that heaven's wrong
Oh what gladness in my heart
To know my love's been found
Chains totalled my climb
I was pushed out of time

[Chorus 2]
Then something out of the blue
Said you see me trough
Something out of the blue
Said you see me trough

[Bridge]
Now where hope was lost
Love's paid the cost

[Chorus 2]
Then something out of the blue
Said my love is you

[Chorus 1]
Something out of the blue
Said I needed you

[Outro]
Something out of the blue

[Verse 1]
When life reaches out and takes you
On an unpleasant ride
And your bridge of dreams
Comes tumbling down
Don't let your bed of sorrow
Ever conquer your pride
Remember there's always a way out

[Chorus]
Take up a course in happiness
Take up a course to clear out your mind
You will show yourself how to smile
Yeah, take up a course in happiness
Take up a free instruction in life
You will learn how to smile

[Verse 2]
And when your optimism
Has a setback or two
And you feel all your trying's in vain
(Your heart's in the rain)
Don't give up the hope that's due you
Just to study your doubt, yeah
Remember there's always a way out, hey

[Chorus]
Take up a course in happiness
Take up a course to clear out your mind
You will show yourself how to smile
Take up a course in happiness
Take up a free instruction in life
You will learn how to smile

[Outro]
Take up a course in happiness
Take up a course to clear out your mind
Show yourself how to smile
Take up a course in happiness
Take up a free instruction in life
You will learn how to smile...

[Chorus]
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life

[Verse 1]
All my life I was alone
Didn't think I'd find my part
But now I see there's joy inside your heart
Every day I searched for the star
That never was in the sky
And now I see this star is on earth

[Chorus]
And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be
(that's what you told me, yeah)
If I gave you a chance to come inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way it will always be
(that's the way it will always be)
Ever since the day you came inside my life

[Bridge]
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum, I love you
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum, I love you...

[Harmonizing]

[Chorus]
And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be
(baby, that's what you told me, yeah)
If I should ever bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said it would be
(that's what you said it would be)
If I should ever bring you inside my life

[Bridge]
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum, bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum, I love you...
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum, I love you

[Chorus]
Happier than the morning sun
That's the way you said that I would be
(baby, that's what you told me, yeah)
If I should ever bring you inside my life, yeah
Happier than the stars above
That's the way you said that it would be
(that's what you told me, yeah)
If I should ever bring you inside my life

[Outro]
I believe that everyone should be
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happy happy, happy

[Verse 1]
Hello Morning
Good, good morning to the one I love
Crystal Ringlets paint a picture of a gold sunrise above

[Chorus]
Little girl, you're sad
Though all you have is visible to you
Within your heart, there stays a part
That like the sky is blue

[Verse 2]
Shifting breezes, grace the inner spectrum of your glance
Leaves on branches, for your pleasure, perform a soothing dance

[Chorus]
Little girl, it seems
In all my dreams
Your happiness is due
But still they last
There in your past
Events that make you blue

[Bridge]
Thoughts of love are in your mind
Yet splintered hopes push them aside
A look at life is what you need to try

[Verse 3]
In an instant, there'll be sunshine
Sprinkled every place
Drops of rain will kiss the softness of your lovely face

[Chorus]
Little girl, be fair
Show yourself you care
Let others care for you
Before it's too late
'Cause time won't wait
'Til your heart's no longer blue

[Harmonica solo]

[Chorus]
Little girl, be smart
Don't break your own heart
There is love waiting for you
Before it's too late
'Cause time won't wait
'Til your heart's no longer blue

[Verse 1]
Lady love and lady cared
But lady went away
And left me all alone to suffer
And now I feel it's not fair
For me to fall in love
The truth is the real me you must uncover

[Chorus]
Seems so long, since I've heard the sound
It's been so long, since I've trusted in someone else
Had to see it all for myself
It's been so long, that the world seems cold
But I think it's time in my life to find myself again

[Verse 2]
Lady loved and lady stayed
Until she was too pleased
She knew I wouldn't leave for her to suffer
I'd never make her suffer
Now I believe you're just like me
In that you understand
You want me for your man to always love me

[Chorus]
You can believe it seems so long, since I've touched a wanting hand
Oh, it seems so long since I've trusted in someone else
Had to see this world for myself
And it's been so long, that the world seems cold
Now I think I've found someone to make trust in someone again
I believe that I can trust in you

[Intro]
Something gon' get you
Something gon' grab you
Something gon' jump out of the bushes and grab you
Whole lotta folks, you better run faster
Something gon' grab you
Something gon' jump out of the bushes and grab you
Something gon' grab you
Oh, if you need this thing to grab you, yeah yeah...

[Chorus]
Keep on running
Keep on running from my love
Keep on running, yeah
Keep on running from my love

Some folks say that you're really, really fine
All you want to be is just a friend of mine

And you'll be sad real soon, yeah

[Chorus]
Keep on running

[Intro]
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
Lord, Lordy, Lordy

[Verse 1]
Standing here on my own side
Waiting for the floor
Your world's moving fast
But still ends up a bore
Come on give me a little room now
Do you have to take it all
Yeah that's the way it is I guess
Then you're born with nothing at all

[Chorus 1]
Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh
I want to talk to you
I want to talk to you
Hey boy don't feel my world's untrue
Yeah, I wanna talk to you
My world can be true
I want to talk to you

[Verse 2]
Pick up my life at the table
Read about the way I could be
But I know I just ain't able
So I read about the real me
Who can I blame
For the way I am
I ain't never had one soul to help me
So I don't give a

[Chorus 1]
Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh
I want to talk to you
I want to talk to you
Hey boy don't feel my world's untrue
Yeah, I wanna talk to you
My world can be true
I want to talk to you

[Verse 3]
Got to woman that love me
Feed me beans every night
Twelve babies look up at me
With big grey hungry eyes
Oh but I just can't complain
You see ya, said I ain't allowed
Oh but pretty soon will come a change
When I gain the biggest mouth

[Chorus 1]
Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh
I want to talk to you
I want to talk to you
Hey boy don't feel my world's untrue
Yeah, I wanna talk to you
My world can be true
I want to talk to you

[Verse 4]
Hey don't want to talk to you
What you mean by that boy
I don't  want to talk to you
I recognize you as being a human being
I've been listening to you for 250 thousand years
I called you Steve when you were amongst my friends

[Chorus 2]
Don't  want to talk to you
I  want to talk to you
Too late
Now boy
Too late I can't wait
Now
Don't  want to talk to you

[Verse 5]
You can have dinner with me next week
And after that you can mow my lawn
Hey don't  want to talk to you now
Understand me
You can't tell me nothing white man
Try to understand yourself

[Chorus 2]
Don't  want to talk to you
I  want to talk to you
Too late
Now boy
Too late I can't wait
Now
Don't  want to talk to you

[Bridge]
You know I'm your friend

[Chorus 1]
Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh- Uh

[Outro]
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lord
Now, Now, Now, Now, Now
Now, Now, Now, Now, Now

[Verse]
Evil, why have you engulfed so many hearts? Evil
Evil, why have you destroyed so many minds?
Leaving room for darkness, where lost dreams can hide
Evil, why do you infest our purest thoughts, with hatred?
Evil, why have you stolen so much love?
Leaving everyone's emotions lost and wandering free
Evil, why have you taken over God's children's eyes? Evil
Evil, before they could really grow to see
That your way, is not the way, to make, life what it should be
Evil, why have you destroyed, you've destroyed so much of this doggone world?
Evil, hey, evil, oh, why have you broken so many homes?
Leaving sweet love all alone, an outcast of the world

[Verse 1]
A lonesome tear
A hungry face
A barren pain
A dream unchased

[Hook 1]
Oh, I can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes

[Verse 2]
A prayer is heard
By one so small
Let love be in the
Hearts of all

[Hook 1]
Oh, I can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes

[Verse 3]
You and I may never see them cry
Or wonder why the world's so cold
(You feel that they're too young
To take a look around)
But in their faces I can see the trouble all around
Today we must turn into lies
The truth already in their minds

[Hook 2]
Oh, I can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes
(We can't wait to see the day there's sunshine in our eyes)
Oh no, no
(Sunshine in our eyes)

[Verse 4]
Oh my mother's worried cause she feels the world is ending
She believes that everything is coming to an end
Papa's staying real careful, 'cause his brother Sam was robbed
Trying to buy just a loaf of bread for baby John

[Chorus 1]
(See how the world escaped)
All the streets turning bare
(Most of the news is bad)
Crime just feeds in the air

[Chorus 2]
Sad is the song
Rolling along
Everything is happening
Wit is the tune
Are we all doomed?
Everything is happening

[Verse 5]
Cost of livings up, but the pay is low down
Hate to see the babies starve cause mamma can't be found
Sister lives alone, bolts and chains the door at night
Never ever walks an alley or a shorter way

[Chorus 1]
(See how the world escaped)
All the streets turning bare
(Most of the news is bad)
Crime just feeds in the air

[Chorus 2]
Sad is the song
Rolling along
Everything is happening
Wit is the tune
Are we all doomed?
Everything is happening

[Verse 6]
Father Bills gone fighting in a place where he's a stranger
But could men die a stranger in every war
We all hide in shame, boldly pointing to another
When the blame we know for sure is right in ourselves
In ourselves, in ourselves, in ourselves, in ourselves

[Chorus 2]
Sad is the song
Rolling along
Everything is happening
Wit is the tune
Are we all doomed?
Everything is happening

[Outro]
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la
Everybody sing it now
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la
Ahh!
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la
Yah!
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la
Get it!
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la
Get it!
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la

[Verse 1]
A smiling face is an Earth-like star
A frown can't bring out the beauty that you are
Love within, and you'll begin smiling
There are brighter days ahead

Don't mess your face up with bitter tears
'Cause life is gonna be what it is
It's okay, please don't delay from smiling
There are brighter days ahead

[Chorus]
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum ditti bum
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum ditti bum

[Verse 2]
A smiling face you don't have to see
'Cause it's as joyful as a Christmas tree
Love within and you'll begin smiling
There are brighter days ahead
Love's not competing; it's on your side
You're in life's picture, so why must you cry?
So for a friend, please begin to smile, please
There are brighter days ahead, oh oh...

[Chorus]
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum ditti bum
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum ditti bum
(Please smile for me)
Bum, bum bum ditti
Bum, bum bum

[Verse 1]
They say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away
And just the pure at heart will walk her righteous streets someday
They say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away
But if there is a God, we need Him now
"where is your God?"
That's what my friends ask me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come

[Verse 2]
Tell me, people
Why can't they say that hate is 10 zillion light years away?
Why can't the light of good shine God's love in every soul?
Why must my color black make me a lesser man?
I thought this world was made for every man
He loves us all, that's what my God tells me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come

[Chorus]
But in my heart I can feel it, yeah
Feel His spirit, whoa whoa, whoa
Feel it, yeah, feel His spirit

[Verse 3]
I... can't say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away
But if so let all be pure at heart
Just to walk her righteous streets I pray
Let God's love shine within to save our evil souls
For those who don't believe will never see the light
"where is my God" - He lives inside of me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come
People, "Where is your God?" — inside, please let Him be
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come

[Chorus]
But if you open your heart you can feel it, yeah yeah
Feel His spirit whoa whoa, whoa
Feel it, yeah, you can feel His spirit
I opened my heart one morning and
I sho nuff could feel it, yeah yeah
Feel His spirit, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You can feel it, yeah, feel His spirit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You can feel it, yeah...

[Verse 1]
You make me smile
You make me sing
You make me feel good everything
You bring me up
When I've been down
This only happens when you're around

[Chorus]
And I can't go on this way
With it stronger every day
But being too shy to say
That I really love you

[Verse 2]
I want to fly
Away with you
Until there's nothing more for us to do
I want to be
More than a friend
Until the end of an endless end

[Chorus]
And I can't go on this way
With it stronger every day
But being too shy to say
That I really love you

And I can't go on this way
Feeling stronger every day
But being too shy to say
That I really love you
Ooh, ooh, I do

[Verse 1]
I can hear you sighing
Saying you'll stay beside me
Why must it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams

[Verse 2]
On the beach we're sitting
Hugging, squeezing, kissing
Why must it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams

[Bridge]
When I'm sleep at night, baby
I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night, baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy

[Verse 3]
Oh, love is so amazing
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah
Guess you will be staying
So let it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams

[Harmonica solo]

[Bridge]
When I'm sleep at night, baby
I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night, baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy

[Verse 4]
Oh, love is so amazing
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah
Guess you will be staying
So let it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams

[Verse 1]
We are amazed but not amused
By all the things you say that you'll do
Though much concerned but not involved
With decisions that are made by you

[Chorus]
But we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
"you haven't done nothin'"

[Verse 2]
It's not too cool to be ridiculed
But you brought this upon yourself
The world is tired of pacifiers
We want the truth and nothing else, yeah

[Chorus]
And we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
"you haven't done nothing"

[Refrain: Stevie Wonder & The Jackson 5]
Jackson 5, join along with me, say
Doo doo wop - hey hey hey
Doo doo wop - oh whoa whoa
Doo doo wop - mmm now now
Doo doo wop - oh oh oh
Doo doo wop - dum dum dum
Doo doo wop

[Verse 3]
We would not care to wake up to the nightmare
That's becoming real life
But when misled who knows a person's mind
Can turn as cold as ice, mmm-hmm

[Chorus]
Why do you keep on making us hear your song
Telling us how you are changing right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
"you haven't done nothin'"
Yeah

[Outro: Stevie Wonder & The Jackson 5]
Jackson 5, say it one more 'gain, say
Doo doo wop - na na na
Doo doo wop - oh
Doo doo wop - mmm co co
Doo doo wop - sing it, yeah
Doo doo wop - bum bum bum

Doo doo wop - mmm
Doo doo wop - brr eh deh deh
Doo doo wop - dum dum dum dum
Doo doo wop - eh deh deh
Doo doo wop - mmm
Doo doo wop - oh yeah

[Verse 1]
There ain't no reason for us sitting down
To try to talk our problem out
'Cause we know the truth, it ain't no use
Each other we must do without
There ain't no reason trying to force a smile
When pain is really in its place
'Cause we know the truth, it ain't no use
Let's part before we lose love's trace

[Chorus]
(we've got to say)
Whoa oh oh
(bye bye, bye bye bye)
Whoa oh oh
(bye bye, bye bye bye)
Whoa oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
As I look back I'm really trying to see
Just what it was that made us spark
'Cause the fire's out, it leaves no doubt
The flame's not burning in our hearts
We still are young and both of us have time
To find our winter love in spring
Yes, we know the truth, it ain't no use
We're not each other's everything

[Chorus]
(So we might say bye)
Whoa oh oh
(bye bye, bye bye bye)
Whoa oh oh, yeah
(bye bye, bye bye bye)
Whoa oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
(Hate we'll say goodbye)
Whoa oh oh
(bye bye, bye bye bye)
Whoa oh oh, yeah
(bye bye, bye bye bye)
Whoa oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
(while they say goodbye)
Whoa oh oh
(bye bye, bye bye bye)
Baby girl, lady, yeah yeah yeah
(bye bye, bye bye bye)
I tried out here to make it work
But it seems that they can't get it together, yeah
(bye bye bye)
Oh oh
(bye bye, bye bye bye)
Whoa oh oh oh
(bye bye, bye bye bye)
Seems we can start over and build it...
(bye bye, bye bye bye)
(bye bye, bye bye bye)
Yeah, yeah, yeah wonderful baby, baby, baby
(bye bye bye bye bye)
Don't go, take me baby, don't go baby
(bye bye bye bye bye)
Ain't no use 'cause we done run out of juice
Whoa oh oh oh oh
So long baby, bye bye baby

[Verse 1]
No more lying friends
Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They won't go when I go

[Verse 2]
All those bleeding hearts
With sorrows to impart
Were right here from the start
And they won't go when I go

[Chorus]
And I'll go where I've longed
To go so long
Away from tears

[Verse 3]
Gone from painful cries
Away from saddened eyes
Along with him I'll bide
And they won't go when I go

[Verse 4]
Big men feeling small
Weak ones standing tall
I will watch them fall
'Cause they won't go when I go

[Chorus]
And I'll go where I've longed
To go so long
Away from tears

[Verse 5]
Unclean minds mislead the pure
The innocent will leave for sure
For them there is a resting place
People sinning just for fun
They will never see the sun
For they can never show their faces
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who will take more than he will give
He will give, he will give
He ain't hardly gonna give, oh yeah

The greed of man will be
Far away from me
And my soul will be free
And they won't go when I go

[Verse 6]
Since my soul conceived
All that I believe
The kingdom I will see
'Cause they won't go when I go

[Outro]
And I'll go where I'll go
No one can keep me from
My destiny, yeah

They won't go where I go, whoa oh whoa, oh

[Verse 1]
Simon says that now your mind desires a vacation
Free to join in fun and plenty of recreation
There awaits you a ticket
At "Please Have A Good Time" Station, yeah
'Cause what is, is gonna stay
'Til ole Father Time decides to change
Simon says that your mind is requesting furlough
Let it find the answers to things
That you've always wanted to know
There's a tour of many places
That you've always wanted to go, yeah
And to me that sure sounds best
'Cause it means happiness for you

[Chorus]
There is so much in life for you to feel
Unfound in white, red, or yellow pills
A mind excursion can be such a thrill
You please satisfy
Take a chance and ride
The bird of beauty of the sky

[Refrain]
Do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do
Do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do

[Verse 2]
Tudo bem voce deve descansar a sua mente
Nao faz mal o qu vai acontecer daqui pra fente
Vai cantar alegri
Voce coracao assim tao feliz ja vai cantar carnaval

[Chorus]
There is so much in life for you to feel
Unfound in white, red, or yellow pills
A mind excursion can be such a thrill
You please satisfy
Take a chance and ride
The bird of beauty of the sky

[Outro]

Do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do
(Bird of beauty of the sky)
Do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do
(Beauty of the sky...bird of beauty of the sky)

[Verse 1]
Born to open for
Mankind nature's door
A life known by a few

And those who knew that shared
Their knowledge fewer cared
About what plants could do

For most felt it was mad to conceive
That plants thought, felt, and moved quite like we
But with instruments Bose would devise
Would take Science itself by a surprise, so

[Chorus]
On we go to where who knows
To a place where there's still non-believers
What will it take for heaven's sake
For those who find what's real too hard to believe in
It's that same old story again

[Verse 2]
Born of slaves who died
Too soon to realize
The need his life would be

Selflessy he gave
His wisdom to a way
Where first no minds would see

He said if farm land was to be rich
We must plant crops to replenish it
But it took him persuasion and tests
To convince them Carver's way was best, so

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Good morn' or evening, friends
Here's your friendly announcer
I have serious news to pass on to everybody
What I'm about to say
Could mean the world's disaster
Could change your joy and laughter to tears and pain

[Chorus]
It's that love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
Hate's goin' 'round breaking many hearts
Stop it please before it's gone too far

[Verse 2]
The force of evil plans to make you its possession
And it will if we let it destroy everybody
We all must take precautionary measures
If love and peace you treasure
Then you'll hear me when I say, woah-oh

[Chorus]
That love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
Hate's goin' 'round breaking many hearts
Stop it please before it's gone too far
People, you know that love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away, hey
You know that hate's, hate's goin' 'round breaking many hearts
Stop, stop it please before it's gone too far
It's up to you 'cause love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
You know that hate's, hate's goin' 'round
Breaking, hate's tried to break my heart many times
Don't, you've got to stop it please before, before, before
Love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
You know that hate's goin' 'round, hate's goin' 'round
Hate's goin' around and it tried breaking up many hearts
You've got to, I've got to, they've got to, we've got to, they've got to, we've got to stop it before it's gone too far
Love's, love's in need of love
Did you ever think that love would be in need of love today?
Don't delay, send yours in right away, ooh-oh, hey
Bring it down a little
Love is very peaceful, so bring it down a little
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
The world is not
L-O-V-E, love
L-O-V-E, love
Just give the world love

[Verse 1]
There are people who have let the problems of today
Lead them to conclude that for them, life is not the way
But every problem has an answer and if yours, you cannot find
You should talk it over to Him, He'll give you peace of mind

[Chorus]
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

[Verse 2]
Many of us feel we walk alone without a friend
Never communicating with the One who lives within
Forgetting all about the One who never ever lets you down
And you can talk to Him anytime, He's always around

[Chorus]
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

[Verse 3]
Well, He's the only free psychiatrist that's known throughout the world
For solving the problems of all men, women, little boys and girls

[Chorus]
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
When your load's too much to bear
Just go talk to God, He cares (I know he does)
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

[Outro]
Thank you
(Thank you very much)

[Verse 1]
Would you like to go with me
Down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me
To Village Ghetto Land?
See the people lock their doors
While robbers laugh and steal
Beggars watch and eat their meals from garbage cans

[Verse 2]
Broken glass is everywhere
It's a bloody scene
Killing plagues the citizens
Unless they own police
Children play with rusted cars
Sores cover their hands
Politicians laugh and drink, drunk to all demands

[Verse 3]
Families buying dog food now
Starvation roams the street
Babies die before they're born
Infected by the grief
Now some folks say that we should be
Glad for what we have
Tell me, would you be happy in Village Ghetto Land?

[Outro]
Village Ghetto Land

[Verse 1]
He's a man with a plan
Got a counterfeit dollar in his hand
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Playing hard, talking fast
Making sure that he won't be the last
He's Misstra Know-It-All

[Verse 2]
Makes a deal with a smile
Knowing all the time that his lie's a mile
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Must be seen, there's no doubt
He's the coolest one with the biggest mouth
He's Misstra Know-It-All

[Bridge 1]
When you tell him he's living fast
He will say, "What do you know?
If you had my kind of cash
You'd have more than one place to go"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 3]
Any place, he will play
His only concern is how much you'll pay
He's Misstra Know-It-All
If he shakes on a bet
He's the kind of dude that won't pay his debt
Oh, He's Misstra Know-It-All

[Bridge 2]
When you say that he's living wrong
He'll tell you he knows he's living right
And you'd be a stronger man
If you took Misstra Know-It-All's advice, oh oh
Ooh-ooh, mmm-mmm-mmm

[Verse 4]
He's the man with a plan
Got a counterfeit dollar in his hand
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Take my word, please beware
Of a man that just don't give a care, no
He's Misstra Know-It-All
(Look out, he's coming!)

[Outro]
Dum-bum-bum-ba-bum
Bum-bum-bum-ba-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-bum, I say
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Can his mind take the pain?
Take your hat off to the man
Who's got the plan, yeah, yeah
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Everybody tip your hat, now
To the man who's got the plan
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Give a hand to the man
Let you know he's got the plan
He's Misstra Know-It-All

Give a hand to the man
That you know darn well has got the super plan
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Give a hand to the man that
You know damn well's got the super plan
He's Misstra Know-It-All

If we had less of him
Don't you know we'd have a better land?
He's Misstra Know-It-All, hey, hey
So give a hand to the man
Although you've given out as much as you can
He's Misstra Know-It-All

Hey, you talk too much
You worry me to death, hey
He's Misstra Know-It-All
He's some kind of fella
Thinking of only himself
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Give a hand to the man
That you know has got a super plan
He's Misstra Know-It-All
(He's Misstra Know-It-All)
(He's Misstra Know-It-All)...

[Intro]
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh...

[Chorus]
Please don't go, no no no
If you go, I'll be sad and blue
So I say, no no no, don't go away, oh no

[Verse 1]
Please don't leave, baby please
If you should leave, my poor heart would grieve
So I say, nay nay nay, baby please stay

'Cause I'll break down and cry a river of tears
With just the thought of you not here in my life, oh

If you should go, I'd be sad and blue
So I say, no no no, don't go away
Yeah, baby baby baby

[Harmonica solo]

Crying, baby, hear me crying, oh no, oh no
Crying, baby, no no no no, oh no no...
I'm crying out, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm crying out, baby...

[Verse 1]
I see us in the park
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
Told only to the wind, felt even without being said
I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet

[Chorus]
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
More and more

[Verse 2]
We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers' tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind
And I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
That knocks me off my feet

[Chorus]
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
Darling, I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
Darling, I don't want to—

[Verse]
Hello flower
Boy, do you look juicy
And you know just what I’m coming to get, right
Don’t eat me
Please don’t eat me
I’m trapped in your love
Save me, don’t hurt me

[Verse 1]
Summer Soft
Wakes you up with a kiss to start the morning off
In the midst of herself playing Santa Claus
She brings gifts through her breeze
Morning Rain
Gently plays her rhythms on your windowpane
Giving you no clue of when she plans to change
To bring rain or sunshine

[Pre-Chorus]
And so you wait to see what she'll do
Is it sun or rain for you?
But it breaks your heart in two
When you find it's October

[Chorus]
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone
Taking with her summer's play

[Verse 2]
Winter Wind
Whispers to you that he wants to be your friend
But not waiting for your answer, he begins
Forcing danger's way with his breeze
Morning snow
Plans to have a winter ball for you to throw
But just where or when, he never lets you know
If it's snow or clear days you'll find

[Pre-Chorus]
And so you wait to see what he'll do
Is it sun or snow for you?
But it breaks your heart in two
'Cause you've been fooled by April

[Chorus]
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone

[Outro]
You find it's October
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone
You've been fooled by April
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone
You find it's October
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone
You've been fooled by April
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone

[Verse 1]
When by the phone
In vain you sit
You very soon in your mind realize that it's not just
An ordinary pain in your heart
When you by chance
Go knock on her door
Walkin' away, you're convinced that it's much more
Than just an ordinary pain in your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain in your heart

[Chorus]
Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart

[Verse 2]
When you catch up
But she says goodbye
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart
Tell her you're glad
It's over, in fact
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back?
Takin' that ordinary pain from your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain from your heart

[Chorus]
Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart
Your heart
In your heart
In your heart

[Verse 3: Shirley Brewer]
You're just a masochistic fool
Because you knew my love was cruel
You never listened when they said
Don't let that girl go to your head
But like a playboy, you said no (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
This little girl mind, you will blow (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But then it blew you out the box (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
When I put my stuff on key and lock (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
It makes me feel kind of sick (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
To know love put you in a trick (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
I knew our love would have to end (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
The day I made it with your friend (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Giving your love to one unreal (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Like a big fool, I know you feel (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But in this lovie-dovie game (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
With all its joy, there must be pain (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But now the time has surely come (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
This game don't seem like so much fun (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You're crying big crocodile tears (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Don't match the ones I've cried for years (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
When I was home waiting for you (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You were out somewhere doing the do (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You know I'd really like to stay (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But like you did, I've got to play (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You're dumb to think I'd let you be (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Scott-free without some pain from me (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
I heard your song and took a chance (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But to your music, I can't dance (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Go tell your story, sob-sad (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
About you blowing what you had (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Since one ain't good enough for you (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Then do yourself, see how you do (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)

[Outro]
(Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
(Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
(Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
(Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
(Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
(Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)

[Verse 1]
Pan is my name
I live outside the door
I have to keep the score of things around you
Fire and air
Water I prepare
I am the piper at the gates of dawning

[Chorus]
It's not magic it's not madness
Just the elements I style
And I guarantee faithfully I will never go
Until all is said and done
In a twinkling I'll be gone
Well excuse me I have so much more to do

[Verse 2]
Fancy I fell
A childlike tap I'll steal
Look twice my friend it's not the wind at all
You'll never see
What you refuse to be
The power in the seeing is believing

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Background]
Flower Power, Power Flower, Flower Power, Power of Love
Power Flower, Flower Power, Power Flower, Flower of Love

He's a power flower yeah, oh
Protecting all the flowers, yeah, oh
He's a flower's power, yeah
Through earth, wind, fire, showers, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
He's a power flower yeah, oh
Protecting all the flowers, yeah, oh

[Intro]
Packing my bags, going away
To a place where the air is clean
On Saturn
There's no sense to sit and watch people die
We don't fight our wars the way you do
We put back all the things we use
On Saturn
There's no sense to keep on doing such crimes

[Verse 1]
There's no principles in what you say
No direction in the things you do
For your world is soon to come to a close
Through the ages, all great men have taught
Truth and happiness just can't be bought or sold
Tell me, why are you people so cold?

[Chorus]
I'm going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars, 'cause we've learned to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high

[Verse 2]
We have come here many times before
To find your strategy to peace is war
Killing helpless men, women, and children
That don't even know what they're dying for
We can't trust you when you take a stand
With a gun and bible in your hand
And the cold expression on your face
Saying give us what we want or we'll destroy

[Chorus]
I'm going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars, 'cause we've learned to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high

[Outro]
I'ma stop on J
Don't do that (Let her go first)
Let her go first, please let her go first (Let me go first, go 'head)
Alright, let Alwatta go by herself
Okay, then we gon' take turns
Alright
Strawberry shortcake, cream on top
Tell me the name of your sweetheart
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P
Paul, oh, Paul

[Verse 1]
She's a miss beautiful supreme
A girl that others wish that they could be
If there's seven wonders of the world
Then I know she's got to be number one

[Chorus]
She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes

[Verse 2]
She's the sunflower from nature's seed
A girl that some men only find in their dreams
When she smiles, it seems the stars all know
'Cause one by one, they start to light up the sky

[Chorus]
She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes
I love ya, baby

[Interlude]
Saxophone, right here
Girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto streets
Devastating beauty
Pretty girl with ebony eyes

[Verse 3]
When she starts talking soft and sweet
Like birds of spring, her words all seem to sing
With a rhythm that is made of love
And the happiness that she only brings

[Chorus]
She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes
I love you, baby

[Interlude]
Saxophone, one more time
Girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
Devastating beauty
Pretty girl with ebony eyes

[Outro]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Pretty Black beauty
Beauty, beauty, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes
Ebony eyes
Ebony eyes
Ebony eyes
Ebony eyes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This world is moving much too fast
They're race babbling
This world is moving much too fast
The end’s unraveling

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Man's production
Life's corruption
World destruct

[Chorus]
Help me people
Save you people
God's induction
Life's construction
These instruct
Will save every living thing
Can't you see that
Life's connected
You need us to live
But we don't need you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This world is moving much to fast
They're race babbling

This world is moving much too fast
They're race babbling
This world is moving much too fast
The end’s unraveling
This world is moving much too fast

[Verse 1]
You can't concede
The nucleus of all
Begins inside
A tiny seed
And what you see
Is insignificant
It bites the pure

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Man's production
Life's corruption
World destruct

[Chorus]
Help me people
Save you people
God's induction
Life's construction
These instruct
Will save every living thing
Can't you see that
Life's connected
You need us to live
But we don't need you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This world is moving much too fast

This world is moving much too fast
They're race babbling
This world is moving much too fast
The end’s unraveling

This world is moving much too fast
They're race babbling
This world is moving much too fast
The end’s unraveling

[Chorus 1]
Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart

[Chorus 2]
Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart

[Verse 1]
I've heard so many say that the days of romance are no more
And people falling in love is so old fashioned
But waiting are they the day they once let slip away
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love’s passion

[Chorus 1]
Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart

[Chorus 2]
Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart

[Verse 2]
I know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal
And can only happen in make believe stories
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see
For around us are miracles of love’s glory

[Chorus 2]
Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart

[Verse 1]
I've always come to the conclusion that "but" is the way
Of asking for permission to lay something heavy on one's head
So I have tried to not be the one who'll fall into that line
But what I feel inside, I think you should know

[Chorus]
And baby, that's you, you, you
Made life's history
'Cause you've brought some joy inside my tears
And you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

[Verse 2]
I've always felt that tomorrow is for those who are too much afraid
To go past yesterday and start living for today
I feel that lasting moments are coming far and few between
So I should tell you of the happiness that you bring

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, it's you, you, you
Made life's history (Oh, baby)
You've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby, you have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears (Yeah)
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears
(Yeah, yeah)
You've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby, baby, you have done what no one thought could be
Hey, you brought some joy inside my tears
Got to tell you
You, you, you made life's history (Hey)
You brought some joy inside my tears (You brought some joy inside my tears)
Baby, baby, baby, you have done what no one thought could be (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You brought some joy inside my tears (Yeah, yeah, yeah, you made it, baby)
You, you, you made life's history (Made life's history)
You brought some joy inside my tears (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You have done what no one thought could be (Nobody ever thought it would be)
You brought some joy inside my tears
You, you, you made life's history (Oh, oh)
You brought some joy inside my tears
You have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears
You, you, you made life's history (Yeah)
You brought some joy inside my tears (You, you)
You brought some joy inside my tears (Baby)
You brought some joy inside my
Tears

Much has been written about
The world and all its kind of loves
But the sweetest of them all
You seldom will find stories of, oh oh oh oh

[Chorus 2]
My love lives outside my window
Clouds burst to give water
So her love can grow, oh oh
My love smiles to me each morning
Says she’ll never leave me and I know it’s so

You don’t have to look around
Or ask yourself if she is there
‘cause the fragrance of her love
Says hi with every breath of air, oh oh oh oh

[Chorus 2]
My love lives outside my window
Clouds burst to give water
So her love can grow, oh oh
My love smiles to me each morning
Says she’ll never leave me and I know it’s so

[Verse 3]
You will often hear her name
Describing another’s prettiness
But if ever there was choice
My flower would be the prettiest, oh oh oh oh

[Chorus 2]
My love lives outside my window
Clouds burst to give water
So her love can grow, oh oh
My love smiles to me each morning
Says she’ll never leave me and I know it’s so, oh oh oh
My love lives outside my window
Clouds burst to give water
So her love can grow, oh oh
My love smiles to me each morning
Says she’ll never leave me and I know it’s so

There's songs to make you smile
There's songs to make you sad
But with an happy song to sing
It never seems as bad
To me came this melody
So I've tried to put in words how I feel
Tomorrow will be for you and me

I am singing of tomorrow
I am singing of love
I am singing someday love will reign
Throughout this world of ours
I am singing of love from my heart
Let's all sing someday sweet love will reign
Throughout this world of ours
Let's start singing
Of love from our hearts
Let's start singing
Of love from our hearts

[Verse 1]
If it's magic
Then why can't it be everlasting?
Like the sun that always shines
Like the poet's endless rhyme
Like the galaxies in time

[Verse 2]
If it's pleasing
Then why can't it be never leaving?
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells

[Chorus]
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst

[Verse 3]
So if it's special
Then with it, why aren't we as careful
As making sure we dress in style?
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child

[Chorus]
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst

[Verse 4]
So if it's magic
Why can't we make it everlasting?
Like the lifetime of the sun
It will leave no heart undone
For there's enough for everyone

[Outro]
Oh
Oh

[Verse]
A flake of snow within a storm
A new way waiting to be born
In a world with need of change
A touch of love in fear of hate
A rushing wind that's asked to wait
For the promises of rain
A pearl of wisdom entrapped by poverty
She gives love with purity
Filling minds with hopeful schemes
To build worlds enhanced by peace
Draped in sparkling morning dew
She expresses life anew
From the earth beneath her feet
She is a flower that grows
In love ability
She's femininity

[Chorus]
Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why did they make you begin
When they know in time you'll find your truth
Before your cycle ends
Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why are you crying their fears
When the true reflection of you that they see
Is love besieged by years

[Verse 2]
She has touched the farthest star
Her beauty speaks of what we are
And her freedom makes us free
Her now is in eternity
Infinite to all that see
And her dreams have been achieved
Now there is a sound of laughter
Nature signs out her name
For the world to know her fame

[Chorus]
Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why did they criticize
When they knew your love could cast its spell and
Consecrate their eyes
Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why do you linger in space
When you know in every heart that beats
You hold a special place
When you know in every heart that beats
You hold a special place

[Intro]
Play as funky as you can, slim

[Verse 1]
Come on up, you say
'Cause you can feel your love comin' down
I find myself rushin' over to
Do something for your love
I knock on the door (Yeah)
You answer askin' what am I there for? (Yeah)
I say I thought you wanted me to
Do something for your love

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm an all-day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothing
I'm an all-day sucker
Coming to give something, but to get none of your love

[Chorus]
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love

[Verse 2]
You call me up to say
You're sorry for what went down the other day
And could I come over today to
Do something for your love?
One knock gets me in (Yeah)
But then you say how very nice it's been (Yeah)
That lets me know that I will once again (I)
Get nothin' from your love

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm an all-day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothing
I'm an all-day sucker
Coming to give something, but to get none of your love

[Chorus]
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love

[Verse 3]
You drop by to say
You're sorry for what went down the other day (Yeah)
And if I had some time later in the day
To do something for your love
Anyone else would say (Say)
No, that's okay
But maybe by now, she'll see things my way
And ask me to stay
To do something for her love (Sucker)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm an all-day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothing
I'm an all-day sucker
Coming to give something, but to get none of your love

[Chorus]
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love (To get none of your love)
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love (You're being stingy with your love)
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love (Baby)
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love (I'm an all-day sucker for your love)
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love (Giving none of your love)
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love (To an all-day sucker for your love)
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love (To get none of your love)
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love (Baby)
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love

[Verse 1: Stevie Wonder]
Call up, ring once, hang up the phone
To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover
If she's with me, I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you, my part-time lover

[Chorus]
We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

[Verse 2]
If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's "discreet" with part-time lovers
But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek it's really you my part-time lover

[Chorus]
We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

[Bridge: Luther Vandross, (Part-Time Lovers)]

(Part-time lovers)

[Chorus]
We are undercover passion on the run, yeah
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

[Verse 3]
I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you, my part-time lover
And then a man called our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part-time lovers
You and me, part-time lovers
But, she and he, part-time lovers

[Outro]

[Chorus]
Honey, you make me feel like you care a lot
But I-I-I-I-I, I love you too much
Baby, you make me feel like you need me a lot
But I-I-I-I-I, I love you too much

[Verse 1]
When you say those words of love to me
It makes me feel so good inside
But when the sunshine comes and you must leave
It only leaves me with my own foolish pride

[Chorus]
Baby, you make me feel like you care a lot
But I-I-I-I-I, honey, I love you too much
Baby, you make me feel like you care a lot
But I-I-I-I-I, honey, I love you too much

[Verse 2]
Oh, when you say those words of love to me
I know you know you make me feel so good inside
But if by break of day you never can stay
There must be something in our love that I don't know about that you
Feel you've got to hide

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, you make me feel like you care a lot
But I-I-I-I-I, honey, I love you too much
Baby, you make me feel like you care a lot
But I-I-I-I-I, honey, I love you too much
Hey I love you, I love you, I love, I love you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love you, I need you, I love, I love you
Feel me, feel me, feel me, feel me, love me, love me
I love you, baby, don't let nobody tell you that I don't love you, baby
Oh oh I love you
Baby, have you ever wished that forever nighttime could last
Don't leave my heart a broken glass baby, oh oh
Sometimes I feel like I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
Maybe three much
Yeah, I love you
You make me feel like you care a lot
But I-I-I-I-I, I love you too much

[Intro]
Where is the missing one, the missing one
Where is the missing one, the missing one

[Verse 1]
There is a missing person that I've just got to find
Now just how long they have been gone
I can't say at this time
I glanced outside my window surprisingly to see
The reflection of a broken man who looked somewhat like me

[Chorus]
I'm trying to find my whereabouts, what shall I do?
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I'm turning blue
But wait, I may have found a clue
My whereabouts are somewhere in yesterday with you
Where is the missing one, the missing one

[Verse 2]
I looked inside an album of happy photographs
To try to match the feeling
In the joy I used to have
I traveled through the moments that held a special place
But every time what came to mind is that smile upon your face

[Chorus]
I'm trying to find my whereabouts, what shall I do?
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I'm turning blue
But wait, I may have found a clue
My whereabouts are somewhere in yesterday with you
Where is the missing one, the missing one

I'm trying to find my whereabouts, what shall I do?
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I'm turning blue
But wait, I may have found a clue
My whereabouts are somewhere lost in yesterday with you

I am trying to find my whereabouts, what can I do?
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I'm turning blue
But wait, I may have found a clue
My whereabouts are somewhere lost in yesterday with you
Where is the missing one, the missing one
Where is the missing one, the missing one
Where is the missing one, the missing one, yeah
Where is the missing one, the missing one

[Intro]
The curtain goes up
The first act begins
The scene is two people in love
Lovely is she, lucky feels he

[Verse 1]
She smiles in his eyes
He smiles in her eyes
They both vow love never to part
One sight for all, lovers to see

[Verse 2]
A perfect love story begins
Until insecurity sets in
What happens then is, one aching heart

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't want to be
No stranger on the shore of love with tears
And a broken heart
I can tell you that I don't want to be
No stranger on the shore of love with tears
And a broken heart

[Verse 3]
A table for two
Love vows of "I do"
A honeymoon out of a dream
Who could ask for, anything more

[Verse 4]
A home on a hill
With love daffodils
And cold winter nights by the fire
What more could be, for she and he
There's more than enough love and yet
She or he starts feeling regret
What do you get, one broken heart

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't want to be
No stranger on the shore of love with tears
And a broken heart
I can tell you from experience I don't want to be
No stranger on the shore of love with tears
And a broken heart
I don't want to be
No stranger on the shore of love with tears
And a-a-a-oh, oh, oh
Oh, I don't want to be, please don't let me be
No stranger on the shore of love with tears
And a broken heart, na, na, na, na, na
I don't want to be no, don't let me be no
No, no, no with tears
I don't want to have an upset stomach from a broken heart, baby
I don't want to be
No stranger on the shore of love with tears
And a broken heart

[Verse 1]
I met her at lover's park
One rainy April Monday
Smiling soft and warm as on
A clear December Sunday
Wearing taffeta and lace
That matched her braided hair
With their coraled beads that sang to me
She said "hi" and asked me why
Was I looking with sorrow
When there were much brighter days
In store for me tomorrow
I looked up at her and smiled
And said, why I don't know
But would she agree, to stay with me
And she said

[Chorus]
Never in your sun, she said
Never in your sun, then she said
I will only come
In your pouring rain to relieve the pain

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 2]
So if you are at lover's park
And someone looks with sorrow
Ask them why are they so sad
When sunshine's theirs tomorrow
They'll reply they don't know why
And ask you please to stay
Until the end of time, and when they're fine

[Outro]
Be kind and say
Never in your sun, just tell them
Never in your sun, then say
I will only come
In your pouring rain, to relieve the pain, never, ever
Never in your sun, never in your sun, believe that
I will only come
In your pouring rain to relieve the pain

[Verse 1: Syreeta]
The strangest thought came to me on this morning
As I awoke to greet the coming dawn
The sun was hardly peaking through the garden
It felt that with everything I was one

[Chorus: Syreeta]
Then I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower
As a flower
How I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower
To spread the sweetness of love
To spread the sweetness of love

[Verse 2: Syreeta]
The dew had finished making love to many
A rainbow smelling sweet was in the air
I envied all the silence I saw growing
So unmoved by things outside of themselves

[Chorus: Syreeta]
Then how I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower
As a flower
How I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower
To spread the sweetness of love
How I wished that I could come back as a flower
Oh, as a flower
As a flower
How I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower
To spread the sweetness of love
To spread the sweetness of love

[Spoken Intro]
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen
And those of you who have taken with us this long journey to celebrate the completion of the orbit of portineau
Tonight, as a tribute to portineau we have a special song written and performed for the occasion by Stevie Wonder
A seed is a star, a star is a seed

[Verse 1]
We're a people black as is your night
Born to spread Amma's eternal light
Which since time began
Has been to bring truth to every man
Our ancestors have since long ago
Passed their wisdom down so we could know
For here lies the key
That will help unfold the mystery

[Chorus]
A seed's a star
A seed's a star's a seed
Oh, a star's a seed
A star's a seed's a star

[Verse 2]
In myself I do contain
The elements of sun and rain
First a seed with roots that swell
I gradually burst through my shell
Pushing down into the ground
The root of me is homeward bound
A trunk, a leaf, and there I am
A miracle of least by far
Tree - you are the longest living one we know
The largest of all plants and still you grow
Tree - within your branches there's such history
So much of what we're searching for to know
Every fifty years we celebrate, yeah yeah
Po Tolo, our star, as it rotates
Though infinitely small
It is still the heaviest of them all

[Chorus]
A seed's a star
A seed's a star's a seed
A star's a seed
A star's a seed's a star
A seed's a star
A seed's a star's a seed
A star's a seed
A star's a seed's a star

[Verse 1]
Lonely one of young so brokenhearted
Traveling down the rigid road of life
Using pharmaceutical extractions
To find the paradise
Finds the high but comes down feeling lower
Gets down on their knees and starts to pray
Looking up to heaven for the answer
They hear a voice that says

[Chorus]
You will know
Troubled heart you'll know
Problems have solutions
Trust and I will show
Oh, you will know
Troubled heart you'll know
Every life has reason
For I made it so

[Verse 2]
Single parent trying to raise their children
But they would much rather not alone
Reaches out to find that special someone
To make their house a home
Finds someone but no one is the right one
Gets down on their knees and starts to pray
Looking up to heaven for the answer
They hear a voice that says

[Chorus]
You will know
Troubled heart you'll know
Problems have solutions
Trust and I will show
Hey, you will know
Lonely heart you'll know
Every life has reason
For I made it so
You'll know
Troubled heart you'll know
Problems have solutions
Trust and I will show
You will know
Troubled heart you'll know
Every life has reason
For I made it so
And oh, you will know
Lonely heart you'll know
Problems have solutions
Trust and I will show, yeah
You will know (You will know)
Lonely heart you'll know
(You will know, you will know, you will know)
Every life has reason
For I made it so
You'll know
Lonely heart you'll know

[Verse 1]
I am a veteran of the war
I up and joined the army back in 1964
At sixteen I just had to be a man at any cost
I volunteered for Vietnam where I got my leg shot off

[Pre-Chorus]
I recall a quote from a movie that said "Who's more a man
Than a man with a reason that's worth dying for"

[Chorus]
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to getting ahead

[Verse 2]
They gave me a uniform and a tiny salty pill
To stop the big urge I might have for the wrong kind of thrill
They put a gun in my hand and said, "Shoot until he's dead
But it's hard to kill when 'please, I'm your friend' echoes through your head

[Pre-Chorus]
Brought up in church taught no man should take another's life
But then put in a jungle where life has no price

[Chorus]
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to getting ahead

[Bridge]
Back in the world the paper reads today
Another war is in the brewing
But what about the lives of yesterday
And the many happy families that have been ruined

[Verse 3]
My niece is a hooker and my nephew's a junkie too
But they say I have no right to tell them how they should do
They laugh and say "Quit bragging" 'bout the war you should never have been in
But my mind is so brain-washed I'd probably go back and do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
I walk the neighborhood parading my purple heart
With a fear of agent orange that no one will stop, no

[Chorus]
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to getting ahead, yeah
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
Now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to getting ahead
Could you believe I do?
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to getting ahead

[Verse 1]
I can't conceive the nucleus of all
Begins inside a tiny seed
And what we see as insignificant
Provides the purest air we breathe

[Chorus]
But who am I to doubt or question the inevitable being
For these are but a few discoveries
We find inside the Secret Life of Plants

[Verse 2]
A species smaller than the eye can see
Or larger than most living things
And yet we take from it without consent
Our shelter, food, habiliment

[Chorus]
But who am I to doubt or question the inevitable being
For these are but a few discoveries
We find inside the Secret Life of Plants

[Verse 3]
But far too many give them in return
A stomp, cut, drown, or burn
As if they're nothing
But if you ask yourself where would you be
Without them you will find you would not
And some believe antennas are their leaves
That spans beyond our galaxy
They've been, they are and probably will be
Who are the mediocrity

[Chorus]
But who am I to doubt or question the inevitable being
For these are but a few discoveries
We find inside the Secret Life of Plants

[Verse 1]
They knock on your door
You laugh in their face
They tell you it's time to pray
They give you a book
And tell you to read
And point to the Judgment Day

[Chorus]
People say they live dangerously
Walking places they should not be
But they will walk their lives
With a never-ending light
They will walk their lives
Until they shine the light
Of truth into your life

[Verse 2]
They sit on a stump
You run from their sight
To not hear the holy word
They sing and they chant
They preach and they speak
In tongues you have never heard

[Chorus]
But people say they live dangerously
Walking places they should not be
But they will walk their lives
With a never-ending light
They will walk their lives
Until they shine the light
Of truth into your life

[Bridge]
I wanna know
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers?
They just walk the light through the day, through the night
I wanna know
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers?
They just walk the light through the day, through the night

[Verse 3]
On corners of streets
And airports or tents
They reach out for you to come in
They have no defense
Except inner sense
And knowing the Almighty Friend

[Chorus]
But people say they live dangerously
Walking places they should not be
But they will walk their lives
With a never-ending light
They will walk their lives
Until they shine the light
Of truth into your life
Truth into your life

[Bridge]
I wanna know
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers?
They just walk the light through the day, through the night
I wanna know
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers?
They just walk the light through the day, through the night
I wanna know
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers?
They just walk the light through the day, through the night
I wanna know
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers?
They'll just walk the light through the day, through the night
Through the day, through the night

[Outro]
Come on and shine that light through the day through the night
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers?
They just walk the light through the day, through the night
Even though when they knock on your door
You laugh in their face
You run from their sight
Not to hear the holy word
They have no defense
Except inner sense

[Verse 1]
You were brought up in a small town
Where everyone greeted with a morning smile
I mean the place was so free from crime
You could leave your front door open
And if your eyes were drawn from a lack of food
Or your pockets were short on cash
There was always someone close at hand
That you could always run to
You could have been a doctor
And you could have been a nurse
But these things weren't good enough for you
So you decided to pack up all you own
And get a one-way ticket there
To a place where all the successful people went
In order for them to do

[Chorus]
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl
Remember only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl
Remember only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey
Land of la la
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey
The land of la la

[Verse 2]
You get off the bus, pick up a paper
And look through the classified
So that you might find a place
Suitable for you to move into
Then you turn around to pick up the duffle bag
That you brought along
But much to your surprise you find
Your bag has taken off walking
You dig in your wallet
To get your last dime
But then recall you just spent your last dime on the newspaper
You're much too prideful
But pride has no defense
When all you've got in your possession
Is the wallet in your hands

[Chorus]
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl
Remember only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl
Remember only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl
Only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey
Land of la la
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey
Living in the land of la la

[Repeated refrain]
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey, living in the land of la la

[Outro over refrain]
You might get everything you want
But not want everything you get
Being in la la land is like nowhere else
Living in the land, one hell of a land, a land full of lost angels
Movie stars and great big cars and Perrier and fun all day
And that's enough to make anybody go wild
In the land of la la
He's a big boy now, she's a strong girl
But only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la

[Verse 1]
Her parents said, "Girl, don't leave home"
But her heart kept cheering her on
She had a real good man, steady job
But the two of them just weren't in her heart

[Chorus]
She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying, "Girl you're wrong, go home"

[Verse 2]
Long days, short nights when you're on the road
For a pretty girl it's a heavy load
And even so, who'll pay your fare?
She said I'll make it on a wing and a prayer

[Chorus]
She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying, "Girl, you're wrong, go home"

[Bridge]
She said I've on right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word

[Verse 3]
As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family, my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start

[Chorus]
She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying, "Girl, you're wrong, go home"

[Bridge]
She said I've on right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word, my final word

[Verse 3 repeated]
As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family, my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start

[Chorus]
She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying, "Girl, you're wrong, go home"

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying, "Girl, you're wrong, go home"

[Outro]
Go home, baby
You never, go home right now
Go home, girl, go, you better go home
Go home, girl
Go home, girl, go, you better go home
Ooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Go home, girl, go, you better go home
Go home, baby
Go home, girl, go, you better go home
Go home, baby
Go home, girl, go, you better go home
Pack up your things and go on home
Pack up your things and go on home
Go home, girl, go, you better go home
Go home, girl, go, you better go home
Go home, girl, go, you better go home

[Verse 1]
Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away
Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

[Chorus]
And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

[Verse 2]
Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I've sought can never be mine

[Chorus]
And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

[Outro]
And though the odds say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over you
Over you

[Verse 1]
The wretchedness of Satan's wrath
Will come to seize you at last
Because even he frowns upon the deeds you are doing
And you know deep in your heart
You've no covenant with God
Because he would never countenance people abusing

[Chorus]
You know apartheid's wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)
Like slavery was wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)
Like the holocaust was wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)
Apartheid is wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong
It's wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)
Wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)

[Verse 2]
The pain you cause in God's name
Points only to yourself to blame
For the negative karma you will be receiving
Because when people are oppressed
With atrocities that test
The future of all mankind we, the world won't stand seeing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The rules I need not recite
For you know what's wrong and what's right
So strike down your barbaric rules and cruel restrictions
The clock of now says it's time
For you to make up your mind
Before it's too late for you to earn your redemption

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Ubuqaba Babo Bucacile
Woqamba Kuze Kucace
Ngoba Nosathane Uyabugxeka
Lobuqaba
Oh, freedom is coming
(Inkululeko Iyeza)

Hold on tight, yeah
(Qinisani Inkululeko Iyeza)
Freedom is coming
(Inkululeko Iyeza)
Hold on tight

[Verse 1]
There is a place
On earth's motherland
Where a people
Die in bantu stands
Boy child at eight
Will face guns of hate
Woman child's fate
Is life second rate?

[Chorus]
Just because they're dark and lovely
Just because they're dark and lovely

[Verse 2]
They do a dance
Called Mbaqana jive
Rainbow people
Dancin' to stay alive
After hours
Party hand in hand
After Shebeen
Terror strikes again

[Chorus]
Just because they're dark and lovely
Just because they're dark and lovely
Dark and lovely
Dark and lovely
Dark and lovely

[Verse 3]
The whole planet's watchin'
And the Sun God is watchin', too
Hey there Botha
Yes, we are watchin' you
Spirits can do
Jah will stop this reign
Watch our world turn
To help those in pain

[Chorus]
Just because they're dark and lovely
Just because they're dark and lovely
Just because they're dark and lovely
Just because they're dark and lovely

[Outro]
Dark and lovely
Dark and lovely
Dark and lovely, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Dark and lovely
Dark and lovely, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Dark and lovely, yeah yeah
Dark and lovely, dark and lovely people
Dark and lovely

[Verse 1]
That girl thinks that she's so fine
That soon she'll have my mind
That girl thinks that she's so smart
That soon she'll have my heart
She thinks in no time flat
That she'll be free and clear to start
With her emotional rescue of love that you'll leave torn apart
That girl thinks that she's so bad
She'll change my tears to joy from sad
She says she keeps the upper hand
Cause she can please her man
She doesn't use her love to make him weak
She uses love to keep him strong
And inside me there's no room for doubt
That it won't be too long

[Chorus]
Before I tell her that I love her
That I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her love

[Verse 2]
I've been hurting for a long time
And you've been playing for a long time
You know it's true
I've been holding for a long time
And you've been running for a long time
It's time to do what we have to do
That girl, That girl
That girl knows every single man
Would ask her for her hand
But she says her love is much too deep
For them to understand
She says her love has been crying out
But her lover hasn't heard
But what she doesn't realize is that I've listened to every word

[Chorus]

[x4]

[Outro]
That girl, that girl, that girl
Oh, That girl, that girl, that girl, that girl

[Chorus]
This is fun day
Yours and my day
This is fun day, dee ooh, wee ooh

[Verse 1]
This is fun day
On a fine day
When the air is filled with tweeting birds that sing
Together in the sun
This is your day
Yours and my day
When you feel the joy of children playing
Laughing from dusk 'til dawn
On a day like this you share your joy with everyone
You share your peace, and share your joy
And share your love

This is fun day (Fun day)
On a fine day (Fine day)
When you feel the urge of getting up to start-up
With the break of dawn
This is your day (Your day)
Yours and my day (My day)
When you turn on your radio and hear the DJ
Playing your favorite song
On a day like this not even bad can rub you wrong
Because you say it's okay 'cause it's your day

[Chorus 2]
I'm going to go out to the park (Out to the park)
Where you feel the joy in every heart
(Joy in every heart)
That's what I need to start each day off right
Oh, I'll find a place for you and me (For you and me)
Underneath the shade of a lover's tree (A lover's tree)
Fun day should be each day in all our lives, oh oh

[Chorus 1]
This is fun day
Yours and my day
This is fun day, dee ooh, wee ooh

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 2]
This is love day
A celebration
A day on every calendar that's set aside
For everyone to give
This is your day (Your day)
Such a fun day (Fun day)
I cannot believe a day like this has come
That's if this really is
I'm so very proud to say that for this day I've lived
To see your peace, to see your joy, and to see your love

[Chorus 2]
I'm going to go out to the park (Out to the park)
Where you feel the joy in every heart (Joy in every heart)
That's what I need to start each day off right
Oh, I'll find a place for you and me (For you and me)
Underneath the shade of a lover's tree (A lover's tree)
Fun day should be each day in all our lives, hey hey

[Outro]
This is love day
A celebration
A day on every calendar that's set aside for everyone to give...
Let me solo, let me solo, let me solo (Solo)

[Intro]
Na na na na na na na na na

[Verse 1]
Excuse me please your majesty
I chance this moment nervously
To share with you a fantasy
That I have lived inside of me

And it is so pretty
And it is so fine
It's the kind you'd love to last you
Until the end of time

We've talked of love, we've talked of life
And what would make the world so nice
We've walked the sand by lover's sea
I've held your body close to me

And it is so pretty (Pretty)
How I'd love to know
For if I had a chance to hold you
I'd never let you go

[Chorus]
You're my queen in the black
With your time-stopping body
Queen in the black
With your eyes that hypnotize, girl
Queen in the black
With your voice that's sweet as candy
Queen in the black
Miss Ebony, you really turn me on, yeah

[Interlude]
Na na na na na na na na na, oh wow

[Verse 2]
There's not a day that passes by
That I don't have you on my mind
If this ain't love I have inside
Then my heart's telling me a lie

Because it feels so special (Special)
And it feels so right
And if I could I know I'd love you
For the rest of my life

[Chorus]
You're my queen in the black
With your time-stopping body
Queen in the black
With your eyes that hypnotize, girl
Queen in the black
With your voice that's sweet as candy
Queen in the black
With your soft and sexy lips, babe
Queen in the black
I love the way you move your body
Queen in the black
You know you are nothing less than royalty
Queen in the black
Oh, I'll place you on a throne, girl
Queen in the black
Miss Ebony, you really turn me on
Queen in the black
With your time-stopping body
Queen in the black
With your eyes that hypnotize, girl
Queen in the black
With your voice that's sweet as candy
Queen in the black
With your valentine smile, girl
Queen in the black
With your soft and sexy lips, babe
Queen in the black
Love the way you move your body
Queen in the black
You know you're nothing less than royalty
Queen in the black
You know I'll place you on a throne, girl
Queen in the black
Miss Ebony, you really turn me on
Queen in the black
Miss Ebony, you really turn me on
Queen in the black
Miss Ebony, you really turn me on
Queen in the black
With your valentine smile, girl
Queen in the black
With your soft and sexy lips, babe
Queen in the black
Love the way you move your body
Queen in the black
You know you're nothing less than royalty
Queen in the black
You know I'll place you on a throne, girl
Queen in the black
Miss Ebony, you really turn me on
Queen in the black
Miss Ebony, you really turn me on

[Outro]
Queen in the black
Queen in the black, Queen in the black
Queen in the black
Queen in the black, Queen in the black, Queen in the black now
Queen in the black
You know what I'm talking about, yeah, yeah
Queen in the black
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Queen in the black
With your time-stopping body
Queen in the black
With your eyes that hypnotize, girl
Queen in the black
Yeah

[Verse 1]
When was the last time
That they heard you say
Mother or father, I love you
And when was the last time
That they heard you say
Daughter or son, I love you

Ones you say you cherish every day
Can instantly be taken away
Then you'd say I know this can't be true
When you never took the time
To simply tell them "I love you"

[Verse 2]
When was the last time
That they heard you say
Sister or brother, I love you
And when was the last time
That they heard you say
Darling or best friend, I love you
The one for whom you'd give your very life
Could be taken in the twinkling of an eye
Through your tears you'd ask why did you go
Knowing you didn't always show
Just how much you loved them so

[Chorus]
These three words
Sweet and simple
These three words
Short and kind
These three words
Always kindles
An aching heart to smile inside

[Bridge]
I know a family
Who hasn't a cent to their name
And yet the joy and love they have between them
They always claim
And when one's called from life
The survived mourn the lost
And will never be the same
Yet they rejoice
In knowing they gave them their all

[Chorus]
These three words
Sweet and simple
These three words
Short and kind
These three words, these three words
Always kindles
An aching heart to smile inside
These three words
Sweet and simple, oh sweet simple
These three words
These three words, these three words, these three words
Short and kind
Short and kind
These three words
Always kindles
An aching heart to smile inside

These three words
These three words

[Verse 1]
I hear tell there's big fun tonight
On the corner of Main and Dog-Meat-Bite
Friday midnights would not be right
Without Redd's hot party and a nasty fight

[Chorus]
But I'll be in your corner
I'll be in your corner, if they do
I'll be in your corner
I'll be in your corner, if they do

[Verse 2]
You can't renege because it's going to be alive
Fine women, lots of liquor and stuff for your mind
Now where we're going they don't like your kind
But they'll cool out when you tell them you're a friend of mine

[Chorus]
Because I'll be in your corner
I'll be in your corner, if they do
I'll be in your corner
I'll be in your corner, if they do
{Verse 3]
You can't tell your pa and mama
Where we're going going till after we've been there
'Cause that might make their poor heads worry
And worrying can cause grey hair
And one thing might lead to another
And if there'e any trouble they'll blame it on me
I think we just might have two to go
The pretty looking over here from the middle of the floor
We'll make a b-line to Hotel La Sin
Where you'll do the talking to get us in

[Chorus]
And I'll be in your corner
I'll be in your corner, if they do

[Verse 4]
We shoulda been long gone 'cause this place is hot
'Cause in the corner there are two brothers that are undercover cops
If they stop us for questionning mum is the word
'Cause a question not answered is an answer not heard

[Chorus]
And I'll be in your corner
I'll be in your corner, if they do
I'll be in your corner
I'll be in your corner, if they do

[Verse 5]
You can't tell your pa and mama
Where we're going going till after we've been there
'Cause that might make their poor heads worry
And worrying can cause grey hair
And one thing might lead to another
And if there's any trouble they'll blame it on me

[Verse 1]
We are supposed to be sisters and brothers
But all we do is constantly dog one another
We are supposed to act as each other's cover
But we keep at each other's throat
Each other's throat
Each other's throat
Yo, it is no joke
We're at each other's throat - Aowl, Aowl

[Verse 2]
We are supposed to spread love and not evil
But we've been acting more like heathens than people
Treating our fellow-man far worse than illegal
Because we keep at each other's throat
Each other's throat
Each other's throat
Yo, it is no joke
We're at each other's throat - Aowl, Aowl

[Verse 3]
Ut oh, 11 o'clock pm and here's the news
Another fatality caused by a family feud
Charged, tried, sentenced by the jury of a brother's gun
Made sister's fiancee's wedding never to be sung
He didn't like the way he treated the girl
So the boy played God, pow, he ended his world

[Verse 4]
He made a plea for temporary insanity
But left his sister insane permanently
This isn't new, this stuff happens everyday
Somebody doesn't like someone so they blow them away
Too fast for reason, too quick to negotiate

[Verse 5]
Regret and sorrow happens a split second too late
Jealousy for power, greed for possession
Selfishness so you give someone a faked out impression
Speaking of which I'm truly not impressed
So if seeing is believing- I don't want to see the mess

[Verse 6]
Heartless are we on the straight with no chaser
As if for negativity we got the vapors
Know as I love me so I do love my neighbor
Because we are too busy at each other's throat

[Outro]
Each other's throat
Each other's throat
Yo, it is no joke
We're at each other's throat -Aowl, Aowl

[Repeat]

[Chorus 1: Kimberly Brewer & Stevie Wonder]
My love is gone with yesterday
My love is gone with yesterday
My love is gone with yesterday
My love is gone with yesterday

[Verse 1: Kimberly Brewer]
We had a love for all seasons
At least that's how it used to be
There was no time, space, or reason
More special to us than we
My love continued to flourish
As a flower blooms in spring
Then you tried to play love for silly
But the loser is the fool who doesn't play
Love by the rules

[Chorus 2: Kimberly Brewer]
If she breaks your heart
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you
Because I may not be around to do the things
I used to do
And if you awake to find you're lost
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way
Because the love I felt inside
Has gone away with yesterday

[Chorus 1: Kimberly Brewer & Stevie Wonder]
My love is gone with yesterday
My love is gone with yesterday
My love is gone with yesterday
My love is gone with yesterday

[Verse 2: Kimberly Brewer]
There was a time when forever
Was commonplace for me and you
Laughing, loving, sharing, caring
Seemed to be made just for us two
Oh, but I kept on building the dream world
That I thought was you and I
Sorry, I'm sadly mistaken
Because our castle in the sky
Has turned into a mere goodbye

[Chorus 2: Kimberly Brewer]
Well, if she breaks your heart
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you
Because I may not be around to do the things
I used to do
And if you awake to find you're lost
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way
Because the love I felt inside
Has gone away with yesterday
Oh, if she breaks your heart
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you
Because I may not be around to do the things
I used to do
And if you awake to find you're lost
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way
Because the love I felt inside
Has gone away with yesterday

[Chorus 1: Kimberly Brewer & Stevie Wonder]
My love is gone with yesterday
My love is gone with yesterday
My love is gone with yesterday
My love is gone with yesterday
My love is gone with yesterday
My love is gone with yesterday
My love is gone with yesterday
My love is gone with yesterday
My love is gone with yesterday
My love is gone with yesterday

[Verse 1]
Honey, sweet
I've got something to say to you in privacy
Something I'd like for you to hear
And only your ears alone
Secretly, I've been admiring you intensely
So much so I'd like to settle down with you
And make a home

[Chorus]
You are my first breath
My first smile
And my morning cup of tea
Yours is the love
That I pray for
Before I go to sleep
From the time I saw your face
I knew no other could erase
My loving you with each beat of my heart
Until the day I heard you speak
I didn't know that sound was sweet
Me hearing you in each beat of my heart
There's a time when playing ends
And the serious begins
Like the love that I felt from the start
With each beat of my heart

[Verse 2]
Honey, sweet
I soared into a heaven's galaxy
So hypnotized was I
From seeing all the magic in your eyes
So I bring
To you what's been a lifetime fantasy
Of being with the only one who can
Create my paradise

[Chorus]
You are my first breath
My first smile
And my morning cup of tea
Yours is the love
That I pray for
Before I go to sleep
From the time I saw your face
I knew no other could erase
My loving you with each beat of my heart
Until the day I heard you speak
I didn't know that sound was sweet
Me hearing you in each beat of my heart
There's a time when playing ends
And the serious begins
Like the love that I felt from the start
With each beat of my heart
There's a time when playing ends
And the serious begins
Like the love that I felt from the start
With each beat of my heart

[Verse 1]
There we were two lonely souls
Existing from day to day
Feeling love would never
Come our way
Watching lover share their bliss
Sadly wishing only if
Believing that we had to live
Life like this
But Like a bolt of lightning
As when two stormy clouds collide
We made a joyful happening
To our lives
Now we're as happy as can be
Me loving you and you loving me
Two hearts intertwined
Which makes us one of a kind
Feeling the charge of a love evermore
Knowing that love is enough to live for
It feels so fine
Sharing love one of a kind

[Chorus]
One of a kind now baby
Your love and mine, such ecstasy
One of kind sweet darling
The only way love is meant to be

[Verse 2]
United love so fine
Living in love one of a kind
It feels nothing but fine
Sharing our love one of kind
If we had a second chance
At living a second time
We'd change everything but our love
In our lives
Because like a big disaster
Lost in a never-ending night
We light a light of magic
Now we're as happy as can be
Me loving you and you loving me
Two hearts intertwined
Which makes us one of a kind
Feeling the charge of a love evermore
Knowing that love is enough to live for
It feels so fine
Sharing love one of a kind

[Chorus]
One of a kind, now baby
Your love and mind, such ecstasy
One of a kind, sweet darling
The only way love is meant to be

[Repeat]

[Verse 1]
Well the night is young
And the stars are out
And your eyes are all aglow
And you say you feel
Ways you've never felt
But are you sure, make sure you're sure

[Verse 2]
Well, the wine is sweet
And the music sways
And your lips are so divine
And you say you know
That you're falling in love
Now, let's be mature, make sure you're sure

[Verse 3]
I'm not accustomed to wearing my feelings
In a place that's so obvious to see
But if eyes don't lie
There's a chance that you are not fooling yourself
And me

[Verse 4]
Well the night is through
And the sun's come out
And so too has your lovely smile
And you vow to stay
In these arms always
Can you endure, now are you sure?

[Outro]
Love can be so insecure
So please be sure

[Verse 1]
I took a worthless trip
Down life's avenue
Just to try to find a way to smile again
While I was on my way
I met a wise man who said
That happiness you only find within
I learned my lesson then

[Chorus]
So I go sailing
Through the rivers of my mind
I go sailing
Be surprised what you can find
I go sailing
Through the rivers of my mind
Take a chance on your mind
Be surprised what you'll find

[Verse 2]
I took a friend's advice
Who said go up and away
Take the magic of a mystery tour
But I felt so all alone
Though I could almost touch the stars
I started missing things I touched before
The tour was such a bore

[Chorus]
So I go sailing
Through the rivers of my mind
I go sailing
Be surprised what you can find
I go sailing
Through the rivers of my mind
Take a chance on your mind
Be surprised what you'll find
I go sailing
Through the rivers of my mind
I go sailing
Be surprised what you can find
I go sailing
Through the rivers of my mind
Take a chance on your mind
Be surprised what you'll find
I go sailing
Through the rivers of my mind
Spend some time going sailing
Be surprised what you can find
Be surprised what you find and go sailing
Through the rivers of my mind
Take a chance on your mind
Be surprised what you'll find
Go sailing
Through the rivers of my mind
I go sailing
Be surprised what you can find
Go sailing
Through the rivers of my mind
Take a chance on your mind
Be surprised what you'll find
Sailing
Through the rivers of my mind
Yeah

[Verse 1]
People going 'round
Telling others they're square
Around and round in circles
Is a ride that goes somewhere
All you need to fly
Is a heart dying to try
A chemical love
It's a chemical love
Ain't nothing to it
Getting cash when you are broke
Doing lots of time
Is worth a little snort of coke
Infected needles can aid you in no time
Through chemical love
You've got a chemical love

[Chorus]
Some people crave for physical love
Some people crave material love
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love
You've got a chemical jones
You've got a chemical love
Yeah, a chemical love
You've got chemical love

[Verse 2]
Some people find themselves hooked on the weirdest things
That have nothing to do with living
God's gift to us is our life what's ours to him
If it's not our love, then nothing's given, given

[Chorus]
Some people crave for physical love
Some people crave material love
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love
You've got a chemical jones
A chemical love

[Verse 3]
Yes it's true the best things in life are free
Not material, Chemical or physically
Try it for yourself, you'll get a guaranteed high
From spiritual love, natural miracle drug

[Chorus]
Some people crave for physical love
Some people crave material love
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love
You've got a chemical jones
You've got a chemical love
You've got a chemical love
A chemical love
Some people crave for physical love
Some people crave material love
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love
You need a spiritual jones
For that spiritual love

[Outro]
I'm talking to you
We all could do with a spiritual jones
For some spiritual love

[Intro]
Lighting up the candles, lighting up our love
Lighting up the candles, lighting up our love

[Verse 1]
Lighting up the candles
To what used to be
Tender memories in moments of love
Happy times and bad times
All seem wonderful
When you have a toast to moments of love

[Pre-Chorus]
I really think we could have made it
To that forever and a day
But destiny and fate decided
They would get in our way

[Chorus]
So we're lighting up the candles
Wishing you the best
Like the happiness in moments of love
For lighting up the candles
Spark the memories
Helping us to see more moments of love

[Pre-Chorus]
I really think we could have made it
To that forever and a day
But destiny and fate decided
They would get in our way

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 2]
For lighting up the candles
Spark the memories
Helping us to see the need for what was
Helping us to see more moments of love

[Outro]
See, we're lighting up the candles, lighting up our love
Lighting up the candles, lighting up our love
Lighting up the candles, lighting up our love

[Verse]
Early in the morning
About the break of day
The earlybird is working
So his life don't fade away
Spends his days denying that
He's got no time for flying
In the breeze
High up on his own, the eagle flies alone
And he is free
Earlybird is scratching though
The going's getting tough
Time is passing by him and he just
Can't get enough
He'll tell you all is going well
Though knows that something's wrong
The earlybird will wake one day
And find his life is gone
You know I like to lay in bed
And sleep out in the sun
Reading books and playing crazy music
Just for fun
You know it makes feel so fine
And sets my mind at ease to
Know that I don't harm a soul
In doing what I please

[Outro]
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away

[Intro]
Such a lovely world was made for you and me
Wondrous life for us to taste, touch, smell, hear, and see
But one glance from outside looking at our world state
Clearly displays we don't appreciate it at all

[Bridge]
Rain your love down won't you rain down your love
Let it drench us like the sun from above

[Verse 1]
Such ability inside you and me
Made to do anything and be all we can be
But one bird's eye view at us does show, oh it shows
That against God's Plan we've let it go, oh no

[Chorus]
Rain your love down won't you rain down your love
Let it drench us like the sun from above
Rain your love down let it rain down today
So that it may wash all our sins away

[Bridge]
You'd think the signs would make a difference
Oh, make a difference

[Verse 2]
You'd think fire next time instead of rain
Would cause us to make a change
The world has gone insane

[Chorus]
Rain your love down won't you rain down your love
Let it drench us like the sun from above
Rain your love down let it rain down today
So that it may wash all our sins away, let it rain

[Chorus]
Rain your love down let it pour on us, please
Cleansing us from hunger, hate, war, and greed
Rain your love down, won't you let it start over again
So we can live up to your Master Plan

[Chorus]
Rain your love down, oh won't you let it start
Wash the wicked minds and the
I know they're sick, you know they're sick at heart, yeah
Rain your love down won't you let it rain
Rid this world of drugs, disease, crime, and pain

[Verse 3]
Clear our spirits give our minds new software
With your lesson on honor, respect, trust, and care
Rain your love down I beg for human sake
For only you can get us out of this state

[Outro]
Rain your love down on all mankind
Cause we are out of order and so out of line

[Verse 1]
Am I seeing what I think I see
Or are my eyes playing tricks on me?
'Cause what I see don't make no sense
Looking so good standing over that vent
Earth Venus in broad daylight
The Goddess of Love is in my sight
I gotta catch a hold of myself
'Cause if I don't I'll have nothing left

[Pre-Chorus]
Imagine you're sitting at ring side
And I'm standing on the inside
And approaching is Miss Matador
I'm on the charge for

[Chorus]
The woman in red
The woman in red
Like fine wine she's going straight to my head
The woman in red (The woman in red)
The woman in red (See the woman in red)
I'll settle for nothing less than her instead

[Verse 2]
M-M-Miss, please pardon me
Now listen to me, I can hardly speak
I haven't been this much confused
Since Daddy caught me trying on his shoes
Now, I'm too old to be acting like this
But there's something about her I just can't resist
My heart is beating like a big bass drum
And my mind is saying that girl's the one

[Pre-Chorus]
Imagine you're sitting at ring side
And I'm standing on the inside
And approaching is Miss Matador
I'm on the charge for

[Chorus]
The woman in red (The woman in red)
The woman in red (See the woman in red)
Like fine wine she's going straight to my head
The woman in red (The woman in red)
The woman in red (See the woman in red)
I'll settle for nothing less than her instead
The woman in red (The woman in red)
The woman in red (See the woman in red)
Like fine wine she's going straight to my head
The woman in red (The woman in red)
The woman in red (See the woman in red)
I'll settle for nothing less than her instead

[Bridge]
Pretty little woman in red (Pretty lady)
Pretty little woman in red (Ooh)
Pretty little wo-
Pretty little wo-
Pretty little
Pretty little woman in red (Taking me out)
Pretty little woman in red (Pretty lady)
(The woman in red, see the woman in red)
Pretty little woman in red
Pretty little wo-
Pretty little wo-
(The woman in red, see the woman in red)
Pretty little
Pretty little woman in red

[Chorus]
The woman in red (The woman in red)
The woman in red (See the woman in red)
Like fine wine she's going straight to my head
The woman in red (The woman in red)
The woman in red (See the woman in red)
I'll settle for nothing less than her instead
The woman in red (The woman in red)

I'll settle for nothing, I'll settle for nothing
I'll settle for nothing less than her instead

The woman in red (See the woman in red)
Like fine wine she's going straight to my head
The woman in red (The woman in red)
The woman in red (See the woman in red)
I'll settle for nothing less than her instead

[Verse 1: Stevie Wonder]
Miss Lady Girl
Is putting her love on the shelf
Cause she don't want
To be hurt by nobody else
She's taken her heart
And put it away under lock and key
But it's high time
Miss Lady Girl sets her heart free and gives her love to me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
But some think that diamond rings, fancy cars
Will make a big impression, yeah, ha! Dah
But I know that all she needs is my tender
Love and affection
Cause she still says

[Chorus]
That no one's gonna get it (Dah)
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I feel that I will be the one who will (Hee-hee! Hee-hee! Aaow!)
No one's gonna get it (Dah) (Da-da-da) (Ooh!)
No one's gonna get it, oh no (Da-da-da)
But someone's gotta get it (Da-da-da)
And I know that I will be the one who will (Hee-hee! Hee-hee! Aaow!)
Gonna get it, her love
Gonna get it, her kisses
Gonna get it, her heart
Gonna get it, get it

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
Miss Lady Girl, ha! Dah
Has buried her feelings deep inside
Cause she don't want, ah, dah
To be taken for another ride
She's sick and tired, ha!
Of being on that lonely merry-go-round
She just don't know, dah
That the ultimate love
Of her life is about to be found, hoo!

[Pre-Chorus: Stevie Wonder]
They think that ready cash, flashy clothes
Will fill her life with laughter
But I've got the very thing that she needs
True love forever after
Then no more will she say

[Chorus]
That no one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I feel that I will be the one who will
No one's gonna got it
No one's gonna get It, oh no
But someone's gonna get it
And I know that I will be the one who will
I'm gonna get it (I'm gonna get it)
I'm gonna get it (You ain't gonna get it)
(I'm gonna get it)
(You ain't gonna get it)
(I'm gonna get it)
(I'm gonna get it)
Gonna get it, gonna get it
Gonna get it, get it, aaow!
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
Gonna get it, gonna get it
Gonna get it, gonna get it
Hoo! Hoo!
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
You ain't gonna get it
You know, dah, ah, hoo!
Aaow!
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
I'm gone gonna get it

[Verse]
True love
Why'd you take so long
Every time i thought i found you
I was oh so wrong
True love
Were you playing with my heart
Or me not trying to feel that
They weren't it from the start
I'd say yes i found you
And think maybe so
I'd say here's my love true
And feel are you sure
But love is that feeling
Sharing no room with doubt
For i knew you were the key to my heart
Oh sweet love
Never go away
Let our love have us forever
To prove why we can't stay
Oh true love
Are you saying touché
Let is live as perfect lovers
With a promise for always

[Outro]
Let us live as perfect lovers
With a promise for always

[Verse 1]
Wolf tickets are all you say I'm selling
Well that goes to show what you need to know
Because I ain't yacking nothing I ain't packing
My love can get with your love toe to toe

[Chorus 1]
So when you're ready
Really, truly ready
Holding strong and steady
I'll be good to go
Cause if you start it
I am going to finish it
I am going to knock it
Like it ain't been knocked before

[Chorus 2]
Getting with this
Know you're going to be
Stepping off the edge of eternity
Just one kiss
Know it's you and me
Stepping off to the edge of eternity

[Verse 2]
Dead air time is all you say you're hearing
Well that shows how much you don't comprehend
Cause it's not in the loud but in the quiet
Where lies the thing that will make your head spin

[Chorus 1]
So when you're willing
Really, truly willing
Not just simply willing
You just let me know
Cause when you get it
I ain't going to quit it
Girl, I'm going to hit it
Like it ain't been hit before

[Chorus 2]
Getting with this
Know you're going to be
Stepping off to the edge of eternity
Just one kiss
Know it's you and me
Stepping off to the edge of eternity

[Verse 3]
Pie in the sky is all you say I can deliver
Well wait til you feel what I've got in store
One hundred and eighty pounds of good and plenty
And when you've got the need I've got some more

[Chorus 1]
So when you mean it
Really, truly mean it
Not just scheming to get to it
We can get it on
Cause if you woo it
I'm going to get to it
Girl, we're going to do it
Until every ounce is gone

[Chorus 2]
Getting with this
Know you're going to be
Stepping off to the edge of eternity
Just one kiss
Know it's you and me
Stepping off to the edge of eternity

[Outro]
Are you ready to step off the edge into eternity
Really, really ready to step off the edge into eternity
Because if you're ready to step off the edge into eternity
We can step right off the edge into eternity

[x2]

[Verse 1]
You are so unpredictable
When I am not
You are so irresistible
That I can't stop
You say my name
And start walking on heaven

[Chorus]
What flying saucer did you come here on?
What extraterrestrial planet are you from?
You're much more than life
You are from galaxy paradise
What flying saucer did you come here on?
What will they say when they find that you're gone?
Say you'll stay in my life
Queen from galaxy paradise

[Verse 2]
You are so unforgettable
When I will not
Our love is far more than sensual
And twice as hot
You touch my hand
And I know that we'll love forever

[Chorus]
What flying saucer did you come here on?
What extraterrestrial planet are you from?
You're much more than life
You are from galaxy paradise
What flying saucer did you come here on?
What will they say when they find that you're gone?
Say you'll stay in my life
Queen from galaxy paradise

[Verse 1]
I look inside my crystal ball of desire
And know why rapid beats my heart
I see the spark, I feel the flame of the fire
Letting me know love wants to start
No more playing around
No more waiting around for the special one to come
No more wearing a frown
No more tears coming down 'cause I know what I want
And I want what I know

[Chorus]
It's you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you, it's you, you're that angel sent from Heaven above
It's you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you, you're that angel sent from Heaven above, for me
(For you and you, for me)
If only I had not waited, I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited, my life would be undone
If only I had not waited, I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited for you

[Verse 2]
I looked behind and what I sight is the mire
So very lonely was my heart
I look ahead, I hear the sound of the choir
Singing that love will never part
No more hearing the sound of the rain coming down
No more I can't see the sun
No more hurting for fun 'cause the moment has come
When I know what I want
And I want what I know

[Chorus]
It's you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you
You're that angel sent from Heaven above
It's you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you, it's you, you're that angel sent from Heaven above, for me
(For you and you, for me)
If only I had not waited, I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited, my life would be undone
If only I had not waited, I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited for you
Oh baby
It's you (Oh)
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you (You)
You're that angel sent from Heaven above
It's you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you, it's you, it's you and you're that angel sent from Heaven above, for me
(For you and you, for me)
If only I had not waited, I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited, my life would be undone
If only I had not waited, I would have picked the wrong one (Wrong one)
If only I had not waited for you
'Cause baby, it's you

[Verse 1]
Are you telling me you feel
Like you have never felt
Ut Oh, my heart
Don't you know those famous words
Be seen but not heard
Taboo to love

[Chorus]
Are you telling me your eyes
Met hers to your surprise
But why, my heart?
How loud must you hear me say
Have fun but don't play
Taboo to love

[Verse 2]
Where's your lantern or candlelight
So to guide you through the hidden spaces
Through its said truth unveils all lies
Feelings can't be left to roam

[Chorus]
So you say you've lost your head
But you use your heart instead
Beware of love
This is not like you at all
Who vowed to never fall
Taboo to love, taboo to love
Taboo 

[Background]
To love, taboo to love
Taboo 

[Background]

[Verse 3]
Where's your raincoat and over-boots
To protect you in stormy weather
Though its said when you walk in truth
Love can bring you no harm

[Chorus]
So you've made up in your mind
You'll leave your fears behind
So brave my heart
I guess your heart has made you see
It's better to be free
No taboo to love

[Outro]
I guess your heart has made you see
It's much better to be free
No taboo to love
No taboo to love
Taboo 

[Background]
To love, no taboo to love
Taboo 

[Background]
To love, no taboo to love
Taboo 

[Background]
To love, no taboo to love
Taboo 

[Background]
No taboo to love

[Chorus]
Yes I am crying
I got the blues and I don't know why
Yes I am crying
I got the blues, I'm so dissatisfied
Because I've been cryin' through the night
Tears on my pillow
And I have been cryin through the night
Weeping like a weeping willow
From crying through the night
Hear me crying through the night

[Verse 1]
I am lonely, downhearted and sad
Because I've lost the best woman that I ever had
To a friend of mine
Just can't figure out how it could be
That somebody like him could take her away from me
And it's on my mind
Nearly all the time

[Chorus]
Yes I am crying
I got the blues and I don't know why
Yes I am crying
I got the blues, I'm so dissatisfied
Because I've been cryin' through the night
Tears on my pillow
And I have been cryin through the night
Weeping like a weeping willow
From crying through the night
Hear me crying through the night
Now I know just how best friends can be
Because he made sure you knew your best was with me
And it's on my mind

[Verse 2]
Here's a lesson much greater that wealth
Keep your business to you, yourself and no one else
And your smiling eyes
Won't be crying like mine

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Lying out on the street, there's a man
That needs somewhere to sleep
And a bag-lady digs, through the trash
Hoping to find some food to eat
In the cold winter's snow, walks a boy
That needs shoes for his feet
In an old run-down house, there's a child
In a crib that needs some heat
In the dark of the night, a young man
Searches for a guiding light
And a young woman cries in despair
Because she feels alone in life
You might ask yourself what in the hell
Does that have to do with me
Well, here is your wake up call
Everything!
Because we all play a part in each other's existence

[Chorus 1]
Take the time out to love someone
Reach your arms out and hug someone
Be it king or some homeless one
We are all one underneath the sun

[Chorus 2]
Take the time out to be right there
Take the time out to show you care
You'll be so glad when the day is done
You took the time out to love someone

[Verse 2]
There's a man in a house where they're selling crack
Yet he's trying to be strong
But when lost in the sea, of no hope
He must be saved from wrong
Don't say what you won't do, if for days
You had no food to eat
Nor extremes you won't go, for a bed, shoes
Or if your baby needed heat
You do not have the right to pre-judge
If you don't share your strength
And you can't say you're down for the fight
If you won't go the length
Now I don't really care what you feel
If you don't feel for life
And don't care what you think if your words
Don't have ways and actions that perpetuate life

[Chorus 1]
Take the time out to love someone
Reach your arms out and hug someone
Be it king or some homeless one
We are all one underneath the sun

[Chorus 2]

[x2]
Take the time out to be right there
Take the time out to show you care
You'll be so glad when the day is done
You took the time out to love someone

[Refrain]
I think it's time to

[Chorus 1]
Take the time out to love someone
Reach your arms out and hug someone
Be it king or some homeless one
We are all one underneath the sun

[Chorus 2]

[x2]
Take the time out to be right there
Take the time out to show you care
You'll be so glad when the day is done
You took the time out to love someone

[Verse 1]
There's a girl in my life about 4'10"
She's the one who brings me morning joy
And brings me joy when my day ends
She says my life will never have no problems
That her love cannot fix
And she proves her worth true
Every time she goes into her love bag of tricks

[Chorus]
She's got everything I want
Everything I need
And if she ain't got it
She knows how to find the remedy
And she tells me
Come let me make your love come down 

[x7]

[Verse 2]
She says you'll never worry in your life
As long as you come and let me
Make your love come down
I call her Miss Satisfaction
Because she keeps me satisfied
She gets my automatic smile
When she whispers Steveland, I love you, I love you
I love you
Such a lovely world is my life
Since that girl has come inside
And everyday that I live
I'm gonna do my best to keep her satisfied
Our love will never have no problem
That the both of us can't fix
Because like glue to a stamp
Like gum on a shoe
She and I are going to stick

[Chorus]
She's got everything I want
Everything I need
And if she ain't got it
She knows how to find the remedy
And she tells me
Come let me make your love come down 

[x7]

[Verse 1]
What is that that you're looking through
A pornographic magazine?
When I bet you don't even know how to
Spell the word
And you say you don't leave home unless
You're strapped
With your uzi sub machine
When you've just barely come into this world
Well, if a child's ways and actions
Reflect what they hear and see
Guess the only ones to blame are you and me

[Chorus]
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
Look what's happened to our world
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
We're so sorry
The only chance for a better one
Is up to you and he
Please! Forgive us for what we've done
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones

[Verse 2]
What kind of name is that you're calling her
I've heard that word before
But I don't think any parent would give their
Daughter a name so low
And about this extra paraphernalia
You say you're carrying to get high
That won't take you anywhere you want to go
Well, you don't have to listen
Because it's here for you to see
So many burnt out lives trapped in their misery

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh, I could rattle on about the good old days
And how life used to be
And even inwardly relive them vividly
But the best advice I can give to you
Is that we only go around one time
Treat each day like this is it
And give it the best you can

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
Look what's happened to our world
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
We're so sorry
There's so much we should and should
Have never done
That's why we're begging on our knees
Please! Forgive us for what we've done
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones

[Verse 1]
You can't say we shall and not fight through hell
You can't say we will and not dare to deal
You can't shout out peace and then vanish in the crowd
You can't ride the storm without some effect
You can't steal the spoil and not pay the debt
You can't wave a sign that spells "evil" and feel really proud
You can't sing a song with no melody
You can't say we're one without unity
You can't form a line if you're sacred to stand alone
You can't pray for grace and then smack her face
You can't speak of hope and then crack a joke
You can say you're there but time knows how much you've grown
Put a face to your somebody

[Chorus]
Can you say your name?
Or would you rather stay unknown?
Can you show your face?
Or are you fearful of it shown?
Can you feel your heart?
Or does it beat for you alone?
Lift your glass up high
Say that your truth will never lie
If your love cannot be moved

[Verse 2]
You can't look at me and not see yourself
You can't say "for them" and not for who else
You can't truly bless and not bless the good of all
You can't serve the rich and desert the poor
You can't hear their cries and just close the door
You can't say you're down and not take it to the wall
You can't benefit from one's detriment
You can't find the serum and not cure the sick
You can't free the slave to enslave them differently
You can't see the right only from your sight
You can't see the wrong and just go along
Or is that the way you would want your fate to read
Put a face to your somebody

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You can't make a pledge and then slip the script
You can't say the words and not move your lips
You can't be confused and still say you understand
You can't be a friend but not through thin and thick
You can't be a click but in danger split
You can't evenly share and then grab the biggest hand
You can't say you do but then show you don't
You can't say you will and make sure you won't
You can't want for change and not do what you need to do

[Bridge]
You can't give up all and then take back all you give
You can't live to die but you can die to live
Or is that too much to ask of the you in you?
Put a face to your somebody

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
What if someone made a soda
That caused everyone to love each other
Oooh, oh yeah, it sounds good, to me
And if just a tiny pill can make us see
That we're truly sisters and brothers
Oooh, oh yeah it sounds so nice to me
And we would have no time to waste
On trivial things like war and pain
'Cos we'd be filled with joy to know
Through love the universe we've changed

[Chorus]
To being all about the love again
All about the love my friend
This whole world will be all about the love again
We'd be all about the love again
No need to pretend
This whole would be all about the love again

[Verse 2]
What if someone came up with a lotion
That made everybody start sharing
Oooh, oh yeah it feels so good to me, yeah yeah
And some irresistible cologne that with one spray
There'd be no second thought of caring
Oooh, oh yeah it sounds so fine to me
And gone forever would be the day
Of hunger, homelessness and shame
'Cos for every single heart
The promise of endless love will reign

[Chorus]
We'd be all about the love again
All about the love my friend
This whole world will be all about the love again
We'd be all about the love again
No need to pretend
This whole would be all about the love again
All about the love again
All about the love my friend
This whole world will be all about the love again
We'd be all about the love again
No need to pretend
This whole would be all about God's love again

[Verse 1]
I was a lonely no one
Living in a vacuum as life's debris
Victimized as one whose self deprivation
Had made for my outer insecurity
I was a he ain't nothin'
Living in the slums of love's misery
Starving from the lack of sweet affection
Until you came to rescue me

[Chorus]
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Since you walk through my door
I don't have to no longer be blue
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Now that love's touched my soul
All my lonely nights alone are through

[Verse 2]
I was a Mr. Lonely
Seeing only darkness in the bright of day
Blind even though my eyes were wide opened
But then your love sunshined my way

[Chorus]
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Since you walk through my door
I don't have to no longer be blue
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Now that love's touched my soul
All my lonely nights alone are through
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry 

[x6]

[Verse 3]
My life was without reason
Sinking in a hell that had no space or time
Falling to the burning pit of pain and sorrow
Until you saved this life of mine

[Chorus]
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Since you walk through my door
I don't have to no longer be blue
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Now that love's touched my soul
All my lonely nights alone are through
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry 

[x4]
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
My nights are not lonely no more
My tears don't flow no more
My eyes don't cry, my eyes don't cry, my eyes don't cry no more

[Verse 1]
We have time for racism
We have time for criticism
Held bondage by our ism's

[Chorus]
When will there be a time to love

[Verse 2]
We make time to debate religion
Passing bills and building prisons
For building fortunes and passing judgements

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
At this point in history we have a choice to make
To either walk a path of love
Or be crippled by our hate

[Verse 3]
We have time to cause pollution
We have time to cause confusion
All wrapped up in our own illusions

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
We have time to conquer nations
Time for oil excavation
Hatred, violence and terrorism

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
At this moment in time
We have a choice to make
Father god is watching
While we cause mother earth so much pain
It's such a shame

[Verse 5]
Not enough money for
The young, the old and the poor
But for war there is always more

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
We make time for paying taxes
Or paying bills and buying status
But we will pay the consequences

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Now's the time to pay attention
Yes now is the time... to love.....love
A time love... love...love
A time to love
Please, please won't you tell me
When will there be a time to love
Please, please won't you tell me
When will there be a time to love
Please, please won't you tell me
When will there be a time to love
Please, please won't you tell me
When will there be a time to love
Please, please won't you tell me
When will there be a time to love

[x4]

[Intro: Edley Shine]
Now every ting is lovely
So don't put your trust in a false prophecy
Dis a de Edley Shine & Stevie
You might wonder
Stand firm to all those who feel concern
Come when you can't see the light
You must see the Robins in flight
Life is just a matter of time or space
So all those who have to face sorrow
Shall only have to wait till tomorrow
Big tings a guan dis year
So mek we drop inna gear
Come cross missa Stevie Wonder
Watch it!

[Verse 1: Stevie Wonder]
Now where do I start to make the point that I'll be making
To most efficiently use your time that I'll be taking
With the clear understanding that every ticking second is precious to us all
But if you let me bend your ear and listen up you will hear
Not just what I say, but every word that I am saying
You wake in the morning from a dream with spirits dope hype
Though you real life condition is far from being alright
Your love has wronged you, your money's gone, you've lost your home and everything you own
But before you do something major extreme
I've got one simple thing for you to take along with you, as you go on your lonely way

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder]
Tomorrow robins will sing
Tomorrow robins will sing
It really is no big thing, 'cause tomorrow robins will sing
Tomorrow blue jays will fly
The weather forecasts clear skies
So dry those tears from your eyes, 'cause tomorrow blue jays will fly

[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder]
You borrow a dime to call up a friend that you could rely on
They put the phone down, you hear in the background "tell him I'm not home"
Your face is broken, your throat is choking, you hang up the phone in disbelief
And to make matters worse
You can remember you were the first and only one to come to him when lonely was his every day
But if what you did came from your heart and not expecting
Then you should not waste one heart beat on any regretting
The saying's older than old yet true for today as when it was made to be told
As you saw so shall you reap
And if you've treated life sweet
Your blessing's been ordained and already on its way

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder]
Tomorrow robins will sing
Tomorrow robins will sing
It really is no big thing, 'cause tomorrow robins will sing
Ooh, tomorrow blue jays will fly
The weather forecasts clear skies
So dry those tears from your eyes, 'cause tomorrow blue jays will fly

[Bridge: Stevie Wonder]
Today is the tomorrow you were so worried about
Looking over your yesterday
The clouds are gone and the sun is out
And everything has worked out irie okay

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder]
Tomorrow robins will sing
Tomorrow robins will sing
It really is no big thing, 'cause tomorrow robins will sing
Tomorrow blue jays will fly
The weather forecasts clear skies
So dry those tears from your eyes, 'cause tomorrow blue jays will fly
Ooh, tomorrow robins will sing
Tomorrow robins will sing
It really is no big thing, 'cause tomorrow robins will sing

[Verse 1]
Make me feel like paradise
Give me what I'm missing
Send me to the highest heights
Take me up and away
I've tasted love so many times
With something always missing
But I know that you got the kind
To take me up and away

I know that our journey
Will be filled with passion, love and pleasure
Touching down where only
Satisfaction’s guaranteed
We won't let our feelings
Auto-pilot perfect navigation
Sending us to love bliss
Like no one ever knew could be

Oh, make me feel like paradise
Fill me with your kisses
Make the moment feel just right
Take me up and away
Because I have waited all my life (Flying high)
For the one worth giving (Love sky high)
And I don't have to think twice (Flying high)
Let's go up and away

Love's light in flight, mmm-hmm
Fuel injection passion (Flying high)
Love's light in flight (Love sky high)
Fuel injection passion

We need just to feel it
To know that our loving has the power
Showing that these feelings
Emanate from you and me
With love high aviation
We will fly forever and one hour
Giving us the always
To live out all our fantasies

[Verse 1 repeated]
Make me feel like paradise
Give me what I'm missing, yeah
Send me to the highest heights
Take me up and away
I've tasted love so many times
With something always missing, yeah
But I know you've got the kind
To take me up and away, yeah

Ooh, make me feel like paradise

[Verse 1]
My love is warmer than a smile
My love gives to every needing child
If anyone should ask you who's my true love
Tell them my love true
Is ever letting all their love come through

[Chorus]
My love sees love with not a face
And lives to love through time and space
If all of everything about my love
Fits to the tune of you
Then you can say that you are my love too

[Verse 2]
Let my love shine through out the world
To every mountain top and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
'Til love's all over
Let it reach out to every heart
To every disenfranchised people
'Til it is present and no more
Is pain all over

[Chorus]
Our love sees love's the key to peace
We'll pray 'til all world wars have ceased
Should you or anyone you know enough
To say they feel as we
Then let our universal song be free

[Verse 3]
Let our love shine through out the world
To every mountain top and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
Until love's all over
Say words of love to all we see
To rich and poor for love is equal
Let us lift up humanity
Spread love all over
Let all its forces join as one
So to rebuke all signs of evil
Through every valley, land and sea
Our love's all people

[Verse 1]
There is something on my mind that's in my heart written on my face
And it would behove me and my soul if I did state my case
And so as truth is real and real is truth this truly must be told
That you've got to be the sweetest somebody I Know
It's your love for life, your love for God, your love for love and more
And you express your love in ways like I've never known before
If there's a record kept on who's the sweetest let the record show
That you've got to be the sweetest somebody I Know

[Chorus]
You are the sweetest somebody I know
And that is why I can't help but love you so

[Verse 2]
In a time when people are on with making sure that they're okay
You pour out your love every second, every minute, every hour of the day
I'm not trying to blow your horn I'm only saying what is so
That you've got to be the sweetest somebody I Know

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Bridge]
When I feel like from giving up from seeing all life's pain and strife
You rejuvenate me saying everything's gonna be alright
If there's a place called "heaven" bet my life someday you're gonna go
Cause you've got to be the sweetest somebody I Know

[Chorus]

[x2]
Everybody say, 'Yeah'
(Yeah, yeah!)
Say, yeah!
(Yeah!)
Say, yeah
(Yeah!)
Yeah?
(Yeah!)
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

[Harmonica solo/instrumental]

[Announcer]
How 'bout it?
Go ahead an shake this up for me real good
Stevie Wonder

[Verse 1: Dionne Warwick]
Tender, warm and serene
Are the words that might come close to having
Remnants of the feelings that we can no longer hide
Mighty, shining and clear
Are but mere expressions that don't come near
To the ever glowing eminence of light in our eyes tonight

[Chorus: Dionne Warwick]
Because moments aren't moments
Until they are moments like this magic moment of ours
And magic's not magic
Until it is magic like magical love in our hearts
Feeling with tender love-bloom

[Verse 2: Dionne Warwick]
Gentle, quiet, so soft
Are the wings of love that can send us off
To an ever splendor unknown to all in our time
Trusting in the unknown and giving into what feelings have shown
Will take us to altered intimacies in our lives
Where we'll find

[Chorus: Dionne Warwick]
That moments aren't moments
Until they are moments like this magic moment of ours
And magic's not magic
Until it is magic like magical love in our hearts
Feeling with tender love-bloom

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus: Dionne Warwick]
'Cause moments aren't moments
Until they are moments like this magic moment of ours
And magic's not magic
Until it is magic like magical love in our hearts
Moments aren't moments
Until they are moments like this magic moment of ours
And magic's not magic
Until it is magic like magical love in our hearts
'Cause moments aren't moments
Until they are moments like this magic moment of ours
And magic's not magic
Until it is magic like magical love in our hearts

[Intro]
Moon blue, moon blue
Your hearts just caught up in the moon blue

[Verse 1]
Moon blue, rivers of love you shine, bathe me in light sublime
Flood me with all your glowing heart can give
Moon blue, memories bind like chains
When will you come again
I wait in darkness just for your bright to beam

[Chorus]
Because I'm not afraid of the consequence
Of being in love with you
And I'd rather be alone some nights
Awaiting your full hue
For though the sun makes bright the day
My world is dark when there's no you
You light my skies and make dark night bright day, moon blue

[Verse 2]
Moon blue, your beauty's seen by all, the yearning of your call
Travels the world and then makes home my soul
Moon blue, lift me to starry heights, i long to live within your light
Solace of mind, my heart is yours for always

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Stevie Wonder + Dionne Warwick]
Every time I think our love is drifting apart
Something always throws it back together
And every time I think I've found someone new for my heart
After one kiss my heart tells me never

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder + Dionne Warwick]
Ooh, oh, everyone has got a weakness in life
Girl, you just happen to be mine
Oh, everyone has got a certain weakness in life
Your love just happens to be mine

[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder + Dionne Warwick]
Every time I think your love has no more to give
You do something more to take me higher
And every time I think that for someone else I could live
I'd be living love out as a liar

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder + Dionne Warwick + Both]
Oh, everyone has got a weakness in life
Boy, you just happen to be mine
Oh, everyone has got a certain weakness in life
Your love just happens to be mine

[Bridge: Stevie Wonder + Dionne Warwick]
We keep thinking that our love won't last beyond tomorrow
But our hearts say we're gonna stay in love this way

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder + Dionne Warwick + Both]
Oh, everyone has got a weakness in life
Girl, you just happen to be mine
Oh, everyone has got a certain weakness in life
Your love just happens to be mine
Say it again
Everyone has got a weakness in life
Boy, you just happen to be mine
Everyone has got a certain weakness in life
Your love just happens to be mine

[Verse 1]
He and his wife have had problems
That he's played off like nothing's wrong
'Til he comes home from work early
Just to find the girl is gone
Oh, but he gets into the cupboard
Picks out that bottle of gin
Drinks like there's no tomorrow
And decides to take a spin

[Chorus]
No, don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk, no
Don't drive drunk
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad

[Verse 2]
Teenager at a live party
Says, "Give me one for the road"
But he's already so inebriated
If you lit a smoke he'd explode
Oh, but bartender says, "I don't think so"
Young one says, "I can deal"
Staggering out he says, "Check you all later"
But I really don't think he will

[Chorus]
No, don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk, no
Don't drive drunk
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad
Don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk, no no
Don't drive drunk
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad

[Verse 3]
Boy out with girl on their first date
Gets pulled over by the law
Officer says, "Hey, can't you drive straight
Or have you been drinking alcohol?"
Oh, boy says, "Man, are you crazy?"
Cop says, "Hey, then walk this line"
But results from the breathalizer
Proves he's charged with D.U.I

[Chorus]
No, don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk, no no
Don't drive drunk
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad
Say it again, don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk, no no no no
Don't drive drunk
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad
No, don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk
Don't you drive drunk
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad
Yeah, don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk, no
Don't drive drunk
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad

No, don't drive drunk
No, don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad
Don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad

[Verse 1]
All the gold in all the world
Is nothing to possess
If all the things that it can bring
Can't add up to one ounce of your happiness

[Chorus]
And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there

[Verse 2]
A diamond that shines
Like a star in the sky
Is nothing to behold
For minuscule is any light
If it can't like you brighten up my soul

[Chorus]
For your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there
Oh yeah

[Bridge]
I could have never fathomed this
Such joy, love, and tenderness
That you give to me, yeah
For the love I feel inside
It's so wonderful I can't hide
And I glow, I glow
With just the thought of you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

[Chorus]
And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there
One more time
For your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll, I'll be right there, yeah
Come on, one more time
And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there
You know I'll be right there
You know I'll be right there

[Verse 1]
You scare me a bit
But that's all right
You know when I want you
Most every night
And I've been meaning to tell
You baby that it makes no sense
Still I'm finally convinced
Yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I believe we could chug all night
I believe we could hug all night
The band is loose and the groove
Is right you're so much woman I
Believe we could chug all night

[Verse 2]
On the day that I die, well
I just might scream
If I'm alive in the morning
I'll be alive in a dream
You better listen to me baby
Cause you know that I'm hung on you
Till I'm blind and black and blue
No one else will do

[Chorus]
We're going to do a little chugging
We're going to do a little hugging
The band is loose and the groove is right
I'm wired for sound
Are you wired for light?
And you're so much woman
I believe we could chug all night

[Verse 3]
No woman ever do what you do
High on a pleasure wheel
No devil ever cast a voodoo
So long and dark and real

[Chorus]
We're going to do a little chugging
We're going to do a little hugging
The band is loose and the groove is right
I'm wired for sound
Are you wired for light?
And you're so much woman
I believe we could chug all night

[Outro]
I said a yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Woo! It's only midnight baby
Come on and do it to me

[Chorus]
Most of us are sad
No one lets it show
I've been shadows of myself
How was I to know?

[Verse]
Tell me scarlet sun
What will time allow?
We have brought our children here
Who can save them now?
Oh, Weeping woman try to smile
Like the coming dawn
Most of us are sad it's true
Still we must go on
Love was here today
Oh the sun was bright
I will sing you far away
Love is here tonight

[Chorus]
Most of us are sad
No one lets it show
I've been shadows of myself
How was I to know?

[Verse 1]
Such a happy couple love and some
Until man goes busy just for fun
Man gets the guilt, tells fun girl we can't no more
Fun girl says if you stop i'll tell her right now

[Chorus]
Aah, please don't hurt my baby
That's all his lips could say
Aah, please don't hurt my baby
She won't believe you anyway

[Verse 2]
I was blinded by sexsation
Temporarily out my head
Aah, please don't hurt my baby
She mustn't know we went to bed
You could hear him moaning

[Bridge]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

[Verse 3]
You should have thought about that boy
Before you were using it like a toy
You should have thought about that boy
Before you did the ooh aah ooh aah ooh ooh aaah
What a pretty love pair, perfect fit
Til woman sights on one that she's just got to get with
Woman gets scared tells plaything we can't no more
Plaything says if you stop i'll tell him right now

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I was blinded by desire
Temporarily insane
Aah, please don't hurt my baby
He can't know we did the wild thing
And you could hear her crying

[Bridge]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

[Outro x2]
You shoulda thought about that girl
Before you were giving up that pearl
You shoulda thought about that girl
Before you did the ooh aah ooh aah ooh ooh aaah
You shoulda thought about that boy
Before you were using it like a toy
You shoulda thought about that boy
Before you did the ooh aah ooh aah ooh ooh aaah

[Verse 1]
I'm hanging on to my peace of mind
I just don't know
I'm hanging on to those good times, baby
Just want to let them roll
I'm gonna make it to the light and joy
I'll tell you why
I got a woman who can take me there
The apple of my eye

[Chorus 1]
Oh, whoa, I just don't know
No no, no, no
No, whoa, I love her so

[Verse 2]
Don't let me see that mornin' paper
'Cause I don't need those dues
It's just the same old murder movie
But they call it the news
I'll tell you what would be some story
And what would set me free
Is if the same thing happened to everybody
That just happened to me

[Chorus 2]
Oh, whoa, I just don't know
No no, no, no
No, whoa, I'll never let her go
No no, no

[Verse 3]
And every time I hear somebody
Sneaking up behind
Whoa, I turn around but I still hear that sound
And just when I'm about to lose my mind

[Chorus 3]
Here comes my baby
Singing like a nightingale
Coming my way
Down along that devastation trail
Well, tell the Lord above
She's got a brand of love that cannot fail

[Verse 4]
I'm hanging on to my peace of mind
And that's no lie
I'm hanging on to my special friend
The apple of my eye
The apple of my eye, my inspiration too
She's got a lead on my heart and my soul
And she knows just what to do

[Chorus 3]
Oh, whoa, I just don't know
No no, no, no
No, whoa, I get so low and my mind's about to go

[Chorus 4]
But wait a minute, here comes my baby
Singing like a nightingale
Coming my way
Down along that devastation trail
Well, let the fires burn
And let the floods return, we will prevail

[Outro]
Hanging on to my peace of mind
I just don't know

[Verse 1]
Look at how they stop and stare
As if they've never seen a heart in love
And though i see them i don't care
Cause i'm too busy thinking bout our love
Thinking about that each and every morning
I wake up to that love glow in your eyes
And though it seems i'm hooked on this fixation
I will not stop my daydreaming
Until my nights are true with you

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, my love is on fire
Ooh baby, my heart is on the wild
Ooh baby, i'm burning with desire
I want to feel your love
I need to feel your love mixed with mine

[Verse 2]
Listen at me call your name
As if you're witness to my every word
And though it seems sometimes insane
Something within me tells me they'll be heard
So i wait so patiently the moment
When my love fantasies will come to life
And all i need from you is confirmation
Then i'll be living truth, those moments
That i long with you

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Bridge]
On flute, hubert laws
And all i need from you is confirmation
Then i'll be living truth, those moments
That i long with you

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Verse 1]
I lost ten points just for being in the right place
At exactly the wrong time
I looked right at the facts there, but I may as well
Have been completely blind

[Chorus 1]
So if you see me walking all alone
Don't look back, I'm just on my way back home
And there's a train, leaves here this morning
And I don't know what I might be on

[Verse 2]
She signed me to a contract
Baby said it would all be so life long
I looked around then for a reason
When there wasn't something more to blame it on

[Chorus 2]
But if time makes a difference while we're gone
Tell me now and I won't be hanging on
And there's a train, leaves here this morning
And I don't know what I might be on

[Verse 3]
"1320 North Columbus" was the address
That I wrote down on my sleeve
I don't know just what she wanted
It might have been that it was getting time to leave

[Chorus 3]
And I watched as the smoker passed it on
And I laughed when the joker said, "Lead on"
'Cause there's a train, leaves here this morning
And I don't know what I might be on

[Outro]
There's a train, leaves here this morning
And I don't know what I might be on

[Verse 1]
The day's been hot and sunny
Evening's about to take control
The sky is painting pictures
Stirring up love bliss in our souls
The breeze carries the fragrance
Of the sweetest symphony as it blows through your hair
Better can be nowhere
Our voices turn to whispers
Blending with rhythms of the night
The nightingales sing a love song
Glancing down at us in their flight
The moisture brings forth magic
That permeates the midnight air
To kiss the love we share, are

[Chorus]
Raindrops, passionate raindrops
The kind of rain that writes they're
So in love on our skin
Raindrops, that we hope won't stop
Cooling the red hot love that we are making
Raindrops, passionate raindrops
That brings out all the fire that we have within
Raindrops cover every spot
Right to the last drop
We want all of you and then
Let each drop a rain be a lifetime that our love won't end

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in our doing
Trying to make our bodies one
We fall prey to moon dreams
Till awaken by the morning sun
Still disorientated
I feel something warm on my face
Coupled by your embrace
We gaze in awe and wonder
As if we can't believe it's so
Just that taste of heaven
Has got us longing for much more
We lie there impatient
Anxiously waiting foe the sun to go in
And the clouds to burst again, to give us

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Verse 1]
Open up your eyes
Take the devil from your mind
He's been holding on to you
And you're so hard to find
The wind outside is cold
Restless feeling in my soul
Tempting me to get away
But there's no place a man can go

[Chorus]
God, will you lead me where I roam?
Help me not to let my feelings show
No, no

[Verse 2]
You are the one, oh
How could you be so blind?
The devil prays on runaways
He's never far behind
The many years I've tried
Now have been revealed to me
Closer is the love you'll find
Waiting so patiently

[Chorus]
God, will you lead me where I roam?
Help me not to let my feelings show
No, no
Take the devil
Take the devil
From your mind

[Verse 1]
You lift me to the sky
When i'm flat on the ground
You put me on a high
When i'm all the way down
And when trouble comes around
Trying to blow up the spot
You look it in the eye and say "i think not"

[Chorus]
Tell your heart i love you
I love you, yes i do
Tell your heart i need you
You need to know its true
Don't nobody in the world love you the way i do

[Verse 2]
You make me feel like a trillion bucks
When i don't even have a dime
You put a smile on my face
In a time i could be crying
And when negative comes around
With nothing good to say
You give it a stare that makes it get the hell away

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Long before my mind believed
My heart could not help but conceive
That i love you, yeah
And when my head did suggest
My heart had already confessed
That i love you, love you, love you

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Verse 1]
When the lights are down
And the stage is bare
And no more magic's in the air
There's not a friend in sight to care
Your tears no one will share

[Chorus]
I'll be your comfort through your pain
I'll be your shelter in the rain

[Verse 2]
When your sad is bad and your bad is worst
And there's no who to turn to first
When you've done everything you can
No one's there to take your hand

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When you've looked around
And haven't seen me anywhere
Though when you were down
I lifted you up from there
There isn't a thing you can ask of me
I won't do
Just you put your trust in me
My love will see you through
When the final candle's flickered out
"Why me" is all you can think about
When all your joy has disappeared
Your future isn't clear

[Chorus]

[Outro]
When all the odds say there's no chance
Amidst the final dance
I'll be you comfort through your pain
I'll be your shelter in the rain
I'll be you comfort through your pain
Yes, i'll be your shelter in the rain, rain
I'll be your shelter
Be your shelter, be your shelter in the rain

[Verse]
I'm just arriving in the city
And there's music on my mind
Looking for my destination and
My home is far behind
Cause it's a long road ahead
And you can make it in the end
And I'm going to make it with my friends
And I'm trying
It took me sometime to see it
Now I'm looking through this world
And it's going to take some time before
I get back, help me girl
Cause you can make it if you try
You got to lay it on the line
And everything will be fine if you try

Sitting smoking just a thinking
Is an easy thing to do
We got to keep on trying for
The feeling to come through
And it's a lonely way to live
You got to take it, you got to give
If you mistake it, just try again
And I'm trying, yeah!
Got to keep on trying
Ah, we got to keep on trying
Yeah I'm trying

[etc]

[Verse 1]
If i'm caught at a dance party without my dancing shoes
And everybody dances on my bare feet
Shame on me
If i'm minding my business just doing the right thing
And you try to front me off in the street
Shame on you
If a family's waiting for that special blessing to
Come their way
But they ain't trying to get on their knees and pray
Shame on them
And if we live in a time where every nation's fighting
Around the world
Yet we can't all agree that peace is the way
Shame on us

[Chorus]
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss

[Verse 2]
If i gotta get up early in the morning for a job
Interview
And i forget to set the stupid alarm
Shame on me
If my children are playing outside like little children do
And you come around there trying to bring them some harm
Shame on you
Should i be driving thru a klantown, find a restaurant
To get me some food
And someone says "hey boy, we don't serve your kind"
Shame on them
And if we live in a democracy and you don't use your
Power to vote
Knowing some would like to turn back the hands of time
Shame on us

[Chorus]
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss

[Verse 3]
If I'm hooked on a habit knowing damn well it could
Cost me my life
Yet i keep doing what i should do without
Shame on me
If you're locked in a marriage and your other half
Just gives you abuse
Yet you've convinced yourself that there's no way out
Shame on you
If we're jamming the music and somebody's got the
Audacity
To say that they can jam it better than us
Shame on them
And should there be just a handful that believe that
We are totally free
And there's no need to fight for equality
Shame on us

[Chorus]
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss

[Outro]
What the fuss 

[X4]

[Verse 1]
Can you picture mother earth in the palm of your hand?
The entire universe as a tiny grain of sand
And it feels impossible to do

[Chorus]
As i can't imagine love without you

[Verse 2]
Think of drinking every sea with its salty waters dry
Sprinting around the world three times faster than a rocket flies
And the thought of it you can't pursue

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Some thoughts are just no brainers
Not worth an ounce of time
Yet others inconceivable
So they never cross your mind

[Verse 3]
Travel back though life inside one atlantis summer's night
Add up every single star
Since the day there first was light
How and where to start
You'll have no clue

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Yet others inconceivable
So they never cross your mind
Travel back though life inside one atlantis summer's night
Add up every single star
Since the day there first was light
How and where to start
You'll have no clue
And the thought of it you can't pursue
Because it feels impossible to do

[Outro]
As i can't imagine love without you
I can't imagine love without you

[Verse]
They were dueling, Doolin-Dalton
High or low, it was the same
Easy money and faithless women
Red-eye whiskey for the pain
Go down, Bill Dalton, it must be God's will
Two brothers lying dead in Coffeyville
Two voices call to you from where they stood
Lay down your law books now
They're no damn good
Better keep on moving, Doolin-Dalton
Till your shadow sets you free
If you're fast, and if you're lucky
You will never see that hanging tree
Well, the towns lay out across the dusty plains
Like graveyards filled with tombstones, waiting for the names
And a man could use his back, or use his brains
But some just went stir crazy, Lord, cause nothing ever changed
Until Bill Doolin met Bill Dalton
He was working cheap, just biding time
Then he laughed and said, I'm going
And so he left that peaceful life behind
Mmh

[Verse]
Twenty-one and strong as I can be
I know what freedom means to me
And I can’t give the reason why
I should ever want to die

Got no cause to be afraid
Or fear that life will ever fade
Because as I watch the rising sun
I know that we have just begun

I might spend my life upon the road
Just trying to add to what I know
Then someday I might settle down
And all my friends will be around

They say a man should have a stock and trade
But me, I'll find another way
I believe in getting what you can
And there ain’t no stopping this young man

[Outro]
Because I'm young and fast as I can be
I know what freedom means to me
And I can’t give the reason why
I should ever want to die
No I can’t give the reason why
I should ever want to die

[Verse 1]
Some people ask me why always on the bright side
When there's so much going on down the other side
It's like i live in a bubble with no trouble
And problems don't exist
I chuckle and tell them that ain't the case at all
It goes way back to the time when i was very small
Not in mind but size and age my papa use to say
You can always look at the negative
But you should always live in the positive
So i try everyday to live that way

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Some people live in what was and what they could have been
As opposed to living in a what is and how much they can
And be the first to complain about nothing in life going their way
The attitude is "that i can't do nothing 'bout"
And very happy with just breathing in and out
The ones that when you say "lets go make a difference"
They'll say "naw that's ok"
So i don't waste time on the trip side
Because i do know the real on the flip-side
And i'm crystal clear everyday that's why i say, yeah

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
When i see the morning
And the sun is smiling down upon me
I joy in the blessing
That still the ground is not above me
And for the people
That i can truly say do love me, i feel
Positivity, because that's what life's meant to be
Positivity, because this day did not have to be

[Verse 3]
Some ask me why i'm such an optimist
When it's more fashionable be a pessimist
From what's in seventy-five percent of what we read, hear and view
Well i use to have a friend named minnie riperton
Who use to always say when she was living
"Like fine wine i like seeing the glass of life as half full than half empty"
I'm not saying sometimes life can't be rough
But never to the point of me saying i've had enough
Long as my heart beats i ain't giving up
That's why i say everyday

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4]
When people ask me as an african american
What do i see for tomorrow in the human plan?
Is it possible for all the people of the world to co-exist?
I say unity is only as big as our vision
And if its narrow, try to expand beyond the horizon
But true leaders must guide us through the ills of society
That stands in our way
So if the road is to harmony, be with the call
But if its about discord, don't take the ride at all
Because the world vision i see is the one-we for everybody

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Positivity, because that's what life means to me
Positivity, because this day did not have to be
Positivity, because that's what life's meant to be
Positivity, because that's the energy the world needs 

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Move in
Can't you see she wants you
She has you deep in her eyes
You been wondering why she haunts you
Beauty in the devil's disguise
She can tell you all about it
She sees it in the stars
She'll burn you if you try to put her down

[Chorus]
Oh well, it's been a good day in hell
And tomorrow I'll be glory bound

[Verse 2]
Higher
She can keep you loaded
Feeding you whiskey and wine
Fire
The devil's on the phone
He laughs and says you're doing just fine
In that big book of names
I wanna go down in flames
Seein's how I'm goin' down

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Truckin', that's all that I've been doin'
Every girl's a fork in the road
Stuck in some sticky situations
Feelin' like I wanna explode
All this gratification
And sick conversation
Someone get me out of town

Oh well, it's been a good day in hell
And tomorrow I'll be glory bound

[Verse 1]
Oh, my, don't the sky look spacious
With the stars all shining down
Well, I can hear the night wind howling
It's a high and lonesome sound
And I ain't had a woman in so long
I can't feed my starving soul
Come on, saddle up, boys, we're gonna ride into town
We're gonna get a little out of control

[Verse 2]
There's a card game in the corner
And the barmaid smiled at me
Well, I tipped her a sliver dollar and
She brought me a drink for free
All the town-folk call her the cheap one
And the gamblers call her Flo
Come on, set 'em up again
I got me a friend, and I think I'm getting out of control
Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
She's cool water, her mama taught her
I got news, she's mine and mine alone

[Verse 3]
And if anybody's looking for trouble
You know I'm the one you want to try
Well, I'll fight any man who wants to
And I don't care who or why
You got to gamble on your story
You got no guts, you get no glory
And I'm betting my money on an ace in the hole
Think I'm getting out of control

[Outro]
We've done it now
Where's my baby?
Where'd you go, baby?

[Verse]
You never cry like a lover should
Sigh when it feels real good
Or see the sky through the stone and wood
You never cry like a lover
I thought i saw somebody i loved
Sleeping deep inside you
If i could catch you in an unguarded moment
I'd stay right here beside you
You never smile at me late at night
Laugh out loud when we get it right
You can't get loose if there's too much light
You never smile like a lover
Try a little harder
I can't live with you baby, can't live without it
Try a little harder
And sometimes i believe in love
Sometimes i doubt it
But your life goes on
Like a broken down carousel
Where somebody left the music on

[Bridge]
I was hoping you were the one 

[x4]

[Outro]
You never move like you used to do
Pour it out when you're feeling blue
Somebody must have put some pain on you
You never cry like a lover
(you never cry like a lover)
Cry
(you never cry like a lover)
You never cry
(cry like a lover)
Come on and cry
(you never cry like a lover)
You never cry
(cry like a lover)
You never cry
(cry like a lover)

[Chorus]
Oo, midnight flyer
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
Oo, midnight flyer
I paid my dues and i feel like traveling on

[Verse 1]
A runaway team of horses ain't enough to make me stay
So throw your rope on another man
And pull him down your way
Make him into someone who can take the place of me
Make him every kind of fool you wanted me to be

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'll go to Santa Fe
Maybe San Antone
Any town is where I'm bound
Any way to get me gone
Don't think about me
Never let me cross your mind
Except when you hear that midnight lonesome whistle whine

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
I paid my dues and I feel like travelin' on

[Hook: B.o.B]
I woke up in the morning high as hell x4
Still faded, but nigga can’t you tell
Can’t you tell, nigga can’t you tell
I woke up in the morning high as hell
Can’t you tell, nigga can’t you tell
I woke up in the morning high as hell

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I woke up this morning so high
I probably never get low
R. Kelly, I think I can fly
But this is as high as it go
I can't recall being sober
Cause that was a trillion hours ago
You say you want to get higher than me
Well you got a billion miles to go
Nigga this stone age, roll up and put it in rotation
My dro potent and make show faces
Till I'm po' baby like an old lady
So faded like some old navy in an old basement
With my OG that's fresh off of probation
I bang, bang, you be ho saving
Ran in yo ho like home invasion
When I hit up my dealer I'm so impatient
I be hightailing and ain't no debating
I know the answer to the whole equation
Always baking like a local bakery
We pass it around like a roller skating rink
I go to the club, it stay open late for me
Just rolled up a blunt and it's motivating me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Woke up in the morning, grab some weed, a joint and rolled it
Put some cheese eggs on my stomach, I don't need it bitch I want it
Crib in California, got a villa in the trump
I put some converse on my feet and told my bitch, "let's get this money"
One joint, fourteen grams, that's a half
Blow torch on the nail, that's a dab
Space cakes, Hemp2O, I'm getting blow
Budder in a G-Pen, man I'm stoned
One hit of this wax, got him high, he don't wanna say it
Try to call my phone, but I'm gone, me and Bobby Ray
I'm smoking Kush today, tomorrow, I'm a straight shatter
Hardcore budder, lookin' like some cake batter
It make me think better, fucking up you're dead wrong
Rasta told me "fat rips make the dread long"
I took a dab, past out fly as hell

[Hook]

[Bridge: B.o.B.]
High, in the sky, Superman
Am I high, yes I am
I done lost my mind (4x)
In the sky, ceiling fan
Purple haze, Afghanistan
I done lost my mind (4x)

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Lord, I don't know which way I am going
Which way the river going to flow
It just seems that upstream, I keep rowing
Still got such a long way to go
Still got such a long way to go

[Verse 2]
Then that light hits your eye
I know, I swear
We'll find somewhere
The streets are paved with gold
Bullets fly, split the sky
But that's alright, sometimes
Sunlight comes streaming through the holes

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Tell me , how do you feel?
Like you're rolling so fast that you're spinning your wheels?
Don't feel too bad, you're not all along
We're all trying to get along
With everybody else trying to go their way
You're bound to get tripped, and what can you say?
Just go along until they turn out the lights
There's nothing we can do to fight it

[Chorus]
No man's got it made till he's far beyond the pain
And we who must remain go on living just the same

[Verse 2]
I once knew a man, very talented guy
He's sing for the people and people would cry
They knew that his song came from deep down inside
You could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes
And so he traveled along, touch your heart, then be gone
Like a flower, he bloomed till that old hickory wind
Called him home

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
We who must remain go on laughing just the same

[Verse 1]
Cruising down the center of a two way street
Wondering who is really in the driver's seat
Minding my business along comes big brother
Says, son, you better get on one side or the other

[Chorus]
I'm out on the border, i'm walking the line
Don't you tell me about your law and order
I'm trying to change this water to wine

[Verse 2]
After a hard day, i'm safe at home
Fooling with my baby on the telephone
Out of nowhere somebody cuts in and
Says, "hmm, you in some trouble boy, we know where you're been."

[Chorus]
I'm out on the border, I thought this was a private line
Don't you tell me about your law and order
I'm trying to change this water to wine

[Bridge]
Never mind your name, just give us your number, mm
Never mind your face, just show us your card, mm
And we wanna know whose wing are you under
You better step to the right or we can make it hard

[Chorus]
I'm stuck on the border
All I wanted was some peace of mind
Don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
I'm trying to change this water to wine

[Outro]
On the border
On the border
On the border
On the border
On the border
Leave me be , i'm just walking this line
On the border
On the border
All i wanted was some peace of mind, peace of mind
I'm out on the border
On the border
Can't you see i'm trying to change this water to wine
On the border
Don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
Sick and tired of all your law and order
On the border
Sick and tired of it
On the border
I'm the man on the border
On the border

[Chorus 1]
Well, my time went too quickly
I went lickety-splitly out to my old fifty-five
As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive

[Chorus 2]
And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade
Just a wishing I'd stayed a little longer
Lord, don't you know the feelings getting stronger

[Verse]
Six in the morning, gave me no warning
I had to be on my way
Now the cars are all passing me
Trucks are all flashing me
I'm headed home from your place

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
And now the sun's coming up, yes it is
I'm riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Freeway cars and trucks
Riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Riding with lady luck

[Verse 1]
How come you love him when he
Takes you for a fool
He's only looking for a good time
How can he love you when he
Treats you mean and cruel
He's not the best thing that you could find

[Chorus]
Is it true?
I can't believe it
Is it true?
I just can't see it
Is it true?
Is that you?

[Verse 2]
When we were young, we didn't really have a care
You were hung up, i had a good line
I never knew it then but, man, i was in love
How could i know it was the right time?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yes, i was so wrong
For leading you on
There wasn't much i could do
I was a wild one, but i can change some
If that's important to you

[Outro]
Is it true- you've lost that feeling?
Is it true- you might be leaving?
Is it true?

[x2]
She's really leaving

[x3]

[Verse 1]
Every night I'm lying in bed
Holding you close in my dreams
Thinking about all the things that we said
And coming apart at the seams
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough

[Refrain]
I know you were trying
To give me the best of your love

[Verse 2]
Beautiful faces
And loud, empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give
That same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above

[Refrain]
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love
(You get the best of my love)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love
(You get the best of my love)

[Bridge]
I'm going back in time
And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping

[Verse 3]
But every morning
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way
And I see it mine
But we both see it slippin' away
You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasn't enough

[Refrain]
Oh-uh-oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

[Chorus/Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love
(The best of my love)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love
(The best of my love)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
Ev'ry night and day
(You get the best of my love)
(The best of my love)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
Ohohuh, ohohuh
(You get the best of my love)
(The best of my love)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love
(The best of my love)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
Mhmhmhmh
You get the best of my love
(You get the best of my love)
(The best of my love)

[Verse 1]
It's not the first time
That I've had the sense that something's wrong
But I'm old enough to know
That things don't always work out like they should
I know you're trying hard
To break it gently to me, now
But there's no easy way
To tell it like it is, so baby

[Chorus]
I don't want to hear any more
You don't need to tell me it's over
I've been here before

[Verse 2]
I've seen that look before
I know it well, it comes as no surprise
You've been avoiding me
But now you want to talk it over
Before you take my hand
And tell me softly in a whisper
There's no need to explain
I've read the book, I know how this all ends

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I won't ask you to stay
I won't stand in your way
Look me right in the eyes
Let me walk away with my head high
If there's some other guy
I don't need to know why

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I won't ask you to stay
I won't stand in your way
And I don't want to hear any more
No, no, baby
I don't want to hear any more

(Look out, look out)
(Watch out, watch out)
Yeah
(Look out, look out)
Yeah

[Chorus]
Draft day, Johnny Manziel
Five years later, how am I the man still?
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side, bitch, we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for ya
Yeah, suits and ties yellin' out, "Pay the guys"
Man, I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
Aww man, aww man, aww man
Man, you know I had to—

[Verse]
Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine, but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure that my people getting by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas'll take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep eggin' me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard-boiled, mm
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left this shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
Yeah, no offense 'cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on making records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up 'cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talking crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound, that'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it Wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say, "Okay, if you say so"
See whatever I say goes, I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I could never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so-and-so, where did they go?
Too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit, I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence, you can really get it, yeah
I mean, for real, girl you know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to— oh, wait, sidebar, left some beat at the end
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off
SZN

[Chorus]
Draft day, Johnny Manziel
Five years later, how am I the man still?
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side, bitch, we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for ya
Yeah, suits and ties yellin' out, "Pay the guys"
Man, I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
Aww man, aww man, aww man
Man, you know I had to—

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
I used to hurry a lot, I used to worry a lot
I used to stay out till the break of day
Oh, that didn't get it
It was high time I quit it
I just couldn't carry on that way

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I did some damage
I know it's true
Didn't know I was so lonely
Till I found you

[Chorus 1]
You can go the distance
We'll find out
In the long run (In the long run)
We can handle some resistance
If our love is a strong one (Is a strong one)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People talking about us
They got nothin' else to do
When it all comes down
We will still come through

[Chorus 2]
In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you
It's a long run

[Verse 2]
You know I don't understand
Why you don't treat yourself better
Do the crazy things that you do
Cause all the debutantes in Houston, baby
Couldn't hold a candle to you

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Did you do it for love?
Did you do it for money?
Did you do it for spite?
Did you think you had to, honey?

[Chorus 3]
Who is gonna make it?
We'll find out
In the long run (In the long run)
I know we can take it
If our love is a strong one (Is a strong one)

[Pre-Chorus 4]
Well, we're scared
But we ain't shakin'
Kinda bent
But we ain't breakin'

[Chorus 4]
In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you
It's a long run
In the long run
In the long run

[Outro]
Gonna find out, ooh fa-fa-fa-find out
Long-long-long-long, long-long-long-long
Ooh, run-run-run, baby, run-run, baby
Long, long, long, long

[Verse 1]
There's a place I can go
When the tension is high and I'm feeling low
In a falsh I can be in an another space
As a different me, have a new id

[Chorus]
I think I'll treat myself to all the pretty places in my head
Yes, I'm going to treat myself to all the pretty places in my head

[Verse 2]
There's no rich, there's no poor
Everything is love no such thing as "war"
There's no black and no white
Rainbow colors they, dress the day and nights, life's paradise

[Chorus]
I think I'll treat myself to all the pretty places in my head
Yes, I'm going to treat myself to all the pretty places in my head

[Verse 3]
It's amazing how the mind
Can do what you want it to
It can take you to a time
Where you'll want to stay forever
Feeling overlasting pleasure

[Bridge]
If your life's in a place
That you can hardly bare
Come along with me to mental ecxtasy

[Chorus]

[x2]
I think I'll treat myself to all the pretty places in my head
Yes, I'm going to treat myself to all the pretty places in my head

[Outro]

[x2]
Wahtsoever things are lovely
Whatsoever things are pure
Whatsoever things are honest
Whatsoever things are true

[Verse 1]
Try to envision you as the oldest living someone
Being every night and day all alone
Going through ages and ages, places and spaces
But never finding that someone to call your own
Like a treasure chest of dreams long forgotten
Hidden for good in a stolen lost and found
But just when fate was calling quits
Love appeared in the midst of despair
Came and turned your life around

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm new, new like the first day of spring
New like a nightingale that's just learned to sing
I'm new, new like the very start of dawn
Like a child that's first born with your love, I'm new

[Chorus 1]
You're standing amongst a crowd of six billion people
Crying out for help, but no one understands
Because much to your dismay, you've been taken far away
To a land where joy is pain and sorrow's a happy man

[Verse 2]
Where an aching heart's the sign of the mighty
And a love-filled heart looks down upon with fault and shame
But at the very instant all was through, lady lucks appears, says "love can do"
And changed you like a Christian who's been born again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm new, new like the fresh morning dew
New like a work of art that's finally through
I'm new, new like a first flight of a dove
So safe and secure with your love, I'm new

[Chorus 2]
Love took a long time coming to me
But I've got to say
I owe my thanks to him for sending you my way, hey

[Chorus 3]
Because I'm new, new like the first winter snow
Like the start of forever, with infinity to go
I'm new, new like the birth of the sun
Forever young I will be

[Chorus 4]
Because with your love, I'm new
New like from a restful night of sleep
New like a starving man that's had food to eat

[Outro]
I'm new, nothing compares nor can compete
Sharing with you the sweetness of your love, I'm new

[Verse 1]
I was just walking down the street
Looking forward to seeing the friends I was to meet
Yet what happened so tragically
Really makes for no sense at all
Suddenly two guys confronted me
Saying I was in the wrong turf, angrily
They said their colors were black but I was wearing gray
I started to turn to go back
They up and blew me away

[Chorus]

[x2]
My love is with you where ever you are
My love is with, where ever you are

[Post-Chorus]
Though my life they've taken
They can't take what we've shared
Spread the love I've given
And I'll be there

[Verse 2]
I was out playing with my friends
You know, doing silly things that kids do at ten
But the crossfire I was caught in
Should not have been in the first place
A dropped Monte Carlo came to a screech
Someone yelled "nobody gets away with dissent me"
Across the street a man pulled his nine
Everybody started to run
A shower of bullets rang out
Mistakenly my life was done, oh

[Chorus]

[x2]
My love is with you where ever you are
My love is with, where ever you are

[Post-Chorus]
Though my life they've taken
They can't take what we've shared
Spread the love I've given
I'll be there

[Pre-Chorus]

[x2]
My love is with you where ever you are
My love is with, where ever you are

[Bridge]
When you're joyful
When you're lonely
When you're happy
When tears are streaming right down your face
In the morning
In the noon time
In the evening
In the wee wee hours of the night time hour
In the summer
In the springtime
In the autumn
In the cold long winter, winter nights
My love is with you
My love is with you my best friend
My love is with you my brother
My love is with you my sister
My love is with you my mother
My love is with you my father

[Outro]
I'm with you

[x2]
Ban the hand gun - chant

[Verse 1]
Look at us baby, up all night
Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark? Ah ahh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay

[Chorus 1]
And I can't tell you why

[Verse 2]
When we get crazy, it just ain't right
(Try to keep your head, little girl)
Girl, I get lonely, too
You don't have to worry, just hold on tight
(Don't get caught in your little world)
Cause I love you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be

[Chorus 2]
And I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay

[Chorus 3]
And I can't tell you why
No, no baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why

[Outro Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
I've seen you, I saw you, I see you
Without little notice, if any at all
Of you knowing me watching you
You walking, you talking, you smiling
You styling in everything your body wears
And that's not just a point of view
They're painting, they're ranting, they're raving
About Miss Lovely got it going on
From head down to her toes
And no one knows better than I know
Cause I've been listening to the spirit of
Your body, mind and soul

[Chorus 1]
It's a sensuous whisper
That makes my body weak
It's that sensuous whisper
That's sweeter than the sweetest sweet
It's that sensuous whisper
That makes my psyche say
Ooh we, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we

[Verse 2]
Can feel you, can smell you, can taste you
Though my senses never had the pleasure of
That lovely wonderment
But I start to shaking, I shiver, to think that little sparkle in your eye
Means you are giving me some kind of hint
I'm ready, I'm willing, I'm able
In fact those words are at the tip of my tongue
Eagerly waiting for me to say
Then you smile and whisper "how are you?"
But when I move my lips and try to speak the words just go away

[Chorus 1]
It's a sensuous whisper
That makes my body weak
It's that sensuous whisper
That's sweeter than the sweetest sweet
It's that sensuous whisper
That makes my psyche say
Ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we

[Chorus 2]
It's that sensuous whisper that's got me tripping out
It's that sensuous whisper
That I don't wanna do without
It's that sensuous whisper
That makes me want to shout
Ooh we, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we

[Verse 3]
I don't even care how long it takes
As long as I have you lying next to me
Cause to wait forever and a day
Is a small price to pay if it's you I'm getting
If it's you I'm getting, I'm not quitting
And that is how I'm living

[Verse 4]
I'm clinging, not dreaming, but scheming
With my nose against the grind and both my eyes focused upon the prize
I think it, I trust it, I know it
Your love that I've longed for is gonna be mine
Good things do come in time
I'm right on the rythm you're giving
But this is more than giving up some casual mental telepathy
The music, the candles, the champagne and all that's needed
Is one thing to give it authenticity

[Chorus 1]
It's a sensuous whisper
That makes my body weak
It's that sensuous whisper That's sweeter than the sweetest sweet
It's that sensuous whisper
That makes my psyche say
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we

[Chorus 2]
It's that sensuous whisper
That's got me tripping out
It's that sensuous whisper
That I don't wanna do without
It's that sensuous whisper
That makes me want to shout
Ooh we, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we

[Chorus 3]
It's a sensuous whisper
That makes my body rock
It's that sensuous whisper
That makes me beg baby don't ever stop
It's that sensuous whisper
That always get me hot, baby
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we

[Chorus 4]
It's that sensuous whisper
That makes me feel alright
It's that sensuous whisper
That keep me wanting you morning, noon and every single night
It's that sensuous whisper
Don't want you out of my sight, baby
Ooh we, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we

[Outro]

[x2]
It's that sensuous whisper

[Verse 1]
Here in the conscious world
We place our theories down
Why man must bring us
To our knees
Before he sees the weakness
Of his sinful plan
The power in his hand
Will never touch a friend

[Chorus]
Throw your hatred down
Throw your hatred down

[Verse 2]
Meanwhile in the underworld
The weaknesses are seen
By peasants and presidents
Who plan the counter-scheme
Children in the schoolyard
Finish choosing teams
Divided by their dreams
While a TV screams

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The wheel of fortune
Keeps on rolling down
The street that's paved
With sinful plans
There but for circumstance
May go you or I
Dressed in gold lame
Find a place to stay

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Feelin young and full of fun
Hangin out with my crew
Hot to trot and about to pop
Trying to find some girl to get into
There she was fine as can be
Hair braided down to her knees
She took me home, she turned me out
But before sunrise she said I must leave

[Pre-Chorus]
It was a cold chill on a summer night
Never thought the girlie wouldn't treat me right
It was a cold chill on a summer day
Never thought the girl would dog me out that way
It was a cold chill on a summer morn
Never cried like a baby since the day I was born
It was a cold chill on a summer eve
Never had no chopper bring me to my knees

[Chorus]
I was feeling so trusting
Gave it all right down to the bone
But she did me wrong
On a summer night

[Verse 2]
Far from meek, and feeling chic
Refusing to concede defeat
There I was same crew, same time
Same club we kicked it at the previous week
I asked her how could she have the nerve
To treat me with such disgrace
She blinked her eyes, smiled, apologized
Threw her drink right in my face

[Pre-Chorus]
It was a cold chill on a summer night
Never thought the girlie wouldn't treat me right
It was a cold chill on a summer day
Never thought the girl would dog me out that way
It was a cold chill on a summer morn
Never cried like a baby since the day I was born
It was a cold chill on a summer eve
Never had no chopper bring me to my knees

[Chorus]
I was feeling so trusting
Gave it all right down to the bone
But she did me wrong
On a summer night, on a summer night
On a summer night, on a summer night
A cold chill, a cold chill, a cold chill, cold chill

[Verse 3]
Weekends came and weekends passed
But not the yearning in my heart
And there she was to light the spark
Like she did right from the very start
I took no time, drove to her house
Got deep into a passion high
I heard a knock, the turn of a key
And the voice of another guy

[Pre-Chorus]
It was a cold chill on a summer night
Never thought the girlie wouldn't treat me right
It was a cold chill on a summer day
Never thought the girl would dog me out that way
It was a cold chill on a summer morn
Never cried like a baby since the day I was born
It was a cold chill on a summer eve
Never had no chopper bring me to my knees

[Chorus]
I was feeling so trusting
Gave it all right down to the bone
But she did me wrong
On a summer night, on a summer night
On a summer night, on a summer night

[Outro]
It was a cold chill
Like standing in the deep freeze
A cold chill
Like when snow's above your knees
Cold chill
Like sitting at the north pole
A cold chill
Wearing not one stitch of clothes
Cold chill
Like a winter Chicago night
A cold chill
Twenty ice cubes down your back for spite
Cold chill
Stranded in sub-zero degrees
A cold chill
Layed out on the arctic sea
Cold chill
When your fingers get frost bite
A cold chill
Buried beneath ten feet of ice
Cold chill
Baby, that ain't so nice
A cold chill

[Verse 1]
Into each life there comes a time
When you must pay your lovers' dues
Breaking out in a cold sweat
Because you've been rightfully accused
I'm not such a strong man
That love can't make me weak
You're walking out the door
And it's hurting me so deep, so deep

[Chorus]
And I'm sorry
Sorry that I made you cry
Sorry, sorry that I told you lies
I'm sorry, sorry the way we fuss and fight
I'm sorry, sorry cause now you're
Saying goodbye to me

[Verse 2]
Every young boy will grow up
To then become a man
Then the difference from wrong and right
He clearly understands
I'm not such a big man
That I can't break down in tears
Because my whole body went into shock
When you told me you were out of here! Out of here!

[Chorus]
And I'm sorry
Sorry that I made you cry
Sorry, sorry that I told you lies
I'm sorry, sorry the way we fuss and fight
I'm sorry, sorry cause now you're saying
Goodbye to me, to me

[Bridge]
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, that I ever made you cry
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, that I ever told you lies
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, sorry the way we fuss and fight
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, so sorry

[Verse 3]
If you added up all the good times
And compared them with the bad
You'd realize that our love
Was the best you ever had
I'm not such a proud man
That I won't cop a plea
See me baby girl, I'm on my knees
Begging please, baby please, baby please, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, sorry that I made you cry
Sorry, sorry that I told you lies
I'm sorry, I'm sorry the way we fuss and fight
I'm sorry, sorry cause now you're
Saying goodbye to me, me baby, me baby, me baby

[Outro]
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, that I ever told you lies
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, that I ever made you cry
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you
I'm sorry baby, sorry the way we fuss and fight
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
Sorry, sorry 

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Staring right at 2000 AD
As if mankind's atrocities to man has no history
But just a glance at life in 2000 BC
We find traces of man's inhumanity to man
There's no mystery

[Chorus]
All for one, one for all
There's no way we'll reach our greatest heights
Unless we heed the call
Me for you, you for me
There's no chance of world salvation
Less the conversation's peace

[Verse 2]
We can't pause, watch and say "no" this can't be
When there's a plan by any means to have
Cleansing of one's ethnicity
And we shouldn't act as if we don't hear nor see
Like the holocaust of six million Jews and
A hundred and fifty million blacks during slavery

[Chorus]
All for one, one for all
There's no way we'll reach our greatest heights
Unless we heed the call
Me for you, you for me
There's no chance of world salvation
Less the conversation's peace

[Verse 3]
When publicly or privately convened
May love, positivity and life's preservation
Be the basic theme
And should you put your trust in some
Prophet in life
Give him trust but your faith must stay
With the one
Who gave the ultimate sacrifice for...

[Chorus]

[x2]
All for one, one for all
There's no way we'll reach our greatest heights
Unless we heed the call
Me for you, you for me
There's no chance of world salvation
Less the conversation is peace

[Verse 1]
Somewhere out there on that horizon
Out beyond the neon lights
I know there must be something better
But there's nowhere else in sight

[Verse 2]
It's survival in the city
When you live from day to day
City streets don't have much pity
When you're down, that's where you'll stay

[Chorus]
In the city (oh, oh)
In the city (oh, ohhh)

[Verse 3]
I was born here in the city
With my back against the wall
Nothing grows and life ain't very pretty
No one's there to catch you when you fall

[Verse 4]
Somewhere out on that horizon
Far away from the neon sky
I know there must be something better
And I can't stay another night

[Chorus]
In the city (oh, oh)
In the city (oh, ohhh)

[Outro]
In the city
In the city
In the city (oh, ohhh)
I was standing
All alone against the world outside
You were searching
For a place to hide
Lost and lonely
Now you've given me the will to survive
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive

Don't you worry
Sometimes you've just got to let it ride
The world is changing
Right before your eyes

Now I've found you
There's no more emptiness inside
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive

I would die for you
Climb the highest mountain
Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do
Now I've found you
There's no more emptiness inside
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive

[Solo]

I would die for you
Climb the highest mountain
Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do

I was standing
All alone against the world outside
You were searching
For a place to hide
Lost and lonely
Now you've given me the will to survive
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive

[Verse 1]
Looking for the good life
Dressed to kill
She don't have to worry
'Cause there's always someone else who will
Loose and loaded every night
Dancing underneath the flashing light saying
"Look at me, baby, look at me
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm somebody!"
Just slip into the arms of the disco strangler

[Verse 2]
He's been around here all along, baby
Been waiting for his time to come
You looking for attention, darling
He will surely give you some
He's the crimson in your face du jour
The fiddler in your darkest night
He's the melody without a cure
And Rome is burning but that's alright
Just slip into the arms of the disco strangler
Just slip into the arms of the disco strangler

[Verse 1]
It wasn't really sad the way they said good-bye
Or maybe it just hurt so bad she couldn't cry
He packed his things, walked out the door and drove away

[Chorus]
And she became the girl from yesterday

[Verse 2]
He took a plane across the sea
To some foreign land
She stayed at home and tried so hard to understand
How someone who had been so close could be so far away

[Chorus]
And she became the girl from yesterday

[Verse 3]
She doesn't know what's right
She doesn't know what's wrong
She only knows the pain that comes from waiting for so long
And she doesn't count the teardrops
That she's cried while he's away
Because she knows deep in her heart
That he'll be back someday
The light's on in the window, she's waiting by the phone
Talking to a memory that's never coming home
She dreams of his returning and the things that he might say

[Outro]
But, she'll always be the girl from yesterday

[x2]

[Verse 1]
It's just another day in paradise
As you stumble to your bed
You'd give anything to silence
Those voices ringing in your head
You thought you could find happiness
Just over that green hill
You thought you would be satisfied
But you never will

[Chorus]
Learn to be still

[Verse 2]
We are like sheep without a shepherd
We don't know how to be alone
So we wander around this desert
And wind up following the wrong gods home
But the flock cries out for another
And they keep answering that bell
And one more starry-eyed messiah
Meets a violent farewell
Learn to be still

[x2]

[Bridge]
Now the flowers in your garden
They don't smell so sweet
Maybe you've forgotten
The heaven lying at your feet

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
There are so many contradictions
In all these messages we send
(We keep asking)
How do I get out of here
Where do I fit in?
Though the world is torn and shaken
Even if your heart is breaking
It's waiting for you to awaken
And someday you will

Learn to be still

[x2]

[Outro]
You just keep on running
Keep on running

[Verse 1]
Well, he sits up there on his leatherette
Looks through pictures of the ones that he hasn't had yet
When he thinks he wants a closer look
He gets out his little black telephone book

He's calling, calling, calling
He's calling, calling, calling
He's calling, calling, calling
He's calling

[Verse 2]
Come sit down here beside me, honey
Let's have a little heart to heart
Now look at me and tell me, darling
How badly do you want this part?
Are you willing to sacrifice?
And are you willing to be real nice?
All your talent and my good taste
I'd hate to see it go to waste

[Verse 3]
We gon' get you an apartment, honey
We gon' get you a car
(Yeah, we're going to take care of you, darling)
We gon' make you a movie star
For years I've seen 'em come and go
He says, "I've had 'em all, ya know."
I handled everything in my own way
I made 'em what they are today

{Guitar Solo 1}

[Verse 4]
After 'while nothing was pretty
After 'while everything got lost
Still, his Jacuzzi runneth over
Still he just couldn't get off
He's just another power junky
Just another silk scarf monkey
You'd know it if you saw his stuff
The man just isn't big enough

{Guitar Solo 2}

[Verse 1: Glenn Frey]
Stare out the window
You can't make the time go
You don't even know why you're here
Wait for the weekend to go off the deep end
And make everything disappear

[Verse 2: Don Henley]
You're lost in a teenage jail
So young and so vicious and so frail
Where something is always for sale
You're lost in a teenage jail

[Verse 3: Glenn Frey & Don Henley]
You're not like your mothers (not like your mother!)
You're not like the others (not like the other!)
You're not quite like anyone else (You're not quite like anyone else, no, no)
They don't even know you
Got nothing to show you
So get something good for yourself
{Synthesizer Solo}

{Guitar Solo}

[Verse 1]
Harry got up
Dressed all in black
Went down to the station
And he never came back
They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street
In the morning
He had a home
The love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfurl
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

[Chorus]
In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute

[Verse 2]
Lying here in the darkness
I hear the sirens wail
Somebody going to emergency
Somebody's going to jail
If you find somebody to love in this world
You better hang on tooth and nail
The wolf is always at the door

[Chorus]
In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute

[Verse 3]
And in these days
When darkness falls early
And people rush home
To the ones they love
You better take a fool's advice
And take care of your own
One day they're here
Next day they're gone
I pulled my coat around my shoulders
And took a walk down through the park
The leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark
"Baby, I've changed. Please come back"
What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
The days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here
But I know there's somebody somewhere
Make these dark clouds disappear
Until that day, I have to believe
I believe, I believe

[Chorus]
In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute
(Hey!)

[Verse 1]
There was beer all over the dance floor
And the band was playing rhythm and blues
You got down and did the gator and half an hour later
You were barfing all over your girlfriend's shoes

[Chorus 1]
But the Greeks don't want no freaks
The Greeks don't want no freaks
Just put a little smile on them rosy cheeks
Cause the Greeks don't want no freaks
(Gator!!)
(Yeah, woooo.... woo. Aaow!)

[Verse 2]
She was the pride and the passion of Dixie
She did exactly what her daddy had planned
She was perfect little sister until somebody missed her
And they found her in the bushes with the boys in the band

[Chorus 2]
But the Greeks don't want no freaks
No, the Greeks don't want no freaks
So put a great big smile on them rosy cheeks
Cause the Greeks don't want no freaks
No, the Greeks don't want no freaks
Said, the Greeks don't want no freaks

Just put that monster smile on them rosy cheeks
Cause the Greeks don't want no freaks
No, the Greeks don't want no freaks

Ahhaaahh....

[Verse 1]
Out in the shiny night, the rain was softly falling
Tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away
Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling
And I remember the times we spent inside the Sad Café

Oh, it seemed like a holy place, protected by amazing grace
And we would sing right out loud, the things we could not say
We thought we could change this world with words like "love" and "freedom"
We were part of the lonely crowd inside the Sad Café

[Chorus]
Oh, expecting to fly
We would meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by

[Verse 2]
Some of their dreams came true, some just passed away
And some of them stayed behind, inside the Sad Café

{Acoustic Solo}

[Bridge]
The clouds rolled in and hid that shore
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more
Now I look at the years gone by and wonder at the powers that be
I don't know why fortune smiles on some and lets the rest go free

[Verse 3]
Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall
But things in this life change very slowly if they ever change at all
No use in asking why, it just turned out that way
So meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Café
Why don't you meet me at midnight, baby, inside the Sad Café

{Saxophone Solo}
No more walks in the wood
The trees have all been cut down
And where once they stood
Not even a wagon rut
Appears along the path
Low brush is taking over

No more walks in the wood
This is the aftermath
Of afternoons in the clover fields
Where we once made love
Then wandered home together
Where the trees arched above
Where we made our own weather
When branches were the sky
Now they are gone for good
And you, for ill, and I
Am only a passer-by

We and the trees and the way
Back from the fields of play
Lasted as long as we could
No more walks in the wood

[Verse 1]
Like a blue bird with his heart removed, lonely as a train
I've run just as far as I can run
If I never see the good old days shining in the sun
I'll be doing fine and then some

[Chorus]
How long, how long
Woman will you weep
How long, how long
Rock yourself to sleep

[Verse 2]
Well, I've been doing time in lonesome prison, where the sun doesn't shine
Just outside, the freedom river runs
Out there in that shiny night, with blood hounds on your mind
Don't you know it's the same sad situation?

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Everybody feels alright you know, I heard some poor fool say (Somebody Ooh)
Everyone is out there on the loose
Well I wish I lived in the land of fools, no one knew my name
But what you get is not quite what you choose

[Chorus]

[Outro]
How long, how long (long and drawn out)
Muddy River runs so deep
How long, how long (long and drawn out)
Good night baby, rock yourself to sleep
Sleep tight baby, rock yourself to sleep
Bye bye baby, rock yourself to sleep

[Verse 1]
I came home to an empty house
And I found your little note
"Don't wait up for me tonight"
And that was all she wrote
Do you think I don't know that you're out on the town
With all of your high-rolling friends?
What do you do when you come up empty?
Where do you go when the party ends?

[Chorus]
And you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy to think about us
I don't know what you were dreaming of
Somehow you forgot about love
And you were just too busy being fabulous, uh-huh

[Verse 2]
A little time in the country
A day or two to slow down
A bottle of wine and a walk in the moonlight
Maybe some fooling around
But you think time is just a magazine
And money's just a thrill
I've waited so long for you to change your way of living
Now I realize that you never will

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You tell a joke and everybody's laughing
That's something you know how to do
You've always been the life of the party
But now my baby, the joke is on you
Because you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy to think about us
Running after something that never comes
What in the world are you running from?
And you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy to think about us
To drink the wine from your winner's cup
To notice the children were growing up

[Outro]
And you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy, too busy
Too busy
Aw, baby

[Verse 1]
You don't have to say a word
I can see it in your eyes
I know what you want to say
It's so hard to say goodbye
I can hold back my tears
And try to be strong
While our love is falling apart
I know what I'll say
If you walk away

[Chorus]
But what do I do
What do I do with my heart?

[Verse 2]
I'm not going to say a word
I know I can't change your mind
You know where you need to go
I know I'll be left behind
I won't hold you back
I won't stand in your way
If you need to make a new start
But I still want to know
When my arms let you go

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh, girl, don't you remember?
It was not so long ago
We were making plans for two
Just me and you
Now you tell me that you've found somebody
Someone who loves you better
No one could ever love you
The way I do
Tell me you're not leaving now
Tell me you're not leaving
Tell me that you're going to stay
Please say you'll stay with me, baby
Tell me that you love me still
Say you love me still
For this and this alone I pray
Fall down on my knees and pray

[Bridge]
I'll do anything
Yes, I would
To save what we have
To keep you by my side
I'll love you 'til death do us part
But what do I do
What do I do
When I'm still missing you?

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
You're the only one who's ever heard my song
I might be lonely now, but I won't be lonely long
Take a look at me, baby
Tell me, what do you see?
Take a look at me, baby
You're looking at the brand new me
I'm like a total stranger knocking at your door
No need to worry about the way I was before
It's a new love story
So read every line
You be the judge and the jury
I'm guilty of the crime

[Chorus]
I'm guilty of, guilty of the crime
Of loving you, baby
Guilty of, guilty of the crime

[Verse 2]
I'm saving all my loving just for you
Because there's nothing more that I would rather do
It's a new love story
Got to read every line
You be the judge and the jury
I'm guilty of the crime

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Verse 1]
It's coming on the end of August
Another summer's promise almost gone
And though I heard some wise man say
That every dog will have his day
He never mentioned that these dog days get so long

I don't know when I realized the dream was over
Well, there was no particular hour, no given day
You know, it didn't go down in flame
There was no final scene, no frozen frame
I just watched it slowly fade away

[Chorus 1]
And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for my time to come around again and
Hope is floating on the breeze
Carrying my soul high up above the ground and
I've been keeping to myself
Knowing that the seasons are slowly changing
Even though you're with somebody else
He'll never love you like I do

[Verse 2]
I've been biding time with the crows and sparrows
While peacocks prance and strut upon the stage
If finding love is just a dance
Proximity and chance
You will excuse me if I skip the masquerade

[Chorus 2]
And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the dust to settle down along the
Back roads running through the fields
Lying on the outskirts of this lonesome town

[Bridge 1]
And I imagine sunlight in your hair
You're at the county fair
You're holding hands and laughing
And now the ferris-wheel has stopped
You're swinging on the top
Suspended there with him
And he's the darling of the chic
The flavor of the week is melting
Down your pretty summer dress
Baby, what a mess you're making

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I've been stumbling through some dark places
Now I'm following the plow
I know I've fallen out of your good graces
It's alright now

[Chorus 3]
And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the summer rain to fall upon the
Wild birds scattering the seeds
Answering the calling of the tide's eternal tune

[Bridge 2]
The phases of the moon
The chambers of the heart
The egg and dart of small gray
Spiders spinning in the dark
In spite of all the times the web is torn apart

[Intro]
And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the time to come around again and
Hope is floating on the breeze
Carrying my soul high up above the ground and
I've been keeping to myself
Knowing that the seasons are slowly changing
Even though you're with somebody else
He'll never love you like I do

[Verse 1]
Sitting by a foggy window
Staring at the pouring rain
Falling down like lonely teardrops
Memories of love in vain
These cloudy days, make you want to cry
It breaks your heart when someone leaves and you don't know why
I can see that you've been hurting, baby I've been lonely too
I've been out here lost and searching, looking for a girl like you
Now I believe the sun is going to shine
Don't you be afraid to love again, put your hand in mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I would never make you cry
I would never make you blue
I would never let you down
I would never be untrue

[Chorus]
I know a place where we can go where true love always stays
There's no more stormy nights, no more cloudy days

[Verse 2]
I believe in second chances
I believe in angels, too
I believe in new romances
Baby, I believe in you
These cloudy days are coming to an end
And you don't have to be afraid to fall in love again

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Now, where you going?
Now, what's the rush?
You listen here
No, you just hush
I know what you think
That man don't know anything
But I've been around a while
I know what's happening
Everybody want to check you out
Everybody want to be your friend
And all this pressure
Where do I fit in?
They don't know nothing you don't know
Ain't got nothing you ain't got
But you keep on running, you keep on running with the

[Chorus]
Fast company

[x2]
You're going nowhere, you're going nowhere fast
Fast company

[x2]
You're going nowhere, you're going nowhere fast

[Verse 2]
Now it's alright
To have some fun
This is your turn
Your life has just begun
You're racing out the door
Don't have very much to say
Your motor's running hot
You can't wait to get away
Looking up the road ahead
You can't see very far
Remember where you come from
Remember who you are
Be careful what you say
Be careful who you trust
This world is beautiful
This world is dangerous

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Talk to me and help me try to remember
How it feels to be so in doubt
Turn to me and help me try to remember
That raging fire that the years put out

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Verse 1]
I've been walking through the fields
And on the streets of town
Trying to make sense of what you left me
Everything that I believed in
Has been turned upside down
And now it seems the whole wide world's gone crazy
But when I feel like giving up
And I'm ready to walk away
In the stillness, I can hear
A voice inside me say

[Chorus]
Do something

[x2]
It's too late for saving face
Don't just stand there taking up space
Why don't you do something?
Do something
It's not over
No, it's never too late

[Verse 2]
You were always on my side
Love was all we had
Now I sit and watch our love unraveling
I pick up the morning paper
All the news is bad
How did we get on this road we're traveling?
But when I feel like giving up
And there's nowhere left to go
That's the time I dig down deep
The only thing I know

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Run away
You can't run away
For your honor
For your pride
You'll sleep better
Knowing you tried

[Outro]
To do something
Do something
It's too easy not to care
You're not ready for the rocking chair
Get up and do something
Do something
Don't wait too long
Even if it's wrong
You've got to do something
Do something
It's not over
No, it's never too late

[Verse 1]
Say goodbye to all your pain and sorrow
Say goodbye to all those lonely nights
Say goodbye to all your blue tomorrows
Now you're standing in the light
I know sometimes you feel so helpless
Sometimes you feel like you can't win
Sometimes you feel so isolated
You'll never have to feel that way again

[Chorus]
You are not alone

[x2]

[Verse 2]
Never thought I'd find the road to freedom
Never thought I'd see you smile again
Never thought I'd have the chance to tell you
That I will always be your friend

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Moon shining down through the palms
Shadows moving on the sand
Somebody whispering the twenty-third psalm
Dusty rifle in his trembling hands
Somebody trying just to stay alive
He got promises to keep
Over the ocean in America
Far away and fast asleep

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Silent stars blinking in the blackness of an endless sky
Cold silver satellites, ghostly caravans passing by
Galaxies unfolding, new worlds being born
Pilgrims and prodigals creeping toward the dawn

[Chorus]
And it's a long road out of Eden

[Verse 2]
Music blasting from an SUV
On a bright and sunny day
Rolling down the interstate
In the good old USA
Having lunch at the petroleum club
Smoking fine cigars and swapping lives
He said, "Give me another slice of that barbecued brisket!"
"Give me another piece of that pecan pie!"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Freeways flickering, cell phones chiming a tune
We're riding to utopia, road map says we'll be arriving soon
Captains of the old order clinging to the reins
Assuring us these aches inside are only growing pains

[Chorus]
But it's a long road out of Eden

[Verse 3]
Back home I was so certain
The path was very clear
But now I have to wonder
What are we doing here?
I'm not counting on tomorrow
And I can't tell wrong from right
But I'd give anything to be there in your arms tonight

[Solo]

[Verse 4]
Weaving down the American highway
Through the litter and the wreckage and the cultural junk
Bloated with entitlement, loaded on propaganda
And now we're driving dazed and drunk
Been down the road to Damascus
The road to Mandalay
Met the ghost of Caesar on the Appian way
He said, "It's hard to stop this binging, once you get a taste"
"But the road to empire is a bloody stupid waste"

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Behold the bitten apple, the power of the tools
But all the knowledge in the world is of no use to fools

[Chorus]
And it's a long road out of Eden

[Verse 1]
Well, ain't it a shame
'bout our short little memory?
Never seem to learn
The lessons of history
We keep making the same mistakes
Over and over and over and over again
And then we wonder why
We're in the shape we're in

Good old boys down at the bar
Peanuts and politics
They think they know it all
They don't know much of nothing
Even if one of them was to read a newspaper
Cover-to-cover
That ain't what's going on
Journalism dead and gone

[Chorus]
Frail grasp on the big picture
Light fading and the fog is getting thicker
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
Dark ages

[Verse 2]
You, my love-drunk friend
All that red wine and candlelight
Soulful conversations
That go on until the dawn
How many times can you tell your story?
How many hangovers can you endure
Just to get some snuggling done?

You're living in a hormone dream
You don't have the slightest notion
What long-term love is all about
All your romantic liaisons
Don't deal with eternal questions like
"Who left the cap off the freaking toothpaste?"
"Whose turn to take the garbage out?"

[Chorus]
Frail grasp on the big picture
You keep on rubbing and you're gonna get a blister
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
And I've seen it all before

[Bridge]
And we pray to our Lord
Who we know is American
He reigns from on high
He speaks to us through middlemen
And he shepherds his flock
We sing out and we praise His name
He supports us in war
He presides over football games
And the right will prevail
All our troubles shall be resolved
We have faith above all
Unless there's money or sex involved

[Chorus]
Frail grasp on the big picture (Nobody)
Nobody's calling and they're roughing up the kicker
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
Heaven help us

Frail grasp on the big picture
All waiting for that miracle elixir
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
I don't wonder anymore

Frail grasp on the big picture (Somebody)
You brought her here so go ahead and kiss her
It's a frail grasp on the big picture

Frail grasp on the big picture (Hold on, hold on)
Light fading and the fog is getting thicker
It's a frail grasp on the big picture

[Outro]
Frail grasp on the big picture
Frail grasp on the big picture

[Verse 1]
I like to go out every now and then
I can't wait to do it again
But I haven't had the time
Lately
I like to step out every once in a while
I kind of like to do it in style
I haven't had the time
Lately

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately I've been staying at home
(Staying at home, staying at home)
Working the crosswords, turn off the phone
(Turn off the phone, turn off the phone)

[Chorus]
And I dream I'm on vacation
Because I like the way that sounds
It's a perfect occupation
For me
I don't mind being by myself
If there's no one else around
It's the last good time in town

[Verse 2]
Well, I could stand up straight, get a real job
Stay up late with the same old mob
But it hasn't crossed my mind
Lately
Put on a suit, work downtown
Then come up when the sun goes down
No, I haven't had the time
Lately

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I love to watch a woman dance
She bows her head and lifts her hands
Her hips begin to circle slowly
Her eyes have closed, her face is holy
She holds the whole world in trance

[Chorus]
I love to watch a woman dance
Yeah, I love to watch a woman dance

[Verse 2]
She likes the slow songs of love lost
They take her a million miles away
Because to dream, sometimes, is the only way
To go places you can't get to any other way
Our eyes connect, she takes my hand

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I feel my heart beating, and I wonder
Will it ever satisfy my longing?
I'm going to hold on to you for as long as I can
For who knows, this dance may be our only dance

[Bridge]
So we danced together, close and slow
So slow we're almost standing still
Her warm breath against my neck
Slowly breaking down my will
The room spins so I can barely stand
The song ends, then, she lets go of my hand
There's so much I don't understand

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Look at the weather, look at the news
Look at all the people in denial
We're running time, leaving grace
Still we worship at the marketplace
While common sense is going out of style
I thought that I would be above it all by now
In some country garden in the shade

[Chorus]
But it's business as usual
Day after day
Business as usual
Just grinding away
You try to be righteous
You try to do good
But business as usual
Turns your heart into wood

[Verse 2]
Monuments to arrogance reach for the sky
Our better nature's buried in the rubble
We got the prettiest White House that money can buy
Sitting up there in that beltway bubble
The main jefe talks about our freedom
But this is what he really means

[Chorus]
Business as usual
How dirty we play
Business as usual
Don't you get in the way
Yeah, make you feel helpless
Make you feel like a clown
Business as usual
Is breaking me down

[Verse 3]
Boy, you can't go surfing in Century City
Yeah, them sharks out there are lurking beneath the curb
Yeah, they rob you blind, chew you up, and it ain't pretty
And it's a soul sucking, soul sucking, soul sucking, soul sucking
Soul sucking, soul sucking world

[Chorus]
Business as usual
Day after day
Business as usual
Feel like walking away
A barrel of monkeys
Or band of renown
Business as usual
Is breaking me down

[x2]

[Verse 1]
I come before you with my heart in my hand
Hoping you can see me through this veil of tears
Somehow I've got to make you understand
Ah, don't you know me after all these years?
Oh, love, I hate to disappoint you
But there's something you should know

[Chorus]
This is not the center of the universe
That's alright with me
This is not the center of the universe
But it's where I want to be

[Verse 2]
I will be with you everywhere you go
In gentle breezes that caress your skin
And you will see me in the silent snow
In everything that comes around again
Oh, love, I'll always be beside you
Wherever you may roam
Someday, with all the stars to guide you
You will find your way back home

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
A perfect day, the sun is sinking low
As evening falls, the gentle breezes blow
The time we shared went by so fast
Just like a dream, we knew it couldn't last
But I'd do it all again
If I could, somehow
But I must be leaving soon
It's your world now

[Chorus]
It's your world now
My race is run
I'm moving on
Like the setting sun
No sad goodbyes
No tears allowed
You'll be alright
It's your world now

[Verse 2]
Even when we are apart
You'll always be in my heart
When dark clouds appear in the sky
Remember true love never dies
But first a kiss, one glass of wine
Just one more dance while there's still time
My one last wish, someday, you'll see
How hard I tried and how much you meant to me

[Chorus]
It's your world now
Use well, the time
Be part of something good
Leave something good behind
The curtain falls
I take my bow
That's how it's meant to be

[Outro]
It's your world now

[x3]

[Chorus]
There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow

[Verse 1]
They say that anger is just love disappointed
They say that love is just a state of mind
But all this fighting over who will be anointed
Oh, how can people be so blind

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Oh, they tell me there's a place over yonder
Cool water running through the burning sand
Until we learn to love one another
We will never reach the promise land

[Chorus]

[x6]
Bells will be ringing this sad, sad news
Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again
Choirs will be singing "Silent Night"
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, yes, Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the ones you love
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year's will find you home
There will be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, happy once again

Ooh, there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, Christmas once again

[Verse 1]
We get up early and we work all day
We put our time in because we like to stay up

[Chorus]
All night long

[Verse 2]
We keep on grinning until the weekend comes
Just a pinch between your cheek and gum

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 3]
Start in the morning and get the job done
Take care of business and we have some fun

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 4]
We like a long neck and a good old song
Turn it up and then we sing along, sing along
We're all staying up

[Chorus]

[x5]

[Verse 1]
Went to a party just last night
Wanted to bring the year in right
Woke up this morning, I don't know how
Last night I was a happy man, but the way I feel right now

[Chorus]
It's going to be a funky new year
Funky new year
Ooh, Ahh, got to be a funky new year
Funky new year

[Verse 2]
Can't remember when I ever felt worse
Nothing matters and everything hurts
They were passing round the bottle, made me feel brand new
Trouble with the new man he wants a hit too, hit me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Lord, mmh, funky new year
Nurse I'm worse, funky new year
I got to perk up a little, funky new year
My hair hurts, funky new year

[Chorus]

[Outro]
A party baby
Never again, funky new year
Funky new year
Who's shoes are these? Funky new year
Funky new year
Party hardy baby, funky new year
Funky new year
What year is this anyway?

[Verse]
I have a mansion
Forget the price
Ain't never been there
They tell me it's nice
I live in hotels
Tear out the walls
I have accountants
Pay for it all
They say I'm crazy but I have a good time
I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime
Life's been good to me so far
My Maserati
Does one eighty-five
I lost my license
Now I don't drive
I have a limo
Ride in the back
I lock the doors
In case I'm attacked
I'm making records
My fans they can't wait
They write me letters
Tell me I'm great
So I got me an office
Gold records on the wall
Just leave a message
Maybe I'll call
Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through
(Everybody sing) I'm cool (He's cool)
I can't complain but sometimes I still do
Life's been good to me so far
I go to parties
Sometimes until four
It's hard to leave
When you can't find the door
It's tough to handle
This fortune and fame
Everybody's so different
I haven't changed

[Outro]
They say I'm lazy but it takes all my time
(Everybody sing) Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
I keep on going guess I'll never know why
Life's been good to me so far baby
Inside the Sad Cafe

[Verse 1]
There are stars
In the Southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight
And moss in the trees

[Chorus]
Down the Seven Bridges Road

[Verse 2]
Now I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild
Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars

[Chorus]
Down the Seven Bridges Road

[Bridge]
There are stars in the Southern sky
And if ever you decide
You should go
There is a taste of thyme sweetened honey

[Chorus]
Down the Seven Bridges Road

[Verse]
Same dances in the same old shoes
Some habits that you just can't lose
There's no telling what a man might use
After the thrill is gone
The flame rises but it soon descends
Empty pages and a frozen pen
You're not quite lovers and you're not quite friends
After the thrill is gone, oh
After the thrill is gone
What can you do when your dreams come true
And it's not quite like you planned?
What have you done to be losing the one
You held it so tight in your hand well
Time passes and you must move on
Half the distance takes you twice as long
So you keep on singing for the sake of the song
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone

[Bridge]
You're afraid you might fall out of fashion
And you're feeling cold and small
Any kind of love without passion
That ain't no kind of loving at all, well

[Outro]
Same dances in the same old shoes
You get too careful with the steps you choose
You don't care about winning but you don't want to lose
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone, oh
After the thrill is gone

[Verse]
I wish you peace when the cold winds blow
Warmed by the fire's glow
I wish you comfort in the, the lonely time
And arms to hold you when you ache inside
I wish you hope when things are going bad
Kind words when times are sad
I wish you shelter from the, the raging wind
Cooling waters at the fever's end

[Chorus]
I wish you peace when times are hard
The light to guide you through the dark
And when storms are high and your, your dreams are low

I wish you the strength to let love grow on
I wish you the strength to let love flow

[Chorus]
I wish you peace when times are hard
The light to guide you through the dark
And when storms are high and your, your dreams are low
I wish you the strength to let love grow on
I wish you the strength to let love flow

[Verse 1]
One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
We're gonna find out, pretty mama
What turns on your lights
The full moon is calling, the fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers and moans
You got your demons and you got desires
Well, I got a few of my own

[Chorus]
Ooh, someone to be kind to
In between the dark and the light
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights

[Verse 2]
One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams, now
We're gonna find one
Oh, one that really screams
I've been searching for the daughter of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both
And I can feel her, but she's nowhere in sight

[Chorus]
Ooh, loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right (oh, oh, oh)
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
One of these nights
Mmm, in between the dark and the light
Comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
Get you, baby, one of these nights
One of these nights
Hoo, hoo-hoo
Hoo, hoo-hoo
One of these nights
I can feel you
I can feel
One of these nights
Comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you, now
One of these nights
And it gets so dark
So dark and cold and lonely
One of these nights
One of these crazy, crazy, crazy nights
One of these nights
Swear I'm gonna find you
Comin' right behind you, now
One of these nights
Hoo, hoohoooo
One of these nights
And I wanna say, ahhh
One of these nights
One of these, one of these
One of these nights
Comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
One of these nights
One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
One of these nights

[Verse 1]
She's one of a kind
Sometimes hard to find
Like a rainbow
Well, she's lost all her glory
And could tell you some stories
That we all should know

[Chorus]
And there's too many hands
Being laid on her
Too many eyes will never see
That it's dragging her down
But you won't hear a sound as
She turns around

[Verse 2]
Her beauty all aflight
It always seems to turn the tide
At midnight
And for her there is no rest
We are doing what is best
For our future
One of these days she may not
Be so good to you
One of these days she might
Shake you to the ground
But her fire is still
Burning
And her heart is still yearning
To be found

[Chorus]
And there's too many hands
Being laid on her
Too many eyes will never see
That it's dragging her down
But you won't hear a sound as
She turns around

[Outro]
Too many hands

[Verse 1]
City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style

[Verse 2]
Late at night, a big, old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has it's price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

[Verse 3]
So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
She is headed for the cheatin' side of town

[Chorus]
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

[Verse 4]
On the other side of town, a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night, anticipating
Because he makes her feel the way she used to feel

[Verse 5]
She rushes to his arms, they fall together
She whispers that it's only for a while
She swears that, soon, she'll be comin' back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

[Chorus]
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

[Verse 6]
She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night, it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry

[Verse 7]
She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool

[Verse 8]
My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things?
You're still the same old girl you used to be

[Chorus]
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

[Outro]
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
Honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyes

[Verse 1]
All alone at the end of the evening
When the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
Loved me and I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer
(Spent my life running 'round)
And it's so hard to change
(Can't seem to settle down)
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same

[Chorus]
So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

[Verse 2]
You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
And when you're looking for your freedom
(Nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door
(Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back, you're running back
You're coming back for more

[Chorus]
So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

[Outro]
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit (Wee-ee)
Take it to the limit (C'mon)
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit (Wee-ee)
Take it to the limit (You gotta)
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit (Wee-ee)
Take it to the limit (Come on and)
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit (Ah-ah)
Take it to the limit (Ah-ah)
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit

[Verse]
Visions, that you stir in my soul
Visions, that will never grow old
Sweet baby, i had some visions of you
If i can't have it all, just a taste will do
Go ahead and live all your fantasies
(Don't you ever think about the other side?)
Helps you get from where you are
To where you want to be
(You and me ought to be taking a ride)
You do the best you can
And you make your mistakes
(If you don't like it, you can say that you tried)
Because all i have to give is whatever it takes
Play on, el chingadero, play on
Play on, el chingadero
Dance, angel, dance until you wear out your blues
(Only thing that's gonna save you now)
Take another chance, you got nothing to lose
(The boy didn't love you anyhow)
Girl, you drive me wild when you do what you do
(Something makes me want to take you down)
If i can't have it all, just a taste will do
Just a taste of you

[Verse 1]
In the land of the broken hearted
People looking
For the horseshoe man
They've been
Picking up little pieces
They've been
Putting them all in his hand
And the way the story started
Two lovers long ago
Took a vow to live with heartbreak
Took a chance
But how could they know

[Chorus]
...love?
How could they know love?
Love
How could they know love?

[Verse 2]
Horseshoe man's
Been working his magic
Fixing heartbreak everywhere
He's the one we all can count on
When we're lost
And don't know where love is
He takes the pieces in his hands
And shakes 'em up
Like he doesn't care
He says that there
Will always be heartbreak
Because love is everywhere

[Chorus]

[Chorus 1]
When the red sun sets
On the railroad town
And the bars begin to laugh
With a happy sound
I'll still be here
Right by your side
There'll not be anyone
In my heart but you

[Chorus 2]
And the dreams that you're having
They won't let you down
If you just follow on
Cause you know
Where you're bound
The well will be flowing
And the words will come fast
When the one who is coming
Arrives here at last

[Verse]
On the grassy hills
Of the railroad town
Where we cut through the fences
And over the crown
Where wind was blowing
Right through your hair
I dreamt that my Momma
And Daddy were there

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
Understand this, I'm not looking for true love tonight
If you wanna be my little baby
You can meet me in the pale moonlight
I been workin' every day 8 to 9 and
Serving Coke and fries at the movie blue drive-in
If you want me, you know where to find me

[Chorus]
I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

[Verse 2]
Understand this, I been likin' you since I was small
I don't wanna get you runnin' scared
When there's no pressure there at all
I been workin' 8 to 9 every day
And think about you almost all the time, all the time and
If I wanna see you, I drive by

[Chorus]
I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

[Bridge]
I'm the sweetest girl in town so why are you so mean?
When you gonna ditch that stupid **** you got?
It's me you should be seein'

[Verse 3]
Hello-o-o you are lookin' so fine, so fine
Fantasy about you's like a gold mine, gold mine
Askin' everybody, "Is he mine? Is he mine?"
Not quite yet, but I'm gonna get-get him
Not quite yet, but I'm gonna get-get him

[Chorus]
I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

[Verse]
Trippin' down that old Hippie Highway
Got to thinkin' 'bout you again
Wonderin' how it really was for you
And how it happened in the end
But I guess I'll never know the truth
If you were really all alone

We were just a couple'a kids then
Livin' each and every day
When we both went down to register
We were laughin' all the way
That's when we named it The Hippie Highway
I still call it that today

Roger and out good buddy
I still call it that today
Two Camaros racing down the road
Feels just like yesterday
Roger and out good buddy
I feel you in the air today
I know you gave for your country
I feel you in the air today
Roger and out good buddy

[Verse]
O beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea!

[Interlude: Stacey Dash]
Be without fear in the face of your enemies. Be brave and upright, that God may love thee. Speak the truth, even if it leads to your death. Safeguard the helpless and do no wrong. This is your oath.

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Said how's it feel? Can you feel it?

[Verse 1]
Uh, polo pajamas; I think I made it
I showed my mom my first million; she damn near fainted
The rich and famous, so nice to make your acquaintance
The legends put out their latest, I feel that it sound outdated
I'm the hardest workin' person in the universe
Temptation, victim to the church of Lucifer
Internet rappers ain't shit when no computers work
You spent your whole advance on two chains and a Gucci verse
(A Gucci verse?) I'm the greatest, admit it, I'm the greatest
And I don't hold a grudge against anybody who hate it
I'm underrated, don't fit on nobody's playlist
If I ain't in your top ten, then you a racist
Cocaine ether creates a strange creature
They wasn't hearin' me 'til I fucked with a Brainfeeder
I'm still playin' it out the same speakers
I did it all without a Drake feature

[Chorus]
So many things that I've created
But this right here might be my favorite
They ask me how I feel, I say, "Amazin'"
I feel amazin'
So many things that I've created
But this right here might be my favorite

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Brand-new home, I think I made it
Key to the city, I keep to open the gates wit'
A briefcase with a million under the pavement
That's just on some rainy day shit, yeah
The kids gettin' murdered that I grew up wit'
They shootin' up, doin' drugs or they doin' nothin'
My girl's parents still livin' out in the hood
I come through in that new Bimmer like the shit all good, damn
I'm just a human; let me make mistakes
Shit has changed, ain't little Malcolm with the baby face
Even my homies tell me, "Take a break"
They know it ain't their place, and this a day I hate to waste
Tryna be a legend by tomorrow
They say I can't, I'm determined to prove 'em wrong though
I'm not perfect, but they ain't either
I did it all without a Jay feature

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Supercollider
Dust in a moment
Particles scatter
Coming up from the soup
Swimming upstream
Before the heavens crack open
Thin pixelations
Coming up from the dust
In a blue light
In a green light
In a half-life
In an arc light
I'm a B-spin
Flip-flopping
I'm a pulse wave
Outstepping

[Chorus]
I put the shadows back into their boxes

[Verse 2]
I am open
I am welcome
For a fraction
Of a second
I have jettisoned (Supercollider)
My illusions (Dust in a moment)
I have dislodged (Particles scatter)
My depressions (Parting out from the soup)

[Chorus]
I put the shadows back into their boxes
I put the shadows back into their boxes

[Outro]
I see angels hanging over the balcony
I see angels hanging over the balcony
I see angels hanging over the balcony

[Intro]
If you don't know what a homie lover friend is
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Uh, homie lover friend is what I'm looking for
A girl who can connect with the things I got in store
She can even kick back with the homies
Playing spades, macking aces and getting paid
Too much make-up is not her style
'Cause when it comes to parties you know she gets buck wild
Uh, shaking that rumpy thing
Girl, you make me wanna do some things
Like step up on you and freak you with the digits
9-5-5 bone and baby, gets with it
So I send a shout out to you
Thanks for being, my homie lover friend

[Chorus]
(Here we go, my friend)
A homie lover friend
(Here we go, my friend)

A homie lover friend
(Now here we go, my friend)
A homie lover friend
(Here we go, my friend)
Homie lover friend

[Verse 2]
Yeah, someone who can relate to my sex drive
Cuff her booty while we dance and she don't mind
And picking her up is obsolete
Because I see her at the club by laying her G
She could turn a man into a mouse in a minute
Snapping her fingers up and down and you cool with it
Walking away, humming her favorite song
Huh, ain't nothing but the rent going on
Yeah, a lil' sassy but still cute
Ain't nothing but the rent, you speak the true
She says the type of things I like to hear a homie say
Like, "Damn R, those rims on ya Benz is straight", my homie

[Chorus]
(Here we go, my friend)
A homie lover friend
(Here we go, my friend)
A homie lover friend

(Now here we go, my friend)
Homie lover friend
(Here we go, my friend)
A homie lover friend

[Verse 3]
Yeah, uh, a homie lover friend is something inexpensive
You pay your way, I pay my way
Don't mind kicking it with the homies when we hit the show
Or flex a cooler while chilling on a porno
Her ex wants to go strolling
Huh, but she pages me to go bowling, uh
But not quite the kind of balls that ya thinking
Uh, but the kind that be swinging and swinging and swinging
Don't mind looking ugly when it's time to
Call me yummy yummy yummy, yelling, "It feels good"
So if you see me push up on me
And let me know you wanna be my homie, lover friend

[Chorus]
(Here we go, my friend)
A homie lover friend, uh, uh
(Here we go, my friend)
A homie lover friend

(Now here we go, my friend)
A homie lover friend, yeah
(Here we go, my friend)
A homie lover friend

[Verse 4]
Now, if you're a homie lover friend and you're out there
Just throw your hands in the air like your don't care
And let me know I got the right one, baby
To gimme the chance to say I love you (sweet Sadie)
Now watch my car, here's the keys
While I got my ball on, taking straight G's, uh
But some think I'm wet
But homie girlfriend be tempting me to bet
And so I sniggle as I reach into the pocket of my shorts
Showing straight cash as I watch 'em clear the court
Rolling away counting ends
On my way to Sizzler's, with my homie lover friend

[Chorus]
(Here we go, my friend)
A homie lover friend, uh
(Here we go, my friend)
A homie lover friend
(Now here we go, my friend)

A homie lover friend, yeah, now smooth it out now
(Here we go, my friend)
Homie lover friend

[Bridge]
(Yeah, now smooth it out now)
Said I need someone to satisfy my every need
Homie lover friend, oh-ooh
Said I need someone to satisfy my every need
Homie lover friend, homie lover friend
Break it down...

[Outro]
(Here we go, my friend)

[Verse 1]
Jimmy was your sweetie pie
Your precious one
And I knew you used to love
The very ground he walked upon
One day, Jim's papa told him
Things were looking down
And they packed up everything
They owned and left this little old town
Each tear I dried for you
The closer our lives grew
I fell in love it's true
And you say you love me, too

[Chorus]
Well, don't you know I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved him?
Ooh,Baby I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved him?
Oh baby
But, baby I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved him?
Oh baby I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved Jim?

[Verse 2]
The day you see his face again
Or hear his voice
I don't want to be a loser
If you have to make a choice
Like a puppet to a string
To you, girl, I'm attached
And I know I'd be in trouble
If he came and took you back
I feel so insecure
In my mind, I can picture
Losing you for sure
And the pain I can't endure

[Chorus]
Oh baby I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved him?
Oh baby I'm wondering
Sure enough, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved Jim?
Ooh Baby

[Verse 3]
I can't stop loving you, baby
I can't stop loving you , no
I can't stop loving you, baby
I feel so insecure
In my mind, I
Can picture
Losing you for sure
And the pain I can't endure
Baby, I'm worried
Really, really worried
I wanna make you happy
Really truly happy

[Chorus]
Oh baby I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved him?
Oh baby I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering

[Verse]
Feeble is the mind that says they don't care
Selfish is the heart that won't give their share
Poor them, Poor we
Wasted is the mind that won't take a stand
Lieth the tongue that says they can't when they can
Poor him, Poor she
For as long as we live
And are blessed with air on earth to breathe
We all should live to keep our love alive
More than blinds the soul that sees but won't show
Lost the leader with the way but won't go
For you, For me
Worthless is the one with will but won't try
Grounded are we all if we don't think high
Of you, You of me
For as long as we live
And are blessed with air on earth to breathe
We all should live to keep our love alive
Let's keep our love alive
For as long as I live
And am blessed with air on earth to breathe
I know I'll live to keep our love alive

[Verse 1]
Give me a chance to catch my breath
Because I'm in a state of awe
Guess miracles do never cease
For we're back together now
Pardon me please if I pinch myself
So to know this is not a dream
As I reminisce the love e shared
And the pain there was between

[Chorus]
Look at the clouds in the sky
They seem so happy now
Look at the sun, feel its rays
With such a smiling face
Maybe we can't but maybe we can
With the love that we're feeling inside
Share it with all the world and see each heart
Kiss lonely good-bye

[Verse 2]
If given a chance to live again
I'd change not a single thing
Because that little chance could sadly mean
That you to me faith wouldn't bring
Partly I cry for those lonely nights
And a heartache I thought couldn't end
Yet joyfully I cry because I know our love
We won't let us lose again, never again

[Chorus]
Look at the clouds in the sky
They seem so happy now
Look at the sun, feel its rays
With such a smiling face
Maybe we can't but maybe we can
With the love that we're feeling inside
Share it with all the world and see each heart
Kiss lonely good-bye

[Outro]
Look at the clouds in the sky
They seem so happy now
Look at the sun, feel its rays
With such a smiling face
Maybe we can't but maybe we can
With the love that we're feeling inside
Share it with all the world and see each heart 

[x2]
Share it with all the world and see each heart kiss lonely good-bye 

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Something deep inside of me
Keeps me moving aimlessly
Always been, always be
A lonely travelin' man
Something that I can't explain
Holding me from wind and rain
Wild and free and hard to tame
A lonely travelin' man

[Chorus]
Travelin' Man 

[x2]
Got no goal got no plan
Just an old worn out heart in my hand
Travelin' Man 

[x2]
I'll get there anyway I can
I'm just an uninspiring tired out travelin' man

[Verse 2]
Please don't ask me where I've been
I've been alone through thick and thin
On the outside looking in
A lonely travelin' man
Something that I haven't found
Keeps me seeking all around
Moving on from town to town
A lonely travelin' man

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 1]
Baby, I knew at once that you were meant for me
Deep in my soul I know that I'm your destiny
Though you're unsure why fight the tide
Don't think so much let your heart decide
Baby, I see your future and it's tied to mine
I look in your eyes and see you searching for a sign
But you'll never fall until you let go
Don't be so scared of what you don't know

[Chorus]
True to you heart, you must be true
To your heart that's when the
Heavens will part and baby, shower you
With my love. Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies
And when you're true to your heart
I know it's gonna lead you straight to me
(Got to be true to your heart)

[Verse 2]
Someone you know is on your side, can set you free
I can do that for you if you believe in me
Why second-guess what feels so right
Just trust your heart and you'll see the light

[Chorus]
True to you heart, you must be true
To your heart, that's when the
Heavens will part. And baby, shower you
With my love. Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies
And when you're true to your heart
I know it's gonna lead you straight to me
(Ya know it's true)
Your heart knows what's good for you
(Good for you)
Let your heart show you the way
(Ya know it's true)
It'll see you through
(Got to be true to your heart)

[Verse 3]
Girl, my heart is driving me to where you are
Well, you can take both hands off the wheel and still get far
Be swept away, enjoy the ride
You won't get lost with your heart to guide you

[Chorus]
True to you heart, you must be true
To your heart. That's when the
Heavens will part. And baby, shower you
With my love open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies
And when you're true to your heart
I know it's gonna lead you straight to me
True to you heart, you must be true to your heart
That's when the heavens will part
And baby, shower you with my love
Open your eyes
Your heart will tell you no lies
And when it's true to your heart
I know it's gonna lead you straight to me
(Got to be true to your heart)

[Outro]
When things are getting' crazy
And you don't know where to start
Keep on believin', baby
Just be true to your heart
When all the world around you
It seems to fall apart
Keep on believin', baby
Just be true to your heart

[Verse 1]
What's that you're doing?
Girl i like what you do to me
What's that you're doing?
Because it makes no kind of sense to me
You can make me feel so proud
You can make me holler ow!
Girl you make me want to dance and sing
My mind is blown and you're to blame
I say it's sunnin' when there's rain
I jump by leaps and bounds, just call my name
What's that you're saying?
Girl I like the way you talk to me
What's that you're saying?
Even if it's wrong girl i do agree
Girl you make me feel so small
Though i might stand six feet tall
What you've got cuts me right down to size
I'll be the last, you'll be the first
I'll do my best to quench your thirst
I'm the lucky one who keeps the prize

[Chorus]
Girl I like what you're doing, baby do it some more 

[x2]
Girl I like what you
Do to me, do to me, do it some more 

[x2]

[Verse 2]
What's that you're doing?
Girl i like what you do to me
What's that you're doing?
Because it makes no kind of sense to me
You can fill my appetite
Without me taking up a bite
Never knew that love could fill you up
You're much too good for me to pass
I'm for the taking, you just ask
We can make it stick with love and luck

[Chorus]
Girl I like what you're doing, baby do it some more 

[x2]
Girl I like what you
Do to me, do to me, do it some more
You know I like what you're doing
Girl I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more

[Verse 3]
What's that i'm feeling?
That sensation's such a mystery
I know what it's thrilling
And i hope this feeling lasts eternally
Girl you make me scream and shout
Tell me what it's all about
You make me give in without a fight
I don't have no words to say
You can fill it anyway
And everything you do will turn out alright

[Chorus]
Girl I like what you're doing, baby do it some more 

[x2]
She loves you yeah yeah yeah
She loves you yeah yeah yeah yeah

Little bit of Bakersfield

[Chorus]
I'm a honky tonk night time man
I can't stand no light
I'm a honky tonk night time man
I can't stand no light
I get my rest in the day time
Do my running around at night

[Verse]
I had the blues this morning
Had the blues all day today
I had the blues this morning
Had the blues all day today
Well I wish a tornado
Come and blow my blues away, away
That's what I said, take 'em away
And then my heart starts beating
When that sun starts sinking low
Well my heart starts beating
When that sun starts sinking low
When the shadows fall
I know its time for me to go

[Bridge]
Billy Powell on piano
Oh Barry, play me some dobro

[Chorus]
I'm a honky tonk night time man
I can't stand no light
I'm a honky tonk night time man
I can't stand no light
I get my rest in the day time
Do my running around at night

[Verse 1]
I used to live in a poor neighborhood
My friends and me we always had a time
Never had no money but we had it so good
Those days are gone and I wanna go back
So pure so simple
Never thought about it when you're young you don't care
You don't realize it 'till it's all behind
Take it for granted just not well

[Chorus]
Oh-oh It was pure and simple
I'll remember those days 'till the end
Oh-oh God knows it's simple
If I could live my life all over again
I'd keep it pure and simple

[Verse 2]
Those days are gone and I wanna go back
Got me a feeling I'm not alone
Wish I had a road so I could go back home

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Chorus 1]
Pretty Maui Mama
Lying over the water
With my sun in your eyes
When you hear the melody play
It changes every day
Oh, Hawaiian sunrise

[Verse]
Once when we were there
We had relaxing times
Thought we might settle down
But the music called me
And my friends have
Much to spread around
We moved from town to town
Hawaiian sunrise

[Chorus 2]
And in the morning when you rise
Will you look in my son's eyes?
I know you do

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Produced by Marvin Gaye]

[Verse 1]
Jesus called me collect last night
It took all of me not to answer
Daddy warned me the perils of playing
Hard to get with God as in standard
Flying high and fearless baby
I've kissed death a thousand times before

[Chorus]
Remember me for who I was not who I am
I'll pray you never understand this sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet November
Remember me for who I was not who I am
I'll pray you never understand this sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet November

[Bridge]
Take (take) time (time)
Flow (flow) shine (shine)
Brilliant (brilliant) light (light)
Angel (angel) fly (fly)

[Verse 2]
Heard you fucking with Tommy again
We both 'member where that landed you last time
That nigga don't really love you girl
He just beds you every night, it's his past-time
Blind eye and the fearless, darling
You two might just do it raw tonight
Heaven help if he leave you girl
I bet you bought two new thongs this time

[Chorus]
Remember me for who I was not who I am
I'll pray you never understand this sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet November
Remember me for who I was not who I am
I'll pray you never understand this sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet November

[Outro]
Hurts right, broken stride

[Verse 1]
Since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell
Down at the end of lonely
Street at Heartbreak Hotel

[Chorus]
I get so lonely 

[3x] baby
I could die

[Verse 2]
Though the place is crowded
You still can find some room
Where those broken hearted
Lovers cry away their blues

[Chorus]
I get so lonely baby
I get so lonely, I get so lonely I could die 

[3x]

Eww eww eww
Eww eww eww (Thugger)
I'm high right now, I'm high right now

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
What you gonna do when I pull up on you, nigga?
(I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)
Pussy nigga know that he a cat like Tigger
(For sure, for sure)
Beat the pussy nigga with the baseball bat
Pull up with them F&Ns comin' out the hatch
Pussy mothafucka scared to say it to my front
So I'm blowin' out his back
Point it at his liver, make the nigga reconsider
Bands in my pants got me lookin' a little bigger
Red just like Elmo but I never fuckin' giggle
You can suck my pickle for a nickel

[Hook: Young Thug]
Eww eww eww
Eww eww eww, eww

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
How many niggas standin' around you would die for you?
I’m not bein' funny but if I come through there sprayin'
All them niggas turn to 4 wheelers
Honestly, truth be told, YSL won't fold
Pick his ass off from the balcony
Walk into the house and change clothes
YSL, wipe a nigga nose
We don't give a damn if it's indoors or outdoors
We gotta have that, gon' grab that
Nigga go stab that, smack that shit
Every day I keep the bands on me, I'm a lick
If a nigga think I'm sweet then his tongue gettin' split
I ain't doin' any features unless you give me your bitch
I'ma fuck for the cash then she gettin' robbed by Tick

[Hook: Young Thug]
Eww eww eww
Eww eww eww, eww

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Hundred bands inside of my pants
Make the mothafucka dance on the stage
Aye, bitch, it's a parade
Pourin' 4s is a sport, Leanorade
50 whole k spent on my hygiene
Drinkin' so much lean that my pee clean
808 just might be the dream team
Bitch got some good brain, call her Pinky
Bag full of weed, no lighter
In the kitchen wrappin', rappin' like a cypher
You know damn well, I like her, I'mma bite her
In a Bentley on West Lee gettin' trailed by sniper
How the fuck you feel that I don't mean nothin'?
All them years in the bando, no clean nothin'
Runnin' to the cops, tell 'em I don't serve the fiend nothin'
Pullin' off like "SIKE!"
Bitch I got the bando, fifty hundreds
Spot 'round the corner filled up with onions
Big homie got a whole truckload
Me and Scooter take a trip to New Mexico
All I ever wanted was the money
All I ever wanted was the money
Put your hands in the air if you dare
Any motherfucker to step over here
F&N put 'em in a wheel chair

[Hook: Young Thug]
Eww eww eww
Eww eww eww, eww

YSL clearing out the whole little place
Make a pussy nigga turn Christian like Ma$e
Gold bottles, Ace of Spades, looking like a vase

Your daddy is rich, mama
You're overdue
Now I ain't the one, baby
Been messing with you

[Chorus]
Got bells in your mind, lady
And it's easy to see
I think it's time for me to move along
I do believe
Ah you're tryin' to put a hook in me, baby
Oh no

[Verse 2]
Now you're talking jive, woman
When you say to me
That your daddy's gonna take us in, baby
Take care of me
You know and I know, woman
I ain't the one
I never hurt you, sweetheart
I never pulled my gun

[Chorus]
Got bells in your mind, mama
And it's easy to see
I think it's time for me to move along
I do believe
Time for me to put my boots out in the street, missy
Are you ready boots, walk on

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well now, all right there missy, let me tell you a thing or two
Now you're talking jive, woman
When you say to me
That your daddy's gonna take us in baby
Take care of me
When you know and I know, woman
I ain't the one
I never hurt you sweet heart
I never pulled my gun

[Chorus]
Got bells in your mind, mama
And it's easy to see
I think it's time for me to move along
I do believe
I must be in the middle of some kind of conspiracy

[Verse 1]
Ain't no need to worry
There ain't no use to cry
'Cause I'll be coming home soon
To keep you satisfied
You know I get so lonely
That I feel I can't go on
And it feels so good inside, babe
Just to call you on the telephone
And I said

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, I love you
What more can I say
Ooh baby, I need you
I miss you more everyday

[Verse 2]
I woke up early this morning
And the sun came shining down
And it found me wishin' and a-hopin'
Mama, you could be around
Well you know that I need you
More than the air I breathe
And I guess I'm just trying to tell you woman
Oh, what you mean to me, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, I love you
What more can I say
Ooh baby, I need you
I miss you more everyday
What I say

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
I'm tryin' to tell you I love you
In each and every way
I'm tryin' to tell you I need you
Much more than just a piece of leg

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, I love you
What more can I say
Ooh baby I need you
I miss you more every day

Ooh baby I love, love, love, love you
What more can I say
Ooh baby I need your sweet lovin'
I miss you more, more every day yeah
Ooh baby I love you
Baby I need you

[Verse 1]
Train roll on
On down the line, won't you
Please take me far away?

Now I feel the wind blow
Outside my door, it means I'm
I'm leavin' my woman
At home
Lord and

[Chorus]
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind again

[Verse 2]
And I don't know
Oh where I'm goin'
I just want to be
Left alone
Well, when this train ends
I'll try again, alright
I'm leavin' my woman
At home
Lord and

[Chorus]
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on, Tuesday's gone

[Piano and Guitar Solos]

[Verse 3]
Train roll on
A-many miles from my home, see I'm
I'm ridin' my blues away, yeah

Tuesday, you see
She had to be free, lord but
Somehow I've got to
Carry on
Lord and

[Chorus]
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind, whoa
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on

[Outro]
Roll on
'Cause my baby's gone
I'm riding my blues, babe
Tryin' to ride my blues
Ride on train, ride on train
Ride my blues babe
Goodbye to you, babe
Goodbye to you yeah
Oh train

[Verse 1]
I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you-know-who
He said, "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow
What you trying to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you"
I said, "Excuse me"

[Verse 2]
I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, and mean, and
Big and bad, Lord, a-pointing that gun at me
"Oh wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble with you
And I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you"

[Chorus]
"Oh won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see-a me no more
For sure"

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you, son, well, it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well he turned and there screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door

[Chorus]
"Oh won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see-a me no more
Show me the back door"

[Verse 1]
Well everytime that I come home nobody wants to let me be
It seems that all the friends I've got just got to come interrogate me
Well, I appreciate your feelings and I don't want to pass you by
But I don't ask you about your business, don't ask me about mine

[Verse 2]
Well its true I love the money and I love my brand new car
I like drinking the best of whiskey and playing in a honky tonk bar
But when I come off the road, well I just got to have my time
'Cause I got to find a break in this action, else I'm going to lose my mind

[Chorus]
So don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye, that's right

[Verse 3]
Well, "What's your favorite color?" and "Do you dig the Brothers?" is driving me up a wall
And every time I think I can sleep, some fool has got to call
Well don't you think that when I come home, I just want a little peace of mind
If you want to talk about the business buddy, you're just wasting time

[Chorus]
So don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye

[Outro]
I said don't ask no stupid questions
And I won't send you away
If you want to talk fishing
Well I guess that'll be okay

[Chorus]
Well, have you ever lived down in the ghetto?
Have you ever felt that cold wind blow?
Well if you don't know what I mean
Won't you stand up and scream
Because there's things going on that you don't know

[Verse 1]
Too many lives they've spent across the ocean
Too much money been spent upon the moon
Well, until they make it right
I hope they never sleep at night
They better make some changes and do it soon
Do it now, do it to it

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well they're going ruin the air that we breathe
Lord have mercy
They're gonna ruin us all, by and by
I'm telling all you beware
I don't think they really care
I think they just sit up there
And just get high

[Chorus]
Have you ever lived down in that ghetto?
And have you ever felt that cold wind blow?
Well if you don't know what I mean
Won't you stand up and scream
'Cause there's things going on that you don't know

Well if you don't know what I mean
Won't you stand up and scream
'Cause there's things going on that you don't know

[Outro]
Tell it
Tell it, tell it
Things going on

[Verse 1]
I've got my pistols in my pockets boys
I'm, I'm Alabama bound
I've got my pistols in my pocket boys
I, I'm Alabama bound
Well, I'm not looking for no trouble
But nobody dogs me around

[Verse 2]
Now when I'm going to fetch my woman, people, Tri-Cities here I come
Oh and I'm going to fetch my woman, people, Tri-Cities here I come
'Cause she was raised up on that cornbread
I know that woman give me some
Give me some baby

[Verse 3]
Oh when the kid hits Alabama, people
Don't you try to dog him around
Now when the kid hits Alabama, people
Don't you try to dog him around
'Cause if you people cause me trouble, Lord
I've got to put you in the ground

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 4]
Well, I was born in Mississippi
Baby, don't take any stuff from you
Oh I was born in Mississippi
And I don't take any stuff from you
And if I hit you on your head
Boy, its got to make it black and blue

[Verse 5]
Ah well I'm going to Alabama
Got my pistols out by my side
'Cause I ride to Alabama
With my pistols out by my side
'Cause down in Alabama
You can run, but you sure can't hide

[Verse 1]
Seven years of hard luck, coming down on me
From the Florida border, yes up to Nashville Tennessee
I worked in every joint you can name, mister every honky tonk
Along come Mr. Yankee Slicker, saying maybe you're what I want

[Chorus]
Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' For MCA

[Verse 2]
9000 dollars, that's all we could win
But we smiled at the Yankee Slicker with a big ol' Southern grin
They're gonna take me out to California gonna make me a superstar
Just pay me all my money, mister, maybe you won't get a scar

[Chorus]
Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' For MCA

[Electric Piano and Guitar solos]

[Verse 3]
Oh suckers took my money since I was seventeen
If it ain't no pencil pusher, then it got to be a honky tonk queen
But I'll sign my contract baby, and I want you people to know
That every penny that I make, I'm gonna see where my money goes

[Chorus]
Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' For MCA

[Verse 1]
Daddy was a Cajun, baby, raised on southern land
And so my kinfolks tell me, was a street-fighting man
Well, they rushed him down to see the doctor
Well the doctor just checked his head
The only thing that was wrong with him was Johnny Walker's Red
He drank ole poison whiskey
And it killed him dead
Aw yeah

[Verse 2]
Happened back in the bayou many years ago
Satan came to take him and he did it real slow
Well, they rushed him back to see the doctor
Well the doctor just shook his head
Twenty years of rotgut whiskey done killed this poor man dead
He drank ole poison whiskey
Till it killed him dead
You people hear what I said
Sweet guitar

[Guitar and Piano Solos]
Oh poison whiskey

[Verse 3]
Take a tip from me, people
Brothers can't you see
Ain't no future in ole poison whiskey
They're gonna rush you down to see that doctor
Well the doctor's gonna shake his head
The only thing he's gonna tell you baby
Stop drinking Johnny Walker's Red
Don't drink poison whiskey, don't you drink it boy

[Verse 1]
Well I've been riding a winning horse, for a long, long time
Sometimes I wonder, is this the end of the line
No one should take advantage, of who they are
No man has got it made
If he thinks he does, he's wrong

[Chorus]
Every mother's son, better hear what I say
Every mother's son, will rise and fall someday

[Verse 2]
I've seen it happen so many times, so many times before
Some man's got so much money, he doesn't worry no more
Or he's got such a pretty woman, that'll treat him fine
Well my friend has been a fool
It happens everytime

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm not trying to preach to no one, to no one at all
I've seen so many of my good friends, just rise to fall
'Cause they got so much money, or a woman so fine
Well my friends have all been fools, it happens every time

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
What I say

[Chorus]

[Outro]
What I say
Oh, every mother's son will rise and fall someday

[Verse 1]
I'm going down to the swamp
Gonna watch me a hound dog catch a 'coon
Well, I'm going down to the swamp
Going to watch me a hound dog catch a 'coon
You know the hound dog make-a music
On a summer night under a full moon

[Verse 2]
Lord, fetch my cane pole mama
Gonna catch a bream or maybe two
Lord, fetch my cane pole mama
Gonna catch a bream or maybe two
And when the hound dog start barking
Sounds like ol' Son House singing the blues

[Chorus]
Hound dog sing that
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music
When the hound dog starts singing
I ain't got them big ol' city blues

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, hey pretty mama
Lord, just take that city hike
Said go ahead pretty mama
Lord, just take your city hike
Well, I'd rather live with the hound dogs
For the rest of my natural born life

[Chorus]
Singing that
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music
Well, I'd rather live with the hound dogs
For the rest of my natural born life
Well, I'd wanna live with the hound dogs
For the rest of my natural born life

[Verse 1]
Thirty days, Lord and thirty nights
I'm coming home on an airplane flight
Mama waiting at the ticket line
Tell me son why do you stand there crying

[Chorus]
It was the needle and the spoon
And a trip to the moon
Took me away, took me away

[Verse 2]
I've been feeling so sick inside
Got to get better, lord before I die
Seven doctors couldn't help my head, they said
You better quit, son before you're dead

[Chorus]
Quit the needle. quit the spoon
Quit the trip to the moon
We're going to take you away. Lord, we going to take you away
It was the needle and the spoon

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
I've seen a lot of people who thought they were cool
But then again, Lord I've seen a lot of fools
Well, I hope you people, Lord can hear what I say
You'll have your chance to hit it some day

[Chorus]
Don't mess with the needle or a spoon
Or any trip to the moon
It'll take you away

[Outro]
Lord, they gonna bury you boy
Don't mess with the needle
Now I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

[Verse 1]
Call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
Well now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I don't carry me no load

[Verse 2]
Ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no changes in me
Well there ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no changes in me
And I ain't hidin' from nobody
Nobody's hidin' from me
Oh, that's the way its supposed to be

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Well I got that green light baby
I got to keep movin' on
Well I got that green light baby
I got to keep movin' on
Well I might go out to California
Might go down to Georgia
I don't know

[Piano solo]

[Verse 4]
Well I dig you Georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
Well now I dig you Georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
But I don't love me no one woman
So I can't stay in Georgia long

[Verse 1]
Well now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
Well now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I don't carry me no load

[Outro]
Oooh Mr. Breeze

[Verse 1]
Life is so strange when it's changing, yes indeed
Well I've seen the hard times and the pressure's been on me
But I keep on working like the working man do
And I've got my act together, going to walk all over you

[Chorus]
Gimme back my bullets
Put 'em back where they belong
Ain't fooling around cause I done had my fun
Ain't gonna see no more damage done
Gimme back my bullets

[Verse 2]
Sweet talking people done ran me out of town
And I drank enough whiskey to float a battleship around
But I'm leaving this game one step ahead of you
And you will not hear me cry because I do not sing the blues

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Been up and down since I turned seventeen
Well I've been on top, and then it seems I lost my dream
But I got it back, I'm feeling better everyday
Tell all those pencil pushers, better get out of my way

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
New York City is a thousand miles away
And if you ask me, I'll tell you that's okay
Now I'm not trying to put the big apple down
Because they don't need a man like me in town
I pick cotton down on the Dixie line
Work hard all day trying to make a dime
But that's all right, that's okay by me
Because that's the way that it was meant to be

[Chorus]
Big city, hard times don't bother me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be

[Verse 2]
I don't like smoke choking up my air
And some of those city folks well they don't care
I don't like cars buzzing around
I don't even want a piece of concrete in my town
I like sunshine, fresh clean air
Makes me feel like you wouldn't care but
That's all right, each to his own
But one smell from the city
And this country boy is gone

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well, I don't want to even read about it
Let me tell you something, let me tell you true
What's right for me might not be right for you
Well, you live your way, I'll live mine
And I hope that your happy all the time
I pick cotton down on the Dixie line
Work hard all day trying to make a dime
But that's all right, that's okay by me
Because that's the way that it was supposed to be

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let me tell you, I said

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ooh, that's my way, baby
I don't want you to even tell me about the big city
I don't want to read about it

[Verse 1]
I'd like to tell y'all a story
About a friend of mine
Who liked to drink good whiskey, oh Lord
And have a real good time
His woman, you know she left him
And stole that boy's brand new car
And ran out of town with a guitar picker
Said he gonna be a superstar
Sure you are

[Chorus]
You can't always trust your woman
You can't always trust your best friend
Beware of the ones that you need y'all
Because those might be the ones that do you in

[Verse 2]
Don't talk no stuff to no slicker
Don't tell your feelings to your friend
Don't tell your woman that you love her, because
That's when your trouble begins
There are many ladies here among us
That'll stab you in the back when you ain't around
There are many, so many of your very best friends
That'll kick you in the head when you are down
Yes they will

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't you backtalk the police
Because its his job to put you in the jail
They'll lock you up, boy and throw away the key
And your best friend won't even go your bail
There are many slickers here among us
That are all dressed up in suits and ties
But don't you show your pain, Lord in front of them
Because if you do you kiss yourself goodbye, alright

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Cheating woman make you crazy
Cheating woman make you a fool
She'll leave your heart so lonely
Brother there's nothing you can do
Well I can't stand the pain no more
She don't want my love for sure
She don't even want poor me
Knocking on her front door
Why did you make me love you sister
When you knew you was untrue
You loved every man with pants on
Yes a dozen to you is too few
I'm gonna shoot you and end your world
Then you won't bother poor me
You won't bother poor me no longer
Cheating woman - going to shoot you
Oh woman why you do me
Oh Lord the way you do
I done everything I can baby
Seems like nothing reaches you
I'm gonna get that pistol gal
I'm gonna shoot you and all your pals
You ain't going to bother poor me
You won't bother poor me no longer

[Verse 1]
Well, he walks so tall, to be so small
Never met a man who's stranger
He lives his life for a dollar sign
And to deal with him is dangerous
Well, he knocked me down but I'm on my feet
Now I'm so much wiser
I'd rather quit and go back home
Than to deal with the money miser

[Chorus]
Let's cry for this bad man
I sing a song for the bad man

[Verse 2]
Well, you treat me right baby, I'll treat you right
That's the way it's supposed to be
I put my faith down in my friend
And he almost put an end to me
Well I work seven days a week
Eight when I am able
When you take my money from me, you take food from my mama's table

[Chorus]
Let's cry for this bad man
I wrote a song for the bad man

[Bridge]
Oh baby you know who you are
Let's cry for this bad man
I wrote a song for the bad man, way down in Georgia

[Verse 3]
Well, you treat me right baby, I'll treat you right
That's the way it's supposed to be
I put my faith down in my friend
And he almost put an end to me
Well, when you take my money baby, when you hurt my family
It's like walking through the swamps without no shoes
Step on a snake, it scares you

[Chorus]
Let's cry for this bad man
I wrote a song for the bad man

[Chorus]
Let's cry for this bad man
I wrote a song for the bad man

[Outro]
Oh baby straight to you
He's so bad, so bad

[Verse 1]
Eleven times I been busted, eleven times I been to jail
Some of the times I been there, nobody could go my bail
Well it seems to me, Lord that, this ol' boy just don't fit
Well I can jump in a rosebush, and come out smelling like
Those misters dressed in blue, never done so right by me
Some of the times I was innocent, but the judge said guilty
I'm not one to complain, now son I tell you true
When the black cat cross your trail, Lord
It comes in misery; times two

[Chorus]
Double trouble; that's what my friends all call me
(Double trouble)
I said, double trouble
T-R-O-U-B-L-E

[Verse 2]
Well I was born down in the gutter
With a temper as hot as fire
Spent ninety days on a peat farm, just doing the county's time
Well now, even mama said, "Son you're bad news
And it won't be too long before someone puts one through you"

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Riding on a greyhound, counting those white lines
Destination I don't know and I'm feeling like I'm dying
Well ten years on this road, might've took its toll
But the man with the plan says the band has got to go

[Chorus]
I said roll gypsy roll
Lord, just pick up your bags and go

[Verse 2]
Met many a woman on my way down the line
Every woman that I met I left satisfied
I made lots of money, just how much I don't know
But most of the money, I done stuck up my nose

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Gypsy's life's a story and it's one that's never told
He's always hungry, he's always on the go
With no tomorrow, it's how it seems to be
When you're moving around, from town to town

[Outro]
Made lots of money, just how much I don't know
But most of the money, I done stuck up my nose
And maybe that's the reason I don't know where I'm going
I don't know oh

[Verse 1]
I recall when I used to come home, never had a dime
But, Lord, I always had a good time
And I recall drinking wine with one of my friends
Lord, I can't go back again

[Chorus]
Am I losin' my own way back home?
Am I losin' a good friend that I've known?
Am I losin', won't you tell me how I've sinned?
Why am I losin' one of my best friends?

[Verse 2]
And I recall this friend of mine I knew so well
It goes to show, Lord, you just can't tell
Now my friend won't talk to me, let me tell you why
He thinks I've changed because of a dollar sign

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And it's so strange when you get just a little money
Your so-called friends want to act just a little funny
Yes, they'll blame you
But I'm not the one that's here to blame
It's you, my friend, that's really changed
Its a shame, such a shame
Am I losin' once again?
Why these things happen, Lord, I don't understand
But, Lord, it can sure hurt a man
Why won't my friend take me as I am?
Because your friend, Lord, is the most important thing

[Chorus]

[Intro]
I asked the wiseman one sunny day
Can you help me find my way
You're so much older and wiser too
Would you help me mr wiseman
I'm feeling blue
Oh I'm not satisfied

[Verse 1]
He said you're not doing too bad, no not bad at all
You're just trying to walk son, before you can crawl
You got stacks of money to the sky up above
Now all you need is to find you a love

[Chorus]
He sent me searching to find my love
He sent me searching to the Lord up above
He sent me searching just to find the morning dove
And she'll tell you where to find your love
Oh mr wiseman, I need to find my love

[Verse 2]
You can have anything in this god's world
But you won't be happy son, 'til you find a girl
Now you can be happy boy, if you try
Find a woman son, and you'll be satisfied

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
Oh Lord, he sent me searching

[Verse 1]
I said baby mama, I don't know your name
But I said baby, sugar I can play your game
Every night when we leave the hall
I see you hanging around
You wanna ride in my big black car baby
Want to go uptown

[Chorus]
I know who you are baby
I know what they call you girl
Never put you down baby
I'm just like you baby, I'm on the hunt

[Verse 2]
I know lady
People going to talk about you and me
Let me say one thing mama, sugar I do as I please
And if you wanna love me baby, I'm your man
And all those high-faluting society people
I don't care if they don't understand

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
My daddy told me a long time ago
Said there's two things son
Two things you should know
And in these two things you must take pride
That's a horse and woman, yeah
Well both of them you ride

[Chorus]
Have you heard that rumor that's going around
My baby's got a man, Lord way across town
It's the same old story
Tell me where will it end
Yes I heard the news, it's the same old blues again

[Verse 1]
Well I wrote you a letter, must have read it wrong
Stood at the doorway, baby you was gone
Took a lot of courage
To let the telephone ring
I got the same old blues, same old blues again

[Chorus]

Well you gave me the business, though I didn't mind
Because I got a lot of patience, Lord got a lot of time
It's the same old story
Tell me where will it end
I got the same old blues, same old blues again
Here come my blues

[Verse 2]
Wanna find me a mountain, and I'm going to hide out
Ain't talking to you babe, Lord I ain't coming back
Well I heard that rumor, tell where will it end
I got the same old blues, same old blues again

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I got the blues... same old blues

[Verse 1]
I jumped off a boxcar down around Tennessee
I was cold, tired and dirty hungry as I could be
But I had my guitar and a hundred railroad songs
So I asked the policeman
Can I stay here long
He said Mr. Hobo you got to go now
We don't want you around
See I'm trying to build me a respectable town
And we don't need a hobo like you hagnin' around

[Verse 2]
So I left that town, Lord, had my guitar in my hand
Still cold and tired, kinda mad at the man
But this life that I chose to live, sometimes is strange
See I'm trying to learn about the old music from riding the train
I'm a hobo I know, but that's the price I pay
Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way
Catch me another train and this is what I'll say
Mr. Choo-choo train take me away

[Verse 3]
I'm going to ride this train Lord until I find out
What Jimmie Rodgers and the Hag was all about
See I play this rock n roll and I think that's fine
But I want to go back a little further in time
I'm a hobo I know but that's the price I pay
Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way
Catch me another train and this is what I'll say
Mr. Choo-choo train take me away

[Verse]
Well when I was a young-un they used to teach me to play music like this here
When I look in your face baby
When I look in your eyes
I can tell pretty mama I been wasting time
Cause you don't really love me
You just love me for what I am
But you best treat me right, woman
Gonna lose your money man
Well when I first met you baby, you was a red light girl
But I tried to take you to better world
But you would not listen
Still you think I am a fool
Well you had it made in the shade, baby
Don't let that tree fall down on you
Well I work the railroad each and every day
Well I work real hard trying to make my pay
Lord I never tell you what you supposed to say
Girl you had it made in the shade
Don't let that tree fall down on you

[Verse 1]
Well this life that I've lead has took me everywhere
There ain't no place I ain't never gone
But its kind of like the saying that you heard so many times
Well there just ain't no place like home
Did you ever see a she-gator protect her young
Or a fish in a river swimming free
Did you ever see the beauty of the hills of Carolina
Or the sweetness of the grass in Tennessee

[Chorus]
And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes

[Verse 2]
Do you like to see a mountain stream a-flowing
Do you like to see a youngun with his dog
Did you ever stop to think about, well, the air your breathing
Well you better listen to my song

[Chorus]
And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes

[Verse 3]
I'm not trying to put down no big cities
But the things they write about us is just a bore
Well you can take a boy out of ol' Dixieland
But you'll never take ol' Dixie from a boy

[Outro]
And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes
Because I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes

[Verse 1]
I'm headed down a highway, got my suitcase by my side
Blue skies hanging over my head, I got 500 miles to ride
I'm going down to Memphis town, to play a late night show
I hope the people are ready there, 'cause the boys are all ready to go

[Chorus]
Well, I'm a whiskey rock a' roller
That's what I am
Women, whiskey, and miles of traveling
Is all I understand

[Verse 2]
I was born a travellin' man and my feets do burn the ground
I don't care for fancy music, if your shoes can't shuffle around
I got a hundred women or more and there's no place I call home
The only time I'm satisfied, is when I'm on the road

[Chorus]
Well, I'm a whiskey rock a' roller
That's what I am
Women, whiskey, and miles of traveling
Is all I understand
Sometimes I wonder, where we go

[Verse 3]
Lord don't you take my whiskey; and rock n roll
Take me down to Memphis town, busdriver get me there
I got me a queenie, she got long, brown, curly hair
She likes to drink Old Grandad and her shoes do shuffle around
And everytime I see that gal
Lord she wants to take me down

[Chorus]
Well, I'm a whiskey rock a' roller
That's what I am
Women, whiskey, and miles of traveling
Is all I understand
Sometimes I wonder, where will we go
Lord don't you take my whiskey; and rock n roll

[Verse]
Well, Billy Joe told me ,well everything's looking fine
He got the place all secure, got the icebox full of wine
He said, now hurry on all and don't be late
I got three lovely ladies who just won't wait
We'll do some down south juking, looking for some peace of mind
Now put your Sunday pants, lets get out on the road
We've been working all week and I think its time we let go
We got three fine mamas sitting all alone
Gonna sip our wine, gonna get it on
And do some down south juking, looking for some peace of mind
Well, come Monday morning we'll be headed out to the the field
We'll be doing everything for Papa and old Uncle Bill
Well, come Friday night we'll be headed to town
Trying to pick up any woman hanging around
And do some down south juking, looking for some peace of mind 

[x2]
And do some down south juking, looking for a peace of mind

[Verse]
Well, just keep on running mama, until you can't run no more
You know your sister told your mama 'bout the boy next door
Well, I see your sugar daddy comin' around the corner
I wonder if he knows your the preacher's daughter, oh no
Well, I seen you through your window, baby, many times before
Yeah there's a hundred different lovers knockin' on your back door
Well, I see your sugar daddy comin' around the corner
I wonder if he knows your the preacher's daughter, oh no
Well, keep on running mama, until you can't get no ?
You're just a no good woman lord, I ain't lying
Well, I see your sugar daddy comin' around the corner
I wonder if he knows your the preacher's daughter, oh no
And I'm talking about the preacher's daughter
Doing what she hadn't ought to
Getting on down
With every stud in town

[Verse]
White Dove sitting on a blackberry bush
Is there any questioning why
Tell me what heaven you're bound for today
Feel just like I could cry 

[x2]
Little squirrel sitting on a flat slanted rock
Wodering where the winter meal is coming from
Tired of fighting for it, gonna lay down my gun
Just know that my work is done 

[x2]
Little boy blue now come blow your horn
No more of the sheep is around
Said I'm tired of fighting, gonna lay down my gun
Just know that my work is done 

[x4]
How can you stand there smiling
After all you've done
You know it seems to make you happy
When you've hurt someone
Twice before you fooled me
With your deceiving and lying
Come in and close the door
One more time, one more time
Yeah you've been gone so long
No one knows where
And you say that you still love me
Then show me you care
Because you got what it takes, sweet mama
To make a man feel fine
So I'll take the word of a liar
One more time, one more time


Girl you've got me hungry
Losing my mind
I know I'm playing with fire
Get burned every time
Yes I'm a fool for you baby I can't deny
But I got to have your sweet love
One more time, one more time
Girl you've got me hungry
Losing my mind
I know I'm playing with fire
Get burned every time
Yes I'm a fool for you baby I can't deny
But I got to have your sweet love
One more time, one more time

Yes I'm her fool once more
I can read her brown eyes
But when the rooster crows tomorrow
Well its her turn to cry
I'm headed down that old road
She lost her free ride
So tonight I'll take what I paid for
One more time, one more time
One more time

[Verse 1]
Like a restless leaf in the autumn breeze
Once I was a tumbling weed
Like a rolling stone, cold and all alone
Living for the day my train would come
I never cared for school or any golden rules
Papa used to always say I was a useless fool
So I left my home to show them they was wrong
And headed out on the road singing my song
Then one sunny day. The man, he looked my way
And everything that I dreamed of, it was real
Money, girls and cars; and big long cigars
And I caught the first plane home so papa would see

[Chorus]
When I went home to show 'em they was wrong
All that I found was two tombstones
Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong
Oh, such a sad song
First I got lost, then I got found
But the ones that I love are in the ground
Papa I only wish you could see me now
Take a listen papa
Whoo, I learnt how to play my guitar
Gonna be a superstar

[Verse 2]
First I got lost, then I got found
The ones I love are in the ground
Won't you tell me please was I right or wrong
If there's any way you can hear what I say
Papa, I never meant to do you wrong
All the money, girls and cars. And all the words and all the cigars
Papa, I just want you to know they couldn't take your place

[Chorus]
When I went home to show 'em they was wrong
All that I found was two tombstones
Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong
Oh, such a sad song
First I got lost, then I got found
But the ones that I love are in the ground
Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong

[Verse]
Oh. Now when you think the times, babe
Take a look around
Because babies are dying from disease
Sleeping out on the ground
People never seen the tortured eyes
From a foreign land. No
When you see somebody who's down and out
Lend a helping hand
You better, lend a helping hand. If you can
Lend a helping hand
Do it if you can
Oh. Every time you feed your face
Do you bow your head
Hunger kills each and every day
Won't you share your bread
If you've ever felt the pain inside
I know you'd understand
When you see somebody who's down and out
Lend a helping hand
You better, lend a helping hand. If you can
Lend a helping hand
Do it if you can
Oh. Every time you feed that face
Do you look around
For somebody right in your own neighborhood
Sleeping out on the ground
And do some down south juking
If you've ever felt the pain inside
I know you'd understand
When you see somebody who's down and out
Lend a helping hand
Why don't you, lend a helping hand. If you can
Lend a helping hand
Won't you please lend a helping hand

[Verse 1]
Wino on the street. Drinking a bottle of booze
Ain't got nothing to say, yeah. And he don't got much to lose
Times are on his face. Blisters on his brain
Wonders who's at fault. Knows that he's to blame
Thinks back on his childhood and wonders the reasons why
Why some men have made it rich. Why some men have cried
Reached out his hand, lord. For a nickel or a dime
Livin' every day, yeah, for one more taste of wine

[Chorus]
Wino, soon you've got to choose
How long must you take abuse
Wino, you wasn't born to lose
Sweet wine is making you a fool

[Verse 2]
Wino on the street. Drinking a bottle of booze
Ain't got nothing to say, yeah. And he don't got much to lose
I want to help him out with his troubles and woes
I guess he's a happy young man. God in heaven only knows

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yonder come a man, now this I know
Now you better find some place to go
Yonder come a man to take you downtown
He don't want you hanging around

[Verse 1]
It's been so long since I've been gone
Another day might be too long for me
Traveling around I've had my fill
Of broken dreams and dirty deals
A concrete jungle surrounding me
Many nights I've slept out in the streets
I paid my dues and I changed my style
Seen hard times
All over now

[Chorus]
I want to come home
It's been so long since I've been away
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried
I'll be coming home soon to your love
To stay

[Verse 2]
I miss old friends that I once had
Times, they've changed and I'll be glad when I
Go home
I don't know why the thought came to me
But, why I'm here, I really can't see
And now

[Chorus]
I want to come home
It's been so long since I've been away
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried
I'll be coming home soon to your love

[Bridge]
To stay
Coming home to stay
Coming home to your love, mama
I've seen better days

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
I miss old friends that I once had
Times, they've changed and I'll be glad when I
Go home
I don't know why the thought came to me
But, why I'm here, I really can't see
And now

[Chorus]
I want to come home
It's been so long since I've been away
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried
I'll be coming home soon to your love

[Outro]
To stay
Coming home to stay
Coming home to your love, mama
I've seen better days

[Intro]
Yes sir

[Verse 1]
Well, the bigger the city, well, the brighter the lights
The bigger the dog, well, the harder the bite
I don't know where you been last night
But I think, mama, you ain't doin' right

[Chorus]
Say I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little about love
And baby, I can guess the rest

[Verse 2]
Well now I don't read that daily news
'Cause it ain't hard to figure where people get the blues
They can't dig what they can't use
If they stick to themselves they'd be much less abused

[Chorus]
Say I know a little
Lord, I do know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little about love
And baby, I can guess the rest

[Bridge]
Play me a little, oh yeah
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Well, if you want me to be your only man
Said listen up, mama, teach you all I can
Do right, baby, by your man
Don't worry, mama, teach you all I can

[Chorus]
Say I know a little
Lord, I know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little about love
And baby, I can guess the rest

[Outro]
Well, I know a little about love
Baby, I want your best

[Verse]
When the season is turning
And my day has gone by
And to see my reflection
See it in your eyes
Know the day that's come now has gone by
And if you look now quite closely
You feel the sun start to shine
And you know the day is longing
Longing just for you
The season that's come now is as fresh as you
And if you look now quite closely
You feel the sun start to shine
And you know the day is longing
Longing just for you
The season that's come now is as fresh as you

[Verse 1]
Well I've heard lots of people say
They're going to settle down
You don't see their faces
And they don't come around
Well I'm not that way
I got to move along
I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight

[Chorus]
You got that right
Said, you got that right
Sure got that right

[Verse 2]
Seems so long I been out on my own
Travel light and I'm always alone
Guess I was born with a travellin' bone
When my times up, I'll hold my own
You won't find me in an old folks home

[Chorus]
You got that right
Said you got that right
Well, you got that right
Sure got that right

[Bridge]
I tried everything in my life
Things I like I try 'em twice

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Travelling around the world, just singing my song
I got to go, Lord I can't stay long
Here comes that ol' travelling jones once again
I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Well, you can see her walking down on Peach tree Street
She got high-heeled shoes and a dot on her cheek
She's looking good, she's headed downtown
Ain't got no money, honey
She knows her way around
I think she's cute, think she's cute as she can be
Talking about a funny talking, honk-tonking Georgia Peach
Well these Georgia Peaches
Son they know their way around
They can take your money, son before you get sight of town
Well they talk a little funny, but they look so fine
Nine out of ten of them gonna sell you a dime
I think they're cute, think they're cute as they can be
Talking about a funny talking, honk-tonking Georgia Peach
Well, peaches, peaches. Love them Georgia Peaches 

[x2]
Well them Georgia Peaches
Sure do got the style
They'll steal your heart with a Southern smile
Well they talk a little funny, but they look so fine
The older they get, I swear its like good wine
I think they're cute, think they're cute as they can be
Talking about a funny talking, honk-tonking Georgia Peach 

[x2]
I just seem to fall in love with the wrong things

[Verse 1]
My daddy told me always be strong son
Don't you ever cry
You find the pretty girls and then you love them
Then you say goodbye

[Chorus]
I never dreamed that you would leave me
But now you're gone
I never dreamed that I would miss you
Woman won't you come back home

[Verse 2]
I never dreamed that you could hurt me
And leave me blue
I've had a thousand, maybe more
But never one like you

[Chorus]
I never dreamed I could feel so empty
But now I'm down
I never dreamed that I would beg you
Woman I need you now

[Verse 3]
It seems to me I took your love for granted
It feels to me that this time I was wrong, so wrong
Oh Lord how I feel so lonely
I say woman won't you come back home
I tried to do what my daddy taught me
But I think he knew
Someday that I would find one woman like you
I never dreamed that it could feel so good, Lord
That two could be one

[Chorus]
I never knew about sweet love
So woman won't you come back home
Oh baby won't you come back home

[Verse 1]
You got to love old Charlie Daniels
You got to cut the rug with Wet Willie too
And you got to be a fan of the Marshall Tucker Band
Before I'll sit down and have a drink with you
Yes, Bakersfield has got old Merle Haggard
He's a bad, bad boy, yes indeed
Nashville's got a million and one guitar pickers
But I guess my favorite would be the CDB

[Chorus]
Yes there's a few good rockers in New York City
Guess the big LA, it never cared for me
So won't you tell all them Hollyweird writer people
That it just don't make a damn
When you got good friends like me

[Verse 2]
Never dick on good old Waylon Jennings
Or Willie Nelson, Bob Wills or me
Well they're playing that good old country-western
You know this thing they call the Texas Swing

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Why are you praying, my sweet morning dove
You're so afraid, but so hungry for love
Well I can give you love baby
Hugs and kisses, I can give you everything that you been missing
Just don't be afraid, oh
Sweet little missy
She's twenty years old and a full grown woman
Sure enough
I'm the one that wants her
Are you ready for love
Well I'm the one that wants you forever and a day
Come on baby, what'd you say
Just don't be afraid, oh
Sweet little missy

[Chorus]
Sweet little missy
She's saving her love
But giving us hope like the Lord up above
This ain't the worst thing she'll ever do
Because like a dollar bill you can't take it with you

[Verse 2]
Well I'm the one that wants you forever and a day
Come on baby, what'd you say
Just don't be afraid, oh
Sweet little missy
She's so damn pretty, I can't take it no more
You and me babe, giving my soul for sure
Well I can give you love baby
Hugs and kisses, I can give you everything that you been missing
Just don't be afraid, oh
Sweet little missy

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Ain't no good life
Not the one that I lead
Because the more I fight the sadness, yeah
It only seems the more that I grieve
Well I look back on the good times
As some lost part of me
I want to know, tell me why is it so
Well just because I don't pray
Lord, that don't mean I ain't forgiven
Just because I'm alive
That don't mean I'm making a living
I'm going to get myself together
I'm going to try a dying attempt
Talking about the good times slipping by
Yeah I tell ya
I don't even know where last month went
Well I can't make no money baby
Well because my money's already spent
And I know where it went
I said it went on that damn rent
Well I don't mean change, baby
I mean folding money
Well I want loving, said I don't need a buddy
I don't need nobody, now

[Outro]
Ain't exactly my idea
Its sort of old, borrowed and blue
Just trying to say
Don't try that straight life buddy
Oh you'll find it kind of hard on you
Women, don't try to cook nothing up, ooh
Brother you know you'll only wind up in your own stew
Just don't let nobody tell you, oh what you oughta do

[Verse 1]
I was sitting at home all alone when I heard that telephone ring
And there on the line was a friend of mine saying he wasn't doing a thing
So I'm stepping out on the town tonight to party where the drinks are free
There's a sweet young thing ready and waiting on me

[Chorus]
Young and fine, strike you blind
Smokestack lightning make you lose your mind
She's got looks that kill can fire at will
Smokestack lightning she's all I need

[Verse 2]
When we got to the place I got me a taste
I knew she'd be good for a game
Dancing out on the floor she was ready for more
She knew all the boys by their names
I said hey sweet thing let me pull your string
Let me take you home
I woke up in a hour with my money and my memory gone

[Chorus]

Young and fine strike you blind smokestack lightning

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Are you a saint then don't be a stranger
Were you sent down from Heaven to show me the way
And if you ain't then I see a danger
You better take a minute and hear what I've got to say

[Chorus]
Because I'll keep on trying to put it straight to you
You better give it straight to me
Because most women seem to have a good time
Making a fool out of me
I'm keeping my faith I've made up my mind
I've got nothing left to lose just lay it on the line
I'm keeping my faith yea I'll find the one
Who won't steal me blind who won't turn and run
I'm keeping my faith I'm trusting in you
So don't treat me like those other ones do
Ain't no getting 'round it tell me to my face
Do you think I'm a fool for keeping my faith in you

[Verse 2]
I'll treat you right I'll do you better
I won't disappoint you I won't make you cry
My friends tell me if you let her
She'll empty your pockets she'll spend you dry

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse]
I'm the kind of man that loves all the girls
From debutantes to honky-tonk queens
I've tasted every brand all around the world
But all I see are peaches in my dreams
I'm talking about, I'm talking about them southern women
It's a well known fact across the Dixie line
And if a man don't agree I can tell you he's blind
They can drink with the best and the hell with the rest
And if she takes you home you ain't getting no rest

[Chorus]

[x2]
I'm talking about, I'm talking about them southern women
I'm talking about they'll love you so slow them southern women
Them southern girls
They look like angels on saturday night oh-lord they got a wild side
Take you places that you've never been make a man come back again
Talk about mama's southern belle little girl learned her lesson well
Ain't no others can cast a spell like the sweet southern women

[Outro]
They can make a man feel so proud they can capture him with a southern style
Little girl learned her lesson well ain't no others can cast a spell
Like the sweet southern women them southern girls

[Verse 1]
You got to lock your doors, keep the world out
We're closing ourselves in
If you watch the news it'll scare you to death
To Hell and back again
The only justice here's at the wrong end of a gun
Got the criminal making the laws got the good men on the run
I've seen enough
We don't own anything we've got we've giving it all away
But that don't make no sense to me you know who's gonna pay
It's the man in the factory working twelve hours a day
The woman working in the restaurant with another kid on the way

[Chorus]
Isn't anything in this life sacred anymore
We can't lose what we've got it's worth fighting for
I've seen enough, I've seen enough to make a grown man cry

[Verse 2]
A man's standing by the road a sign in his hand
He don't want your charity he says I ain't no begger man
All I need is a chance to get back on my feet
But we just pass him by well it could be you or me
I've seen enough
I ain't the kind to just sit back and watch the world go around
It's not too late to change let's turn this shit around

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
My baby came home late last night
I said girl I gotta talk to you
I've been drinking with the man next door
He said he's been singing with you
Whoever's telling lies it's time to say bye-bye
You know my mama didn't raise no fool

[Chorus]
You're going to walk out that door you'll never see me anymore
Tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm going to love ya' just one more time
I'd love to see what you've got
I don't care if it takes all night
Going to make you remember for the rest of your life oh baby
We had a good thing a good thing going
But ain't been seeing eye to eye
You had a good thing but it's all over
Might as well wave and say goodbye

[Verse 2]
It's easy to see the guilt in your eyes
Girl I want you to tell me the truth
Was he worth the risk and all the trouble he's caused
Now it comes down to me and you
You thought I was blind when you were gone all the time
Playing me for a fool

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We had a good thing going baby but it's all over

[Outro]
Good thing, good thing going

[Intro]
This song goes out to all the money men

[Bridge]
He drives around in a fancy car
Smokes those long cuban cigars
He don't know how to play guitar
He can't sing but still the pretty girls think he's a star

[Verse]
We play music got families to feed
Ain't good with numbers and he knows we can't read
If we get a dollar you know he gets three
It ain't hard to figure out it's as simple as can be
Don't ask me ask the money man
These boys are living in a fantasy land
I just keep 'em on the road so they can pay the money man
I'll be long gone before they understand
My promises are strong like a road made out of sand
I want to be your money man
My mortgage is picked up by the band
I want to be your money man
The boys, oh they're sleeping out in the van
Don't ask me ask the money man
You boys are living in fantasy land
You signed the dotted line I'm taking all I can
Your money's looking good in my retirement plan
That's just the way it is when your playing in a band
That's my money man down on his knees
He ain't praying but he damn sure ought to be
He's at a place where money doesn't grow on trees
And all his prison buddies doing more than shoot the breeze
How does it feel no money man
Not too good
What did you do with my money man
Well I a... Well a you know a
How does it feel to be a honey man
Are you sure that your still a man

[Outro]
Aw your dressed up like a little girl
Just shootin' the breeze down on your knees
Money man, oh money man

[Verse 1]
I snuck around the corner he had this guy down
I through the first punch that's when he hit the ground
To survive in the street you gotta win the first round
Because if you want eat you gotta be the baddest one around
I'm a backstreet crawler
Daddy paid for college I earned a degree
Got a job up on Wall Street
Where I learned to make the little man bleed
That's when I got stomped like a cattle stampede
Had a nervous breakdown all my friends and family left me

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler
When you see them on the concrete it's their spirit that's harder
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler
Where your ego meets defeat and your pride can't get no smaller
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler

[Verse 2]
I guess you might say it sure is a shame
I used to have everything oh how my life has changed
Yeah I'm broken and torn I've never been free
Lost everything that meant a thing to me

[Chorus]

[Intro]
There's a rumour going around on the backside of town
Jake is out to get some revenge
Has fire in his eyes since his brother died
Shot down by a so-called friend

[Verse 1]
For a fifty dollar gram is what the neighbors say
Drugs had control of his life
Caught up on crack you're trying to think back
The devil had him hooked you could see it in his eyes
It's a killer
There's a cold house at the corner of the street
The kids come and go there at night
Jerry drove up in front of the house
Somebody pulled out a knife
Jerry freaked out and went for his gun
Shot him right between the eyes
All he ever wanted was a twenty dollar high
But now he's locked up for the rest of his life

[Chorus]
It's a killer there's no way out baby once your in
It's a killer steal from your family
Then you'll turn on your friends
It's a killer It can happen to you

[Bridge]
So don't you never, never give in
It's a killer

[Verse 2]
The neighborhood I used to call home
These days it's looking like a war zone
Unemployment on the rise but the black market thrives
Money just keeps changing hands
The laws are getting tough sometimes it's not enough
To satisfy supply and demand
Trouble breaks out there's fighting in the streets
Bullets flying all around
An innocent child caught in the line of fire
All because there weren't enough drugs to go around

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Intro]
She'd wake us up early every morning
She'd help us say our prayers every night
She was always there to help us through the hard times
We could count on her to make everything alright

[Verse 1]
I remember swinging on the front porch
Papa said there's something I need to say tonight
Mama's been sick for a long time
Let's pray to God she can make it through the night

[Chorus]
Mama don't want to say goodbye
She said wipe those tears from your eyes
Mama I don't wanna say goodbye
It was written in the Heavens and the skies above
Son I gave you birth showed you all my love
I can't think of this life without you it's hard to try
Mama I'm afraid to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Now kids I've been hanging on a long time
I hate to leave this world before your grown
Remember everything that I've taught you
Remember all the good times when I'm gone

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
She whispered in my ear before she passed away
Son it's time to be a man ain't nothing left to say
Jesus walked on water I know it's true
When it comes time he'll call you home
I hope your ready too

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
It was a late night show in Georgia
We were on the 'ol highway
We know we've lost some friends
And family on the way
But you know we all feel better
And it makes it worth our time
To know our bus is rolling towards
That Mason-Dixon line

[Chorus]
Oh we can't seem to find the end of the road
Roots never grow on the seeds that we sow
We've still got our music and so many miles to go
You know we can't seem to find the end of the road

[Verse 2]
We know we've got a legacy that's hard to live up to
But there's still a lot of reasons
Why we play these songs for you
It's a family tradition and as long as we're around
That Freebird keeps on flying and it never will come down

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh we can't seem to find the end of the road
Roots never grow on the seeds that we sow
We can't seem to find the end of the road
No matter how far we travel it always seems to slow
We still got our music and so many miles to go
You know we can't seem to find Lord the end of the road
The end of the road

[Verse 1]
Every woman's out there looking for a rich man
And every man's out there looking for a perfect ten
Can't always get what you want sometimes
So your better off just taking what you can
Money won't make you happy baby
And a perfect woman son's gonna make you sad
If you think that's where it's at, then I'm telling you, your wrong
Cause you can have it all one day and then it's gone
You can search all of your life, and still not find
What you want, ain't what you've got

[Chorus]
Good loving so hard to find
Could this be the right place, at the right time
Good loving, feels so fine
I just can't get enough
Because good loving's hard to find,so hard to find

[Verse 2]
We all need good loving
Ain't talking about no one night stand
Some have the touch, and others just a hand
But when you find the right one then you'll understand
Can't always get what you want sometimes
So you're better off just taking what you can
You can search all of your life, and still not find
What you want ain't what you've got

[Chorus]
Good loving so hard to find
Could this be the right place at the right time
Good loving feels so fine
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

[Outro]
Some of that good good love

[x3]
Good loving
So hard to find
Good loving
Make you loose your mind
Good loving
Good good love
Good loving
Some of that loving baby

[Verse]
I met the man, when I was fifteen
Seen him in all the papers, on T.V. and magazines
So I had to ask him, what's the difference between
Those who make a wish, those who spin wheels
And those who ride in white limosines like you,mister
Won't you tell me one thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Some have the passion and they control the ride
Some settle for whatever happens
As years pass they see their lives just slip on by
The world keeps a' turning
It'll leave you behind
Nothing else matters, nothing's worth learning
Until the dream you have inside

[Chorus]
It's the one thing, the one thing there's no denying
So find yourself a dream and some piece of mind
'Cause money and power won't buy it
It's the one thing, nothing else matters

[Pre-Chorus]
And somewhere you might have heard the good times are through
And good luck is something you're born with
I know it just ain't true
The world keeps a' turning
I wouldn't tell you no lie
Nothing else matters, nothing's worth learning
Until the dream that you have inside

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Nothing else matters

[Verse 1]
What can they all be thinking
Wanna' take the cross off of the hill
Put away the pledge of allegience
Lord,just the thought gives me a chill
They can take God off our money but, in the end 'o ain't it funny
How were all gonna see him on the judgement day
So sing it loud

[Chorus]
One more time
Hear what you say
When you got the truth inside, now they can't take that away
One more time
'Cause it ain't too late
Hold on to what you believe because they can't take that
They can't take that away

[Verse 2]
They want to change something somewhere for everybody
Right now a change ain't what we need
Just like my father's father before him
They held on with pride to everything they believed
They can take God off our money but, in the end 'o ain't it funny
How were all gonna see him on the judgement day

[Chorus]

[Outro]
There's a fire that burns forever
Come a day we ain't gonna take no more

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I've got a saying in my life that's got me by so far
Well it mat not be right but, nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong
The first mistake is leave it up to somebody else
If you want something done you got to do it yourself
I'll do it myself before somebody makes a fool out of me

[Chorus]
Because nothing comes easy for a man like me
Everybody thinks the best things in life are free
If they would open their eyes it'd be so plain to see
That the best things in life don't come so easily

[Verse 2]
I met a man who thought just a little bit different from me
He said you got it so easy but I just had to disagree
It would have been alright but he pushed me too far
If your looking for trouble step outside of this bar
IF it comes down to fisting, mister that ain't nothing new to me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You'll find in this life if there's something that you believe
You got to get your hands dirty when it's something that you really need
If they ever give you something too easily
Can't be too good, 'cause nothing good's for free
Tell ya' straight from the heart a bed of roses it will never be

[Chorus]

[Verse]
There's a grey horse standing still
As a soldier climbs in the saddle for one last ride
The rain pours off his hat
You can see the shadows of the past written in his eyes
Now the cannons are silent
His friends are all gone, gotta put it all behind him
If he ever wants to find his way home
He's the last rebel on the road
Just a boy with his old guitar
Keeps to himself but everybody takes him wrong
But he carried on, got a dream that will never die
Can't change him
No use in staying where you don't belong
Now he's rolling down the highway
Gone too far too fast
No one will ever find him
He'll never look back

[Chorus]
Because he's the last rebel
And he's all alone, He's the last rebel
His friends are all gone
He's the last rebel, the last rebel on the road

[Bridge]
There'll never be another like him
He's the last of a dying breed
Ain't no use trying to change him

[Chorus]
Because he's the last rebel
And he's all alone, He's the last rebel
His friends are all gone
He's the last rebel, the last rebel on the road

[Verse 1]
Five a.m. in the morning, whiskey still running through my head
I could get out of bed and maybe I'll just have another cigarette
As long as I can remember seems all I've ever done is work
The boss is a jerk and I ain't paying the rent
Spent my whole life shovelin' dirt

[Chorus]
I'm going to get outta Hell in my Dodge
Can't take this anymore
Going to go downtown pick up my girl
There ain't nothing worth waiting for
Take the road less traveled
Spend my life behind the wheel
Gonna get outta Hell in my Dodge
Freedom made out of steel

[Verse 2]
There's a knock on the door from the Sheriff
Asking me where I was last night
Seems somebody looking a lot like me
Had taking up with his wife
He said son if I ever catch him
There's going to be some hell to pay
He'll be gone for good if I see him again
Because I just might blow him away

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
What's a poor man supposed to do
Stuck in the middle and trapped by the blues
Baby, I'm sick of these blues

[Chorus]
I'm going to get outta Hell in my Dodge
Can't take this anymore
Going to go downtown pick up my girl
There ain't nothing worth waiting for
Well I Don't care if I'm wrong or right
Gotta split this town tonight
Going to get outta Hell in my Dodge
Live my life behind the wheel
I'm Gonna get outta Hell in my Dodge
My freedom made out of steel

[Verse 1]
I don't read the paper, I don't watch the news
Life's good in this small town, population 62
Our bank ain't been held-up since 1932
Our doors are always unlocked
But not for long I'm telling you

[Chorus 1]
Because I know time's are gonna change
I know life will never be the same
I see please tell me it ain't so
They're all moving in surrounding me
No place left to go
My oh my you can kiss your freedom goodbye

[Verse 2]
Used to have a small town drugstore
Where old men liked to meet
That store's gone out of business
They're selling drugs out in the streets
The new kids like to spray paint
They've got a lot to say
Sure do have a way with words
Taught me a few today

[Chorus 2]
Because I know time's are gonna change
I know life will never be the same
I see small town folks like me
Are gonna have to change the way we do things cause eventually
My oh my you can kiss your freedom goodbye
Kiss it goodbye

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
There's a honky-tonk just south of Georgia
A little salvation just a' waiting for ya'
I heard it said a long time ago
If your looking for your soul
Down a dirt road just across the border

[Verse 1]
Well the harder it comes you know the easier it goes
If you can make your way a little further down that road, yea
When your caught up in between
Or just dying to be set free

[Chorus 2]
South of Heaven
Always ending up
No matter how I try
I'm just south of Heaven
Don't want to think you can have it all
Because all I need is just south of Heaven

[Verse 2]
There's a little girl they call the sweet thing
Been some time I'd like to tell you one thing
You have nothing left to lose
So by the time that you come to
You'll be one more calling her name

[Chorus 3]
Well the harder it comes you know the easier it goes
If you can make your way a little further down that road, yea
When your caught up in between
Or just dying to be set free

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
All I want, all I need, all I want
Is south of Heaven

[Verse 1]
Two young lovers meet and take each others hand
They say I do in the name of the Lord
Living as one giving all they can
Then the pressures come and a child is born
Young girl cradles the child in her arms
The man's home late and his day's too long
They're both unable to spend some time alone
That everybody needs to have
That's the thing that keeps love strong

[Chorus]
Love don't always come easy
And sometimes love it can hurt
Words don't always come easy
It's worth a try we're gonna make it work
Because love don't always come easy

[Verse 2]
Without warning many go a different way
And travel that road looking for someone
Their lives unravel a little more every day
This ain't no time to turn and run
It's a crime to throw it all away

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Rock down rock down peaces no more ohh

[Verse 1]
There's an old man sitting on a front porch now
Talking about how it used to be
When I was young I was a hell of a man
My father died when I was ten
I hit the road to find a job
Had to feed my family
Times were hard my hands are still scarred
From the life I've had to lead
I was born to run
Drove a tractor and trailer all my life
Six kids and a hell of a wife
Made lots of money it all slipped away
A large family that's the price you pay
I always dreamed never gave up
Son, even when times got tough
That's when I'd push it a little bit more
You should've heard that engine roar

[Chorus]
I was born to run
Can't slow down
No regrets, I've been blessed
Born to run
In time you'll see what the good Lord's done for me
Born to run
I can't slow down
No regrets, I did my best
Born to run
In time you'll see
What the good Lord's done, done for me

[Verse 2]
The old man, he passed away
And all he said never crossed my mind
Until I saw the price he payed
Was a lot like mine
I'm full and though it's miles away
Gotta hit the city right on time
And when I'm on I'll always sing little song of mine
I was born to run

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Well, there's a devil in the bottle, staring straight at me
Daring me to reach out, but I know he's testing me
If I take just one sip, I become that devil's son
Act a fool, sell my soul before God and everyone
Oh Lord, I know, I only hurt the ones I love
I'm walking down this dead end road, all alone and by myself
Wish I could blame the whiskey, but I can only blame myself
Running out of chances, and Lord that's such a crime
I got to find the answer before I lose my mind
Oh Lord its a crying shame, oh Lord I've caused so much pain
I only hurt the ones I love
There's a devil in a bottle that just won't let me be
So many times I've been hurting my soul and family
But I got free on the day I fought the
Devil in the bottle
The next time that ol' devil tries to get the best of me
I'll smash that bottle against the wall and know I'm finally free
There's a devil in a bottle that just won't let me be
There's so many times I let him hurt me
I got free the day I fought the
Devil in the bottle 

[3x]
Q: Within 30 seconds of you rapping how often do you mention bitches, clubs, expensive cars and booze?

A: nothing in the first 30 seconds, everyone knows you want to wait until the 45 second mark..dick. And I've never mentioned an expensive car in anything, for what it's worth. No, valid question. I make a product for a certain audience and I'm good at it. Supply and demand, simple economics. I don't do this because I love the attention, I do this because I have a certain skill set that now allows me to get paid without the threat of doing federal time

Q: Remember don't sign with Turtle, he'll only get the white record labels to sign you

A: Haha, I just saw that episode. Saigon played himself out in that role

Q: What's your view on music piracy?

A: Piracy is good for underground artists, thanks to google people search the fuck out of songs to find the original artist. You end up getting more exposure as a indie artist. At this point I'm just happy my music is getting out. My management hate the shit though and now that music is the product they see piracy as money out of our pockets. I focus on music, I let them stress legalities and royolaties

Q: How did you first release your music into the public sphere? How did you start to generate publicity for yourself? What advice would you give to people who are trying to pursue this same dream?

A: I just started doing a shit ton of collabos with other artist that already had established followings
A strong and constant internet presence, a street team out promoting shows and appearances, You have to have a team you trust, people that know their talents and understand your vision and your goals, people who let you focus on your talent, believe in you, and will call you on your bullshit in a minute

Q: How old are you and what crimes have you committed?

A: 19, I sold weed and pills until a year ago

[Verse 1]
There's a story to tell about days of old
A man and his gun, a street fighter I'm told
There's one in every town, tryin' to make himself a name
If he's quicker on the draw, comes glory and fame
They say he's always alone, he rides a horse with no name
His only friend was the devil by his side but it caused him so much pain
If his guns could talk, oh, the stories they would tell
Of all the men who tried and lost, all the ones he sent to hell

[Chorus]
They are outlaws, renegades, rebels on the run
They pay the price every day they live like the wrong end of a gun
Move around from town to town can't stay in any place to long
Outlaws, renegades... rebels on the run

[Verse 2]
Things haven't changed much these days
Faces are younger, but still they keep playing the deadliest game
Brothers and sisters, what are we fighting for
It's not for the fame or the glory anymore
I hear the mothers crying
Too many children dying
How many tears have to fall to bring this to an end

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
I can still remember I was eight years old
The first time that I picked her up little did I know
She's taken me to places that I've never been
Did my first gig in a rock-n-roll band

[Chorus]
Berneice, sweet Berneice

[Verse 2]
Get a real job let the guitar go
There ain't no future in this rock-n-roll
So go for your guitars, go for your guns
Better think twice it's three against one
Take your best shot it's a showdown now

[Chorus]
Berneice, sweet Berneice

[Verse 3]
A guitar woman needs a guitar man
One without the other, neither one of them can stand
Remember where we came from we can do it all again
So thanks to all you people, give youselves a hand

[Chorus]
Berneice, sweet Berneice

[Verse 1]
This is a story 'bout living
A tale of a long hard road
Ain't a whole lot of misgivings
Of the things that I thought I sowed
My daddy was a real hard worker
He said son there will come a day
Talk ain't always cheap
And here's what daddy had to say

[Chorus 1]
With these hands I've made my living
With these hands I've held a child
With these hands I've climbed a mountain
Sometimes we forget
We ain't much different at all

[Verse 2]
He likes grits, you like the apple
There ain't nothing wrong with that
He says y'all, you say you're
It all depends on where you're at
Well a little bit of music is a whole lot of fun
And its always good for the soul
From New York City out to California
You know its only rock and roll

[Chorus 2]
With these hands we come together
With these hands we can change the world
With these hands I play my music
Sometimes we forget
We ain't much different at all

[Verse 3]
Oh, not at all
So what I'm trying to tell you
Is that I'm only one son of the South
Its gonna take more than you me and you
To work this whole thing out

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
On a foggy road just before sunrise
Don't you lose control, you could lose your life
You keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes straight ahead
Don't forget what the good book says
You think it can never happen to you
But it happens all the time

[Chorus]
On a full moon night, something ain't right
Didn't see it 'til about midnight
When it happened it seemed kind of weird
Things like this seem to appear
From the shadows of a full moon night

[Verse 2]
Never had a clock that goes at night
That was the way of the simple life
Right down the road come a big surprise
Man shot his wife than took his own life
You think, it can never happen to you
But it happens all the time

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Intro]
Uhh Huh That's right

[Verse 1]
Missy was a real fine looker
Always had an eye for the boys
Man I always wanted to book that girl
Play around with some of her toys
I said, my my, oh can you look at them eyes
I said oh no Lord here we go
Don't you pretend you don't know
Bring it on
Yeah baby
Rumor says she from the bayou
Searching for her fortune and fame
Man she's got a way about her
She's driving all us poor boys insane

[Chorus]
I said, my my, oh can you look at them eyes
I said oh no Lord here we go
Don't you pretend you don't know
Bring it on
Give it to me baby
I've been waiting for it all night long
Bring it on
I know you got it in you to shake my sheets
To your rock n roll beat
Bring it on, you can bring it on

[Verse 2]
Just about the time I thought I had it made
I felt a slap on my shoulder
I turned around and had to stare up at him
He said little man you best think this over

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Way down yonder you can hear the wind blow
Through the tall grass growing in the old bayou
The old bayou
There's a dark haired woman that looks so fine
Wearing hand me down clothes, drinking homemade wine
No one ever knew who her daddy was
The people down here say it's all because

[Chorus]
She's the daughter of the devil, the sister of a snake
The keeper of souls down on Vodoo Lake

[Verse 2]
There's a city boy across the county line
Came looking for the legend of the girl so fine
Well the stories that he heard, well they had to be lies
But he found out different when he looked in her eyes
Well he tried to run away but she had control
He's finding out now what everybody knows
He knew it was over when she started to shake
Now there's one more soul down on Voodoo Lake
There's an eerie silence at the break of dawn
A chill in the air, something wrong
When a shadow crosses the ground
Those long lost souls never make a sound
You'd think by now they'd realize
She'll never break her bayou ties

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Voodoo Lake, Voodoo Lake
Daughter of the Devil, sister of a snake
Voodoo Lake
Down on Voodoo Lake, Down on Voodoo Lake
You can see her down on Voodoo Lake

[Verse 1]
You know I'm dirty because it's in me
Life's not easy
And it's the heart that I won't change
I wouldn't be the same
You see me one day and then the next day
I don't wanna play
I'm not the same dog you have known
It's not written in stone

[Chorus 1]
Well am I right or wrong
Looking out for number one
I never stay too long
I'm there and then I'm gone

[Chorus 2]
I'm not the preacher man
Oh can you understand
It's a game of win or lose
I've got an evil eye
You know sometimes I might lie
Oh I'm not the preacher man
Yeah-Yeah-Yeah

[Verse 2]
Saint was a sinner
Ain't he a winner
And did you hear him say
I didn't lie just as well
It's all in the head
Oh ain't it funny
How little money
Cheap talking honey
Can turn a sunny day to gray

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[x3]

[Outro]
Aah aah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Aah aah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

[Verse 1]
I've always lived my life like a gypsy
I can't imagine myself settling down
So please don't ask me to give up this life I lead
Cause I love to feel those wheels go 'round and 'round

[Chorus]
I can see it inside
It's my heart that sees, not my eyes
And if you listen close I'll tell you why
Home is where the heart is
And my heart is at home with you

[Verse 2]
There's a cold wind blowing and you know it's almost midnight
You never dreamed it would be this hard loving a music man
But this iron horse on which I ride I'm closer it's true
And it's just as hard for me as it is for you

[Chorus]
I can see it inside
It's my heart that sees, not my eyes
And if you listen close I'll tell you why
Home is where the heart is
And my heart is at home with you

[Verse 3]
In my life I'm always on the run
Living one day at a time
Hold on a little longer
I don't know where I'm gonna end up
Or where I'll go

[Chorus]
I can see it inside
It's my heart that sees, not my eyes
And if you listen close I'll tell you why
Home is where the heart is
And my heart is at home with you

[Chorus]
I can see it inside
It's my heart that sees, not my eyes
And if you listen close I'll tell you why
Home is where the heart is
And my heart is at home with you

[Outro]
Home is where the heart is
Oh ,my home is where my heart is

[x2]
I was born a travelin' man, that's all I'll ever be
Moving around from town to town is what makes me so free
My father was a trucker for the years of 23
And on the day that I was born his truck was left to me

I'm a travelin' man

Travelin' man
Travelin' man, that's what I am
Travelin' man, oh that's what I am

Travelin' man that's what I am, no woman puts a hold on me
You'll see me once or maybe twice that's all you'll see of me
No, all you pretty women Lord, I hope you understand
Don't be a fool, Lord no and put your heart in a travelin' man

I'm a travelin' man

Travelin' man
Travelin' man, that's what I am
Travelin' man
Travelin' man that's what I am
Guess I'll always be
Travelin' man that's what I am, but at
At least I'm free, yeah
I'm a traveler
Travelin' man
Oh that's what I am
Travelin' man that's what I am, Lord I move so fast
I have had so many women, none of them have last
I am just a mover, moving fast as sound
Always free, sometimes lonely, always movin' around
I'm a Travelin' man
Travelin' man, that's what I am
Travelin' man
Travelin' man
Oh, that's what I am
Travelin' man

[Verse 1]
I ain't the son of the seventh son, black cats won't cross my path
Good luck comes I just watch it run and it sure does run out fast
I wasn't born under no bad sign, but it was Friday the 13th
East, west, no, yes
Hot, cold, tell you this
Ain't nothing in between

[Chorus]
Its either good luck -- I'm the last to get it
Bad luck -- I'm the first
When its good, ain't nothing better
When its bad, ain't nothing worse

[Verse 2]
Well life can be a little hard sometimes, you do what you gotta do
A lot depends on the luck a man has and the cards that's been dealt to you
I'd fold this hand if I could or at least take a card or two
I been around
Had my ups and downs
Tell me does it sound little like you

[Chorus] 

[3x]

[Verse 1]
Alarm clock rings about a quarter after five
I've been up all night
Raisin' hell with some friends of mine
I take one good look in the mirror
But only one things getting clearer
The way I live, I'm lucky to be alive

[Chorus]
There I go lying to myself
Said I wasn't gonna do it
Next thing you know, here I go again
Talked myself right into it

[Verse 2]
Supposed to be to work an hour ago
When I pass that boss storming down the road
Now there's an angel on my shoulder
Thinking she can win me over
Devil's got my number don't you know

[Chorus]
There I go lying to myself
Said I wasn't gonna do it
Next thing you know, here I go again
Talked myself right into it

[Bridge]
Maybe, maybe have I gone to far this time
Maybe, maybe is my conscience working overtime
Nah

[Verse 3]
There's a knockout Georgia Peach giving me the eye
Well if the truth be known I'm just a little shy
Turns out she wasn't alone
She had a six foot chaperone
But that didn't slow me down
Don't ask me why

[Chorus]
There I go lying to myself
Said I wasn't gonna do it
Next thing you know, here I go again
Talked myself right into it

[Outro]
I got no one to blame except myself
I said I wasn't gonna do it
Next thing you know here I go
Talk myself right into it
Talk myself, talk myself right into it
Talk myself, talk myself, talk myself right into it
Said I wasn't gonna do it
Here I go again baby

[Verse 1]
In this world that we all live in
Its all taking and there's no giving
Before its too late,somethings gotta change
Go to work every day for the dollar
Doesn't matter we're all blue collar
At the end of the day
Nothing lost, nothing gained

[Chorus]
But its about time we realized
Its about time we opened our eyes
Take one step back and look at yourself
Do you like what you see
Oh no
Cause its never too late
Doesn't matter who you are
Its never too late
Hold on to your dreams and they will take you far
Cause its never too late
No, no, no

[Verse 2]
So many times I've seen you crying
But I see you out there still trying
Working hard just to get through another day
As a friend I'm here to remind you
We all have a place to belong to
Who am I? See I'm just like you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We all need a helping hand sometimes
And I need one if you were mine
So right here, right now
You can count on me
Just open your eyes and you will see
That its never too late
No,no,no

[Bridge]
Cause its never too late, it doesn't matter who you are
Its never too late
Hold on to your dreams and they will take you far
Cause its never too late
Cause its never too late, it doesn't matter who you are
Its never too late
You don't need a guitar son to be a star
Cause its never too late
No, no, no
Its never too late
No

[Intro]
Cause its never too late
Take a look around
Cause its never too late

[Verse 1]
Here I sit all by myself
Wondering how she could put our love on a shelf
A crowd of people, they pass me by
But all I can do is hang my head and cry

[Chorus]
Blame it on a sad song in the night
I don't want anyone but you to make it right
Blame it on a sad song in the night
Well, it's an old familiar feeling
Girl, it's got my heart reeling
Don't want to hear a sad song in the night
Anymore

[Verse 2]
I know when we first started out
I was your only love and you had no doubt
But songs of the heart don't last forever
But don't you give up on love 'cause you never say never

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
'Cause not a day goes by that I don't think about you
Oh, moment to moment, I get lost in time
And many years from now when I hear that song come on the radio
All those feelings will come back to haunt me
My heart will let me know

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Blame it on a sad song
You can blame it on a sad song, baby
Blame it on, blame it on a sad song

[Verse 1]
You better listen my brother
Cause if you do you can hear
There are voices still calling from across the years
And they're crying across the ocean
And they're crying across the land
And they will until we all come to understand

[Chorus 1]
That none of us are free
None of us are free
None of us are free if one of us is chained
None of us are free

[Verse 2]
Well there are people in the darkness
And they just can't see the light
And if we don't say it's wrong then that says it's right
We got to feel for each other
Let our brothers know we're here
Got to get the message and send it out loud and clear

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Well I swear to you salvation isn't very hard to find
None of us can find it on our own
We got to join together. Spirit, heart and mind
All the are suffering, knows they're not alone

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4]
If you just look around you
You're see what I say
Cause the world's getting smaller each passing day
Now it's time to make some changes
Now it's time all realized
That the truth is shining right before our eyes

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[x2]
Well it's the very heart of humanity
Cause none of us are free if one of us is chained
None of us are free

[Verse 1]
Every time I think I got it all figured out
Then I draw a blank and my whole world crashes down
So many people have got it worse than me
But that could change tomorrow, ain't no guarantee

[Chorus]
How soon we forget
To count every blessing
If you think you got it bad take a look around
How soon we forget
That life is one big lesson
Still we make the same mistakes time and time again
How soon we forget

[Verse 2]
Got a friend of mine who says he's run all out of luck
But he'll be fine, cause he just ain't drunk enough
The world is empty when you're slamming those shots down
How can you be happy, son when the devil's hanging 'round

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Just remember, thank God you're here today
If you got the will you can find a way

How soon we forget... oh, baby

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Soon we all forget
How soon we forget
Soon we forget.. ooh
Take a look around and you will see
Soon we all forget... oh

[Outro]
So many people have got it worse than me
Oh.. can't you see
How soon we all forget

[Verse 1]
These ol' white lines on the highway
Lord its all I know
Seems like I've been out all my life
But I just can't let it go

[Chorus]
Oh you know I ain't complaining
Cause I can tell, Lord its just your plan
So I thank you for what I have
And that's a song
All I have is a song

[Verse 2]
I keep thinking about the friends I've had
And all the meories we've shared
They keep coming back, time and time again
Sometimes I wonder was it worth the cost
And all I've lost

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So I play this song one more time, cause Lord its all I know
I'll be standing at your door following along
Cause all I have is a song
And this song will live on

[Outro]
All I have is a song
A piece of me to live on

[Verse 1]
Up every morning before the sun
Taking my loving on the run
Breaking my back till the day is done
I'm gonna punch that time clock and have some fun
Ain't no easy way to get myself out

[Chorus]
So - I keep on working
Like a working man do
I gotta buy my baby shoes
I keep on working
It's the only thing to do
I make my living by the sweat of my brow
Oh - working just like you-uh

[Verse 2]
I was raised on the poor side of town
I made my living moving around
I never let no one dog me down
Oh I was taught to stand my ground
Life was always changing
That's just the way it is

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Outro]
Aaah ah ah ah aaah ah ah ah
I keep on working-working

[x4]
Uh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
Raised up with two kinds of people
The good ones and the bad
I was taught from early on
The only choice I had
Now I see, it's clear to me
What was in the plan
Had to walk the walk and talk the talk
And try to be a man
I swear the wind took me away
But now I'm here again today, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm back on the mean streets
Oh, it's the only thing I know
Never change me, it was born in my soul
And it don't take much to make me mad
Push me a little and I bring back
I've a mean streak, oh
Yeah, I'm back on the mean streets

[Verse 2]
Somebody stole my money
I heard a brother say
Used to we'd fight it out
That was yesterday
Just because you're packing son
Don't make you a man
If you shoot to kill, what's the thrill
Why don't you understand
Each time I walk outside my door
We need a change and that's for sure

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Do you ever think about where you're goin'?
Have you ever thought about where you've been?
Will you ever pass this way again?
There's a fear and you know it
But inside, you can't show it
No where for you to run and hide

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse]
There's a grey horse standing  still
As a soldier climbs in the saddle for one last ride
The rain pours off his hat
You can see the shadows of the past written in his eyes

Now the cannons are silent
His friends are all gone, gotta put it all behind him
If he ever wants to find his way home
He's the last rebel on the road

Just a boy with his old guitar
Keeps to himself but everybody takes him wrong
But he carried on, got a dream that will never die
Can't change him
No use in staying where you don't belong

Now he's rolling down the highway
Gone too far too fast
No one will ever find him
He'll never look back
'Cause he's the last rebel
And he's all alone, He's the last rebel
His friends are all gone
He's the last rebel, the last rebel on the road

There'll never be another like him
He's the last of a dying breed
Ain't no use tryin' to change him
'Cause he's the last rebel
And he's all alone, He's the last rebel
His friends are all gone
He's the last rebel, the last rebel on the road

[Verse 1]
I'm just a cityboy
But there's a small town side of me
And I feel it closing in
Are we blind to see
That she's dying more each day
And she's crying out to you and me
Changes come and when they're gone
They curse the fools who wait too long

[Chorus 1]
So let's take care of what we have
Before the good we know goes bad
And the beauty fades and just slips away
The dirty air,the dying seas
Will this be the world we leave
To the wild and young
I say,just look at what we've done
And right before our eyes

[Chorus 2]
Today's yesterday
Will be tomorrow's goodbye

[Verse 2]
Here comes the rain
And it might wash her tears away
But it doesn't change a thing
Like my brother before me
All I can do is write this song
And for her I sing

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
Do you ever think about
The future or the past
Do you ever wonder
How long this world will last

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse]
Santa comes once a year, we all know
Didn't use my chimney, had a key to my door
Oh, Lord, look what Santa did
(He's messing with me)
Call it Merry Christmas?
I say Santa's messing with The Kid

[Verse 1]
I hear rumors flying
About a head on crash
At the stroke of midnight
When centuries clash
Some going to party
Some going to kneel and pray
Well you can quote the bible
Bribe the devil
But there's gonna be some hell to pay
We were young and innocent
Thought this day would never come
And tomorrow seemed a million miles away
Let's look each other in the eyes
And realize it could be time
To set aside our anger
And know we're all the same

[Chorus]
Take my hand we're gonna cross the line
To a brand new day on the end of time
We're gonna rise as one or fall together
Out here on the ledge
We're standing on the edge...of forever

[Verse 2]
From the silence I hear the thunder roll
Words of the prophets echo in my soul
One salvation in the world to me
I know in my heart if we love each other
We can face what's meant to be
Now there's power in the wrong hands
A madman in a foreign land
If we don't get our senses
It's all gonna slip away

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Intro]
You know there's Dasher and Dancer
Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid
Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

[Verse 1]
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw him
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

[Chorus]
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"

[Verse 2]
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history"

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Hey, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history"

[Verse 1]
I knew a man a long, long time
But I never knew him at all
Small in stature, big at heart
Oh, he always stood tall
From the time that he was born
He had a style all his own
In my mind he could do no wrong
Misunderstood all along
He worked hard all his life
To get what he has today
We would all be better off
If we could hear those words
That he had to say

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
He took me by the hand
And said, "Son, what's your plan?
I won't stop you or stand in your way
Someday you'll be a man
I look at him with hungry eyes
That only youth can know
With all his wisdom and all his years
He said, "I'll teach you all that you need to know

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Don't stop, now, keep moving
Don't worry about where you are going
I'll hear you, you'll feel me
I'm there no matter where you go

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Intro]
Love this time of year
It seems to bring us near
I wish Christmas was every day

[Verse 1]
There's something about those lights
On that tree at night
Feeling you girl, next to me
Oh baby, baby the way we kiss
Under the mistletoe
A laugh, like little children
Making angels in the snow
Well, it's in your eyes and in your smile it shows
That this very special time of year
It seems to set your heart a glow
Oh, sing it with me, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, it's Christmas, you know it's Christmas
And it's our favorite time of year
Bells will be ringing, our hearts are singing
Well, I'm glad it's Christmas time once again

[Verse 2]
The city's lit up bright on this starry night
But there's something left to do
Go home and light a fire, tell me your heart's desire
Wrap me up, take me away
Oh, when I'm with you darling
There's so much love that I want to share
I know you feel it too
There's magic in the air
And in this, sweet, sweet memories
We share together
They're going to last us now
Now and for ever, for ever and ever

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Alas my love you do me wrong
To cast me out discourteously
When I have loved you so so long
Delighting in your company

[Verse]
Your gown was of the grassy green
Your sleeves of satin were hanging by
Which made you be a harvest queen
Yet you would not love me
Green sleeves was my all my joy
Green sleeves was my delight
Green sleeves was my heart of gold
And who but my lady green sleeves

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Yeah, ooh, ooh, the only time I get up early
Is to met my mules at the fishing hole
I wanna catch the one that got away
I wanna feel my pole bending in that way

[Chorus]
Since I was a kid, I felt this way
I fell hook, line and sinker gone fishing, yeah

[Verse 2]
St. John's River runs north not south
Smart enough to have a large mouth
If you can hook 'em, you can mount 'em
You can keep 'em around
But if they break your line, they're gonna go back down

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh, ain't nothing like sunrise on the lake
Or when the moon comes up at night
Oh, there's things out there that can take your life
You might just die of fright
But I'll be there come rain or shine
See it's what I like to do
Only thing better than setting the hook
Is setting my hook in you

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I've been everywhere, tried everything
But there ain't nothing that feels the same
When you find the right one, it's a magical thing
Next thing you know, it's a diamond ring

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Gone, gone fishing, she hooked me
Gone, gone fishing, yeah, yeah
Gone, gone, gone fishing, yeah

[Outro]
She's my baby, gone, gone, gone fishing
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, gone fishing

[Chorus]
You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse]
He's making a list and checking it twice
Going to find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Out of all the reindeer you know you're the mastermind
Run, run rudolph, randalph's not too far behind
Run, run rudolph, santa's got to make it to town
Randalph he can hurry, he can take the freeway down
And away went rudolph a-whizzing like a merry-go-round
Said santa to a boy child what have you been longing for?
All I want for christmas is a rock and roll electric guitar
And away went rudolph a-whizzing like a shooting star
Run, run rudolph, santa's got to make it to town
Can't you make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
And away went rudolph a-whizzing like a merry-go-round
Said santa to a girl child what would you like most to get?
I want a little baby doll that can cry, scream and wet
And away went rudolph a-whizzing like a saber jet
Run, run rudolph, run, run rudolph, a-running like a son-of-a-gun

[Verse 1]
Dig down and tell me what you find
Back in the pages left behind
Everybody's got a story
Ours ain't no different from the rest
Each step we take, it's just a test
On this broken road to glory

[Chorus 1]
When we were young and brave
We fought to save the one thing that we loved
We took a sacred vow
And signed our names in blood

[Chorus 2]
And through it all, we kept on shining
We fought the doubt and faced the pain
We built it up from dust and ashes
To cheat the odds and rise again

[Verse 2]
There's been a million miles of road
Another million miles to go
Still giving me a reason
Most times your first could be your last
God give me one more second chance
Oh, something to believe in
And though it's easier to give it up
Than to give it all you got
Don't let it make you something
That you're not

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
And through it all the wheels keep turning
Above the tears the truth stands tall
Now here we are one in spirit
We stand together through it all
Oh, through it all

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Verse 1]
Mama used to send us early to bed on Christmas Eve
She became Santa's helper and they took care of me
We would wake up early from our beds only to see
The love she had for all of us was left beneath the tree

[Pre-Chorus]
One day I know we'll be together
When the Lord brings me to you
Then I know, I will be in Heaven
When my eyes can rest on you

[Chorus]
But until then I will remember
All the good times that we've shared
I'll hang a star upon this tree for you
On Christmas Day I know you'll be there too

[Verse 2]
Now that I am all grown up with children of my own
I see the happiness in their eyes, somehow I wish I'd known
But not a Christmas Day goes by, that I will not see
The gift you gave to all of us was the love you gave to me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
One day I know we'll be together
Then I know I will be in Heaven
I won't have to remember
Because I'm standing there with you
Of a time that you and I always knew
Mama, on Christmas Day I'll finally be with you

[Outro]
Joy to the world, the Lord has come

[Verse 1]
Now Mama's in the kitchen cooking
And her children are fast asleep
It's time for Santa Claus to make his midnight creep cause

[Chorus]
Santa Claus wants some loving
Santa Claus wants some loving

[Verse 2]
I know there's something real pretty
Underneath that Christmas tree
But I haven't had no loving and it's wearing me because

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now I been trying to fix this old bicycle
Can't seem to find my pliers
Halfway watching Mama for that sleep in her eyes because

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I don't want no turkey
Don't care about no cake
I want you to come here Mama before the children wake because

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Now Christmas is for the children
And I want them to be real pleased
But right now Mama it's Christmas Eve
Come make your Papa happy please

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Christmas lights out in the yard
A wreath hung on our door
There was christmas music on the radio
When I stare outside my window
Waiting for Santa to come
I couldn't wait to see under our tree
When Santa's work was done

[Chorus 1]
Singing hallelujah it's christmas
Everybody all over the world tonight
Singing hallelujah it's christmas
It's christmas time again

[Verse 2]
All year long I try to be
As good as I could be
Just a boy with all them childhood dreams
Then I'd sit down and write "Dear Santa
Don't forget to come my way
I'll see you soon, and please make room
For my guitar in your sleigh"

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Singing hallelujah it's christmas
People all sharing their hearts tonight
Singing hallelujah it's christmas
It's christmas all over the world

[Bridge]
Have a happy christmas
Make a joyful noise
Have a happy christmas
All us wild eyed boys

[Verse 3]
I never got that __
But it taught me to believe
That what means the most is only
To give more than receive
And if we could wish together
I'd wish the world in harmony
Because if christmas could last forever
What a better world it'd be

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4]
Singing hallelujah it's christmas
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah it's christmas
It's christmas time again

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Intro]
Well, it looks like it's another
Skynard family Christmas time
Well, well, well, well

[Verse]
Seems like ? New Year's Day
Started out in old L.A
Those big wheels keep turning once again
But this bus we ride, we call our home
Well, this what keeps us moving on
But 11 months on this road, I'm going home
Family say they're trimming the tree
Cooking that turkey, waiting on me
Just like Santa, I'll be right on time
Thirty eight will be there too
CDB will be guiding you
To another Christmas time

[Chorus]
Sleigh bells ringing, children singing
It's another Skynard family Christmas time
Oh, pick an excuse
That's right, dig deep
Christmas time

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Well, it's another Skynard family Christmas time
Yeah, it's another Skynard family Christmas time
That's right
It's another Skynard family Christmas time

[Intro]
Let me tell you

[?]

[Verse 1]
Where I come from it's grits and gravy not champagne and caviar
Got pickup trucks, there is no mercedes, that's who we are (Oooooh.. Yeah I wouldn't change a thing)
I am no saint sometimes a sinner and I can't tell you why
But I get up every morning and thank the man above (Oooooh WOOOoo my life is good)

Let me tell ya how good... hahaaa

[Chorus]
Like my women hot and my beer ice cold
A real fast car and my whiskey old
Like a slow drive down and old dirt road
That's How I like it
I like to turn my music way up loud
There is nothing better than the sound of a crowd
American flag it makes me proud
That's how I like it
Wooooo...aaah... Listen now

[Verse 2]
There is no cell phone towers, you won't catch me online
Working with my hands for hours, is how I spend my time
And I don't stand in line for coffee, It is not my cup of tea
Out here in the country we got everything we need Ooooh Woooo yeah

[Chorus]

Ooooohhhh

[?]

WOOooooo That's how I like it

[Whistle]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
WOOOOOoooo
Yeah

[?]

[Intro]
Ooooooooo.... Yeah OOOOOOOOO

[Verse 1]
Well sometimes I lose my direction, And sometimes I jump off track
But when I ride out baby, I can always get back
I need to feel the cool breeze in my face, The rumble of the engines between my legs
Hey little sister, You can color me gone
So if I want to stay out all night long, You can't stop me from running wild
Yeah don't worry how long I'm gone, I'll come back every once and a while

[Chorus]
I pick them up, I lay them all down
I never like my feet, to ever hit the ground
Don't miss me when I'm gone, because I'll be around
I'm a free spirit baby pick me up and lay me on down
That's right. Wooo

[Verse 2]
Well I know I got a good life, Jim Beam, And women, They treat me right
I make my own rules, Like it or not
Now don't misunderstand me baby, I give it every once and a while
Well it's tough love honey, But I'll leave you with a smile
So if I want to stay out all night long, You can't stop me from running wild
Now don't worry how long I'm gone, I'll come back every once and a while

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've been here, I've been there, I've been everywhere
I wouldn't tell you no lies
And just like me you're a wild one, Won't you take me for a ride

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You got to lay me on down, Yes you do
I'm a free spirit, Oh you know you are Johnny
Oooooooh That's what I am Oooooooh

[Intro]
MMMMmmmmmm
Hahaaa
Let me tell you a story

[Verse 1]
Outside of Macon off a country road
Justice was forsaken when they let the wrong man go
Johnny Law was shady first one on the scene
They called it murder in the first degree
Dead man walking, walking down the hall
Judge says guilty but still he's standing tall
Dead man walking they say he broke the law
Taking the life of another man who done his daughter wrong

[Chorus]
Light them up, lay them down
Take them out but there's more of us around
When wrong is right and right is wrong
Oh there's a dead man walking tonight
Walk on

[x3]

[Verse 2]
If I ask you a question, would you tell the truth
Would you pull the triger if you were standing in his shoes
Dead man walking I know what I'd do
If someone hurt my baby I'd be walking too

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah

[?]
So if I ask you that question, would you tell the truth?
Ahaha...Dead man walking
MMMMMmmmmm

[Intro]
Ooh
One, two

[Verse 1]
She's on the left, I'm on the right
Oh, here comes trouble
And I ain't even seen her yet
Oh, she's something I'll regret
She's got it good, I got it bad
Can't seem to get her walk
And her talk outta my head
Oh, you know I'm just a mess

[Chorus 1]
Give it up, give it up
Give it to me
Can't you see, honey
I'm down on my knees?

[Chorus 2]
Want to feel your touch
I need you so much
Don't you know I come with
A money back guarantee?
Oh, you ain't gonna get my money

[Verse 2]
I'll buy the house, you drive my car
I'll take you anywhere
But baby, if that's not enough
Oh, you can call my bluff
I will shower you with
Diamonds and rings
I'll feel a little angel baby
Can't you see?

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
Money back, money back guarantee

[x4]

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, oh, the girl I see
Oh, you can have it all, baby
Say baby, money back guarantee
Oh oh, you can keep your money back guarantee
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Well the sun don't shine where it used to
And the angels are hiding their heads
People don't listen to their hearts anymore
Seems the good men all are dead
There is no right, wrong, no in between
That isn't the constitution that they wrote for me
Got our heads stuck in something overseas
Standing ass deep in hypocracy
Well I found myself out on the open road
Heading out into the desert
Looking for another world that's waiting on me
That none of us can see
I keep thinking to myself as I move along
Where do we all come from
Is there religion or another dimension
Another place and time yeah

[?]

OOOooooo

[Chorus]
When my life is over and done
Finally made my way through it
Another life has just begun
Is this the way you do it
Oh the way

[?]
OOOooooo

[Verse 2]
Looking in the eyes of the man on the moon
He's staring down at me
Wondering what he's thinking and if he knows
Please let me see
Life is like an open door we're all walking through
Do you know the answers, no one knows the truth
Until we pass on through

[Chorus]

OOOOOOoooooo

[Verse 3]
Walking on the world upside down
It keeps spinning round and round
World upside down
I'm so tired of all this bullshit going down
Finally made my way through it
When my life is over and done
Is this the way you do it
When my life is over and done
Finally made my way through it
Another life has just begun
This is the way you do it
Oh the way

[?]
This is the way you do it
Oh the way

[?]

[Intro]
That's right, come on

[Verse 1]
Long tall Sally's looking good to me
Shaking that thing for everybody to see
Oh, everybody's thinking just like me
Wonder who the lucky fool's gonna be

[Chorus]
Get it while the getting good, baby
Take it cause the others would
Ain't no hesitating, they just might be waiting
Get it while the getting good

[Verse 2]
Look at that dude in the parking lot
Taken it for granted, everything he's got
So if he hands you a dollar say, "Thank you, sir"
Cause I've been up and down and I know what it's worth

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You know I gotta have it, ain't no doubt about it
Get it while the getting good
You can say you don't want it
But deep inside you know, you really do
You know what I'm talking about
Well, everybody's thinking just like me
Wonder who the lucky fool's gonna

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
You gotta get it while the getting good
You gotta get it while the getting good, baby
You gotta get it while the getting good
Oh, you better get it while the getting good, baby

[Intro]
Here we go
Come on

[Verse 1]
I was raised on the west side Shanty Town
I didn't get up until the sun went down
When your backs against the wall you better get tough
I learned real quick how to swing and duck

[Chorus]
I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine
Good looking women backwoods and moonshine
Learned more about life on the streets than in school
Sweet Mama didn't raise no fool (No she didn't)

Hahahaha
Ooooohhh

[Verse 2]
Some folks cheat and some folks lie
I can judge a man by the look in his eyes
So don't hand me Jack and try to call it Cola
I know the difference between shit and shinola

[Chorus]

Play it boys

[?]
MMmmHhmmm

[?]

[Verse 3]
Mama was no angel when she taught me right from wrong
She knew every single note and every word in every single song
She taught me how to gamble and how to roll the dice
If it makes you feel good DO IT don't think twice

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Outro]
Talking about Mama
Ooooh I'm telling you sheee

[?]
Talking about sweet, sweet sweet Mama
Talking about sweet sweet sweet, sweet sweet Mama
Talking about sweet sweet sweet, sweet sweet Mama
Talking about sweeeeeeeeeet Mama

[Intro]
That's right

[Verse 1]
Well, the dogs are barking and I'm out rocking
Nobody home to throw them a bone
I was thinking just the other day
Yeah, on my way back to U.S.A
Oh, junk mail and bills in a letter box
Out on the line are my dirty socks
Had to jump the fence and break my lock
Yeah

[Chorus]
Oh my God, I'm back in FLA
I got so much to do but I'm only here for a day
Wish I could pay for it while I'm in it
Seems like I'm there only for a minute
Me and the bank own a house down in FLA
Yeah

[Verse 2]
What in the world am I gonna do
Clock on the wall says a quarter to two
Well, the boys are on the bus and they're waiting on me
I got soap in my eyes and I can't see
Telephone's ringing, baby's on the line
Tired of being here doing my time
Gotta hit the road running, gotta get goodnight
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
That's right
Well, let's do

[Verse 3]
Oh, wish I could pay for it while I'm in it
Seems like I'm there only for a minute
Me and the bank own a house
Yeah, me and the bank own a house
Oh, a run down shack in FLA

[Outro]
Yeah, that's right
FLA, FLA, FLA
Yeah

[Intro]
Oooohhh
Ahhhhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus]
Tornados spinning, I sit here grinning
I think we've all seen this movie before
This is confusing, almost amusing
It's hard to tell up and down anymore
When did it get so crazy, how did we lose control
Everybodies shouting, how bad it really sucks

[Chorus]
Situation normal
All funked up, We're all funked up

[Verse 1]
We had some leaders, and they were cheaters
But they came out smelling like a rose
We should reject them, but we respect them
For what they do when the door is closed
Nothing in this world a simple man can do
Stand up and be counted, hadn't you had enough

[Chorus]
Situation normal
All funked up, Yeah we're all funked up
We're funtionally disfuntional
We're funtionally yeah disfuntional
We're all funked up

Uuughh

[?]

[Verse 2]
Don't you know the meaning of the word snafu
Better known as trouble for me and you
Murphy's law will get you, he's on his way
Same old same old shit a different day

Uuughh

[?]
Oh

[?]

[Pre-Chorus]]

[Chorus]
Situation normal
All funked up, we're all funked up
We're all funked up
We're all funked up

[Outro]
Ooooohhhhh

All funked up

[Verse 1]
Broken bones, broken hearts
Stripped down and torn apart
A little bit of rust - I'm still running
Counting miles, counting tears
Twisted roads, shifting gears
Year after year - it's all or nothing

[Chorus]
But I'm not home, I'm not lost
Still holding on to what I got
Ain't much left
No there's so much that's been stolen
I guess I've lost everything I've had
But I'm not dead, at least not yet
Still alone, still alive, Still UNBROKEN
I'm still alone, still alive
I'M STILL UNBROKEN

[Verse 2]
Never captured, never tamed
Wild horses on the plains
You can call me lost - I call it FREEDOM
I feel the spirit in my soul
It's something Lord I can't control
I'M NEVER GIVING UP WHILE I'M STILL BREATHING

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Like the wind, like the rain
It's all running through my veins
Like a river pouring down into the ocean
I'm out here on the streets
But I'm standing on my feet
Still alive, still alone, still unbroken

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'm still alone
Still alive
Still unbroken
I'm still unbroken
I ain't never going down
I'm still unbroken
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Hey, when is the last time you sat down and had dinner with your kids?
Talked about what's going on in their lives?
Hey, when is the last time you just stopped and helped somebody out?
I bet you can't remember
Well a lot of people are saying
We're changing for the better
Well that don't interest me

[Chorus]
I like the simple life
The way it USED to be
We left our doors wide open
We didn't need no key
I've been around the world
Seen all there is to see
I'd trade ALL THOSE memories for ONE MORE DAY
How it used to be
I like the Simple Life

[Verse 2]
I wanna get up Sunday morning
Go fishing with my boy
Watch the sunset kick back in my yard
Take my Harley on a real long lazy Sunday drive
And do a little more nothing once in a while
Yeah Maybe kick my feet up
Watch a little re-run on TV
Laughing with ol Barney, Andy and Aunt Bee

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Everything's going by so fast
I swear sometimes we just can't see
So caught up in where we're TRYING to get
Life as we know it, could be gone in a minute

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Woman lose my number
You can't get to me
My pockets ain't deep enough
Your eyes were seeing green
I caught you lying, you're a cheat
Oh Lord shame on me
I loved you once
Tried you twice
But you've become bad company

[Chorus]
Somebody call the rescue
'Cause I think I'm on the edge
Yeah you're just like a sledgehammer
You keep pounding in my head
While you were on the phone lying to me
You were lying next to who
It ain't nothing to do about the heartache
It's just a little thing called you

[Verse 2]
All my friends did tell me
But I could not believe
Well you were doing me wrong
When I was gone
How wicked can you be?

Yeah a black cat crosses many roads
Chills you to the bone
I might be hurt, but I won't cry
'Cause I'm a man that's not alone

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
When I was 15 I dreamed of leaving my home
I had to see the world
And live like a rolling stone
I heard California was paved in gold
So I hopped on that train
It didn't come easy
But I keep thinking bout
The green grass and missing my home

[Chorus]
Take me back to my southern ways
Where I can be myself and live another day
Take me back to my southern ways
Where the tall pines blow and the southern winds kiss my face

[Verse 2]
Oh southern grace
Me and my boys started a band
Practiced everyday out on the Hell House land
Played every honky tonk and this ol bar
To sing about Sweet 'Bama
We were just simple men
The music is forever
And the songs will never ever end

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh take me back!
I sit here thinking about those days
I wouldn't change a thing about my life today
Ain't it funny how time sure flies
Cause all I ever wanted and all I ever needed
WAS YOU

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[JVZ:] I think it's gonna be good night here Rickey

[RM:] I think it's time to rock

[JVZ:] It's gonna be hell of a show

[JVZ:] People out there in the parking lot

[RM:] Smoking that stuff it's a rebel flag rock

[JVZ:] Turn it up, crank it out, let me hear you shout

[BOTH:] That sweet soul southern music

[Chorus 1]

[BOTH:]
So put your hands in the air
Give us all you got

[Chorus 2]
We're feeling right (feeling right
Gonna take all night (take all night
To rock this joint the way it's supposed to be
Young and old (young and old
3 Generations bold (generations
We've been told
It's a SKYNYRD NATION!

[Verse 2]

[JVZ:] Motorcycle ladies hugging up to their daddies

[RM:] Oh teenage bangers they're all getting ready

[JVZ:] Open those gates gonna rock tonight

[RM:] Oh when those lights go down it's a beautiful sight

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[x2]

[Outro]
SKYNYRD NATION! (Young and Old)
SKYNYRD NATION! (3 Generations More!)
We've been told
IT'S A SKYNYRD NATION

[Verse 1]
Well I heard it on the late night radio
For the umpteenth time heading from LA to the Florida coast
I was between black coffee and shifting gears
When the second verse took a turn and brought me to tears
They were talking about love, I do and forever
And how two people ought to stay together
Well the music hit me but the singer's got it all wrong

[Chorus]
Unwrite that song
Unwrite that song
Cause what he's saying to me don't go with that melody
Unsing them lines about those happy times
Don't they know she's gone
Unwrite that song

[Verse 2]
Well it was 3 AM and she was cryin and her eyes were all red
When that music video came on and she sat up in her bed
She grabbed that whiskey bottle
Poured one last shot
And threw that empty glass at the TV and screamed

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well there was a time that I believed
All those words were true
And if I had a pen and paper right now
I know what I'd do

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Floyd was a trapper way back in the holler
Made moonshine so he could make a dollar
Six feet tall, dressed in overalls
And wore himself a long gray beard
People say Floyd came to town one day
But two law dogs got in his way
Floyd never hurt no one in his life
But they never came back this way
No, they never came back this way

[Chorus]
And the people say
Aye, aye, aye, aye hear the hound dogs moan
Aye, aye, aye, aye now that Floyd is long gone
And the creeper was a creeping and the souls they were hollering singing
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

[Verse 2]
The G-men came out to track him down
But the swamp was too deep, even one of them drowned
They sent in the hell hounds but they turned around singing
How how how how how

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah the souls are they were crying
Yeah the creeper he was creeping
Sheriff Boudreaux came to talk to his neighbors
All they could say is he was eaten by a gator
The legend lives on but Floyd he's at home singing
How how how how how

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wanna light up underneath the no-smoking sign
Sometimes I wish they'd tell me, how justice got so blind
I wish they'd just leave me alone cause I'm doing alright
You can take your change on down the road and leave me here with mine

[Chorus]
Cause that ain't my America
That ain't this country's roots
You wanna slam old Uncle Sam
But I ain't letting you
I'm mad as hell and you know I still bleed Red, White, and Blue
That ain't us
That Ain't My America

[Verse 2]
I was standing there in Dallas
Waiting on a plane
I overheard an old man
Tell a young soldier "thanks
The young soldier hung his head and said "it's hard to believe
You're the only one who took the time to say a word to me
And the old man said

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's to the women and men who in their hands hold a Bible and a gun
And they ain't afraid of nothing, when when they're holding either one
Now there's kids who can't pray in school
$100 dollar tanks of gas
I can tell you right now this country ain't
AIN'T SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT
NO

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Mama used to say to me, you can make your destiny
Keep your feet planted on the ground
You can always get it back, make a castle from a one room shack
It's all of what you make of what you've found
Son you're gonna find out when you're older
There's always been the hand of god resting right there on your shoulder

[Chorus]
Will it be hell or heaven on earth
The choice is up to you
Look to the sky, the answer is clear
Are you going to, live life for all it's worth
Choose hell, or heaven on earth
If you live it right, there's nothing to fear
Because you'll find heaven right here

[Verse 2]
Saw a man the other day, had it made in every way
Till his greed brought him down
He was blinded by the city lights, now he shivers in the cold tonight
Who will save the lifeguard when he's about to drown

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You know you're going to walk through fire
You know your going to feel the pain
Oh you're going to lose, if you want to win the game
And everytime your heart is breaking
And everytime your faith is shaken
Remember what mama said... Oh that day
Hope when my time has come
I've left enough to build upon
No one going to say I didn't try
Here's why

[?]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I ain't the kind to stick around without it
It'd be a crime cause man I'm all about it
It's in my blood
It keeps me breathing
It's like a drug - gotta have the feeling

[Chorus 1]
It's been awhile since I've seen your face
What a shame, what a waste

[Chorus 2]
I've been up, I've been down
I've been kicked to the ground
But I can't get my mind off of you
So I keep on moving on to a place I belong
Hoping you wanted me to
I'm better than I was before
I'm knocking at your door
I'm coming back for more

[Verse 2]
Some say it's love
Some say it's hate
I'm here to tell you it's never too late
If you don't use it
Man you're gonna lose it
Your sweet little nothings are what I call music

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[x2]

[Outro]
I keep coming back, coming back for more

[Verse 1]
Last night I heard this politician
Talking 'bout his brand new mission
Liked his plans, but they came undone when he got around with God and guns
I don't know how he grew up
But it sure wasn't down at the hunting club
Cause if it was he'd understand a little bit more about the working man

[Chorus]
God and guns
Keep us strong
That's what this country
Was founded on
Well we might as well give up and run
If we let them take our God and guns

[Verse 2]
I'm here in my back of the woods
Where God is great and guns are good
You really can't know that much about 'm
If you think we're better off without 'm
Well there was a time we ain't forgot
You caressed all night with the doors unlocked
But there ain't nobody save no more
So you say your prayers and you thank the lord
For that peace maker
In the Dresser Drawer

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Yeaaa
Ooh
God and guns
Don't let 'm take
Don't you let 'm take
Don't let 'm take
Our God and guns

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Wohoho
God and guns
Wohohoo
Ooh

[Intro]
Oooohhh
Mmmmmm Yeah

[Verse]
We just landed, we just touched down
It just hit home yeah, that a good man is gone
Hey Cat in the Hat, we're all going to miss you
And all your practical jokes yeah, and taking three steps with you
We never say goodbye we always say so long
You had nine lives I can't believe they're all gone
The Mad Hatter's moving on
Yeah he's moving on
Yeah we'll see you again, one way or another
And now that you're there yeah, Say hello to our brothers
Oohh. We never say goodbye we always say so long Yeah
You had nine lives I can't believe they're all gone
The Mad Hatter's moving on
The Cat in the Hat is gone
OOoooooo
Oohh
Traveling man, traveling man His spirit's never gone
It lives on and on and on and on
Oooohhh
Mad Hatter
Oooohhh
So tonight we'll pay tribute, and light up a match
And tell all your brothers and sisters, about the Cat in the Hat
Ooohhh... He had nine lives I can't believe they're all gone
I know the Mad Hatter, he's not alone

[Outro]
The Mad Hatter's moved on
Ooooohhh he's gone
Travelin' on
Travel on
OOOoooooOOOooooo
OOOoooooOOOooooo
The Mad Hatter's moved on
See you later

[Verse 1]
There was a time that you believed
That nothing could happen to you
You were in a place - deep in a hole
So dark that you could not see

[Chorus]
Everyday the rain won't fall
The sun will come out and shine on us all
There's a light at the end for you my friend
Oh, take it from me
The Storm will someday end
Will someday end

[Verse 2]
So much has changed inside your heart
We can tell it's tearing you apart
We share your pain and feel your hurt
But holy water cleanses the dirt

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Yeah
You were
Stuck in a hole

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I remember the day that he came in
I can't believe how long it's been
Like a poet, he began to play
Just an old friend that hung with the band
A drinking man he had no plan
But he played the 'Bird
Played it for free

[Chorus]
Cause I know he's here
He's everywhere
Take a look around oh and you will see
That cross we bear
It's in the air
Lord we thank you for these gifted hands

[Verse 2]
There are demons we live with every day
That tear at our hearts and take us away
To another place
Some of us don't get back
This song is for the hands of the working man
Who believes in himself and he understands
Love, hope, and faith are The Maker's plan

[Chorus]

[Outro]
One day we'll all take that ride
And with those gifted hands I know you'll fly

[Intro]
Yeah

[?]

[Verse 1]
Big bad machine still making the scene
Big wheels keep on turning
Step on the gas, gone in a flash
Rubber just keeps on burning

[Pre-Chorus]
Because every night is a Saturday night
No Matter what town we're in
Open the doors, kick out the lights
Just let the party begin

[Chorus]
We're just watching the world from this big ass bus
The highway is home to folks like us
Making good music, keeping it alive
Slip in slip out, of your rocking little town tonight
Yeah that's what we do

[Verse 2]
Get into town, lay our head down
Really there is nothing to do
Watching the clock, get ready to rock
We aren't no different than you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

MMMMmmmmm

So good to see you all again
I hope this ride we're on
Oooooh it never ends yeah

OOohhh

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
"Because We're just watching the world from this big ass bus
The highway is home to boys like us
Making good music, keeping it alive
Slip in, slip out
We're going to rock' your little town
Watching the world from this big ass bus
The highway is home to folks like us
Making good music, keeping it alive
Slip in, slip out
Of your rocking little town tonight
Yeah it's what we do
Oohhh we'll see you soon
MMMMMmmmOoooh
Yeah your little rocking town

[Verse 1]
Somewhere south of Winslow the road went right and I went left
Nothing out my window but desert, dirt, and death
From outta nowhere stood an angel from up in the air
Sometimes that hot horizon plays tricks on you I swear
Oh, I picked her up
Sure enough that girl was real, sitting in my truck
Said I know a place called the Broken Wheel where we can try our luck
Five miles north of 66, behind old man Lester's barn
Where the whisky flows and the money goes and the sherriff claims that he don't know

[Chorus]
Oh, here I go again, singing
BANG BANG
That cell door's closing in
BANG BANG
Here I go again
BANG BANG
Those chains around my legs
BANG BANG
This is where the highway ends

[Verse 2]
4 AM I was outta cash when she whispered in my ear
I got a gun and a plan, pull the truck up to the rear
Yeah it hit me like a tire tool right between the eyes
When the door flew open - she came out screaming
DRIVE FOOL DRIVE

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh, blue lights in my eyes
Oh, I must've been outta my mind

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Here I go again
BANG BANG

[Verse 1]
Your love does something to me that I can't describe
Dark eyes see right through me and I just can't hide
You drive me crazy with what you don't say and the way you hold back love
Tell me tell me won't you please please tell me
Need an answer from above
There you are, You're my desire, and here I am
I'd be a liar if I said

[Chorus]
I am not going to crawl
You are not going to nail my heart to the wall
You aren't going to find me crying like a child just asking for it all
I am not going to beg, I'd rather lose it all instead
If that is what it takes to get you Part of me just might let you
For someone like you, I'd do more than fall
I just might crawl

[Verse 2]
Seems like I get this feeling this time of night
Head down senses reeling, something just isn't right
Imagination locked up inside and it's got nowhere to go
I see my lover through another's eyes
And it's killing me to know the truth
Like playing with fire To lose you
I'd be a liar if I said

[?]

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Mud-covered cornfields staring out my back door
The barn's leaning over now and that deer don't run no more
So much life before, now that dream is gone
When the factory burned down I moved up to the city
The school we all went to is a memory that got bulldozed
And the good times froze when that door closed

[Chorus]
Main Street's still there but the stores are all empty
The car lot where my daddy worked is dirt and stone
The only thing that comes through here
Is stormy weather
And it's raining
It's raining in my heartland

[Verse 2]
We're packing them boxes for something better
Ran across my mom and dad's old love letters
And the photograph of this house that we're standing in now
Let's stop by the church where we got married
Walk out back where your grandma's buried
And say goodbye one last time

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Some dreams just stop growing where you plant them
You gotta count your blessings and be happy that you've had them
Let's grab a shovel baby, dig us a new life

[Chorus]

[Verse]
A boy gets crazy when he's sitting at the bar
Don't you mess with Jake don't you push him too far
Rotgut whiskey and homemade wine
Make a good country boy just lose his mind
Like a runaway train rolling through the night the boy have got no fear
Like a race car hitting the wall it gets hard to steer
Waiting for the smoke to clear
Betty got caught in the back of Bobby's car
Bobby got caught with his hand in the cookie jar
Her Daddy blew a fuse and went for his gun
Now Bobby and Betty they're on the run
Like a runaway train rolling throught the night nothing's going to stop them now
Got to keep on moving cover their tracks somehow
Like a runaway train rolling through the night
The kids have got no fear
Daddy swears bang is the last sound Bobby's going to hear Oooohhh
Waiting for the smoke to clear
Daddy finally caught them and he emptied his gun
Put a dead end to all of Bobby's fun Oooohhh
Good god almighty for heaven's sakes
Betty's Daddy turned out to be Jake
Like a runaway train rolling through the night
Jake got no fear
No hangman judge going to give the boy 99 years
Here sits Jake in the back of this bar
Sipping on an ice cold beer
If the law had a clue all they'd do is look right here
They'd see Jake
Waiting for the smoke to clear .... Waiting for
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Around the time of the second world war
A new kind of man came through the door
I ain't looking for food
I'm looking for work
Not afraid to sweat - digging in the dirt
I ain't looking for a hand-out
But I'm willing to lend a hand to the man that pays me
Yes I am
Mr. Roosevelt, he understands I'm a hobo kinda man
I've been riding this train
I've been up all night
I'll be swinging that ho before daylight
When the next box car comes along
I'll jump it and fight ya and call it my home
When the money runs out, so do I
I'll be riding these rails 'till times change and kill me
Yes I will
I never know where I am, hey, I'm a hobo kinda man
That's what I am

[Chorus]
Those steel wheels-a-rolling
Somewhere I feel me towing, I know
I can hear that whistle blowing
Come tomorrow morning
I'll be gone
Yeah
Oh! I'm a hobo kinda man

[Verse 2]
I'm always leaving my wife and kids behind
Working somewhere on down the line
Every night I sleep in a different town
I never know, honey, where I'm bound
Living out of a suitcase
I changed from a train to a silver eagle
But I'm getting all I can
I'm a modern day hobo kinda man

[Chorus]

[Intro]
MMMMMmmmmmm

[Verse 1]
I listen, and still I haven't heard
Tell me what is the word
And if I ever heard it would it be clear as water
Oh tears run down your face
Reflects the human race
We're all caught up with winning losing time and space
Life's lessons
So you think you know it all
But you're headin' for a fall
Ooh to make it back again
You'll have to crawl and step back
Take a look around
Are your feet still on the ground
Can we find you in the section of lost and found

[Pre-Chorus]
Never think you got it figured out
Because when you do you begin to doubt
It's time for you to open your eyes

[Chorus]
Will we look back and see what we've done
Will we be proud or ashamed of what we've become
Will we realize we all share one fate
Or is this another life's lesson... Too late

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Will we look back and see what we've done
OOohhh...OOohhh
Will we realize we all share one fate
OOOohhhh life's lessons
OOohhh...OOohhh...OOohhh yeah life's lessons
Ooohh... life's lessons

[Outro]
Will we look back and see what we've done
Will we realize we all share one fate

[Intro]
MMMMMmmmmMMMMMmmm

[Verse 1]
Well it took so long for me to realize
That my destiny was right before my eyes
If it were up to me to travel through this life
I'd find an open space for me to live out all my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm such a lucky man, I try to be a stronger man
I shed a tear or two but that don't make me a weaker man
It's made me a better man, I've given all I can
To a world that sometimes thinks that I'm a lesser man

[Chorus]
I remember all the things I've been through
Gave myself to all those people I once knew
I'm such a lucky man

[Verse 2]
I'd like to thank you for the times that you have been with me
I hope it meant as much to you to share these memories
There's a guiding light that always seems to shine on me
If I did it again I'd be happy until the end

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

It's right here in the moonlight

[Bridge]
Whooooooooohhhoooooohhhh
I'm a lucky man, I try to be a stronger man
I shed a tear or two but that don't make me a weaker man
It's made me a better man, I've given all I can
To a world that sometimes thinks that I'm a lesser man
I'm a lucky man
Yeah

[Outro]
MMMMMmmmmMMMMMmmm.... I'm a lucky man
Whooooooooohhhoooooohhhh.... just a lucky man

[Verse 1]
Oh another hot cup of coffee – I’m up at 5 am
These old worn out working boots look like these beat up hands
But I get up and I do it – because people depend on me
Trying to keep my faith in this American Dream
Paychecks going down
Prices are going up
Takes most of my money just to fill my pick-up truck

[Chorus]
Nothing Comes Easy – trying to feed my family
Nothing Comes Easy – for a working class like me
I’ve been doing time on the line – listen you don’t understand
Nothing comes easy
Nothing comes easy

[Verse 2]
Let’s put back the pieces to this broken promised land
All this crazy spending – I don’t understand
Politicians preaching – but it don’t never change
Same ol’ lines and bullshit – might as well flush it all down the drain
Nobody wants to say it – but I’m gonna speak my mind
We’re all in this together but we’re running out of time

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Not for a man like me
Yeah when your back’s up against the wall
And the wolf’s knocking at your door
LISTEN MR. PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE CAN’T TAKE IT ANYMORE

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Well them four walls of Raiford, closing in on me
Doing three to five hard labor, for armed robbery
I had two years behind, but I could not wait the time
Every time I thought about it, well I died some more inside
And I had stripes on my back, memories that hurt
For the only time I seen sunshine is when I hit the dirt
Digging ditches for the chain gang, sleeping in the cold
Oh Lord please forgive me for I could not wait no more

[Chorus]
And I coming home to see you Jesus
Well it feels so close this time
Please take mercy on this soldier
From the Florida-Georgia line
When they find me they must kill me
Oh Jesus save my soul
I can't go back down to Raiford
I can't take that anymore

[Verse 2]
Well these last few years behind me
Oh Lord, have been so sad
I fought proudly for my country when the times were bad
Now they say I'm guilty, when they find me I must die
Only me and Jesus know that I never stole a dime
Well when Vietnam was over there was no work here for me
I had a pretty wife awaiting and two kids I had to feed
Well I'm one of America's heroes and when they shoot me down
Won't fly old Glory proudly, put my medals in the ground

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Well he's trucking on down from Memphis
Cruisin' down to New Orleans
Tonight he sleeps alone with a Cajun queen
Well there's smoke from the stacks a-blowing
And he don't care where he's going
The only time he feels right is when he's rolling
He's got roadmaps in his hand
Lord, drivin' just as hard as he can
Trying to dodge them scales and the Man
Well I'm talking about
Truck driving man
Yea he'll always give ya, the best that he can

[Chorus]
White cups and coffee, Lord yea
Its all that he needs
And he's all right by me
Truck driving man
Truck on
Truck driver
Shift your gears

[Verse 2]
He's got ladies up in North Dakota
From the Keys man, to Minnesota
And he loves each and every one, least that's what he's told them
Lord, flannel shirts and blue jeans
Truck stops are routine
Tonight he sleeps alone with a Cajun queen
Well I'm talking about
Truck driving man
Yea he'll always give ya, the best that he can

[Chorus]
White cups and coffee, Lord yea
Its all that he needs
And he's all right by me
Truck drivin' man
Guitar
Truck driver

[Verse 3]
Well he's trucking on down from Memphis
Cruisin' down to New Orleans
Tonight he sleeps alone with a Cajun queen
Well there's smoke from the stacks a-blowing
And he don't care where he's going
The only time he feels right is when he's rolling
Well I'm talking about
Truck drivin' man
Yea he'll always give ya, the best that he can

[Chorus]
White cups and coffee, Lord yea
It's all that he needs
And he's all right by me
Truck driving man
I said he's all right by me, truck driving man 

[x2]
Play the guitar
Truck driver

[Verse]
Somewhere the sun is shining
On some unhappy day
Somewhere there's people laughing
They think they've found the way
But its not me
Its not me, no no now
Its not me, Its not me, Its not me, Its not me
I'm not the one
Well sure I used to cry, but I used to laugh to
I had ups as well as downs you see
But I been down now for so long
I've forgotten all my dreams
Yea it must be me
It must be me, you know now
Its not me, Its not me, Its not me, Its not me
I'm not the one in the sun
Since I became I've wondered what I've become
Lord I know it can't be much longer before
I find my place in sun
Sometimes I wonder will I figure something out
Will I find a reason good enough to live
Lord if it don't dawn on me pretty soon
I think something's gonna give
Yea it might be me
Yea it just might be me, yea
Its not me, no it can't be
Because I'm not the one in the sun
No I'm not the one
Yea I'm not the one
But I'm not the one
Sorry to say I'm not the one

[Verse 1]
Mister Banker
Mister please, how much does money mean
Won't you reconsider mister
Won't you do this thing for me

[Chorus]
Ain't got no house
Ain't got no car
All I got, Lord, is my guitar
But you can have that mister banker
Won't you bury my papa for me
Oh mister banker please
Listen to how that sound

[Verse 2]
I would not be here on my knees
But hey mister banker
It means so much to me
Oh won't you reconsider mister
Won't you do this thing for me

[Chorus]
I told you mister
I ain't got no house
Ain't got no car
I got me a 1950 Les Paul guitar
Won't you take it mister banker
Won't you bury my papa for me
Oh mister banker please

[Intro]
Oh Yeah

[Verse 1]
Got a pocket full of memories and my song
Got to keep on moving and rolling on
When I'm playing for keeps, I always win
Don't know where I'm going, but I know where I've been
Yeah!
Looking back when I was a boy
A hand-me-down bike was my toy
A barefoot brother who gave me hell
I Learned from the best who taught me well

[Chorus 1]
I hear that highway calling

[Chorus 2]
Oh, feel the breeze
I've been around playing and gambling but Lord I'm free
Saddle up baby, ride up close to me
An open highway's all I'll ever need
Last of A Dying Breed

[x2]

[Verse 2]
One horse towns and one night stands
Just like my daddy - I'm a Traveling Man
I'm not the kind to settle down
The roar of the engine - I love that sound

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
My poor broke mama told me
When I was twelve years old
You eat and talk much too fast
There's one thing you should know
Take your time my sweet baby
Take your time my blue eyed son
Well you may never have his money
But you won't miss no rich man's fun

[Chorus]
I can never give you money honey
I can never buy you clothes
But the way them women been looking at you
Someday you should have both
If you take your time my sweet baby
Take your time and love them slow
And if you play your cards right
You won't never wait no more

[Verse 2]
Well the ladies like their diamonds
They like their brand new clothes
But I was blessed with plenty of other things they love the most
I take my time with the ladies
I take my time and I love them slow
And since I turned thirteen
Lord, I ain't never wait no more

[Chorus]
I can never give you money honey
I can never buy you clothes
But the way them schoolgirls look at you
Someday you should have both
If you take your time my sweet baby
Take your time and be my son
Well you might never have his money
But you won't miss his fun

[Verse 1]
Angels sing and buzzards fly
Kingdoms fall and rivers rise
It's all the same since a sin is a lie
Some are free but we're all doing time

[Chorus]
One day at a time smell the roses taste the wine
One day at a time no stop signs or red lights
That wheel keeps turning on and on, day and night
No one survives ain't no use in crying
What ain't dead is surely dying one day at a time

[Verse 2]
Money burns and good gold shines
Dreamers dream and finders find
World keeps spinning round and round
Save our souls before it all comes down

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Verse 1]
She’s like fine shine out of a steel mine
She ain’t afraid to get dirty – have a good time
She’s kind of backwoods
She’s kind of psycho
She likes to ride fast on her motorcycle

[Pre-Chorus]
No I can’t forget how she tastes on my lips
She’s as good as it gets

[Chorus]
I like a little bit of Homegrown
She gets me stoned
Oh in her short dress – yeah I’m a mess
I like to get her all alone
She really turns me on
Yeah in her bare feet – sipping sweet tea
A little Homegrown

[Verse 2]
She’s got a gun rack
Knows how to throw ‘em back
She’ll run the table but you’ll never get your money back
She makes me crazy – but she’s my baby
She knows that Jesus is the only one who saves me

[Pre-Chorus]
No I can’t forget how she tastes on my lips
She’s as good as it gets

[Chorus]
I like a little bit of Homegrown
She gets me stoned
Oh in her short dress – yeah I’m a mess
I like to get her all alone
She really turns me on
Yeah in her bare feet – sipping sweet tea
A little Homegrown

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
No I can’t forget how she tastes on my lips
She’s as good as it gets

[Chorus]
I like a little bit of Homegrown
She gets me stoned
Oh in her short dress – yeah I’m a mess
I like to get her all alone
She really turns me on
Yeah in her bare feet – sipping sweet tea
A little Homegrown

[Outro]
A little Homegrown
Ooh, talk about a little Homegrown

[Verse 1]
Mama called this morning, said
'Son won't you come back home?
I ain't been feeling good and
I know it won't be long
Don't keep me waiting
I wanna touch your face again
Oh, what a good life it's been

[Chorus]
Now I'm ready to fly
I wanna see your daddy again
I'm ready to fly
All my family and friends
I know they're out there waiting
In a place beyond the sky
I'm ready to fly

[Verse 2]
Hard times of '69
The war was raging on
That's the reason my daddy left
And never made it back home
It was tough for all of us
But mama smiled everyday
Oh, it's so hard to hear her say

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
She made sure she'd never let us see her cry
But those tears on the pillow she couldn't hide

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[JVZ:] She’s got Mississippi Blood running through her veins
Her mama was a looker from New Orleans

[RM:] Daddy worked hard with a gun in his boot
Blow you away click bang boom boom

[JVZ:] Good ol’ dude said she broke his heart
Threw it on the ground – stomped it hard

[RM:] But I wanna tell you a little song I know
Before they be carving my name in stone

[Chorus]

[BOTH:] Oooh Oooh

[JVZ:] She’s a dirty little thing – crazy as hell

[BOTH:] Oooh Oooh

[RM:] She’s my rock-n’-roll queen – sweet southern bell

[BOTH:] Oooh Oooh

[JVZ:] She’s a lipstick stain on a burned cigarette

[BOTH:] Oooh Oooh

[Verse 2]

[JVZ:] Like an old blues song stuck in my head
Mississippi mud and I’m sinking in

[BOTH:] Oooh Oooh

[BOTH:] Oooh Oooh

[BOTH:] Cut off jeans, tied t-shirt
Drinkin’ from the bottle – rolling in the dirt
Foot on the gas – el camino
“Ridin’ With the King” on the Radio

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

[BOTH:] Like an old blues song stuck in my head
Mississippi mud and I’m sinking in
She reads from the good book just to be bad
Lying in the hay – she likes to move fast
An old blues song stuck in my head
Work all day and

[Chorus]

[Outro]

[BOTH:] Like an old blues song stuck in my head

[JVZ:] Mississippi mud and I’m sinking in

[Verse 1]
He was 5 foot 7
Strong as an Oak tree
Yeah he had a good reason
For every lick he gave me
But he showed me the ropes
Good whiskey and smoke
And how to tell a dirty joke

[Chorus]
I had a good teacher
Half devil, half preacher
He made me a believer
I had a good teacher, teacher
Oh Yeah

[Verse 2]
She was 6 foot 1
Shaking that money thing
I was high school dumb
When I had my first tall one
But she gave me a sip
And a kiss on the lips
She let me give her one more

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I graduated from the school of hard knocks yeah
Learned from the best all the tricks to get by
But I gotta give credit where credit is due
I wasn't born no fool

[Chorus]

[Outro]
She was my teacher
She was a really good teacher
She made me a believer
Lord I had some good teachers
Some really good teachers!

[Verse 1]
What the hell have we done
To get this far down?
Yeah take a look at us now
And what we’ve become
Seems like we’re taking care of everybody else
But we forgot our own
A soldier, a beggin’ man
Yeah another homeless child

[Chorus]
Give us something to live for
Somethin’ we can hold on to
Somethin’ to believe in
Like the love between me and you
Caught up in a game that I know we can win
To lose it all now – oh, what a sin
I’ll keep my faith – no I’ll never change
Give us something to live for
Give us something to live for

[Verse 2]
All of us took a left
When we should’ve gone right
Oh what happened to us brothers and sisters?
Now all we do is fight
Yeah face to face
And eye to eye
How do we mend this broken heart?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We all need something to believe in
Going down a dead end road
Like a freight train on the tracks
Lord – carrying a heavy load
Oh and it’s about to break us in half

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Just when you think you’ve got it figured out
It comes along and hits you in the mouth
You think your day can’t get no worse
Your Heaven falls and hits you where it hurts
You wake up smiling on a sunny day
The clouds pour in and then it’s pouring rain

[Chorus]
If you blink you’ll miss it
‘Cause life’s twisted
Like a black snake on a highway
Like a flat tire on a Friday
If you let it man – it’s gonna kick your ass
Life’s twisted like a back road in the country
Like a switch blade in an alley
Let me tell you boy – you better watch your back
Life’s twisted like that
Yeah Life’s Twisted

[Verse 2]
You build your dreams with your own two hands
You find out life has other plans
You think you finally found the one way out
You’re driving North but you’re flying South
Sometime’s you’ve gotta risk it
‘Cause life’s twisted
Like a black snake on a highway
Like a flat tire on a Friday
If you let it man – it’s gonna kick your ass
Life’s twisted like a back road in the country
Like a switch blade in an alley
Let me tell you boy – you better watch your back

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Life’s Twisted

Like a black snake on a highway
Like a flat tire on a Friday
If you let it man – it’s gonna kick your ass
Life’s twisted like a back road in the country
Like a switch blade in an alley
Let me tell you boy – you better watch your back

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah Life’s Twisted
Life’s Twisted
Oh
Life’s Twisted
Life’s Twisted like that
Life’s Twisted like that
Life’s Twisted

[Verse 1]
You may not believe it
But I don't believe in miracles anymore
And when I think about it
I don't believe I ever did for sure
All the things I've said in songs
All the purple prose you bought from me
Reality's just black and white
The sentimental things I'd write
Never meant that much to me

[Chorus]
I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles headin' west
Pickin' up my pain from door to door
Ridin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

[Verse 2]
You don't need to hear it
But I'm dried up and sick to death of love
And if you need to know it
I never really understood that stuff
All the stars and bleeding hearts
All the tears that welled up in my eyes
Never meant a thing to me
Read 'em, as they say, and weep
I never felt enough to cry

[Chorus]
I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles headin' west
Pickin' up my pain from door to door
Ridin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

[Bridge]
When I say that I don't care
It really means my engine's breakin' down
The chisel chips my heart again
The granite cracks beneath my skin
I crumble into pieces on the ground

[Chorus]
I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles headin' west
Pickin' up my pain from door to door
Ridin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

[Outro]
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
There's a little place down in Jackson County
Right off the river road
If you wanna take a ride to the end of the rainbow
Find yourself a pot of gold
Everybody asks me where I'm going
Yeah everybody wants to know
Your sister says she wants to come along with me
I know she really wants to go
Yeah I know she really wants to go

[Chorus]
Down, Down, Down, Down
Down is where I wanna go
Down, Down, Down, Down
Down to the Honey Hole

[Verse 2]
If you wanna check it out on a hot summer night
Climb over the garden wall
Grab your little baby and hold her tight
Underneath the sugar falls
Underneath the sugar falls

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sugarcane grows wild in the fields
Like corn sticky yellow sweet
Late at night you can hear 'em all buzzing
Searching for the Queen bee
Calling for the Queen bee

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Money can't buy you happiness
And that drinking can cause you pain
Yeah that stuff you put up your nose
It can drive you insane
Why do you do these things?
You're killing yourself each day
So you better get down on your knees
And ask the good Lord to take it away

[Chorus]
Let the rain stop falling
Let the sun shine again
Let your heart stop crying
Let the good Lord be with you my friend
And start living life again

[Verse 2]
Time with your family is precious
Take a good look at yourself
You've been burning the candle at both ends
Don't you think it's time to got help?
Let your spirit fly and you won't need to get high anymore
Ask him into your life
Cause he can open up ANY door

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
There ain't no poor man
Born with a silver spoon
And there ain't no wise man
Who learned it all in school
A politician's promise
Can make you feel like a fool
But when they get the power
They're the first to break the golden rule

[Chorus 1]
We work that 40 acres like riders on a mule

[Chorus 2]
Climb that mountain
Reach the sky
Hanging on for a good laugh
For a piece of that American pie
Hey nothings easy
Nothings for free
In the world of dog eat dog
Oh people, that's a poor man's dream

[Verse 2]
Hey Mr. walton
Lend me a dime
You know I'll repay ya
But it's going to take me some time
I'm standing at the crossroads
Just about to roll the dice
I got a dream in my heart
Whatever it takes
I know I gotta pay the price

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
Hey nothings easy
Nothings for free
In the world of dog eat dog
Oh people, that's a poor man's dream

[Outro]
Oh... It's a poor man's dream

[Verse 1]
Yeah she's sitting at the table looking down at her drink
She's always on time - I'm always running late
Yeah I was on my way
But I got sidetracked
Yeah Gary called me up
Said Rickey's in a jam
Come on over brother - She'll understand
Meet me at the truck
We got some planning to do

[Chorus]
I've been bad
I've been good
Don't always do the things that I should
When I go - I go all night
But when I do it wrong
I do it up right

[Verse 2]
I looked at my watch - it was a quarter to three
I knew she'd be up there waiting on me
I-I-I-I got some explaining to do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So I headed straight home
I ain't gonna lie
Ain't got no excuses
No alibi's
I said I was sorry
She said I've heard it before
Some come on over here boy

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
Baby I do it up right
Oh I'm going to do it up right
Oh, I do it up right

[Verse 1]
And we could fight this all night long
There is no right - there is no wrong
Love ain't easy - sometimes it is so blind
The things we said were not so kind

[Chorus]
What you see is what you get
I ain't that old - I'm not dead yet
All those words we said
Are in my head
Now all I got left
Is this Sad Song

[Verse 2]
Something old and something new
Something borrowed but now I'm blue
I stood against the world with you
But now I know baby our love is through

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
After all this time gone by
Now I sit here and wonder why
Yeah - I'm still here and baby you are gone
All I got left
Is this Sad Song

Sad sad song

Oh

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
It said 3:30 on my watch
Big show don't start 'till 9:00
Thought a cold one sure would hit the spot
She started pouring shots
It was only me and her in there
Let's get outta here
Might lose my job but I don't care
Come along if you dare
Lay down my tailgate
Hey boy...What'you say?

[Chorus]
Do a little day drinking
A little bit of love making
A whole lot of world shaking
Then we'll do it again
Do it again
Start from the sun shining
Go until the stars are in the sky
Boy don't you leave me hanging
Cause it's never too late
To get down and dirty
Oh Down and Dirty

[Verse 2]
I turned up her radio
She started dancing real slow
Like she was putting on a show
3 hours left to rock and roll
Wet sweat was pouring off her skin
Her body made me wanna sin
Right then my buzz was kicking in
She had a devil's grin
And then a bus drove by
She flipped them the bird
She looked me in the eye and said
You give me the urge!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Do a little day drinking
A little bit of love making

[Chorus]

[Verse]
He was a poor boy, raised in a small family
He kinda had a craving for something no one else could see
They say that he was crazy, the kind that no lady should meet
He ran out to the city and wandered around in the street
He wants to dance, oh yeah
He wants to sing, oh yeah
He wants to see the lights a flashing
And listen to the thundering
He saw it in a window, the mark of a new kind of man
He kind of liked the feeling, so shiny and smooth in his hand
He took it to the country and practiced for days without rest
And then one day he felt it, he knew he could stand with the best
They got respect, oh yeah
He wants the same, oh yeah
And it's a certain kind of fool
Who likes to hear the sound of his own name
A poster on a storefront, the picture of a wanted man
He had a reputation spreading like fire through the land
It wasn't for the money, at least it didn't start that way
It wasn't for the running, but now he's running everyday

[Introduction]

[Chorus]
God save us, everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hands, sins of our tongue
Sins of our father, the sins of our young
God save us, everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hands, sins of our tongue
Sins of our father, the sins of our young

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I am an Outlaw, I was born an Outlaw's son
The highway is my legacy
On the highway I will run
In one hand I've a Bible
In the other I've got a gun
Well, don' you know me, I'm the man who won

[Chorus]
Woman don't try to love me
Don't try to understand
A life upon the road
Is the life of an outlaw man

[Verse 2]
First left my woman, it was down in Santa Fe
Headed for Oklahoma, I was riding night and day
All of my friends are strangers
They quickly come and go
And all my love's in danger
Because I steal hearts and souls

[Chorus]

[x2]
Woman, don't try to love me
Don't try to understand
A life upon the road
Is the life of an outlaw man

[Verse 3]
Some men call me Abel
Some men call me Cain
Some men call me Sinner, Lord
Some men call me Saint
Some say there's a Jesus
Some men say there ain't
When you got no life to lose
Then there's nothing left to gain

[Outro]
Outlaw man
Outlaw man

[Intro]
Ya
One, two, three
Two, two, three

[Verse 1]
Seems like a dream now, it was so long ago
The moon burned so bright and the time went so slow
And I swore that I loved her and gave her a ring
The bluebird was high on the wing

[Chorus]
Whatever happened to Saturday night
Finding a sweetheart and holding her tight?
She said, "Tell me, oh, tell me, was I all right?"
Whatever happened to Saturday night?

[Verse 2]
The years brought the railroad it ran by my door
Now there's boards on the windows and dust on the floor
And she passes the time at another man's side
And I pass the time with my pride
What a tangled web we weave?
Go around with circumstance
Someone show me how to tell
The dancer from the dance

[Chorus]
Whatever happened to Saturday night
Choosing a friend and losing a fight?
She said, "Tell me, oh, tell me, are you all right?"
Whatever happened to Saturday night?
Whatever happened to Saturday night?

Once I was young and so unsure
I'd try any ill to find the cure
An old man told me
Tried to scold me
"Whoa, son, don't wade too deep
In Bitter Creek"
(Bitter Creek)

Out where the desert meets the sky
Is where I go when I wanna hide
Oh, peyote (oh, peyote, oooh...)
She tried to show me (tried to show me)
You know there ain't no cause to weep
At Bitter Creek
(Bitter Creek)

We're gonna hit the road for one last time
We can walk right in and steal 'em blind
All that money (all that money, oooh...)
No more runnin' (no more runnin')
I can't wait to see the old man's face
When I win the race
(Bitter Creek)

[Verse 1]
I had to sit there and listen to poetry all day
And I tried to escape but they won't let run away
So I tried to hide, but they wouldn't let me hide
So I tried to find you, but I couldn't find you anywhere

[Verse 2]
And I was sitting next to you in the biology lecture
And I pretended I didn't understand just to capture your attention
And then I smiled, and then you smiled
And then I smiled, and it was all worth my while, oh
All worth my while

[Chorus 1]
But later on by the sofa, I wanted to kiss you, I wanted to kiss you
But I couldn't get that close, no, I couldn't get that close
And when you opened your eyes
It was like you didn't wanna see my face in your personal space
And I wanted to run away, yeah, I wanted to run away
Cause I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me, yeah
But obviously not, yeah
I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me, yeah
But obviously not

[Verse 3]
And I once told someone, they should write some golden poetry
Cause it would get them far in the music industry
It'd do them good
And I guess that's what I'm doing now
I'm doing good, yeah
I knew I'd have to do it sometime

[Verse 4]
And I hope I get to see you on February the 14th
Cause then I might be able to try this whole thing again some other time
Oh, you can be my Valentine
Oh, it's the time
Will you be my Valentine, -tine, Valentine?

[Chorus 1]
But later on by the sofa, I wanted to kiss you, I wanted to kiss you
But I couldn't get that close, no, I couldn't get that close
And when you opened your eyes
It was like you didn't wanna see my face in your personal space
And I wanted to run away, yeah, I wanted to run away
Cause I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me, yeah
But obviously not, yeah
I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me, yeah
But obviously not

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm starting to worry that I'm sounding like The Fray
Cause I hate the way they talk about sadness and life decay
But they must talk some sense if the knew how to save a life
But I never talk sense, no, I haven't done this right
Oh, I'm starting to worry that I'm sounding like The Fray
Cause I hate the way they talk about sadness and life decay
But they must talk some sense if the knew how to save a life
But I never talk sense, no, I haven't done this right

[Chorus 2]
Last year on the sofa, I wanted to kiss you, I wanted to kiss you
But I couldn't get that close, no, I couldn't get that close
And when you opened your eyes
It was like you didn't wanna see my face in your personal space
And I wanted to run away, yeah, I wanted to run away
I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me, yeah
But obviously not, yeah
I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me
But obviously not, no

[Outro]
No, no, no, no
Obviously not, yeah, yeah, oh
Nah nah, yeah
Oh oh

[Verse 1]
My mom is my hero

The doctor was lookin' at a star
From then I've been strictly on a mission
I got twenty-twenty vision
All the haters I can spot them from far, I'm sure
Jamacains on slash date
Probably representin' and bringing it home
After I sing my songs, I duck trouble but it keep on lurkin'
Things going to well the devil start workin

[Chorus]
I see them coming from afar
I got my eyes open tough luck for ya'll

Spitting a big ticket number one in the track
Ease along, baby say ease the bar

[Verse 4]
The one and only
Haters got nothing on me
I can feel the vibe
I see it in their eyes
They praying for my demise
They don't want to see me blow yo
Rather see me low low
Or I be on the floor yo
But no yo
I'm pull through this game of tug o' war
What you fellas fussing for
Maybe cause i'm grubbing more
None the less, i'm paying my dues
Don't hate me
A little hard work will get you here too

[Bridge]

Everybody got faith and yelling cause my hot style

I'ma reign supreme until the day i drop down

[Chorus]
I see them coming from afar

[Chorus]
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that you would be the don?
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn?
Did you ever think that you would be this paid?
Were there times when your ass was real afraid?
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours?
Have a show with fifty million viewers?

[Verse 1]
I used to think about how I was gonna make it
Struggling day to day just trying to get this paper
Hoping the day would come when things would go my way
But now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say

[Chorus]
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that you would be the don?
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn?
Did you ever think that you would be this paid?
Were there times when your ass was real afraid?
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours?
Have a show with fifty million viewers?

[Verse 2]
Now I've been around the world and seen so many things
Partied in every club, nothing but VIP
I never take for granted these luxuries I have
Just try my best to answer all of these questions that I ask

[Chorus]
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that you would be the don?
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn?
Did you ever think that you would be this paid?
Were there times when your ass was real afraid?
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours?
Have a show with fifty million viewers?

[Verse 3]
I used to play the game, at night the same old same
Dreamin' about city lights it was my only lie
And now it's world wide shows
As if I can fly on over
Now I can't go nowhere without the whole world due to know

[Chorus]
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that you would be the don?
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn?
Did you ever think that you would be this paid?
Were there times when your ass was real afraid?
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours?
Have a show with fifty million viewers?

[Verse 4]
I used to dream about this life
Now I'm sitting on first class flights
Now they all wanna know

[Chorus]
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that you would be the don?
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn?
Did you ever think that you would be this paid?
Were there times when your ass was real afraid?
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours?
Have a show with fifty million viewers?

[Hook]
Well early in the morning when the sun comes up (what's up?)
Kenny's on the corner selling meth to Chuck (uh-huh)
Now Chuck's headed back to Los Angeles
Everything's not, everything's not love
Well early in the morning when the sun comes up (what's up?)
Kenny's on the corner selling meth to Chuck (uh-huh)
Now Chuck's headed back to Los Angeles
Everything's not, everything's not love

[Verse 1:B.o.B]
Well every single morning down by them tracks (uh huh)
There dude was a dude named Kenny who was selling them sacks (got that work)
Client after client, they would come right back
He'd give em the stuff and they'd give him the cash (yes)
Now Kenny's on his hustle, yeah, he's on his grind (uh huh)
Money's on his mind strictly all of the time (get money)
But there was one customer who'd come to buy
He was looking for ice, not nicks, not dimes (okay)
He ain't know his name so he called him Chuck (Chuck)
And he was in a Benz when he pulled up
He wasn't from the hood, he's just passing by
Black shoes, black car, black shirt, black tie
So Chuck pulled off and the po pulled up
Wasn't no back door so Kenny was stuck
And now he's in the precinct sitting in cuffs
Just waiting for the trial date

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Well in the city of LA around Beverly Hills
On top of the mountain there's a beautiful crib
A man and his wife and his family lives
He get a decent salary, he paying the bills
But everything ain't just what it seems
Outside looking in it's the American dream
Behind closed doors, he's really a fiend
Addicted to meth and he snorts OC
So one day he pulls up to work
Hops out this car and fixes his shirt
He walks in and the whole court just rises (rise)
The Honorable Chuck Blumstein presiding (be seated)
Oh, and what a pleasant surprise (huh?)
Kenny sits there right in front of his eyes (ain't that Chuck?)
But he don't hesitate, looks him right in his face
And with three hits of his gavel, he seals his fate

[Produced by Nez & Rio]

[Intro]
Is it recording?
Love is life, and life is living
Fuckin' awesome, yeah!

You have reached the voicemail box of: Suck it

Hey, Em. What's going on? It's Paul. Uh, I wanted to call you to let you know we're getting ready to shoot the "Monster" video. We got dates for Rihanna and she's gonna come out to Detroit and we can get it shot. We've got some concepts together based on your conversations with Rich Lee and I think we're ready to go.

So the basic concept is sort of like an Inception-type of vibe. The whole video sort of happens inside of your head and Rihanna, in the beginning, is gonna act as your therapist. And you answer into her office, you sit down and you sort of fall asleep or drift off; we're not really sure. And next thing you know, you're travelling in this elevator and the elevator sort of represents your journey and your career. And there's various stops along the way. We're gonna recreate some scenes from some of your classic moments.

I had to go home and get my straightjacket. Redoing this scene actually brings back no memories for me because I don't remember it. Dr Dre would say, "I'm glad to see you got your coat back on. The way things should be."

The scene from the "My Name Is" video, with you in the straightjacket and Dre as your therapist in the psychiatrist's office there.The song which recieved an Oscar for you ,yes "Lose yourself" will also be included. We're gonna go back and revisit "The Way I Am", with you jumping off the building, falling through the sky, with everything moving past you. And then we're also gonna do the classic Grammy scene, with you and Elton John performing "Stan".

[Eminem does an impersonation of Elton John performing Stan at the 2001 Grammy Performance]
"I can't see it all. Even if I could, it'll all be grey. But your picture on my wall, it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad".

So, all these things are going on in your head. You're travelling through the elevator, looking at it from a new perspective, with you watching yourself. And then when you finally get to the end of your journey in the elevator, you come out and you see this sort of caged beast. And the beast is actually Slim Shady.

Slim Shady's inside of this cage and you walk up and you don't really know what's going on. And then you see it's actually yourself. And Slim Shady's feeding you some notes and we can just assume that the notes might be some lyrics or some song titles scribbled on them. And the idea that you keep feeding Slim Shady with fame and all of the things that go along with it. And the songs'll keep coming back out.

So, it's really kind of a trip. It's very surreal. Less performance than some of your recent videos but this is more cinematic and it's more of a story through this journey.

So, anyway. Call me back after you listen to this. Um, I sent the treatment over, read through it and get ready for some really long days. Later.
I'm done. It's a wrap. Uh, I never want to perform in these clothes again. Way too small. I'm try'na go, like, quadruple X next time. So, these clothes are a fucking wrap too. Peace out.

And goodnight. Give it up for him, folks. Thank you very much.
Music.

I had met Paul, Em's manager, a few years ago and we always talked about the possibility of getting together to work on something at some point down the road. We just worked out it was meant to be at this time. I think it's unlike any current hip hop songs. If you listen to what's going on in hip hop, this is not what this is. Em wanted to do something kind of throwback to some of the early records that we were making in the old days. And it more reflects that energy of the early days of hip hop.

We were in the studio working on a bunch of different ideas and this was one of the later ones to come up. It started with a sample and the sample that we started with ended up not being in the record. The song sort of evolves. It started one way, it kind of got programmed and written to and then it changed into a whole different song.

And I felt the track was really strong and didn't really know what direction Em was gonna go in vocally. And then when I heard the vocals, that was pretty, exciting because it was not at all what I was expecting. And just the energy in it and the lyrics and the style of it. It's so well done and so smart and so funny. It's just great. In this song, we ended up using a wired guitar and hook and everything else pretty much is programmed.

It reminds me of old hip hop videos and I think it's really entertaining and I look forward to see it all put together and done. But in the shooting stages, the pieces I've seen look really entertaining.
We'll storm the walls
We'll storm the walls of this town
We're taking out
We're taking over all your shops
And all your sons and daughters

And we'll watch you
Running
And you'll feel the wrath of my sword
And, well so long
To your brother
I never liked him anyway

Let's take a walk
Let's take a walk
Right, new town

You find yourself lost
You pass the steps
But use the breadcrumb trails
What Hansel and Gretel left
And we'll watch you
Running
Playmobils and building blocks
Won't distract you from your lego, lego

Top of the wall
Shouting
(EYO EYO)
You're over the top
Because
The lights are on in Bordello, -dello, -dello, -dello

And we eventually gave up
We’ll eventually gave up, who you?
We eventually, that’s who
Know what this means!
This means war!
Hey, do you know me?
Watching you stand, out, oh
Oh!

And we're not frightened, not at all
And we're not frightened, not at all
And we're not frightened not at all

And we are
We are kings
We are kings
We are kings

[Verse 1]
I wake up
With my eyes shut tight
Hoping tomorrow will never come
For you and I

[Verse 2]
Oh, the phantoms
Crawl out of the night
Hoping the daylight will never come
For you and I

[Chorus]
Keep your heart open and your eyes shut tight
What will be, will be
Keep your heart open and your eyes shut tight
But don't forget about me

[Verse 3]
Oh, the phantoms
Crawl out of the night
Hoping tomorrow will never come
For you and I

[Chorus]
Keep your heart open and your eyes shut tight
What will be, will be
Keep your heart open and your eyes shut tight
But don't forget about me

[Verse 4]
I wake up
With my eyes shut tight
Hoping tomorrow will never come
For you and I

[Outro]
Hoping tomorrow will never come
For you and I
For you and I
For you and I
For you and I

[Verse]
Shall I tell you about my life
They say I'm a man of the world
I've flown across every tide
And I've seen lots of pretty girls
I guess I've got everything I need
I wouldn't ask for more
And there's no one I'd rather be
But I just wish that I'd never been born
And I need a good woman
To make me feel like a good man should
I don't say I'm a good man
Oh, but I would be if I could
I could tell you about my life
And keep you amused I'm sure
About all the times I've cried
And how I don't want to be sad anymore
And how I wish I was in love

[Verse 1]
I'm stuck in the TARDIS
Trapped in hyperspace
One minute, snake charming
The next in a motorcade

[Verse 2]
All the right moves and
In the right places
Watch me dance, I'm a puppet
You can almost see the strings

[Verse 3]
Give me an answer
Give me a line
I've been climbing up this ladder
I've been wasting my time

[Bridge]
Up on the ladder we're all tied to a stake
Up on the ladder we wait for your mistake
Up on the ladder, try to call out your name
Up on the ladder you're all the fucking same

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, DJ Drama]
Your body is a blessing, ain't no second-guessing
And got no competition 'cause shawty, you the bestest
Ain't no hesitation, tryna get you naked
You got something I wanna see
(I'm in my zone, baby)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Your clothes look good but they'd look great on the floor
So hurry up and take 'em off
Don't act like we ain't did this before
So baby, let's go and bring your body over here

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, you want it all the time and I do too
Can we get really freaky?
However you want, girl, it's up to you
Take it all off, all off
Want you naked in the dark, oh-woah
Take it all off, all off
However you want, girl, it's up to you, you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Your body is a blessing, ain't no second-guessing
And got no competition 'cause shawty, you the best—
(DJ Babey Drew)
Body is a blessing, ain't no second-guessing
And got no competition 'cause shawty, you the bestest
Ain't no hesitation, tryna get you naked
You got something I wanna see

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Your clothes look good but they'd look great on the floor
So hurry up and take 'em off
Don't act like we ain't did this before
So baby, let's go and bring your body over here

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, you want it all the time and I do too

However you want, girl, it's up to you, you

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
And I wanna do something nasty tonight, night, night, night
And everything you do to me, girl, it feels so right, right right, right
Love when you feeling me, I got you moaning
You ain't gon' go asleep, not until morning
Giving you chills down your spine, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Your clothes look good but they'd look great on the floor
So hurry up and take 'em off
Don't act like we ain't did this before
So baby, let's go and bring your body over here

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, you want it all the time and I do too
Can we get really freaky? (Girl)
However you want, girl, it's up to you (What do you want?)
Take it all off, all off (Take it off)
Want you naked in the dark, oh-woah (Want you naked in the dark)
Take it all off, all off (Take it off)
However you want, girl, it's up to you, you

[Refrain: Kevin McCall, Se7en, Chris Brown]
Where them lovely ladies at? Right here, boy
Where them sexy ladies at? Right here, boy
Where them lovely ladies at? Right here, boy

Where them sexy ladies at? Right here, boy (I hope they right there)
Where them lovely ladies at? Right here, boy

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, you want it all the time and I do too (Woo, woo)
Can we get really freaky? (Woo)
However you want, girl, it's up to you (Yeah, yeah)
Take it all off, all off
Want you naked in the dark, oh-woah (Yeah, yeah)
Take it all off, all off (Oh-woah)
However you want, girl, it's up to you, you
Every day's the same
Devoid of anything
Walking around the broken fences
And see never empty land
But I don't really mind
It's just so hard to find
??? and the rain's gone
For a little piece of mind

All I'm trying to define is the elegant design
It's gonna take so many words, I'm trippin' fast for time
Mountains crash into the sea, but it doesn't seem to worry me

I only think of you

Take the busy way
That's what my friends all say
But I don't think they really get the point
Of elegant sweet day
I'm sure it's gonna end
I may not have any friends
But at the end of the day, I think I'll be okay
If I work it out instead
All I'm trying to define is the elegant design
It's gonna take so many words, I'm trippin' past for time
Mountains crash into the sea, but it doesn't seem to worry me

I only think of you
I only think of you

[Intro]
I been searching for myself
I been wondering who I am
Lost in a place, no trace
On the odyssey to me

[Skit]
"Eh, yo, pass the blunt nigga"
"Hold on man, hold on"
(laughing) "Ah, shit."
"Hey man, what you laughing for?"
"Hey, you see that nigga Adam over there trying to rap and shit?"
"Word?"
"Yeah, the nigga calling himself Amine."
"For real?"
"Yeah, that nigga need to give it up."

[Verse 1]
I woke up in Tribeca
Next to my dream girl Rebekah
She saying anywhere you go
I'm headed to my next tour
And guess what
I gotta go
I gotta go
I gotta go
I gotta go

[Verse 2]
Headed to that Madison Square
25,000 fans in the air
Never see L.A
If she wanna play
Never hit the back
'Cause niggas wanna play
Traffic on the way

[?] I'm late
Driver screaming get them cars up out my fucking way
If you like my style
You gon' hit inside the dials
I got too much on my mind
You got too much on the route
I say sound check, mic check 1 - 2, 1 - 2
I'm getting ready to perform nigga
How 'bout you
I'm rolling in that thong
She rolling in that calm
I'm getting ready and the fans go away

[Interlude]
Adam, Adam wake up

[Verse 3]
Gazing at my wall
Hoping for a better tomorrow
Thinking bout my problems but my problems looking mighty hard
A small nigga with big dreams, I'm thinking 'bout
All them honey and dope fiends like
How you end up there
How you end up broke
If I end up like that, it's going to be hard to find hope
I'm trying to find the mountain of success with the best
And it's going to be hard to find a fucking rope, oh

[Chorus]
You are now tuned in to the fucking OTM
You are now tuned in to my fucking OTM
This ain't an intro
This is a book, ho
Just hoping you can help me write the rest, though
You are now tuned in to the fucking OTM
You are now tuned in to my fucking OTM
This ain't an intro
This is a book, ho
Just hoping you can help me write the rest, though

[Verse 3]
I ain't a stereotype, I'm a stereo
I let my words speak louder than a punk show
As I was writing this shit
I got a text from my old girl
Talking 'bout she wanna be more than sober
Asking if I wanna go
To the movies though
I told her, "Sorry girl
I'm in the studio"
She said, "LOL, the studio?
Come on Adam
You'll probably never make it though"
A heartfelt mind with a heartfelt dick
Only thing I bust in hoes
Is the pain that exists

[Chorus]
You are now tuned in to the fucking OTM
You are now tuned in to my fucking OTM
This ain't an intro
This is a book, ho
Just hoping you can help me write the rest, though
You are now tuned in to the fucking OTM
You are now tuned in to my fucking OTM
This ain't an intro
This is a book, ho
Just hoping you can help me write the rest, though

[Verse 4]
I'm trying to tell you things that you would have never thought of
I'm trying to tell you things so you wouln't get caught up in
All the lies of this rapping shit
These dumb niggas trying to tell you who they is
'Cause rapping is an art coming straight from the heart
Not about your flashy clothes or the chains that you got
We've came a long way
From that crying beat now
Let Irv kill it on the keys like

[Chorus]
You are now tuned in to the fucking OTM
You are now tuned in to my fucking OTM
This ain't an intro
This is a book, ho
Just hoping you can help me write the rest, though
You are now tuned in to the fucking OTM
You are now tuned in to my fucking OTM
This ain't an intro
This is a book, ho
Just hoping you can help me write the rest, though

[Outro]
You are now tuned in to the OTM

[Skit]
Jalissa: Hello?
Jalissa's Friend: So, Jalissa
Jalissa: What?
Jalissa's Friend: I heard, you did it with Tory
Jalissa: Who you heard I did Tory from now?
Jalissa's Friend: The block bitch and you not low
Jalissa: The block? If it was up to the block, I would have fucked the whole block. Please, nobody checkin' for that
Jalissa's Friend: Yeah yeah yeah, whatever, so how was it?
Jalissa: It was nothin', this is the same Tory I used to play back in the day
Jalissa's Friend: Obviously it wasn't the same Tory, you was all up in this nigga's car
Jalissa: Okay, I might have sat in his car, I might have went home with him and let him smash. So what? If I could go back to that day right now, I would have never let that nigga fuck
Jalissa's Friend: Yeah, yeah
Jalissa: I'm about to go to his house right now and smash every window out his motherfuckin' car. Because that nigga is nothin' but a dirtbag. He is a lowdown, dirty, piece of shit. He is nothin' but a motherfuckin' scrub.
New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

Like a rat in a cage
Pulling minimum wage

New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

New York, you're safer
And you're wasting my time

Our records all show
You are filthy but fine

But they shuttered your stores
When you opened the doors
To the cops who were bored
Once they'd run out of crime
New York, you're perfect
Don't please don't change a thing

Your mild billionaire mayor's
Now convinced he's a king

So the boring collect
I mean all disrespect

In the neighborhood bars
I'd once dreamt I would drink

New York, I Love You
But you're freaking me out

There's a ton of the twist
But we're fresh out of shout

Like a death in the hall
That you hear through your wall

New York, I Love You
But you're freaking me out

New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down
New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

Like a death of the heart
Jesus, where do I start?

But you're still the one pool
Where I'd happily drown

And oh.. Take me off your mailing list
For kids that think it still exists
Yes, for those who think it still exists

Maybe I'm wrong
And maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And myabe you're right

Maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And just maybe you're right

And Oh..
Maybe mother told you true
And they're always be something there for you
And you'll never be alone
But maybe she's wrong
And maybe I'm right
And just maybe she's wrong

Maybe she's wrong
And maybe I'm right
And if so, is there?

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Clarity is a state of mind
Freedom ain't real, who's sold you that lie?
I ain't buying it
No matter what the price (one more time? I'm sorry)
So give it up, give it up mama
Undo your pants and your bra
I see you liking that, you must need a slice
Type A personality
Extrovert, introvert, commonalities
A Type A personality
Just dumb enough to lie to me

[Chorus]
You are, you are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are, you are (we are)
You are, you are, you are, you are (we are)
You are, you are, you are, you are

[Verse 2]
Superficial superwoman
Ain't you tired of that wind in your face?
Your skin taste likes brussell sprouts I swear
Can't seem to remember your face
So give it up, give it up papa
Make it make sense to me
I can not go any further
Than 2 steps in-front of me, I'm lost here

Dum dum dum, dum dum dum
Dum dum dum, dum dum dum
Dum dum dum, dum dum
(Whoa whoa, whoa whoa, whoa)
Dum dum dum, dum dum dum
(Whoa whoa, whoa whoa, whoa)
Dum dum dum, dum dum dum
Dum dum dum, dum dum dum

[Chorus]
You are, you are, you are, you are (we are)
You are, you are, you are, you are (we are)
Dumb enough to lie to me
You are, you are, you are, you are

[Outro]
(Whoa whoa, whoa whoa, whoa)
(we are) (we are) (we are)
(Whoa whoa, whoa whoa, whoa)

[Verse 1]
I do come from miles away
Haven't got no place to stay
Glad to help you plow your fields

[Chorus]
Farmer's daughter

[Verse 2]
Might be just a couple of days
Clean up rest and on my way
Thank you and I'm must obliged

[Chorus]
Farmer's daughter
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 3]
So long better leave your land
Many thanks it was mighty grand
I do hope to see you again

[Chorus]
Ooh, farmer's daughter

[x4]

[Verse 1]
Let the church say amen
Release all my sins at the pulpit
It's the beginning
It's the beginning Of Mice and Men
You hold my hand as an infant
Palms to the sky, Adonai, Ya Allah
Till they all come down
Till we all fall down
Down

[Chorus]
Lines drawn in the sand
Keep the sun at your back
Keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
Just ride
When you don't know yourself
If it hurts you to explain your God in my eyes
Just ride
Lines drawn in the sand
Keep the sun at your back
Keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
Just ride

[Verse 2]
Up here the air is so thin
Mountains on my fingertips
I stand at the tippy, screaming at the top of my lungs
Tears in my eyes
Adonai, Ya Allah, answer my calls if you hear me
Adonai, Ya Allah, answer my calls if you're near me

[Chorus]
Lines drawn in the sand
Keep the sun at your back
Keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
Just ride
When you don't know yourself
If it hurts you to explain your God in my eyes
Just ride
Lines drawn in the sand
Keep the sun at your back
Keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
Just ride
When you don't know yourself
If it hurts you to explain your God in my eyes
Just ride

[Outro]
It's the beginning
It's the beginning
It's the beginning
It's the beginning

[Part I]

[Intro: SZA]
Hey, hey, glory child, hey

[Verse 1]
Hey, glory child, don't you worry
Stuttering and shaken out of fear
Beauty's never given in a hurry
So condescending, leave your questions here
Hey, glory child, don't you worry
I can see your skeleton so clear
Doubting's only made your visions blurry
You're better off just looking in the mirror

[Chorus]
Show me a better way, I wish you could
Show me a better way, I wish you would
Come home today
You could come home today

[Verse 2]
I am shooting stars, don't you see me?
Watching over your every mistake
Digging out of graves is never easy
Handing you my shovel here to take
Always playing catch-me-if-you-can
Gingerbread—you heard I'm sweet to taste
Close your eyes, let go, and count to ten
I'll keep track of every moment wasted

[Chorus]
Show me a better way, I wish you could
Show me a better way, I wish you would
Come home today
You could come home today

[Part 2]

[Intro: SZA + Isaiah Rashad]
Dear God, make me a bird
So I can fly far, far, far away
Dear God, make me a bird
So I can fly far, far, far away
Dear God, make me a bird
So I can fly far, far, far away
Warm winds on a space ride (space ride)
When I call your phone on a late night (late night)
I recall your soul had a taste like (taste like)
Gardens, flowers, Warm Winds

[Chorus: SZA + Isaiah Rashad]
The clouds below your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes you hate to leave somebody
What's happening to we?
Warm winds on a space ride
When I call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul had a taste like
Gardens, flowers, Warm Winds
The clouds below your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes you hate to leave somebody
What's happening to we?
Warm winds on a space ride

[Verse 1: SZA]
Sometimes I call your name out loud
Just to make sure it's you
Sometimes I crack my veins open
Just to see if it's blue
You clean me up

[Chorus: SZA + Isaiah Rashad]
The clouds below your feet
Clean
Quit clipping on your wings
Our wings, yeah
Sometimes you hate to leave somebody
You'll see
What's happening to we?
Warm winds on a space ride
When I call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul had a taste like...
Gardens, flowers, warm winds
The clouds below your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes you hate to leave somebody
What's happening to we?
Warm winds on a space ride

[Verse 2: SZA]
Sometimes I bite my lips and close my eyes
Just to pretend it's you
Long live lonely thoughts on Thursday nights
That's when I think of you
We were all thirteen once (once)
Long live tramp stamps and Pepper Ann (Pepper Ann)
You will never judge me for that (Uh-uh)
You will always love me for that (Uh-huh)

[Outro: SZA]
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes you hate to leave somebody
Whats happening to we?
Warm winds on a space ride
When I call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul had taste like
Gardens, flowers

[Produced by Larry Fisherman]

[Verse 1]
Go forth, spread the news
I'm liberated
Go on, cut the rope
I know you hate it
Two knives, no fork
Wonder who'd make it?
I'd lose for you, I choose for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Gun fighting
Fatality, boy
Hell fire, boy
I stay for eternity
For you, for you
For you, for you I'd stay
For you, for you
For you, for you I

[Chorus]
Sometimes I keep you in my mind
Sometimes I let you go up high
I'm using everything I find
Do anything to keep you tied up
Tied up

[Verse 2]
Stationary, birds wings
Small canary, princess
Young savage girl lost among the lily pads
One road no choice, I've given you this
Move moons for you, I choose to do it

[Pre-Chorus]
Gun fighting
Fatality, boy
Hell fire, boy
I stay for eternity
For you, for you
For you, for you I'd stay
For you, for you
For you, for you I

[Bridge]
Uh, uh
Yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes I keep you in my mind
Sometimes I let you go up high
I'm using everything I find
Do anything to keep you tied up
Tied up
Sometimes I keep you in my mind
Sometimes I let you go up high
I'm using everything I find
Do anything to keep you tied up
Tied up

[Verse 1]
I was wrong, and you were cold
I was hoping you might go
You never show me how much you cared
What was going wrong

[Chorus]
I follow you, pretend you want me too
Living the days not there with you
I thought you trust me enough
That all the stupid things, the things I always do
This time with you, I always knew

[Verse 2]
It's been too long since you are gone
I am thinking of you alone
You never show me how much you're scared
What was going wrong

[Chorus]
I follow you, pretend you need me too
Living the days not there with you
I thought you trust me enough
That all the stupid things, the things I always do
This time with you, I always knew

[Bridge]
I need someone
To be close
When at night
My own demons
Sneak under my pillow
Not someone
That comes and goes wherever
I need you here
Stay and show me your love

(I just need you
I don't want to
You don't need me
I just want you)

[Verse 1]
When the dream came
I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane like a smoke ring day
When the wind blows
Now I won't be back till later on
If I do come back at all
But you know me and I miss you now

[Verse 1]
In a strange game
I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came
And you had a chance to see through me
Though the other side was just the same
You can tell my dream is real
Because I love you, can you see me now?

[Saxophone Solo]

[Outro]
Though we rush ahead to save our time
We are only what we feel
And I love you
Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Can you?

[Verse 1]
We resigned the light to someone and hand it to the righteous
We will walk until the right motion
Some time alone, alone to wonder, change your mind, and talk
Waiting around while everyone else is moving on and on, and talk

[Chorus]
Empty home, it’s not the same at all
Draw the line and I’m losing my mind

[Verse 2]
Baby, you’re the one, the one at least until tomorrow, surprise!
We should shine the light on and leave me down
Undergo and over through your eyes, it ain't a compromise
Used to be walking until the dawn, and on and on until the dawn

[Chorus]
Empty home, some time alone, alone
Draw the line and I’m losing my mind
Empty home, it’s not the same at all
Draw the line and I’m losing my mind

[Verse 1]
Shotgun to the back of my heart
I don't turn around to see who let one ring out
Said you'd never do me wrong
Guess we see how that plays out
Is it true? Is it true?

[Hook]
Heading to the Massacre
Bodies arriving every day
What were those shells you heard
Picking the bones up along the way
Let it ring out
Let it ring out
Let it ring out
Let it ring out

[Verse 2]
Sharpshooting in my backyard
Killed a small boy once, never told no one
If it wasn't for my shotgun
He'd be alive and I'd be halfway to heaven
Instead of sitting in the dark, going through hell
You should've been here
Wish you had been here

[Hook]
Heading to the Massacre
Bodies arriving every day
What were those shells you heard
Picking the bones up along the way
Let it ring out
Let it ring out
Let it ring out
Let it ring out

[Reprise]
Shotgun to the back of my heart
I don't turn around to see who let one ring out

Pt. II: I Doubt It

[Outro]
Lately I've been questioning
Am I all that I pretend to be?
I doubt it, I doubt it
Lately I've been questioning
Am I all that I pretend to be?
I doubt it, I doubt it

[Verse 1]
It's up for discussion, up for reprise
Slowly re-thinking if current disguise deceives me
The Shattered Ring
I can see it in your eyes

[Chorus]
Ready or not
Loaded heart with a dagger
Aim for your sweet spot
I know you'd rather be scared of
I know you'd rather I just disappear
Now that I'm here
I know you'd rather

[Verse 2]
Giddy up Goldilocks, you took too long to save me
Bumping that Jadakiss is dangerous for sanity
Open my candy box for you sir, sugar daddy
Look at how drunk we are, spent the night dancing
Spent the night dancing

[Chorus]
Ready or not
Loaded heart with a dagger
Aim for your sweet spot
I know you'd rather be scared of
I know you'd rather I just disappear
Now that I'm here
I know you'd rather

[Bridge]
Take me up, take me up
I wanna live in your hot love balloon
Ready or not
Take me up, take me up
Take me up, take me up
In your hot love balloon
Take me up, take me up
I wanna live in your hot love balloon

[Chorus]
Ready or not
Loaded heart with a dagger
Aim for your sweet spot
I know you'd rather be scared of
I know you'd rather I just disappear
Now that I'm here
I know you'd rather
I know you'd rather
I know you'd rather
I know you'd rather
I know you'd rather
I know you'd rather
Disappear

[Verse 1]
I discovered you in whole, so terror walks, silent faults
Should have told you a million times that he changed my mind

[Chorus]
Just before I realized that you're gone for real this time
Just before he realized that you're gone for real this time
Just before he realized

[Verse 2]
Need to cover from your eyes, they're really mine, if he ever falls
I can barely catch your eye, but it is too wrong

[Chorus]
Just before I crystallized you were gone for real this time
Just before I crystallized you are gone of time this time
How I want to idealize

[Intro]
No more lying friends

[Wayne ad lib] Fuck 'em
Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They won't go when I go
X2

[Wayne ad lib] You can't doubt what I got, and if you do you can't go where I go
I'ma go by myself, I come in by myself, so I guess it's all about me and it's fuck you

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Come on home biscuit,for man's sake
No more fake hugs and handshakes
Stand straight, you sweeter than a pancake
Me, I'm trying to get that green like the landscape
As for my team, originate
See what I gotta say can't wait
I demand cake
Gotta eat, keep the family straight
They all holding out they hands and plates
Yeah, Wayne's from a place called Hollygrove from the bottom of the globe
Area code 5-0-4
Be hero Joe and I zero in with the Eagle and there'll be no him
I don't need no help, I don't need no homie
I don't need nobody - nigga, I got money
Nigga, I got heart to go along with the guns
Call me Weezy F. Baby, I be by myself when I cum, yeah

[Hook: DJ Keyz]
I don't need 'em, I don't need 'em
I don't love 'em, I don't trust 'em
So mothafucka I was born by myself with my dick in my hand
With my mind on a million dollar plan
Now baby, you are looking at the million dollar man
And I'ma die alone, so alone I stand

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Dudes that never spoke to me now wanna speak 

[beat it]
Girls that never said a word now wanna creep 

[beat it]
Guys that never ran with me now wanna be 

[what?]
The only passenger in my coupe with two seats
Damn, what is it Holmes? Ya boy's breath soft
Air fake, I can feel the silicone
You're all a bunch of Pamela Andersons
Me, a family man, I take care of the family, man 

[ya dig?]
And it seems like my day one niggas ain't acting like day one niggas
I ain't changed, I just came up, niggas
And trust me when I say I ain't put the streets down or them things up, nigga
Bring the Phantom through the hood, I ain't fronting on y'all
Just tryna let you know it's bigger than the corner, my dog
I ain't playing basketball, but I'm ballin' for sure
Now back to the money, catch me when I come off tour 

[fuck 'em]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
The rims may offend you on the shit I slide into
Fuck you, send ya to the desert, tell ya be cool
Ahem, hold on the pistols
Roll by the cops and turn up the stereo
Sittin' at the corner, lookin' like a owner
Talkin' to the owner, yeah my price goin' up
All in the strip club, never get a boner
Only get hard for dough, I'm Homer
And you're a Simpson, and I'm a pimp, son
And she ain't comin' to the crib 'til her friend come
We gettin' money over here, you need to get some
Out comes the cold steel for my income

[Verse 4: Juelz Santana]
Out comes the cold steel for my victims
Born alone, die alone, but you could die with them
Cars white and sexy like Nicole Kidman
Bad chick by my side, video vixen
Ya might fly to L.A. just to shop at Kitson
Thousand dollar hoodies, I'm pickin' up about fifteen
That's about fifteen thousand, I'm trickin'
Zero on bitches 

[Zero]
Swarovski crystals, Great China Wall
And my money run longer than the Great China Wall
And my pockets is Mediterranean Sea deep
So keep plotting and praying to get me 

[come on]

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I hope that you don't start to lose
All the sounds I found in you

[Chorus]
As it goes, I can't explain
Why we feel so uncertain
And as it stems it fades away
On a hopeful day it does the same
As it goes, I can't explain
Why we feel so uncertain
And as it stems it fades away
On a hopeful day that's not the same

[Verse 2]
I dare to find, you never choose
But in the calm, I find my truth

[Chorus]
As it goes, I can't explain
Why we feel so uncertain
And as it stems it fades away
On a hopeful day it does the same
As it goes, I can't explain
Why we feel so uncertain
And as it stems it fades away
On a hopeful day that's not the same
Whatever happened when a million heads collide?
I can't say
I think and i feel so it must be real
The holiest of holies comes out so surreal
I don't care let's do it together
Smile on the face of the gods you made
I am, you are Buddha, Krishna, God

I'm gonna sleep for a week and not speak at all
Cover myself in oil and tin foil
Hold my breath and I'll not speak at all for a while
I heard the word and arranged the fall
So i ran into my bed and covered my head with oil and tin foil
You're a fuck and good luck and god bless you all

[Verse 1]
My baby gone and left me crying by myself
My baby gone and left me crying by myself

[Refrain]
I loved another woman - I lost my best gal

[Verse 2]
She was a real good woman, she didn't mean me no harm
She was a real good woman, she wouldn't do me no harm

[Refrain]
But I loved another woman - now she's up and she's gone

[Guitar solo: Peter Green]

[Verse 3]
Well come back baby, I know I treated you wrong
Well come back baby, I know I treated you wrong

[Refrain]
I loved another woman - now, I won't do that no more

[Outro]
Whooo ooooh
Xanman, Xanman
Don't you understand you're not crying for your man
But it sure ain't tears of joy
Babe you've got to see that the man's not me
Well, I'm barely a boy
Barely a boy

Xanman, won't you understand you're not crying for your Xan man?!?
Xanman, won't you hold my hand, man?
At least until I'm too lazy
For me to go crazy
Whoa (yeah!)

Back in the van with my head in my hands
And my brain like a broken toy
So I take my pills and forget how still
I'm barely a boy, barely a boy

Xanman, (yeah!) won't you understand you're not crying for your Xanman?
Xanman, won't you hold my hand, man?
At least until I'm too lazy
For me to go crazy, yeah
I can't drop!

Back in my van for another day
Until we reach our land
When I'll wipe the memory of your eyes from my mind
Until we can smile and read and play


Xanman, won't you understand you're crying for your Xan man?
Xanman, shit, won't you hold my hand, man?

Xanman, won't you understand you're crying for your Xan man?
Xanman, shit, won't you hold my hand, man?

Xanman, won't you understand you're crying for your Xan man?
Xanman, shit, won't you hold my hand, man?

Xanman, won't you understand you're crying for your Xan man?
Xanman, won't you hold my hand, man?

[Verse]
It was a cold black night and the rain was falling down
I went out looking for my girl
I knew she wasn't nowhere around
She left me early that morning
With a suitcase in her hand
And she took off on a train this morning
And she was meeting some other man, yes
She used to treat me real good
And I wonder why I didn't treat her right
Yes, ah, you know I wonder why I didn't treat her right
And now all I can do, is walk those streets both day and night

[Intro]
I've been drinking
Boy, I'm drinking
Turn it, turn it
Ay, turn up!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm so drunk in with love with her
Her double Ds spilling out my double cup
And she say champagne ain't strong enough
But she never real say ain't long enough
When I lift up all that Herve Leger
You see expression like it's be amazing there
Whatever you do better watch my hair
Too late, oups baby, you made it there
She try to take it there
And I swerve all over in that Rolls Royce on the way to my house
And shorty been drinking like a fish all night, wanna hit it right now
No Merlot, just camel toe, slap all on my handy ball
Ok, handcuffs, ain't no fan of those
But you ain't gonna need any hands at all
Now don't take this as misogyny when I say take this mahogany
And let me put it all in until it's hard to see
Beat it up and reverse till it's hard to breathe
Ok, you're not dealing with inexperience, promise I'm giving you pipe
Learn it, if I keep pouring up you keep throwing back
Shots will be in the air all night

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you
Drank drank drank it
Drank drank drank it
Drunk in love, we be all night
All night

[Hook]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, walking in my l'assemblage
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
New sheets, he sweat it out like washed rags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic 'til my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body Benz
Serving all this, swerve, surfing all of this good good
Drank drank drank it
Drank drank drank it
It's good
Surfing all of this good
Drunk in lo-oooove
Drunk in lo-oooove
All night
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 4: Jay Z]
Hold up
That D'USSÃ‰ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house tryna backup all that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that 3rd, wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight
Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike Turner, turn up
Baby know I don't play, now eat the cake, Annie Mae
Said, "Eat the cake, Annie Mae!"
I'm nauseous, for y'all to reach these heights you gon' need G3
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning, your breasteses is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night
We be all night, love, love
Boy I'm drinking
We be all night, love, love
Drank drank drank it

Never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keeping me on fire, me on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinking, watermelon
(I want your body right here, daddy, I want you, right now)
Boy I'm drinking
Drank it, drank it

We be all night, love, love
Boy I'm drinking
We be all night, love, love
Drank drank drank it
Boy I've been drinking
Boy, I'm drinking

[Intro:The Police]
Giant steps are what you take
Walking on the moon
I hope my legs don't break
Walking on the moon
We could walk forever
Walking on the moon
We could live together
Walking on, walking on the moon

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Private planes on my jet way
A hundred joints in my ashtray
A couple grand to get dressed, behave
My money come in a fast way
Thirty grand is on champagne

Ball cause that's what works for me
Fuck niggas take it personally

[Outro:The Police]
Walking back from your house
Walking on the moon
Walking back from your house
Walking on the moon
Feet they hardly touch the ground
Walking on the moon
My feet don't hardly make no sound
Walking on, walking on the moon

Some may say
I'm wishing my days away
No way
And if it's the price I pay
Some say
Tomorrow's another day
You stay
I may as well play

[Verse 1]
Baby, please stop messing around
You're messing around all the time
Baby, please stop messing around
You're messing around all the time
Now, if you don't stop messing around
You'll be somebody's baby, instead of mine, yeah

[Verse 2]
I want you to squeeze-a me, baby, until my face turns cherry red
You roll me so hard, baby, I'm falling out of bed now
Please stop messing around, messing around all the time
Now, if you don't stop messing around
Be somebody's baby, instead of mine

[Verse 1]
This is the rock
We've been talking about
Yeah this is the rock
Makes you jump and shout

[Chorus 1]
This is the rock
That knocks you right out

[Verse 2]
It makes you lose
All your troubles and cares
You'll lose your blues
They isn't going nowhere

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Well you can get back on the roof
And shout it all around
Get up on your seats about
What I'm putting down
Get them all a hoping to that crazy beat
Get up all a bopping and a tapping their feet

[Chorus 3]
Because it's the rock
Moves you all day long
Yeah it's the rock
Getting everyone
This is the rock
That really turns you on

[Bridge]
Whoo

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Outro]
Yeah this is the rock
That really turns you on

[x2]
Whoa this is the rock

[Verse 1]
Beauty will destroy your mind, spare the gory details
Give them gift-wrapped for the man with everything
Though I lived a lonely life, I was confused
A butcher, I feel nothing

[Verse 2]
As it courses up my arms in a position of the worms
Up, up, through my heart into my brain
Arm a bit slack,  a basic combination
Cut out of chopped liver on the block
My heart's still pumping
My heart's still pumping

[Outro]
He's a warrior, a warrior
Here's a little bitch coming out of him
He's a warrior, a warrior
Here's a little bitch coming out of him
Coming out of him

[Verse 1]
I wanna sit at home in my rocking chair
I don't wanna travel the world
As far as I'm concerned I've had my share
But time's more precious than gold
I don't wanna see another aeroplane seat
Or another hotel room
The home life to me seems really neat
I just wanna unpack for good

[Chorus]
Buy me a ticket homeward bound, homeward bound
Buy me a ticket homeward bound
Oh, homeward bound

[Verse 2]
Well, it all seems the same when you've done it before
There's no difference in the style
There's no end in sight or my own front door
I'll be a stay-at-home for awhile
So I'll have another drink and a cigarette
Just to console myself somehow
It's not too bad if you can forget
I've just gotta find a way somehow

[Chorus]
Buy me a ticket homeward bound, homeward bound
Buy me a ticket homeward bound, homeward bound
Buy me a ticket homeward bound, homeward bound

[Chorus 1]
Bare trees, grey light
Oh, yeah, it was a cold night
Bare trees, grey light

[Chorus 2]
I was alone in the cold of a winter's day
You were alone and so snug in your bed
I was alone in the cold of a winter's day
You were alone and so snug in your bed

[Chorus 1]
Bare trees, grey light
Oh, yeah, it was a cold night
Bare trees, grey light

[Chorus 2]
I was alone in the cold of a winter's day
You were alone and so snug in your bed
I was alone in the cold of a winter's day
You were alone and so snug in your bed

[Intro]
Strictly hip hop - that's what we're dealing with here today
Feel this one more time, let's go back around
Feel this, bump this in your ride
Let the stress off you, yeah
Bump this, leave the job in the back
Leave the school in the back
KRS One

[Verse 1]
Listen to the stile awhile the KRS is giving you
I'm still repping, that's a miracle
Me, I went from criminal all the way to spiritual
Now the people say ''yo, KRS, there's no comparing you''
Original, down to my DNA, I'm lyrical
From the golden age hip hop is what I spit at you
I am the pinnacle, my level is so critical
Way before the metrics KRS was metaphysical
You gotta look at the fact that I still rap
Hip hop culture, I live that cause I built that
Others are still trapped, they're looking like field rats
Using real raps to see where their next meals at
If they would only feel rap and not deal rap
Their whole style, man, they wouldn't have to steal that
I stay fresh cause I'm hip hop, blessed cause I'm hip hop
Cops wanna stress cause I'm hip hop
Fuck a desk and a lunch break, cutting through that red tape
Temple of hip hop, that's the escape
No cure for the headaches and the failures
I'm on that rastaman vibrations like Bob and the wailers
I teach my kids to be sailors
Cause the sea levels rising, you gonna see technical failures
How many times I gotta say it?
The dream of Dr. King, uh uh, nope, I won't betray it
I'd rather make one righteous dollar on my level
Than make a million dollars spitting rhymes for the devil
We're not coming here to dance, me come to MC
Many say I'm the greatest like Muhammad Ali
Some say I'm arrogant and egotistical and cocky
Cause when I flow they know they can't stop me
So here's another classic, blast it like a shotty
My recoil kick so hard it bumps your body
Me I'm the last of the dreaddy, the knotty
KRS One, I liven up any party
Me getting booed? Chewed? Screwed? Hardly
I'm spiritual minded, brother, I move godly
I got manners, when I sneeze I say pardon me
Twenty years rocking, I'm blessed, I got to be

[Verse 1]
If you be my baby
I tell you what I'll do
Give you so much loving
You just got to love me too

[Chorus]
If you be my baby

[x2]
Lord, if you be my baby
I'm the one who'll make you satisfied

[Verse 2]
Now listen to me, baby
What I'm talking about
Now you got something, woman
Makes a dumb man scream and shout

[Chorus]
If you be my baby
Yeah, if you be my baby
If you be my baby
I'm the one who'll make you satisfied

[Verse 3]
Now I'm looking for a woman
That isn't never done no wrong
She'll cook my meals in the day time
And love me all night long

[Chorus]
If you be my baby
Yes, if you be my baby
Lord, if you be my baby
I'm the one who'll make you satisfied

[Chorus]
Take everything easy
Show me a smile
It doesn't take much to please me, my little child

[Verse]
Shine me a light from your eyes, dear
Don't let me see a single tear
Take everything easy, show me a smile
Soon you'll be a man, my little one
So have fun while you can or there'll be none
Everything's going fast around you
There will be things to astound you
You'll be a man in your time, my little one

[Chorus]
So take everything easy
Show me a smile
It doesn't take much to please me, my little child

[Outro]
Shine me a light from your eyes, dear
Don't let me see a single tear
Take everything easy
Show me a smile
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Hook)
Oh, my god, I think, I'm freaking out
Too many drinks, too many rounds
I'm in the clouds, no coming down
(Dude I'm totally freaking out)

(Verse 1)
Oh my god, you got me in, and we can’t get out
Eenie meenie minie mo
It’s too easy I’m freaking out
You are the medic, I know your anatomy
It’s like a movie, should win an academy
I throw a salary, up when you strut at me
When there’s a policy, send a recovery
Heaven is like, give me a break
I give you some of that, (...)
Catching all on video tape
And play back the highlights tomorrow

Too much alcohol
Too many women every night
It’s a replay
What’s happening?
(Hook)
Oh, my god, I think, I'm freaking out
Too many drinks, too many rounds
I'm in the clouds, no coming down
(Dude I'm totally freaking out)

(Verse 2)
I plan to get white boy wasted
The villain in my face took a vacation
A lot of goons see me know I ain’t chasing
The room spinning ing ing ing
And I’m done
Shot like shark, bang bang, that’s a gun
I shoulda auditioned for hangover 1, 2, 3
Oh no, bartender said, you want a drink, oh no
On the side, never ever ever ever drink again
That’s it, drinks, so I will sip again
With a headache, throwing up slurring
Sex on the beach (...)

Too much alcohol
Too many women every night
It’s a replay
What’s happening?

(Hook)(x2)
Oh, my god, I think, I'm freaking out
Too many drinks, too many rounds
I'm in the clouds, no coming down
(Dude I'm totally freaking out)

[Verse 1]
I've been alone
All the years
So many ways to count the tears

[Pre-Chorus]
I never change
I never will
I'm so afraid the way I feel

[Chorus]
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die

[Verse 2]
I been alone
Always down
No one cared to stay around

[Pre-Chorus]
I never change
I never will
I'm so afraid the way I feel

[Chorus]
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die

How I feel
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Destiny, destiny, protect me from the world
Destiny, hold my hand, protect me from the world

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we are, with our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere

[Chorus]
And if the world does turn, and if London burns
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing anymore

[Verse 2]
Grow my hair
Grow my hair, I am Jim Morrison
Grow my hair
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be Jim Morrison

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we are, with our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere

[Chorus]
And if the world does turn, and if London burns
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing anymore

[Chorus 1]
Well, I'm a born enchanter
That's what the ladies see
Yes, I'm a born enchanter
Down in the city of dreams

[Chorus 2]
Lord, do right by me
And let me go
Down in my city of dreams
Where I need to go
Well I'm a born enchanter, well

[Chorus 1]
Well, I'm a born enchanter
Following the sabbath cross
Oh, I'm a born enchanter
Looking for the faith I lost

[Chorus 2]
Lord, do right by me
And let me go
Down in my city of dreams
Where I need to go
Yeah, because I'm a born enchanter

[Chorus]
Got to keep moving
Got to keep moving
Hellhound on my trail
Hellhound on my trail

[Verse]
If today was Christmas Day
If today was Christmas Day
And tomorrow was Christmas Eve
Lord, wouldn't we have a time, boys?

[Chorus]
Got to keep moving
Got to keep moving
Hellhound on my trail
Hellhound on my trail

[Chorus 1]
Shake your moneymaker

[x2]
You got to shake your moneymaker, yeah
Shake your moneymaker
You got to shake your moneymaker
And then

[Chorus 2]
I got a girl that lives up on a hill

[x2]
Says she'll let me roll her
But I don't believe she will

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse]
I got a feeling, blues going to be my only way
Yeah, I got a feeling, blues going to be my only way
But when you're looking for somebody
I'm looking for somebody
Tell me woman, now, how do you see a man like me
You look so nice
You feel so warm

[Verse]
How many more years -
Have you got to wreck my life?
How many more years -
Have you got to wreck my life?
Well, the way you done me
Going to wreck my life

How many more times -
You going to treat me like you do?
How many more times -
You going to treat me like you do?
You spend all my money
All my loving too

Now I'm old and grey
Got no place to go
Now I'm old and grey
Got no place to go
You got yourself a youngster
You can't stand me no more

[Chorus]
My baby, my baby she's so good to me
Yes, she's so fine, as fine as a little girl should be

[Verse 1]
She got a fine pair of legs, um, and her figure is a sight to see
Yeah, she's a red hot little girl and she mean the world to me
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ah, she's fine
She's fine, oh yeah
She's fine, yeah
Oh, yeah
Ah, she's so good
A she's so good to me
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Don't look for no worries, worries and troubles come around
Yes, I don't look for no worries, people, worries and troubles come around
The world keep on turning, I got to keep my feet on the ground

[Chorus]

[x2]
Nobody saw me crying - nobody knows the way I feel

[Verse 2]
Yeah, the way I love the woman, it's bound to get me killed

[Chorus]
I loved the little girl so good, she made my low down butter come

[x2]
I need the woman so bad, I need her like the sky needs the sun

[x2]

[Chorus 1]
I've got things to do
I move everyday
I hope you don't mind
Because I'm going your way

[Chorus 2]
You've got things to do
You move everyday
I hope you don't mind
Because I'm coming your way

You've got things to do
You move everyday
I hope you don't mind
Because I'm coming your way

I've got things to do
I move everyday
I hope you don't mind
Because I'm going your way

[Verse]
Now it's the same as before
And I'm alone again
With no sorrow for myself
And I'm blaming no one else

And closing my eyes
And seeing you standing there

Now it's the same as before
You've touched me with your love
And though you're in my heart
We're still a world apart

As now I'm back to the time
Where I would search for a dream
But no use to try anymore as before
Someday I'll die, and maybe then I'll be with you

So I'm closing my eyes
To hear the people laugh
For they're all aglow
Not knowing where to go
But is it asking too much
When the question is what to do
With the life I'll have
It seems I know nothing now
Except my love for you
And with the strength in my hands
To go on feeding your smile

[Intro]
Tell me anybody
Now do you really give a damn for me
I said tell me anybody
Do you really give a damn for me

[Chorus 1]
Oh because I just got to tell you
About a thing that's bothering me
I was a rambling pony
I would roll, I would roll
I would roll from town to town
I was a rambling pony
I would roll from town to town

[Bridge]
Yes just looking for a sweet woman
And making my love come on down

[Chorus 2]
If I need anybody
Baby I would take you home with me
If I need anybody
Baby I would take you, Baby I would take you
Baby I would take you home with me
Whoa but I don't need nobody
I don't anybody but him and me

[Chorus 3]
And you're sitting there so green
Believe me man I'm just the same as you
I said you're sitting there so green
Believe me man I'm just the same as you
You want me to make a last cry I'll be satisfied
And that's exactly what I mean to do

[Chorus 1]

[x2]
I'm waiting this morning
I'm waiting for my baby to come back home

You know she left me this morning
And I don't know where she gone

[Chorus 2]
She said she wasn't going to leave me
She said she'd always stay by my side
She said she wasn't going to leave me
She said she'd always going to stay by my side

This time she mistreated me
I don't know how many times she lied

[Chorus 3]

[x2]
Well I love my baby
And I'll tell the world I do

[Outro]
But now I've lost my baby
I don't know what in the world I'm going to do, yeah

[Verse 1]
I can't help about the shape I'm in
I can't sing, I ain't pretty and my legs are thin
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to
Oh, well

[Verse 2]
Now, when I talked to God, I knew he'd understand
He said, "Stick by me and I'll be your guiding hand
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to
Well

[Chorus]
Oh, well, oh, well
Well, well, well, well

[Chorus 1]
Although the sun is shining
High above
There's one thing on my mind
You my love

[Verse 1]
I see a weeping willow
In the park
Like this there's sadness growing
In my heart

[Chorus 2]
When we're together
We will never part
And if you leave me
It'll break, it'll break my heart

When we're together
We will never part
And if you leave me
It'll break, it'll break my heart

[Chorus 1]
Although the sun is shining
High above
There's one thing on my mind
You my love

[Chorus]
Station Man, I've been waiting
Can you tell me when we're leaving?

[Verse]
Midnight train now is leaving
Engines screaming
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Where I'm going, I don't know
But you tell me I must go
When we're leaving, I don't know
But you tell me now
I see it's coming and bringing something
This train of loving
I see it's coming, I hear it's running
This train of loving from ages past

[Chorus]
Station Man, I've been waiting
Can you tell me when we're leaving?

[Verse 1]
Oh baby, don't you want a man like me?
I said baby, don't you want a man like me?
I could give you so much loving
More than a woman ever seen

[Chorus 1]
Now come on baby, now we can make some love tonight
I said baby, make some love tonight
Well be rolling out the blankets
I'm going to make you feel alright

[Chorus 2]
Your rolling man, I've got all the love you need

[x2]
I've got so much loving
More than you ever going to see

[Chorus 1]
I said baby, now we can make some love tonight
Come on baby, make some love tonight
Well be rolling out the blankets
I'm going to make you feel alright

[Chorus 2]
I'm your rolling man, got all the love you need
Your rolling man, got all the love you need
Got so much loving baby
More than a woman ever seen

[Chorus 1]
Woman of a thousand years
How are your sons of a time ago
Do they still admire your silvered ways
As you go down
To the sea and golden sand

[Chorus 2]

[x2]
You may be seen up in the sky
And from the land
Or floating by, a fisherman's day
Flying down from a high
She is gone, and then appears
From the water's edge
Woman of a thousand years
He waits to see you

[?]

[Bridge]
For it has been long since you left him
On his own to wander

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
Well goodbye world
It's sad but true
Got a date with the hangman
I have to leave you
I shot my darling
Three times of more

[Chorus]
The reason I'm going
Is blood on the floor

[Verse 2]
The nights are so lonely
The days are so long
I'm in the jailhouse
Because they say I've done wrong
I don't say I'm sorry
I just say I'm sore

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well I came home one night
She were lying
With her legs around
Another mans bod
She saw me, stared laughing
But she cried, when she saw my gun
Goodbye world
I guess we must part
They're taking my life
Because I shot my sweetheart
I don't say I'm sorry
I just say I'm sore

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Baby, if you got to rock
I got to be your rocking horse
Baby, think you'd like to roll
Maybe your digging it more
They're shaking the world
When it's time to crash
But when I get home tonight
I guess I got to shake myself

[Chorus]
You need some love
You must have the blues
Ain't but the one thing
A good man can do
He do the shake
The rattlesnake shake
Man, do the shake
Yes, and jerk away the blues
Now, jerk it

[Chorus]
Now, I know this guy
His name is Mick
Now, he don't care when he ain't got no chick
He do the shake
The rattlesnake shake
Yes, he do the shake
And jerks away the blues
Now, jerk it

[Verse 1]
Come in this house
Stop all of that yakety yak
Come in this house, woman
Stop all of your yakety yak
A stop your yacking woman
You're nothing but an alley cat

[Verse 2]
You talk all day
You talk about this and that
You talk all day, woman
You're talking 'bout this and that
Don't make me nervous
I'm holding a baseball bat

[Chorus]
A honey hush, you're talking too much
A honey hush, you're talking too much
I'm gonna love you honey
I'm taking no more of this stuff

[Post-Chorus]
Well a-hi ho, a-hi ho Silver

You talk all day there, woman
Talkin' 'bout this and that
Don't make me nervous
I'm holding a baseball bat

[Chorus]
A honey hush, you're talking to me
Honey honey honey honey hush, you're talking to me
Stop your yackin'
I'm taking no more of this stuff

[Outro]
Whoa hi ho-a-hi ho Silver

Hi-yo Silver, Silver away

[Verse 1]
I'm getting up soon in the morning
I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm getting up soon in the morning
I believe I'll dust my broom
I quit the best girl I'm loving
Now my friends can get in my room

[Verse 2]
I'm going to write a letter
Telephone every town I know
I'm going to write a letter
Telephone every town I know
If I don't find her in Mississippi
She be in East Monroe I know

[Verse 3]
I don't want no woman
Want every downtown man she meets
No, I don't want no woman
Want every downtown man she meets
Man because no good darling
They shouldn't allow her on the street, yeah

[Verse 4]
I believe, I believe my time isn't long
I believe, I believe my time isn't long
I ain't goinna leave my baby
And break up my happy home

[Chorus]
Clear as the morning rain
Seeing it very plain
We've got to start again

[Verse 1]
What's that you do
What's that you say
There's no use complaining
It's the only way
There's no use feeling dissatisfied
Because how can you know until you've tried

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ever things going around in my head
The futures new and the past is dead
Pull out the stops, turn on the light
Because away from the darkness everything seems bright

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Do do do do do

[x8]

[Verse 1]
She's got so much blues
Her best friend can't help her
Her best friends a woman
How can a woman help her
Woman's got the blues

[Chorus]
She just feels like crying
She just feels like dying
Woman's got the blues

She just feels like crying
She just feels like dying
Woman's got the blues

[Outro]
Womans got the blues

[Verse 1]
Moonshine time, thoughts of you
Spinning 'round as thoughts do
I just wondered if your eyes still shine
As they did when you were mine
I can see in a dream
Thoughts so clear and jewels that gleam
Would your eyes still sparkle then?
If we were, once again

[Chorus]
Jewel eyed Judy, please come home
Jewel eyed Judy, don't leave me alone
Jewel eyed Judy, please come home
Jewel eyed Judy, don't leave me alone

[Verse 2]
Lovely Judy, can you see?
Where it is you're meant to be
Where you lay your head tonight
May the stars find your light
So am I, sitting here
Moonlight glistens on my tears
Is this all that we could find?
Chains of memories left behind

[Chorus]
Jewel eyed Judy, please come home
Jewel eyed Judy, don't leave me alone
Jewel eyed Judy, please come home
Jewel eyed Judy, don't leave me alone

[Verse 1]
So many nights I lay awake
Can't sleep
I lay here thinking about a woman
I used to love
Can't sleep but no good to count sheep
I'll just count the worries
That I've got plenty of

[Chorus]
And how many times
Must I be the fool
Before I can make it
Oh make it on home
I've got to find a place to sing my words
Is there nobody listening to my song?

[Verse 2]
You talk about a life
Been searching for the key
But can't find an answer
To comfort me
I ask myself about love
Can't even find the door
To take me to a place
I've never seen before

[Chorus]
But how many times
Must I be the fool
Before I can make it
Oh make it on home
I've got to find a place to sing my words
Is there nobody listening to my song?

[Verse 1]
Blue blue days, and long black nights
Lonesome tears you're going to cry for me

[Chorus 1]
And little baby
You'd better start babyin' me

[Verse 2]
Think it over before you leave
I got the love, that kind you need

[Chorus 1]
And little baby
You'd better start babyin' me

[Chorus 2]
I'll rave on with the things you say
You say you're going to leave but that'll be the day
Maybe baby, you don't know
I left Peggy Sue a long time ago

[Chorus 3]
She's the girl on my mind
Everyday through all the time
And little baby
You'd better start babyin' me

[Chorus 2]
I'll rave on with the things you say
You say you're going to leave but that'll be the day
Maybe baby, you don't know
I left Peggy Sue a long time ago

[Chorus 3]
She's the girl on my mind
Everyday through all the time
And little baby
You'd better start babyin' me

[Outro]
And little baby
You'd better start babyin' me

[Verse 1]
How can my heart be filled with doubts of you
When you can fill me with a love that's true?
But I can't help but sigh
And sometimes wonder why
What can I do?
I want to see you more and more each day
I really need you, you're my only way
You say it's alright now
But still I wonder how, what can I say?

[Pre-Chorus]
I've dreamed a thousand dreams
And cried so many tears
'Cause when you're not in my heart it seems
Like I've wasted all my years

[Chorus]
Someday, together we will fly to the sun
And then we'll think of all the things we've done
Everyone will smile, happy all the while
Now that we're one

[Pre-Chorus]
I've dreamed a thousand dreams
And cried so many tears
When you're not in my heart
It seems like I'm wasting all my years

[Chorus]
Someday, together we will fly to the sun
And then we'll think of all the things we've done
Everyone will smile, happy all the while
Now that we're one

[Verse 1]
I did a thing last night
You know those future games
I turned off all the lights
Oh, the future came
You were by my side
Will you explain-oh yeah
Real rhyme or reason for those future games
Now you were there last night
And oh were you afraid
Of things we'd come upon
While playing future games
But baby it's alright and so have faith

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, you invent the future that you want to face
How many people sit home at night
Wondering if they will be here tonight
Wondering if children will he bring to the light
Inherit the world, or inherit the night
Wondering if neighbors are thinking the same
All of the wild things tomorrow will tame
Talking of journeys that happen in vain
Well I know I'm not the only one
To ever spend my life sitting playing future games

[Verse 2]
You better take your time
You know there's no escape
The future sends a sign
Of things we will create
Baby it's alright
And so have faith

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Future games

[?]

[X4]
I know I'm not the only one

[?]

[X4]
Tell me
Tell me all the things you do
I'll tell you
Tell you all the things I do

Tell me
Tell me all the things you do
I'll tell you
Tell you all the things I do

[Chorus 1]
Would you love me tomorrow
Like you say you love me now
Would you love me, would you love me tomorrow
Like you say you love me now
When the flames of our flesh have stopped burning
And the fire of our love has cooled down

[Chorus 2]
Too many times I've given too much
Baby, give me your love to me in return
Too many times I've given too much
Baby, give me your love in return
Give me your mind and your heart
Oh, but please don't leave me with a love that burns

[Chorus 3]
And don't you use me as your fool
Baby, because my heart can't stand another lie
Woman never use me, don't use me as your fool
Baby, because my heart can't stand another lie
And if you can't love me tomorrow
Please leave me now in my room to cry

[Chorus 1]
The magic of a blackened night
Can go so far, but not seem right
Although my love, will drive away the sunshine
The magic of, a blackened night
And before you go show me
All the words of love

[Chorus 2]
And the falling sands of time
Blow my wind and drifted by
To and fro the trees still bend
Wondering what the host will send
We will go right down to the sea
Bathing in light we will be free to wander
And the falling sands of time
Blow my wind and drifted by
To and fro the trees still bend
Wondering what the host will send
We will go right down to the sea
Bathing in light we will be free to wander
And the falling sands of time
Blow my wind and drifted by
To and fro the trees still bend
Wondering what the host will send
We will go right down to the sea
Bathing in light we will be free to wander

[Chorus 1]
The magic of a blackened night
Can go so far, but not seem right
Although my love, will drive away the sunshine
The magic of, a blackened night

[Chorus 1]
Little child of mine
You'll be loving like your little mother did
Heard it somewhere before
I won't leave you, no, not like my father did

Heavy country blues keep a-rockin'

[Chorus 1]
Say you love me
Say those three words and
I will give my love to you

[Verse 1]
My love is higher than a mission bell, how deep?
Deeper than a wishing well, how strong?
Stronger than a magic spell
My love, for you
It's wider than the widest sea, how long?
Longer than a memory, how sweet?
Sweeter than a honey tree
My love, uhmm, for you
Give me your heart of gold
Your heavenly magic touch
To cherish have and hold
I need your love so much

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
My love is warmer than a day in spring how bright?
Brighter than a diamond ring how great?
Greater than a mighty king
My love, for you
Is taller than the tallest tree how soft?
Softer than a summer breeze
Oh I ask you please
Give your love, your love
Sweet love to me

[Outro]
How high (ummm)
How deep (ummm)
How strong (ummm)
How wide (ummm)
How long (ummm)

[Verse 1]
Hold on until the ghost appears
That day is gonna last for years
Strange wind is gonna blow through town
Lightning is gonna strike us down
Blue hills are looking good to me
I go there when I'm fast asleep
Ghost town and the desert wind
Strange sounds at the worlds end

[Chorus]
And then the winds start to blow
And the fire comes scorchin' down (Oh yeah)
And then the sky disappears
In the cloud with an awful sound (yeah)
And when you can't hold out
Then you run to the underground

[Verse 2]
Just a blue star hangin' out in space
Earth town is a lovely place
Strange winds comin' from the sky
Lovers gotta say goodbye

[Chorus]
And then the winds start to blow
And the fire comes scorchin' down (Oh yeah)
And then the sky disappears
In the cloud with an awful sound (yeah)
And when you can't hold out
Then you run to the underground

[Outro]
Look out before the ghost appears
Look out before the ghost appears
Strange winds
No sky

[Chorus 1]
Oh, they call me Doctor Brown
They call me that loving man
Oh, they call me Doctor Brown
They call me that loving man
And if you got some trouble
Come around and see what you can

[Chorus 2]
You don't have no prescription
You don't have to take no pills
You don't have no prescription
And baby don't have to take no pills
If you come to see me
Doctor Brown will cure your ills

[Chorus 3]
Oh, ask any woman
In my neighborhood
You just ask any woman
In my neighborhood
If Doctor Brown can't cure you
Nobody can do you no good

[Chorus 4]
You just ask any woman
In my neighborhood

Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get to thinking
About the times we used to have
But now you've gone away and left me so alone
La-di-da, la-di-da-da, la-di-da
Although my back is aching
I'll work the whole day through
Although you hear that I've been wasting all my time

[Chorus 1]
Taking the sun from the sky
Lifting our hearts to the day
Thinking of new revelations
Talking with nothing to say

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I get to thinking
About the times we used to have
But now you've gone away and left me so alone

Although you hear that I've been wasting all my time

[Chorus 2]
Taking the sun from the sky
Lifting our hearts to the day
Thinking of new revelations
Talking with nothing to say

[Chorus 1]
Let me re-tell a story I know
About a man named Moses who lived long ago
He prophesied good, he prophesied bad
And now that prophecy's coming to pass

[Chorus 2]
Let all your sons and your daughters
Of the golden calf
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay it all down, for paradise here on earth

[Verse 1]
A whole lot of people, including myself
Thought the story of Moses was just a tall tale
But all of the things that we see going on
Are just what Moses set down

[Chorus 2]
Let all your sons and your daughters
Of the golden calf
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay it all down, for paradise here on earth

He prophesied good, he prophesied bad

Of the golden calf
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay it all down, for paradise here on earth

[Chorus 3]
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
I just can't imagine a reason for sorrow
Just can't imagine the hurt

[Bridge]
You've got to lay it down
You've got to lay it down
You've got to lay it down
You've got to lay it down

[Chorus 3]
I said, lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay down your burden of sorrow
There's just no reason to hurt

[Outro]
You've got to lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
I said, lay it all down, for paradise here on earth

[Verse 1]
Oh baby, I'll buy you a diamond ring

If you let me love you darling
I'll give you almost anything

[Chorus 1]
Well it's early in the morning
And my baby can't be found
Oh it's early in the morning
And my baby can't be found

Oh baby, I need your love tonight

Times I've wondered
Why it is a lonesome day
Times I've wondered
Why it is a lonesome day
I see you walking

[Verse 1]
You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
'Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushin' by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that we say are very

[Chorus]
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one

[Verse 2]
Now you are here today
But easily you might just go away
'Cause we live in a time
When paintings have no color, words don't rhyme
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, and all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushin' by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that we say are very

[Chorus]
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one

[Verse 3]
You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
'Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes, and all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushin' by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry

Blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one

[Verse 1]
Why not lie here in my arms
And listen to the night?
You must know you have certain charm
And I feel the time is right

[Chorus]
So spare me a little (Just a little bit)
Spare me a little (Just a little bit)
Spare me a little of your love (Of your love)
Spare me a little (Just a little bit)
Spare me a little (Just a little bit)
Spare me a little of your love (Of your love)

[Verse 2]
Now I know that I feel much more
Oh, in every single way
And it's not the same as before
It gets stronger everyday

[Chorus]
So spare me a little (Just a little bit)
Spare me a little (Just a little bit)
Spare me a little of your love (Of your love)
Spare me a little (Just a little bit)
Spare me a little (Just a little bit)
Spare me a little of your love (Of your love)

[Verse 3]
And now I know how the sun must feel
Every time it shines
Now I know this is real
And I want you to be mine

[Chorus]
So spare me a little (Just a little bit)
Spare me a little (Just a little bit)
Spare me a little of your love (Of your love)
Spare me a little (Just a little bit)
Spare me a little (Just a little bit)
Spare me a little of your love (Of your love)

[Outro]
Just a little bit
A day in the life of a fool
A sad and a long lonely day
I walk the avenue and hope I'll run into
The welcome sight of you coming my way

I stop just across from your door
But you're never home any more
So back to my room and there in the gloom
I cry tears of goodbye
(That's the way it will be every day in the life of fool)

[Chorus 1]
When the white flame in us is gone
And we that lost the world's delight
Stiffen in darkness, left alone

[Chorus 2]
To crumble in our separate light
When your swift hair is quiet in death
And through the lips corruption
Thrust to still the labor of my breath

[Chorus 3]
When we are dust, when we are dust
When we are dust, when we are dust

[Bridge]
When your swift hair is quiet in death
And through the lips corruption
Thrust to still the labor of my breath

[Chorus 3]
When we are dust, when we are dust
When we are dust, when we are dust

[Chorus 1]
When the white flame in us is gone
And we that lost the world's delight
Stiffen in darkness, left alone

[Chorus 2]
To crumble in our separate light
When your swift hair is quiet in death
And through the lips corruption
Thrust to still the labor of my breath

[Chorus 3]
When we are dust, when we are dust
When we are dust, when we are dust

[Verse 1]
All you have to do
Is look at me that way
You don't have to say
What's going on in your heart
And deep in the night
When I think you won't drive me crazy
I'm just hoping that maybe
You're feeling the same way to

[Chorus]
I want you and I need you
I don't know what else to say
(Don't you) Don't you think it's time
(Don't you) Don't you think it's time (Don't you)
Don't you think it's time That you remember me

[Verse 2]
So I'm begging you
Not to leave me up in the air
It just wouldn't be fair
Cause you know the way
I feel about you
It may not be love
Or an everlasting feeling
But you sending me reeling
With the very mention of your name

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Remember me

[Verse]
I thank my God for perfect love and peace
I'll hold her tight and always as
And, and always
Mine forever, love, love
So great, so divine
Trees, the grey day has changed everything
It's beautiful, just beautiful
So beautiful, this first grey day is ours
My loving child
By grace of God we live, my child, and love
I crawl to my knees, my dear love
Will you promise to kiss my perfect healing hands and fingers?
And make a promise to me you will always obey
My each command and never, ever fail me
You'll be mine forever more
The sun is here, my love, my love
My sun, our sun complete
God bless our perfect, perfect grey day
With trees so bare, so bare
But oh so beautiful, so beautiful
The grey, blue sky, the world is here
Ours, just, 

[justing?], just ours
Our own, hold us tight
I am yours, just a dream
And go on dreaming
May this joy of ours never ever cease
My love, my love
Pregnant sweet, love is tender

[Verse]
Don't let waters of caution remove you
Don't let the fire of saints compel you
Don't let the lack of their spirit blind your life
Cause soon it's all over, you're going to come through alive
Well I've been all over the world five times or more
And I've seen the future burn blue before my eyes
And all through the dust and the green magnesium fire
Don't let the violence blind you, you're gonna come through alive
And the roses that are offing
They are real as evening wind
They are washed by love and suffering
Cause my love has colored them
Colored them
Oooooh oooohh-nothing but roses
Don't dam the river that's running through you
Stop saving up for time that may never become
I've seen the future come true in twenty days
But don't let is scare you, stop thinking about yesterday
I've had my share of blue revelations
And I know that time is a region to be passed
So all through the dust and green magnesium fire
I can rest easy now, and watch the carnival rolling by
Cause a rose that will be growing
In the place where I have hidden
It is washed by love and suffering
That my love has colored in

[Outro]
Look where the roses grow
Look where the roses grow
Look where the roses lie aaahhh
Look where the roses grow
Look where the roses grow
Look where the roses lie aaahhh
Look where the roses grow
Look where the roses grow
Look where the roses lie aaahhh
Look where the roses grow
Look where the roses grow
Look where the roses lie aaahhh

[Chorus 1]
Day and night we walk these aisles
In the same old movie show
And look for someone
To feel for a while
There's matinees on Saturdays
When we sit in the velvet chairs
Popcorn boxes fly through the air

[Chorus 2]
Sad movies, they make you cry
Sad movies make you wonder why
You ever came
Do something to me
Don't make me wait
Stab something through me
Don't cry out the good things
That I appreciate

[Chorus 1]
Day and night we walk these aisles
In the same old movie show
And look for someone
To feel for a while
The light's go on, the movie's gone
And the manager's up there
He says he doesn't care
And we take our money back

[Chorus 2]
Sad movies, they make you cry
Sad movies make you wonder why
You ever came

[Verse 1]
Why, baby, why are you still so sad?
When you know how much I need you
I hate to see you feel so bad
When I try so hard to please you
You know I'd do anything
Just to see you smile again
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to take away a little pain

[Chorus]
You make me feel, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Dissatisfied (Dissatisfied)
You make me feel, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Dissatisfied (Dissatisfied)

[Verse 2]
My home is yours and I want you to know
That I need you to depend on
And everything you feel, I'm feeling too
And I just hope you haven't forgotten
How can I make the sunshine through?
So we can be happy again
Oh, baby, there's got to be a way
Just to take away a little pain

[Chorus]
You make me feel, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Dissatisfied (Dissatisfied)
You make me feel, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Dissatisfied (Dissatisfied)

[Bridge]
Please don't say you don't love me anymore
'Cause I couldn't ease up on you
You're the only reason for all my joy
And without you, what would I do?
Because I'd do anything
Just to see you smile again
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to take away a little pain

[Chorus]
You make me feel, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Dissatisfied (Dissatisfied)
You make me feel, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Dissatisfied (Dissatisfied)
You make me feel, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Dissatisfied (Dissatisfied)
You make me feel, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Dissatisfied (Dissatisfied)
You make me feel, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Dissatisfied (Dissatisfied)

[Verse 1]
As I’m getting older, chip up on my shoulder
Rolling through life, to roll over and die

[Scat Singing]
Missing Hippie Jon, salad days are gone
Remembering things just to tell ‘em so long

[Scat Singing]

[Chorus]
Oh mama, actin’ like my life’s already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year

[Verse 2]
Always feeling tired, smiling when required
Write another year off and kindly resign

[Scat Singing]
Salad days are gone, missing Hippie Jon
Remember the days just to tell ‘em so long

[Scat Singing]

[Chorus]
Oh mama, actin’ like my life’s already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year
Oh mama, actin’ like my life’s already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year

[Chorus]
Me and my baby don't do nothing but lay around all day long
I said, "Me and my baby don't do nothing but lay around all day long"
Yeah, when I'm with my baby, lazy poker going on

[Bridge]
She puts some coal on the fire, so I can keep my poker hot

[x2]
Yeah, we stoke around all day long
And night time we stoke around some more

[Chorus]
Well now me and my baby don't do nothing, lay around all day long
I said, "Me and my baby don't do nothing but lay around the whole day long"
When I'm with my baby, lazy poker going on
Lazy poker

[Verse]
Money, who needs it
Let me live my life free and easy
Put a toothbrush in my hand
And let me be a travelling man
Cause I'm a road runner baby
I'm a road runner baby
Can't stay in one place too long
I'm a road runner baby
One look at me and I'll be gone
Well you can love me if you wanna
But I do declare
When I get restless
I've got to move somewhere
Because I'm a road runner baby
Anywhere is my home
And I love the life I live
And I'm going to live the life I love
A road runner baby

[Chorus]

[x2]
Don't want no woman
To tie me down
Got to be free baby
To roam around
All my life I've been like this
And if you love me it's your own risk
Cause when the dust hits my shoes
I've got the urge to move
Yes I'm a road runner baby
Got to keep moving on
Hey, and I live the life I love
And I love the life I live
I'm a road runner baby
Road, road runner

[x3]

[Outro]
Road, road runner

[x4]

[Verse]
We are the hungry ones
On a campground that's been and gone
Where are all the faces that I knew?
All the heroes in the bright burning truth
Makes you feel real, real good in your bones
When the hunger stops, and the truth is known
My life, my light is coming home
Yeah, coming home

[Chorus 1]
You know life can be so sad
Sometimes you just sit right down and cry
You know life can be so sad
Sometimes you just sit right down and you cry
Sometime your luck it gets so bad
Maybe you'd be better off if you should die

[Chorus 2]
Yes I've tried so hard not to remember
And people, I've tried so hard to forget
I've tried so hard not to remember
And people, I've tried so hard to forget
But I can't stop my mind wandering
Back to the days I was just a down-trodden kid

[Chorus 3]
Some folks have such a good life
You know, they just get on that big train and they ride
You know some folks have such a good life
They just get on that big train and they ride
I would spend most of my days
Running and hiding from the world outside

[Chorus 4]
If I ever get to Heaven
You know, that sure would ease my worried mind
Yes, if I ever get to Heaven
That sure would ease my worried life
You know, when I find that place in the sky
People, I'm going to leave this old world behind

[Verse 1]
You don't know what she means, you see
She's a heart that beats close to me
And getting back to the way I feel
Her honest word is my only real thing
When she comes to me then I feel fine
And I'm not afraid but so gratified
Emerald eyes is a mystery
She's a heart that beats close to me

[Chorus]
Find, emerald eyes in the night
Gleaming shiny and bright
As if covered with silver
She's still a mystery to me
The way she sails away slow
Makes your day to day life easy

[Verse 2]
Emerald eyes is a mystery
She's my place of serenity
And getting back to the way I feel
Her honest word is my only real thing
Only an honest word, maybe a sky report
Could be a weather bird it was so close to me
Emerald eyes is a mystery
Starin' through to the heart of me

[Chorus]
Find, emerald eyes in the night
Gleaming shiny and bright
As if covered with silver
She's still a mystery to me
The way she sails away slow
Makes your day to day life easy

[Outro]
Emerald eyes is a mystery
She's my place of serenity
Emerald eyes is a mystery
She's my place of serenity
Emerald eyes is a mystery
She's my place of serenity

[Verse 1]
You got to believe
I'm going to be with you baby
In everything you've done
Even though you've stopped the sun from shining
Well I've tried my best, but it may not be enough
And times have been so tough, that I can't tell you

[Chorus]
What can you say to accuse me
When you know I'm not to blame
You know you're gonna use me
I guess I'll always feel the same
Oh, when will we be together
In this crazy world we're in
Is it really such a sin to love you
Well I've tried my best, but it may not be enough
And times have been so tough that I can't tell you

[Verse 2]
What can you say to accuse me
When you know I'm not to blame
You know you're gonna use me
I guess I'll always feel the same

[Chorus]

[Verse]
You've got a sweet, sweet way
You know you'll always be the only one
And if you'll let me say
You'll never be a lonely one
Well you've just got something
Makes a girl start feeling crazy
And I'll do anything if you'll let me be your baby

[Chorus]

[x2]
Even when everybody tells me
I'm just being a fool
Something inside says I've got to have you
And I can't play by the rules
Ooh baby baby tell me there's a chance for me
Because I'm crazy about you and I know this is love for me
Well you just got something
Makes a girl start feeling crazy
And I'll do anything if you'll let me be your baby

[Verse 1]
It's the same kind of story
That seems to come down from long ago
Two friends having coffee together
When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn
Which is wide, at least half of a playing field
Because there's no explaining
What your imagination can make you see and feel

[Chorus]
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

[Verse 2]
Now it's not a meaningless question
To ask if they've been and gone
I remember a talk about North Carolina
And a strange, strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's hand ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed

[Chorus]
That's why it seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
I know that's right

[Instrumental Interlude with Harmonizing]

[Chorus]
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

[Verse 3]
They say there's a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will
Now you know it's a meaningless question to ask
If those stories are right
Because what matters most
Is the feeling you get when you're hypnotized

[Outro]
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Yeaaaaahhhh, that's when, that's when they got you hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

[Chorus]

[x2]
I like the way the light falls today
Slow, too lazy for anything
I see boats that go sailing past me (But not too fast)
You know, I wish this day could keep on going and last forever
Please don't fool around with my happiness
I like the way the light falls today
Please just let it stay that way
Forever and ever and ever and ever

[x4]

[Outro]

[Repeat until fade]
Dont fool around
Please don't fool around with my happiness

[Verse]
For a little peace in any season
I'd give up anything but your love
I don't want to trade, trying to be happy
That's only playing anyway
But if I dream about it, it makes me wonder
For every good thing, must you get bad
But I won't worry, and if I'm living on borrowed time
I'm gonna keep on the way I'm going
Keep on the way I'm going
For every crime, there's retribution
And every valley has a mountainside
No, I don't like to trade just to be happy
That kind of deal won't turn out right

[Chorus]

[x2]
See it is no good to stare inside yourself too long
For every true thing there's one more lie
But I won't worry cause if I'm living on borrowed time
I'll just try to keep on the way I'm going
Keep on the way I'm going

[Verse]
Going to stay out of New York
There's something there that drives me crazy
No I won't go back
There's something there that bleeds me dry
It gets so bad that I stop breathing
And then the sun don't want to shine
There's something wrong with New York
It's a prison without walls
No I won't go back there
I just don't like that place at all
Now you might call it sophistication

[Outro]
I said i won't go back to New York
There's a darkness all around
No, I just can't handle it
You know that place is getting me down
You can say it's sophistication
But I say time is running out

[Verse 1]
The swamp is getting deeper all the time
And the faces that I see don't seem to shine
Now there's too much Warhol hanging off the wall
And the mystery that there used to be is gone

[Chorus]

[x2]
Going to go
Miles away
Let me ride
Just miles away
Don't wanna know
I'm not gonna miss it much
Going to be driving once again

[Verse 2]
Don Juan goes up in a cloud of smoke
And all those Hare Krishna's turned out to be a joke
And it's restless, restless, restless all the time
Sliding up and down the surface of this life
Now I know that I can't say what's black and white
But if I could fly I think I'd try tonight

[Chorus]

[c4]

[Outro]
Miles away

[x4]

[Verse 1]
Monday morning, you sure look fine
Friday, I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me, and then you fade away
I can't go on believing this way
I got nothing but love for you
Tell me what you really want to do
First you love me, then you get on down the line

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't mind
I don't mind, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind

[Verse 2]
Monday morning, you sure look fine
Friday, I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me, and then you say it's wrong
You know I can't go on believing for long
But you know it's true (Yes)
You only want me when I get over you
First you love me, then you get on down the line

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't mind
No, I don't mind, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
But you know it's true
You know you only want me when I get over you
Oh, first you love me, then you get on down the line

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't mind
No, I don't mind, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind

[Verse 1]
Don't think your dreams are sane
They're taking over your life
I stuck to you but I found out
That you was the crazy kind
Now way inside your heart
Do you have a grain of love for me
Because all I see is decadence
And the end of everything

[Chorus]
You can bend over backwards
I am not going to kiss your ring
Say that you will
I am not going to do that thing

[x2]
Somebody
I am not going to kiss your ring
Just sit there

[x3]

[Verse 2]
I looked into your eyes
And saw a real bad thing
I saw desires that burned in you
The need for power to be a king
And I saw that you would use this world
You know you might have to crawl
But it's one of my eyes for one of yours
And you'll never get no love at all

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Once in everyone's life
You know a feeling has to grow
And you may be having a bad time
And you really shouldn't let it show
You're taking a risk, but it doesn't matter
Because you know, you know that it's real

[Chorus]
I can't conceal the way that I feel
I can't conceal the way, the way that I feel

[Verse 2]
How many times have I told you
Oh, I adore you
And if it meant anything at all
I'd do anything for you
But it's too late and I know I'm making
A fool, a fool of myself

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
(For your love)
I'd give you everything and more and that's for sure
(For your love)
I'd bring you diamond rings and things right to your door
(For your love)
To thrill you with delight, I'd bring you diamonds bright
(For your love)
Everything that will excite
Make you dream of me at night

[Chorus]
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

[Verse 2]
For your love, for your love
I would give you stars above
For your love, for your love
I'd give the stars if they were mine to give (For your love)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'd give the stars if they were mine to give
(For your love)
I'd give the moon every day that I live
(For your love)
To thrill you with delight, I'd bring you diamonds bright
(For your love)
Everything that will excite
Make you dream of me at night

[Chorus]
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

[Verse]
There's no use in crying, it's all over
But I know there'll always be another day
Well my heart will rise up with the morning sun
And the hurt I feel will simply melt away
You make me feel, I just can't carry on
But I know I won't always be that way
Because my heart will rise up with the morning sun
And the hurt I feel will simply melt away

[Chorus]

[x4]
You don't have to give up
Why is it all wrong
Why don't you love me
Why won't you just be strong

[Verse 1]
Girls, you know when you're in the mood (In the mood)
You may meet a man can't do anything good (Nothing good)
But you've got to pity him and try to understand (Understand)
That a hero, a hero is so hard to find

[Verse 2]
When he takes you for his love (For his love)
And he tries to tell you, there isn't any other (Don't believe him)
Oh, he may kiss you and tell you he'll miss you (Such a shame)
But don't forget, a hero is so hard to find

[Verse 3]
When he says "hello," don't forget they're all the same
(You know they're all the same)
You may end up sitting all alone and with yourself to blame
Oh, don't you let him

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
(Heroes are)
So when he tells you you've got diamonds in your eyes
(He's just lying)
Don't get carried away because you know he's selling you lies
(He's just lying)
So when you get the feeling the man you've got's no good
(He's no good)
Well, just remember, a hero is so hard to find
Well, just remember, a hero is so hard to find

[Outro]
Heroes, heroes are hard to find
Heroes, heroes are hard to find
Heroes, heroes are hard to find
Heroes, heroes are hard to find

[Verse 1]
Sleep easy by my side
Into gentle slumber you can hide
I, I'm waiting for the sun, to come up
I can't sleep, with your warm ways

[Chorus]
Forever, forever love
Together, together love

[Verse 2]
You made me a woman tonight
Dream until the morning light
I, I'm waiting for the sun, to come up
I can't sleep, with your warm ways

[Chorus]
Forever, forever love
Together, together love

[Verse 1]
It was a blue letter she wrote to me
It's silver words she told
Wanna be on the road to paradise
I want a lover who don't get old

[Chorus]
Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
Baby, when your day goes down
I won't be waiting around for you

[Verse 2]
For every voice you've ever heard
There's a thousand without a word
Redbird, don't say you told me so
Give me one more song to go

[Chorus]
Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
Baby, when your day goes down
I won't be waiting around for you

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
For every voice you've ever heard
There's a thousand without a word
Redbird, don't say you told me so
Give me one more song to go

[Chorus]
Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
Baby, when your day goes down
I won't be waiting around for you

[Outro]
I ain't waiting 

[x9]

[Verse 1]
Do you always trust your first initial feeling
Special knowledge holds true, bears believing
I turned around and the water was closing all around
Like a glove, like the love that had finally, finally found me

[Chorus]
Then I knew in the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal like a clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet, to the sea
To the sea
To the sea, yeah

[Verse 2]
How the faces of love have changed, turning the pages
And I have changed, oh but you, you remain ageless
I turned around and the water was closing all around
Like a glove, like the love that had finally, finally found me

[Chorus]
Then I knew in the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal like a clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet, to the sea
To the sea
To the sea, yeah
To the sea, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm dancing to the music
Of a simple melody
And I wonder are you thinking
Of a single memory
And I know when I see them swaying
I can hear myself say

[Chorus]
Come a little bit closer
(Come a little bit closer)
Because I remember the time
When you held me in your arms
(Come a little bit closer)
And you wanted to be mine
Everything good, everything gold
Now all that's left is a sweet memory

[Verse 2]
If you love me, let me know
Why don't you show me which way to go?
Please don't leave me all alone
Because I can't make it on my own
And I know when I see them swaying
I can hear myself say

[Chorus]
Come a little bit closer
(Come a little bit closer)
Because I remember the time
When you held me in your arms
(Come a little bit closer)
And you wanted to be mine
I'll make you wrong, but that's where I belong
Why are you just a sweet memory?

[Chorus]
Come a little bit closer
(Come a little bit closer)
Because I remember the time
When you held me in your arms
(Come a little bit closer)
And you wanted to be mine
Everything good, everything gold
Why are you just a sweet memory?

[Outro]
Come a little bit closer

[x2]
Come a little closer

[x2]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Have mercy, baby, on a poor girl like me
You know I'm falling, falling, falling at your feet
I'm tingling right from my head to my toes
So help me, help me, help me make the feeling go

[Chorus]
Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

[Verse 2]
Have pity baby just when I thought it was over
Now you got me running, running, running for cover
I'm begging you for a little sympathy
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me

[Chorus]
Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
{Instrumental Bridge}

[Verse 3]
Baby, baby, hope you're going to stay away
Cause I'm getting weaker, weaker everyday
I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me

[Chorus]
Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Say that you love me
Say that you love me

[Outro]
Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling...

[Verse 1]
Now the wind
That's blowing out of the southwest
Is telling me, boy you better beware
Here she comes, and they call her the sweet Omega
And you'll come to know the meaning of her stare

[Chorus]
Because the only road that you'll ever need to ride
Is the one that's rolling out, beyond her eyes
And although she'll bring you joy
Don't you know she can destroy
Oh Lord, she's changing me

[Verse 2]
When you're down
And you're headed for a bad night
And you're seeing shapes of trouble in the stars
She'll take your hand, because they call her the sweet Omega
Then she'll take away the sadness in your heart

[Chorus]

[Outro]
The only road you'll ever need to ride

[x3]
Oh Lord, she's changing me

[Verse 1]
Everybody's trying to say I'm wrong
I just want to be back where I belong

[Chorus]
World turning
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm wrong but who's to say what's right
I need somebody to help me through the night

[Chorus]
World turning
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm wrong but who's to say what's right
I need somebody to help me through the night

[Chorus]
World turning
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down

[Outro]
Umm turning
Everybody's got me down
World turning
Everybody's got me down

[Verse 1]
Well you thought you had a hold on me
But it's different now
Everything you done before
Fell upon you now

[Chorus]
Are you just a bad loser?
But you never let go
(And you're going to go down)
Yes, you'll go down but you'll never let it show

[Verse 2]
All the strings and the strokes in the ocean
Won't buy you piece of mind
All because you did what you did
You're not the peaceful kind

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I think you really know what I mean
But I'll tell you one more time
Oh, because it's the truth and you know it
That you're no friend of mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Well, I need a sugar daddy
He could be my friend
And if I needed a little money
I know he would lend me, lend me a hand

[Chorus 1]
But when it comes to love
He'd better leave me alone
Because I've got you, baby
And you give me all the love I need
Yes, you give me all the love I need

[Verse 2]
And when I get a little hungry
If he could give me all I could eat
And if I needed whiskey
He could serve it to me neat

[Chorus]
But when it comes to love
He'd better leave me alone
Because I've got you, baby
And you give me all the love I need
Yes, you give me all the love I need

[Bridge]
All that I want is someone to take care of me
I'm not asking for love, just a little sympathy

[Verse 3]
And he could pick me up
In a big fancy car
Then I could pretend
I was a big movie star

[Chorus]
But when it comes to love
He'd better leave me alone
Because I've got you, baby
And you give me all the love I need
Yes, you give me all the love I need

[Bridge]
All that I want is someone to take care of me
I'm not asking for love, just a little sympathy

[Outro]
I'm not asking for love
I'm not asking for love
I'm not asking for love
I'm not asking for love
Just a little sympathy
I'm not asking for love
I'm not asking for love

[Verse 1]
She came in like a hurricane
Wearing boots and diamond rings
With a fox fur on her shoulder
She set wondering
And I could tell she was feeling abandoned
Because she flashed a look across my way
She said, "Hop for a ride
You'll never ask me but I'll tell you anyway"

[Chorus]
She took me out on the blackboard jungle
Put me straight in a hurricane
She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways
If I could sing like Paul McCartney and get funky like Etta James
I'd never change, I'd never change
I'd never change silver heeled ways

[Verse 2]
She came in and her flags were flying
She was a sailboat of sweet perfume
And I could see that her eyes were smiling
From across the room
Well I couldn't think of conversation
I was busy looking at her furs
She said, "Hey, you'll never ask me
So I guess I'll say the word"

[Chorus]
She took me out on the blackboard jungle
Put me straight in a hurricane
She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways
If I could sing like Paul McCartney and get funky like Etta James
I'd never change, I'd never change
I'd never change silver heeled ways

[Post-Chorus]
(Silver, silver heels)
That's what I mean
(Silver, silver heels)
Whoo, talking about silver
Silver heels
(Oh, silver, silver heels)
Alright
I'm talking bout silver
(Oh, silver, silver heels, oh, silver)

[Chorus]
She took me out on the blackboard jungle
Put me straight in a hurricane
She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways
If I could sing like Paul McCartney and get funky like Etta James
I'd never change, I'd never change
I'd never change silver heeled ways

[Post-Chorus]
(Silver, silver heels)
That's what I mean
(Silver, silver heels)
Whoo, talking about silver
Silver heels
(Oh, silver, silver heels)
Alright
I'm talking bout silver
(Oh, silver, silver heels, oh, silver)

[Intro]
Aah, aah

[x4]

[Verse 1]
I want to be inside your heart
That's the place, the place for me
But I could understand, it won't be easy

[Chorus]
You've got to prove, prove your love to me
You've got to prove, prove your love to me

[Verse 2]
Like I say it isn't easy to let your heart run wild
So if you want to please me, baby then don't act like a child
But I can understand, it won' t be easy

[Chorus]
And you've got to prove, prove your love to me
You've got to prove, prove your love to me

[Verse 3]
It doesn't matter if you're far away
Or right here by my side
That's the way I feel about it
We can't let the whole thing slide

[Bridge]
Aah, aah

[x4]

[Verse 4]
So if you can't see me right where you are
They why don't you send for me, baby by the nearest star
It won't be easy, and you've got to prove

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Aah, aah

[x4]

[Verse 1]
I know there's nothing to say
Someone has taken my place
When times go bad
When times go rough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass
And let me do my stuff?

[Verse 2]
I know I got nothing on you
I know there's nothing to do
When times go bad
And you can't get enough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass
And let me do my stuff?

[Chorus]
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-bow bow, bow bow, doo da doodladoo
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-bow bow, bow bow, yeah

[Verse 3]
One thing I think you should know
I ain't gonna miss you when you go
Been down so long
I've been tossed around enough
Oh, couldn't you just
Let me go down and do my stuff?

[Verse 4]
I know you're hoping to find
Someone who's going to give you peace of mind
When times go bad
When times go rough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass
And let me do my stuff?

[Chorus]
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-bow bow, bow bow, doo da doodladoo
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow

[Outro]
I'm just second-hand news
I'm just second-hand news, yeah
I'm just second-hand news
I'm just second-hand news, yeah
I'm just second-hand news
I'm just second-hand news, yeah
I'm just second-hand news
I'm just second-hand news, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I'd been

[Chorus]
Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again

[Verse 2]
You don't know what it means to win
Come 'round and see me again

[Chorus]
Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again

[Verse 1: Lindsey Buckingham]
If you wake up and don't wanna smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way

[Chorus: Buckingham and Christine McVie]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Verse 2: Christine McVie]
Why not think about times to come
And not about the things that you've done?
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

[Chorus: Buckingham and C. McVie]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Verse 3: Buckingham and C. McVie]
All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you

[Chorus: Buckingham and C. McVie]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Outro: Buckingham and C. McVie]
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back

[Chorus]
I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine
I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine

[Verse 1]
Finally, baby
The truth has come down now
Take a listen to your spirit
It's crying out loud
Trying to believe
Oh, you say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling
Oh, oh, yeah, uh huh

[Chorus]
I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine
I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine

[Verse 2]
Finally, baby
The truth has been told
Now you tell me that I'm crazy
It's nothing that I didn't know
Trying to survive
Oh, you say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling
Hanging on to you
Oh, oh, yeah, uh huh

[Chorus]
I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love, honey
Take a little time

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Ah, I don't want to know

[Verse 1]
Oh, Daddy, you know you make me cry
How can you love me, I don't understand why
Oh, Daddy, if I can make you see
If there's been a fool around, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me

[Verse 2]
Oh, Daddy, you soothe me with your smile
You're letting me know you're the best thing in my life
Oh, Daddy, if I can make you see
If there's been a fool around, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me

[Chorus]
Why are you right when I'm so wrong? (So wrong)
I'm so weak but you're so strong (Never so strong)
Everything you do is just all right
And I can't walk away from you, baby, if I tried

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Why are you right when I'm so wrong? (So wrong)
I'm so weak but you're so strong (Never so strong)
Everything you do is just all right
And I can't walk away from you, baby, if I tried

[Verse 2]
Oh, Daddy, you soothe me with your smile
You're letting me know you're the best thing in my life
Oh, Daddy, if I can make you see
If there's been a fool around, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me

[Verse 1]
Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon, dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I’ll pray
Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud, cry out

[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
And is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

[Verse 2]
Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale
Up for sale

[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
Well, is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

[Chorus: Variation]
Well did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
And now tell me, is it over now?
Do you know how to pick up the pieces
And go home? And go home, and go home

[Outro]
Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Black widow
Pale shadow of a dragon
Dust woman
Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Ooh, black widow
Ooh, pale shadow, she’s a dragon
Gold dust woman
Woman, woman
Don't know why I have to work
Don't know why I can't play
Turn me off turn me out
But don't turn me away
Save me a place
I'll come running if you love me today

Don't know why I have to go
Don't know why I can't stay
Guess I want to be alone
And I guess I need to be amazed
Save me a place
I'll come running if you love me today 

[2x]

[Verse 1]
Could you ever need me?
And would you know how? Yeah
Don't waste our time, tell me now
All you have to do is speak out my name, yeah
And I would come running anyway

[Chorus]
And I said, "could it be me?"
"Could it really, really be?"
Over and over
"Could it really, really be?"
Over and over

[Chorus]
Oh I said, "could it be me?"
"Could it really, really be?"
Over and over
"Could it really, really be?"

[Verse 2]
Don't turn me away
And don't let me down
What can I do to keep you around?

[Outro]
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over

[Verse 1]
Honey, honey, honey
Who could be sweeter than you
Honey, honey, honey
Bitter sweet, but what can I do

[Verse 2]
Lord, it's good to talk to you
Even sweeter than wine
Don't take the love light away
Cause I'm far away from home

[Verse 3]
Daddy, all I'm trying to tell you
Lord, I really love you, love you, love you
Honey, honey, honey hi

[Outro]
Honey, honey, honey hi
(Daddy, all I'm trying to tell you)
Honey, honey, honey hi
(Daddy, all I'm trying to tell you)
(Oh, I'm far away from home)
Honey, honey, honey hi
(Daddy, all I'm trying to tell you)
(Oh, I'm far away from home)
Honey, honey, honey hi
(Daddy, all I'm trying to tell you)
(Oh, I'm far away from home)
Honey, honey, honey hi
(Daddy, all I'm trying to tell you)
(Oh, I'm far away from home)

[Chorus]
Counting on my fingers
Counting on my toes
Slipping thru your fingers
Watching how it grows
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta tell you what it's really all about

[Verse 1]
Do you ever wonder
Do you ever hate
Six feet under
Someone who can wait
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta tell you
Oughta tell you what it's really all about
You're never gonna to make it baby
Oh I guess I'm gonna make you crazy
Make it babe
Make it babe
Make it babe

[Chorus]
Counting on my fingers
Counting on my toes
Slipping thru your fingers
Watching how it grows
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta tell you what it's really all about

[Verse 2]
Buy another fixture
Tell another lie
Paint another picture
See who's surprised
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta
Someone oughta tell you what it's really all about
You're never going to make it baby
Oh you're never gonna make it crazy
Oh you're never gonna
Make it babe
Make it babe
Make it babe
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
You can love me baby but you can't walk out

[Outro]
Someone oughta someone oughta
Someone oughta someone oughta
Someone oughta someone oughta
Someone oughta someone oughta
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta tell you
Oughta tell you what it's really all about

[Verse 1]
All it took was a special look
And I felt I knew you before
I didn't mean to love you
Didn't think it would work out
But I knew we would be together
And I couldn't wait for more
But what can they say
It's not against the law

[Chorus]
I don't hold you down
Maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Think about me

[Verse 2]
I believe that you really want me
But it's not easy, just to give in
So let yourself go, and let love begin

[Chorus]
I don't hold you down
Maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Think about me

I don't hold you down
Maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Think about me

[Outro]
Baby, once in a while
Think about me
Baby, once in a while
Think about me
Think about me
Every, every once in a while
Think about me

[Verse 1]
Wait a minute baby
Stay with me awhile
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me 'bout the fire

[Chorus]
Drowning in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
When you build your house
Then call me home

[Verse 2]
And he was just like a great dark wing
Within the wings of a storm
I think I had met my match
He was singing
And undoing, and undoing
Ooh the laces
Undoing the laces

[Chorus]
Said Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, never stop
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
But when you build your house
Oh then call me home

[Verse 3]
Hold on
The night is coming and the starling flew for days
I'd stay home at night all the time
I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Ask me and I'm there, yeah
Ask me and I'm there 'cause I care

[Chorus]
In the sea of love
Where every woman would love to drown
But now it's gone
They say it doesn't matter anymore
If you build your house
Then please, call me home

[Chorus]
Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, and don't you ever stop
And now it's gone
No, it doesn't matter anymore
When you build your house
I'll come by

[Outro]
Sara
All I ever wanted, was to know that you were dreaming, Sara
There’s a heartbeat that never really died
Oh, won't you swallow your pride?
What makes you think you're the one
Who can laugh without crying?
What makes you think you're the one
Who can live without dying?

Every little bit
Is there
To see
Every little bit
Of you
And me

What makes you think I'm the one
Who'll be there when you're callin'?
What makes you think I'm the one
Who will catch you when you're fallin'?

Every little bit
Is there
To see
Every little bit
Of you
And me
What makes you think I'm the one
Who will love you forever?
Everything you do has been done
And this won't last forever

Every little bit
Is there
To see
Every little bit
Of you
And me

[Verse 1]
Every night that goes between
I feel a little less
As you slowly go away from me
This is only another test
Every night you do not come
Your softness fades away
Did I ever really care that much?
Is there anything left to say?

[Chorus]
Every hour of fear I spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly calm inside

[Verse 2]
I haven't felt this way I feel
Since many a year ago
But in those years are the lifetimes past
I did not deal with the road
And I did not deal with you, I know
Though the love has always been
So I search to find an answer there
So I can truly win

[Chorus]
Every hour of fear I spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly calm inside

[Verse 3]
So I try to say goodbye, my friend
I'd like to leave you with something warm
But never have I been a blue calm sea
I have always been a storm
Always been a storm
Ooh, always been a storm
I have always been a storm

[Outro]
We were frail
She said, "Every night he will break your heart" (Storm)
I should have known from the first
I'd be the brokenhearted (Storm)
(Storm)
I loved you from the start (Storm)
Save us
(Storm) And not all the prayers in the world will save us

[Verse 1]
That's all for everyone
That's all for me
That's all for everyone
Must be just exactly what I need
I care for everyone
I cry for more
That's all for everyone
Must be just exactly what I need
That's all

[Chorus]
I need somewhere to go
That's all
Must be what I need
That's all
I need someone to know
That's all
Must be what I need

[Verse 2]
I can't stay
I can't deceive
That's all for everyone
Must be just exactly what I need
So that's all for everyone
That's all for me
That's all for everyone
Must be just exactly what I need
That's all

[Chorus]

[Outro]
That's all for everyone
That's all, that's all, that's all, that's all

[Verse 1]
It's not that funny is it
When you don't know what it is
But you can't get enough of it
It's not that funny is it?

[Chorus]
Don't blame me!
Please 

[3x]
I didn't want to bleed so
I didn't want to be this late
So don't make me wait!

[Verse 2]
It's not that funny is it
No one to turn you on
All your hope is gone
It's not that funny is it?

[Chorus]
Don't blame me!
Please 

[3x]
You're here cause I say so
Didn't want to be this late
So don't make me
Don't make me wait!

[Bridge]
Here comes the nighttime looking for a little more
Waiting on the right time somebody outside the door

[Outro]
It's not that funny is it
When you don't know what it is
But you can't get enough of it
It's not that funny is it? 

[2x]
But you can't get enough of it 

[2x]
Intense silence
As she walked in the room
Her black robes trailing
Sister of the moon
And a black widow spider makes
More sound than she
And black moons in those eyes of hers
Made more sense to me
Heavy persuasion
It was hard to breathe
She was dark at the top of the stairs
And she called to me

And so I followed
As friends often do
I cared not for love, nor money
And I think she knew
Well the people, they love her
And still they are the most cruel
She asked me, be my sister
Sister, sister of the moon
Some call her sister of the moon
Some say illusions are her game
They like to wrap her in velvet
Does anyone, ooh, know her name

[Hook]
The weak or the strong, who got it going on?
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it going on?
You're dead wrong

[Verse 1]
Relax and take notes while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke, gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer, motherfucker say your prayers
"Hail Mary, full of grace"
Smack the bitch in the face, take her Gucci bag
And the North Face off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money, oh you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho
The head honcho, swift fist like Camacho
I got so much style I should be down with the Stylistics
"Make up to break up" Niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit, just the two hits
Her hitting the floor and me hitting the clit
Sucking on the tits, had the hooker begging for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was humping around and jumping around
Jacked her then I asked her, "Who's the man?" She said, "B-I-G"
Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Check the pain I inflict, like a convict, the Fulton digger
Jump in the Acura Vigor, after I stick ya
Rip ya like a razor, straight up Henny with no chaser
Watch me erase ya, misplace ya
Put you in the back with the derelicts, yeah, I pop plenty shit
Chump, I'm making hits, no time for the crack rock and shit
Took it to another level
Now I'm getting crazy papes, getting paid from the devils
Another amateur trying to damage the pedigree
Of the B-I-G-G-I-E, you know it's me
Hoes, I thought you know I'm smooth as a baby's ass
Smooth as Teddy Pendergrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass
The Brooklyn-born Teflon Don, wrecking shop
Getting props, proving nobody drops
Words as potent as the blunt smoking Bed-Stuy bandit
And niggas just can't understand it
I bust a cap for the brothers in Nap Nap, Comstock, and Clinton
You know my shit is hitting
Yeah, y'all, a fly nigga, Biggie Smalls
Kicking flavor, make a nigga wanna dig up in their drawers
For the burner, catch a body, I got styles like karate
Jiu-jitsu, when I hit you then I split you
Like a cantaloupe, hope you got a rope to hang yourself
I rob for self; from Brooklyn, where else?
Fat like a Lexus coupe, I ripped your troop
Not even Lois Lane could get the scoop
What you think, I'm stupid? My crew is mad deep
I hope you niggas sleep, huh, yo, Big, you're dead wrong

[Hook]

[Verse]
Everytime that you make me smile
It's the same old way it used to be
And that's enough for me

[Chorus]
Everytime that sleep don't come
It's the same old pain that used to be
And that's enough for me

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, mmm, ah, oh 

[x2]

[Outro]
Everytime that sleep won't come
It's the same old way it used to be
And that's enough for me 

[x3]

[Verse 1]
You look at me with those brown eyes
What do you want to do?
Do you have to have me
The way that I want you? I want you

[Bridge]
Sha-la-lah

[Verse 2]
When you look at me with those brown eyes
What do you want to say?
And are you just another liar?
Will you take me all the way? All the way?

[Outro]
Sha-la-lah

[Verse 1]
Go and do what you want
I know that you have the need
But you know that I'll wait, as long as it takes

[Chorus]
And you'll never make me
You'll never make me
You'll never make me cry

[Verse 2]
Now, I may not mean everything
But I'm happy to have your love
And don't worry baby, I'll be alright

[Chorus]
And I'll never make you
I'll never make you
I'll never make you cry

[Outro]
So go and do what you want
I know that you have the need
And don't worry baby, I'll be alright
You'll never make me
You'll never make me
You'll never make me cry

[Intro: Sam Sneak]
It's how we roll

[Chorus: Sam Sneak]
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah! We in control nigga!
Everytime I pull up, bitches they be like what up
Pull up I put the top down, pull off I put the hood up
Everything that I got now I got it because I stood up
Ya'll suckas was not round and made the way I was brought up
Cause I was always taught to just never fold
I bought another Rolls
I started from selling O's, now my bank account seven O's
And there's two commas on it
Riding, two llamas on it
This purp like my pancakes, I put Aunt Jemima on it
And I'm getting higher nigga, riding with Gotti nigga
Two Phantoms, an Aston Martin, boy that's a Bugatti nigga
In back of the Fisker, and I ain't mention the Rarri' nigga
Bitches like 'Bari nigga, oh
Boats and hoes, money, cars, and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Soon as we hit the party it's choices on all these hoes
We fucking all of they bitches, you niggas is getting old

[Chorus: Sam Sneak]
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I'm standing on the couch like fuck life
Pussy nigga playing games he can die tonight
And we just pulled up in a million dollar worth of cars
Million problems, thousand guns, just a couple dogs
Just a couple real niggas I can ride for
Black man's black 40 cal, black Tahoe
Black driver, white Rolls Royce, real nigga, I'm the ho's choice
Conversations with Meek about shit we did in the streets
How we fucked with our dogs, how we planning to eat
Bricked the rapper on the beat, hundred k in a week
Its CMG, MMG, everybody else enemy
Fuck boats and hoes, Cuban links in gold
The game done got cold, I know real niggas who told
Since that the role that they chose (fuck em!)
Send them hittas up to their door (murder)

[Chorus: Sam Sneak]
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold

[Verse 3: Betrayl]
I ain't dead but I'm the president
Money green, dutch for the medicine
Bogota going through the Mexicans
Switch it up, up to the nose it's heroin
An epidemic, Fall River walking dead again
The city on fire, we let it burn
Smoke got the BM-Dubb moving like a hovercraft
Off the highway and she trafficking Marilyn Monroe
Front door she passing it (let me get that)
Cause most times the corners are a gold mine
Out the hood now we shooting for the coast line
Boats and hoes, below deck with them bricks nigga
Cause you can keep that other shit with ya

[Outro: Betrayl]
Ace Diamond
We back nigga
Fucking with that other shit
It's New B

[Verse 1]
Her lips were waiting
Her eyes looked sad
The dreams of a lifetime
A year gone bad

[Verse 2]
The dreams of a lifetime
Told me wrong
Everything is all right
And now it's gone

[Chorus]
Don't blame me
(Please be strong) I know I'm not wrong

[Verse 3]
Here comes the nightime
Looking for a little more
Waiting on the right time
Somebody outside the door

[Chorus]
Don't blame me
(Please be strong) I know I'm not wrong

[Verse 1]
Her lips were waiting
Her eyes looked sad
The dreams of a lifetime
A year gone bad

[Chorus]
Don't blame me
(Please be strong) I know I'm not wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I seen so many things that make me wonder
But sometimes it's hard to tell

[Chorus]
I said, "Take your time"
But no one was listenin'
I walk a thin line

[Pre-Chorus]
They told me that I never would recover
Still some say they knew me well

[Chorus]
I said "Stay by my side"
But no one said nothin'
I walk a thin line

[Chorus]
And I said "Please toe the line"
But no one said nothin'
I walk a thin line

[Chorus]
And I said "Fate takes time"
But no one was listenin'
I walk a thin line

[Verse 1]
Come on baby, could you ever be
Just a little close to me
Ooh ooh ooh
Could we ever forget tonight?

[Verse 2]
Come on baby, let's take a stroll
You're feelin' warm so don't be cold
Ooh ooh oh
We will never forget tonight

[Chorus]
What a wonderful night to be
The stars must be my friends
To shine for me

[Verse 3]
Come on baby, now don't you be cold
Just remember that love is gold
Ooh ooh
We will never forget tonight

[Chorus]
What a wonderful night to be
The stars must be my friends
To shine for me

[Verse 4]
Come on baby, let's take a stroll
You're feelin' warm so don't be cold
Ooh ooh oh
Could we ever forget tonight?

[Outro]
We'll never forget tonight
It will be alright

[Verse 1]
When you dance do your senses tingle then take a chance?
In a trance, while the lonely mingle with circumstance?
I got something to tell you, you made it show
Let me come over, I know you know
When you dance, ooh ooh, I can really love

[Verse 2]
I can love, I can really love, I can really love
I can love, I can really love, I can really love
Like a mountain that's growing, a river that rolls
Let me come over, I know you know
When you dance, ooh ooh, I can really love

[Verse 1]
When you dance do your senses tingle then take a chance?
In a trance, while the lonely mingle with circumstance?
I got something to tell you, you made it show
Let me come over, I know you know
When you dance, ooh ooh, I can really love

[Intro]
Oh I slept in a derelict
And I ate off the floor
I was wrapped in a blanket
As a knock came on the door

[Chorus]
You can get out of here
Said a man in a raincoat
So I moved in with you and you loved me

[Verse 1]
Took a trip down the highway
And I spoke with my folks
It's a serious business
And there's no time for jokes

[Chorus]
You can get out of here
Said a middle aged lady
So I moved in with you, and you loved me

[Verse 2]
Yes you loved, you loved me
There was so much at stake
Too much confusion
I'd had all I could take

[Outro]
No more get out of here's
From a man in a raincoat
Because I moved in with you, and you loved me

[Verse 1]
He had all the rivers, under his power
He had all the mountains, under his command
You know that he had all the cities, in his own two hands
Yes and he had control of the four winds
And of the hunger of starving man

[Chorus]
And now we're passing on the reins
Because in my heart I can feel the change
You know the lord of light is laughing
Because things don't stay the same
Revelation, revelation

[Verse 2]
He controlled the brimstone, and eternal fire
Surrounds himself with downers, in the king of cold
You know that he had all the princes kissing his diamond ring
And I heard that he walled up, the door to summer
And cut the heart out of mister spring

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Dream on, keep your eyes wide open...
On a Sunday morning, with a voice that's cold
The future gives a warning of the fire that burns below
He puts his hands together, cause his faith is strong
And that's what you've been needing
Oh but it don't seem to last too long

[Chorus]

[Intro: Christine McVie and Bob Weston]
Oh, you're a dream
Hide your head in the sand

[Chorus: Christine McVie and Bob Weston]
You're far away when I want you around
And leave me lonely when I'm feeling down
Do you ever wonder or worry about me?
Did I ever love you, did you ever love me?
Do you ever wonder or worry about me?
Did I ever love you, did you ever love me?

[Verse: Christine McVie and Bob Weston]
Why is it, baby, our love just won't grow?
You made me happy, but time has gone by
Please leave me softly, I won't say goodbye
So all I wanted slips through my hands

[Chorus: Christine McVie and Bob Weston]
You're far away when I want you around
And leave me lonely when I'm feeling down
Do you ever wonder or worry about me?
Did I ever love you, did you ever love me?
Do you ever wonder or worry about me?
Did I ever love you, did you ever love me?

[Verse]
Go on, you know you're only one
Set me free
You take me up and turn around
But let me in
Take this shadow from my eyes
And tell me everything
Take the desert from my soul
And lift me up from down below
Let me take some pride in your creation
Because I have lived alone in castles that were lonely
And I have cursed the dawn and wondered why I do
Well I have wondered why I live
Now I know you must forgive
Let me stand inside your magic shadow
The night is coming faster
And you're feeling all unchained
In the north there is a jungle
Where rockets are aflame
And I hope that in the desert
There are ships and there is noise
And above the greatest city
There will shine a magic shadow
And a voice
It's taking long but I'm getting strong as I grow old
Please believe me let the magic reach me and I will unfold
I'll step aboard with you one day
And see my dust just melt away
And then I'll step inside your magic shadow
Dreamers

[Outro]
Oooohoooooohooooooohhhhhhh
Magic shadows
Oooohoooooohooooooohhhhhhhh
Have you seen, have you seen

[x3]
Have you seen, have you seen magic shadows

[x4]
Oohoohoh

[x5]

[Verse 1]
All I know is the way that I feel
Whenever you're around
You've got a way of lifting me up
Instead of bringing me down (instead of bringing me down)

[Chorus 1]
I can't fight it anymore
Since you've been around
We've got love in store

[Verse 2]
You're the only one I ever felt
Could be special to me
You look at me and I just melt
I'm scared of feeling that way

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2] 

[x2]
Never take your love away
Beggin' you, baby
Never take your love away
Oh darlin'
Never take your love away
Beggin' you, baby
Never take your love away

[Verse 1]
Standing in the shadows
The man I used to be
I want to go back
(can't go back, can't go back)
Melodies awaken
Sorrows from their sleep
I want to go back
(can't go back, can't go back)

[Verse 2] 

[x2]
She was just a dream maker
Dreamer of sighs
Shadow on the one who used to cry
A face as soft as a tear in a clown's eye
I want to go back
(can't go back, can't go back)

[Intro]
Meet me down by the railway station
I've been waiting
I'm through waiting for you
Train sings the same kind of blues

[Verse 1]
Well, I don't know why I always trusted
Sometimes I think that I must have
I must have been crazy
Crazy to wait on you, baby
Turned around and got pushed down, baby
Now I decided yesterday that I would leave you
I'm alright

[Chorus]
Please, I've been taking my time
You know, it's been on my mind
I hope you find a love
Your own designs of love
That's alright
That's alright

[Verse 2]
I believe, I believe that I know you
But we've been a long time
Now I've got to show you, that I
Well, I never did believe in time
You know, changing anybody's mind
Now, I can't define love like it should be
That's alright
It's alright

[Chorus]
Please, I've been taking my time
You know, it's been on my mind
I hope you find a love
Your own designs of love
That's alright
That's alright

[Verse 1]
Walked out, goodbye
I swore I never would cry
Tore a page of my heart
She wants me to be her friend
I'm lonely again
Tore a page of my heart

[Chorus]
Oh, tell me who wrote the book of love
Was it somebody from above
(ha, ha, ha)
Surely he must know all the rules
(ha, ha, ha)
Knowledge not meant for mortal fools
Must have been someone from above
Tell me, who wrote the book of love

[Verse 2]
In silence the lonely make all their mistakes
Tore a page of my heart
Someone in heaven above
Show me how to love
Tore a page of my heart

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Verse 1]
So long ago
Certain place
Certain time
You touched my hand
On the way
On the way down to Emmeline

[Pre-Chorus]
But if our paths never cross
Well, you know I'm sorry, but

[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

[Post-Chorus]
The rainbow's edge
(Aaron)
(Aaron)

[Verse 2]
So it's hard to find
Someone with that kind of intensity
You touched my hand, I played it cool
And you reached out your hand to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But if our paths never cross
Well, no, I'm not sorry, but

[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

[Post-Chorus]
The rainbow's edge
(Aaron)
(Aaron)

[Verse 3]
So long ago
It's a certain time
It's a certain place
You touched my hand and you smiled
All the way back you held out your hand

[Bridge]
If I hope and if I pray
Ooh, it might work out someday

[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the seven wonders)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end (I'll make a path there)
I'll never live to match the beauty again (I'll never live to see that beauty, that beauty, that same same beauty again)

If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
(Well if I hope and I pray)
(Well maybe it might work out someday)

If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the seven wonders)

[Chorus 1]
I'm out of my mind
And it's only over you
I'm out of my mind
And it's only over you

[Verse 1]
People think I'm crazy
But they don't know
Thought love had failed me
But now, they're watching it grow

[Chorus 2]
Angel, please don't go
I miss you when you're gone
They say I'm a silly girl
But I'm not a fool

[Verse 2]
People say they know me
But they don't see
My heart's your future
Your future is me

[Chorus 2]
Angel, please don't go
I miss you when you're gone
They say I'm a silly girl
But I'm not a fool

[Chorus 1]
I'm out of my mind
And it's only over you
I'm out of my mind
And it's only over you
I'm out of my mind
And it's only over you
I'm out of my mind
And it's only over you

[Verse 1]
New York, open your eyes to me
Let me be what I want to be
Tell me, tell me it's not too late

[Chorus 1]
Big Apple, takin' a bite of me
Whole world movin' below my feet
Not like, not like we do in L.A

[Chorus 2]
New York, make me a part of you
Straight, straight through the heart of you
Tell me, tell me it's not too late

[Chorus 3]
Flying high on the empire state
Flying high on the empire state

[Chorus 2]
New York, watch me burn ya down
Straight, straight through the heart of town
Tell me, tell me I'm not too late

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 3]
What can I say this time
Which card shall I play
The dream is not over
The dream is just away
And you will fly like some
Little wing
Straight back to the sun
The dream was never over
The dream has just begun
The dream has just begun

Fingers find the ivory keys
And a song begins to begin
Like a wolf on the run
And you will find
While in the wind
Something that you lost
The dream was never over, no
The dream was only lost
(hours and hours of waiting for you, so strong and so fleeting)
The dream has just begun
(and hours of waiting for you in hopes of meeting)
The dream has just begun
(this way)
Well, the dream has just begun
She remembers how good it can be
He remembers a melody
Ah, in the shadow of my shadow
In a gleam
He remembers how good it can be
She remembers a melody
Well, in the shadow of my shadow
In a gleam
(hours and hours of waiting for you, so strong and so fleeting)
The dream has just begun
(hours and hours of waiting this way meeting, me)
Hours of waiting for you
(so strong and so fleeting)
The dream has just begun...
(meeting this way)
Straight back now
(hours and hours of waiting so strong and so fleeting)
Hours and hours waiting this way
Hours and hours of waiting this way
Straight back
Straight back
Straight back... yeah!

He remembers a melody
He remembers how good it can be

[Verse 1]
Can you understand me
Baby, don't you hand me a line
Although it doesn't matter
You and me got plenty of time

[Bridge 1]
There's nobody in the future
So baby let me hand you my love
Ohh, there's no step for you to dance to
So slip your hand inside of my glove

[Chorus]
Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and)
Hold me, hold me, hold me

[Verse 2]
I don't want no damage
But how am I going to manage with you
Ohh, you hold the percentage
But I'm the fool payin' the dues

[Bridge 2]
I'm-a just around the corner
If you got a minute to spare
I'll be waitin' for you
If you ever want to be there

[Chorus]
Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and)
Hold me, hold me, hold me

[Chorus]
(Oh won't you)
Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and)
Hold me, hold me, hold me

[Solo]

[Chorus]
(Come on and)
Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and)
Hold me, hold me, hold me

[Chorus]
(Come on and)
Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and)
Hold me, hold me, hold me

[Outro]
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold 

[fade]

[Verse 1]
She's so crazy
She's so lazy
Keeps on coming
Keeps you running

[Chorus]
Caroline
Caroline
Time recedes with a fatal drop
Dusty fury on the mountain top
Cut the cord if you can
Caroline
Caroline

[Verse 2]
She's so cagey
She's so stagey
So attractive
So reactive

[Chorus]
Caroline
Caroline
Time recedes with a fatal drop
Dusty fury on the mountain top
Cut the cord if you can
Caroline
Caroline

[Chorus]
Caroline
Caroline
Time recedes with a fatal drop
Dusty fury on the mountain top
Cut the cord if you can
Caroline
Caroline
Caroline
Caroline

[Verse 1]
Oh no here I go again
Falling in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Love is like a grain of sand
Slowly slipping through your hands
Oh, oh, whoa

[Chorus 1]
Whoa, oh, Diane
Whoa, oh, Diane
(Diane)

[Verse 2]
Will I love you? I will, always
Will you stand by me? Always

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause love is like a grain of sand
Slowly slipping through your hand
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Chorus 1]
Whoa, oh, Diane
Whoa, oh, Diane
(Diane)

[Chorus 2]
Talking 'bout Diane, mmm mmm

Talking 'bout Diane, mmm-ooo
(Diane)
Whoa, oh, Diane
Oh-ohh, ooh
(Diane)

[Verse 1]
Listen to the wind on the water
Listen to the waves upon the shore
Try to sleep, sleep won't come
Just as I begin to fade

[Chorus]
Then I remember
When the moon was full and bright
I would take you in the darkness
And do the tango in the night
Tango

[Verse 2]
I keep the dream in my pocket
Never let it fade away
Inside, outside
No loneliness in this dream

[Chorus]
Then I remember
When the moon was full and bright
I would take you in the darkness
And do the tango in the night
Tango

[Non-lyrical vocal bridge]

[Guitar solo]
Tellin' you people, tell you no lie
My heart was breakin', I'll tell you why
Back and forth, lies unfurl
In the eyes, in the eyes, in the eyes of the world

(Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes)

Mondays children are filled with face
Tuesday's children are filled with grace
Back and forth, lies unfurl
In the eyes, in the eyes, in the eyes of the world

(Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes)

[Chorus 1]
Oh
Pretty baby
This feeling I just can't hide
You got me mystified (mystified, mystified, mystified)
(You got me mystified)

[Chorus 2]
Oh
Pretty darling
This feeling is deep inside
You got me mystified (mystified, mystified, mystified)
(You got me mystified)

[Verse]
The light that shines around you
It blinds my eyes
There's a magic surrounds you
Tell me where your secret lies

[Chorus 2]
Oh
Pretty darling
This feeling is deep inside
You got me mystified (mystified, mystified, mystified)
(You got me mystified)

[Chorus 1]
Oh
Pretty baby
This feeling I just can't hide
You got me mystified (mystified, mystified)
You got me mystified (mystified, mystified, mystified)

[Outro]
Mystified
(Mystified)
(Mystified)
(Mystified)
Mystified
(Mystified)
(Mystified)
(Mystified)
Mystified
(Mystified)

[Pre-Chorus]
There's distance between us
And you're on my mind
As I lay here in the darkness
I can find no peace inside

[Chorus]
I wish you were here holding me tight
If I had you near, you'd make it alright
I wish you were here
Because I feel like a child tonight

[Verse 1]
There's rain on my window
And I can count the drops
But I can't help feeling lonely
There's no way, no way that I could stop

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Each moment is a memory
Time's so unkind
Every hour filled with an emptiness
I can't hide

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Wish you were here

[Verse]
If I've been acting a little strange
And you have noticed it too
It's because my life has been rearranged
With the presence of you
The sky is the limit now
We can hit it on the nail
And when we do
I'll think about you
How can we fail
Can you give me one reason why
You'd ever let me down
I won't believe it baby, but I'll try
The truth's going to come around
The sky is the limit now
We can hit it on the nail
And when we do
I'll think about you
How can we fail
The sky is the limit
Oh, the sky is the limit
How can we fail
Sooner or later
I'll keep the promise
I made you
Sooner or later
It will be greater
Than we ever knew
The sky is the limit now
We can hit it on the nail
And when we do
I'll think about you
The sky is the limit now
We can hit it on the nail
And when we do
I'll think about you
How can we fail
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Oh, the sky is the limit
How can we fail
The sky is the limit
Oh, the sky is the limit
How can we fail

[Verse 1]
Well I try and I try
You can't forget her
Can't run, can't hide
When you remember
Nights that won't fade away
Yea fade away
Well I still go crazy
When you hear her name
Feels like you just left today
And it drives you insane
But you keep holding on
Yea holding on

[Chorus]
In the back of my mind
You live all the time
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
Every night, every day
That's where you still play
In the back of my mind

[Verse 2]
When I close my eyes
You can still touch her
And I fantasize
She's still your lover
When I wake up I see
The only place you'll be
I know where you'll be

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I remember your eyes burning bright
Like we touched the summer sun
I can see your shadow standing there
On the streets where we used to run
Remember

[Chorus]
In the back of my mind
You live all the time
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
Every night, every day
That's where you still play
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
You live all the time
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind

[Verse]
Do you know
All there is to know about love
And if you do
Then let me know
If I have learned enough
To make it without you

[Chorus]
Can I learn
All about love
I don't know enough to make it alone
Well I can leave it just the way it was
I can try
I'm gonna try

[Verse]
And if I fall
If I ever fall in love again
I hope I will feel the same

[Chorus]
Can I learn
All about love
I don't know enough to make it alone
Well I can leave it just the way it was
I can try
I'm gonna try

Do you know
All about love
Do you know enough to make it alone
Can you just leave it the way it was
Can you try

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Can I learn
All about love
I don't know enough to make it alone
Well I can leave it just the way it was
I can try

Well I can leave it just the way it was
Let me try
Well I can leave it just the way it was
Let me try

Well I can leave it the way it was

[Verse 1]
With the laughing eyes
You, the one with the haunting stare
Well you
You have the power to hypnotize
I should'a known better
I should beware

[Chorus]
Because I have followed you
Done everything for you
But you just won't look my way
So come on baby and
Save me
I'm running for cover
Save me
Is it one or the other babe
Save me
It's time for somebody else
Save me

[Verse 2]
Well, you, you could own the universe
Think about it and you'll realize
You, you got to believe me
And take my word
Look at me
It's written in my eyes

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I can't wait any longer
For paradise
I told you once
I'm not going to tell you twice

[Outro]
So come on baby and
Save me
I'm running for cover
Save me
Is it one or the other babe
Save me
I guess it's time for somebody else
Save me
Save me
I'm running for cover
Save me
Is it one or the other
Save me
I guess it's time for somebody else
Save me

[x8]

[Verse 1]
One set of doors was the color of honey
One set of doors was pink and grey
Well I wonder which set is mine, said she
As she walked down the long hallway
Well I wonder which set of rooms are mine
For in these rooms she would live and die

[Chorus]
Well it's better to have loved and lost
(Ah but it's better not to lose)
Then to never have loved at all
(Never have loved, never have loved at all)
Well it's better to have loved and lost
(Ah but it's better not to lose)
Then to always be alone
(Always be alone)
In your heart

[Verse 2]
I thought that there was more involved
Through all that time and all these months
I stopped many times to question you
Well I told you that it was the right thing to do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
But I knew that this was just for now
And the time would take its toll upon us all
Well it would break our hearts
Tear it apart
But no one understood
The affairs of the heart

[Chorus]
Well it's better to have loved and lost
Then to never have loved at all
(Never have loved, never have loved at all)
Well it'll break your heart
Tear it apart
But no one understands
(No one understands)
The affairs of the heart

[Verse 1]
Now I'm supposed to understand
Don't you think you're asking too much
What kind of fool do you think I am
Don't you think you've hurt me enough
Still you want to be friends
But I don't want to be just friends
So before you start with your sympathy
Just turn around and go
And if he breaks your heart, don't come crying to me
I won't be there anymore
Go ahead and cry your tears
Because I'm not going to dry your tears

[Chorus]
I've got hard feelings
When it comes to you and me
And these hard feelings
Just won't let me be
These hard feelings run deep
These hard feelings run deep

[Verse 2]
I'll be alright, don't you worry about me
I'll take care of myself
The first thing I need is you out of my life
The last thing I need is your help
Sorry I met you
Sorry I met you
I will forget you, someday

[Chorus] 

[x3]

[Chorus 1]
When the sun goes down and the moon shines bright
Honey, if you call my name, I will take away your pain
I will take good care of you tonight

[Verse 1]
Somebody broke your heart, tore your world apart
But that's all over, it's a brave new day
Somebody made you cry, took away your pride
But that's all over, let's be on our way

[Chorus 2]
When the sun goes down, and the moon shines bright
In my arms it's safe and warm, I give you shelter from the storm
I will take good care of you tonight

[Verse 2]
Somebody made you sad, treated you so bad
But that's all over, i won't let you down
Well, he was just a fool, wonder why so cruel
But you'll forget him, when I come around
When the sun goes down, and the moon rises high
Honey, open up your door and you won't have to hurt no more
I will take good care of you tonight
Well, step out of the shadows, let the night begin
When you hear me knocking, let me in

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Hurry, open up your door, and you won't have to hurt no more
I will take good care of you tonight

[Intro]
Don't you come too close to me
You're dangerous, can't you see
You can make the darkness mean more
Then it ever did
Ever did before

[Chorus 1]
It's a devil's disguise
Angel in black
And I recognize the face behind the mask
It's a devil's disguise
Angel in black

[Verse 1]
I don't know if I want you back
You're the cool nights of the desert
And the hot kisses of the sun
Why is it that I don't believe you
When you say I'm the only one
I know I'm the lonely one

[Chorus 2]
It's a devil's disguise
Angel in black
And I recognize the shadows from your past
It's a devil's disguise
Angel in black

[Verse 2]
Don't you know it'll never last
The face behind the mask
There will never be a second chance for you
Oh No
Not for you

[Chorus 1]

Don't you know it'll never last
The face behind the mask

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
I don't know if I want you back
I don't know if I want you back
Don't you know it'll never last
The face behind the mask

[Verse 1]
My love is like a rock
Nothing moves it away from you
And I can't feel the shock
You won't break it up
No matter what you do

[Chorus 1]
When it all comes down
Stand on the rock
When you come back around
Stand on the rock

[Verse 2]
Your love is like the sea
Waves crashing against my heart
Changing constantly
But you won't change the love
Too strong to fall apart

[Chorus]

[Bridge 1]
Sooner or later you'll see
Nothing's going to change this love in me
Stand on the rock, because it's all right
Stand on the rock

[Bridge 2]
Oh, you play so rough (so rough)
But my love's too tough
Might as well give it up

[Bridge 3]
Sooner or later I'll make you see
Nothing's going to change this love in me

[Refrain]
Stand on the rock, stand on the rock
Stand on the rock, stand on the rock

[Chorus]

[Refrain]

[Outro]
Stand on the rock

[Verse 1]
Dim and wavering
On a wind-blown night
Whose honour, whose anger
Cold and quivering
As was the wind-blown night
Into which she'd fallen, fallen

[Chorus 1]
Freedom, well it's a thing that is fleeting
Freedom is standing next to you
My intentions were clear
I was with him
Everyone knew
Poor little fool

[Verse 2]
Beautiful as you are
With that high spirit
Morning star of evil hit me
Cut me like a knife
Cool and collected
She became that with time
Totally rejected

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
It's all in the eyes
It's all in the way that you look
It's all in the way that you say very little
It's all in the way that you talk

[Chorus 2]
Look at me with daggers
It won't do you any good
All the looks that you've used on me
Don't work now that you've fallen, fallen, fallen

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2] 

[x2]
L

[Outro]
Freedom
Freedom
Everyone knew
Poor little fool

[x3]
Freedom
Come with me
Poor little fool
Freedom

[Verse 1]
Push too hard, I'll pack my bags, I'm going
Ahh, got to learn to let the river flow
Move too fast, You'll end up never knowing
What's inside my heart, give it time to grow
I need just a little space
Then I won't be afraid

[Chorus]
When it comes to love, got to treat it special
When it comes to love, shouldn't be no pressure
When it comes to love, got to take it easy
You can't be too careful, when it comes to love

[Verse 2]
In your eyes I see a fire burning
Never seen it ever burn so bright
Beneath my feet I feel the earth start turning
Long enough to take my breath away and I
Need to know, what you feel
Got to show, it's for real

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When it comes to love
Take It Easy
Got to learn to take it slow
When it comes to love
Keep believing
When it comes to love
Give it time, and just let it grow
I need to know, what you feel
Got to show, it's for real

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Verse]
Was it in my mind
Or was it true
That woman used to Hollywood living
Do you remember how
The angels sang
And your sorrows left you there
Right before the lights came up
Do you remember
You took my hand
Do you remember, my friend
Did you feel like it was
The second time with you
That feeling of a vivid memory
Well it had to do
With a dream come true
And someone that you loved
And would always love
The second time around
For us
She never looked back
Someone that you loved
And would always love
The second time around, for us
She never looked back
She could never look back

[Verse 1]
It's hard
When a love goes wrong
Picking up the pieces to go on
Our dreams
Are scattered in the wind
I won't let it take me under
Even though you tried...and

[?]

[Chorus]
I wonder why
Things go the way they do
Why people lie, and break a heart in two
I wonder why
Things go the way they do

[Verse 2]
It's strange
Strange the way I feel
Time is all I need to make me heal
You're gone
And now I'm all alone (now you're all alone)
I'll reclaim the thunder
Dry the tears i'be cried...still

[?]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now I'm turning my back on confusion
I won't live in a world of illusion
Well the river stopped running through me
You didn't see what you did to me
I've got to try to find, some kind of peace of mind
You're just a mystery to me

I'll reclaim the thunder
Dry the tears I've cried...still

[?]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
My heart is hanging on every word you say
Right now all logic's stripped away
It doesn't analyze your sincerity
It only listens and believes
Don't whisper
I love you
Unless you know it's true

[Chorus]
Be careful what you're saying
You're talking to my heart
Oh be careful what you're saying
You're talking to my heart

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you want someone so bad you fantasize
Sometimes the heat of passion lies
It's only human to give in to what you feel
That doesn't always mean it's real
Don't mislead
Don't misread
The magic of the night

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Think about it
Sometimes it's wise to wait
Think about it
Once spoken it's too late
Don't whisper
I love you
Unless you know it's true

[Chorus]

[Intro]
The bright lights of the city
Are starting to wear me down
And when I need you
You just can't be found

[Verse 1]
Loud days, endless nights
Are starting to make me crazy
And now you're gone
There's nothing left for me

[Chorus 1]
(hollywood)
I don't care for sunny weather
(Isn't that good)
I like the change of seasons better
(knock on wood)
I love the feel of rain upon my face
(for hollywood)
(hollywood)
No and I don't care if the snow comes down
(Isn't that good)
Kick the falling leaves around
(knock on wood)
Got to move to some other kind of town
(for hollywood)

[Verse 2]
Wonderful to know you
Great to know you cared
As I look back
At the crazy things we've shared

[Chorus 2]
I was dazzled by the moonlight
Blinded by neon nights
And as I look back
It never could be right

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
It's always something
Or it isn't nothing at all
It's feast or famine
Too hot or out in the cold
So here we stand
Alone together
Our backs against the wall
If my heart wasn't in it
I wouldn't be here at all

[Chorus 1]
Blow by blow
Well it's blow by blow
And here we go again
(here we go again)
Well it's blow by blow

[Verse 2]
Coming off the ropes
And fighting for the hope in us all
Are you in my corner
Or playing both sides of the wall
So make a stand
It's now or never
Cause life is much too short
And if your heart isn't in it
You shouldn't be here at all

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Blow by blow
Well it's blow by blow
I'm back on my feet again
(I'm back on my feet again)
Well it's blow by blow

[Verse 3]
I can almost see through the tears
And I've got my pride
The dreams that I've hidden for years
Just won't be denied
So here we stand
Alone together
Our backs against the wall
If my heart wasn't in it
I wouldn't be here at all

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
Tonight there's thunder in the sky
Just like the night you said good-bye
And what's left of a heartache
Runs like rain from my eyes

[Chorus]
The winds of change
Going to blow it all away
Ain't it strange
How you won't matter
The winds of change
Going to blow it all away

[Verse 2]
I stood like a rock against the storm
And you never knew, did you, how I was torn
And if your memory finally leaves me too
Well I won't sit and mourn

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I should have known better than to love you
I should have known that you were the hurting kind
Now I'm so tired of thinking of you
I just want to forget that you were ever mine
Tonight there's shadows on my face
Every one tells a story of your disgrace
But soon the dawn will come
And I'll be gone without a trace

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Isn't it strange
How you won't matter

[?]

[Intro]
Oh my mind is made up about you
Now and always
Though the seasons come and they go
Nothing will ever change

[Verse 1]
Well I took a little chance
And I laid my heart down
I thought you'd be the one
Who would always stick around
I took a little time
Though I knew it would be
That we had a date with destiny

[Chorus]
Well out of the darkness
And out of the long black night
You have given me heart, yes
And you showed me the light
And I do, I do
I love you for what you are

[Verse 2]
Well this heart of mine
I know it so well
There are so many strange stories
That I could tell
Many is a time
I went out on a limb
You reached out for me baby
And you brought me back again
A lot of stormy nights
I've seen many a full moon, but darling
This is love in the afternoon

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Outro]
Yes I love you for what you are
I love you for what you are
I do love you for what you are
Yes I do love you for what you are

[?]

[Verse 1]
No matter what goes wrong
You'll never be alone, baby
Just lay down beside me
And let your love hide me, oh baby

[Chorus]
Seems that things
Don't mean a thing
When I
I mean nothing without you

[Verse 2]
And if you're ever feeling down
I'll come down and hang around you, baby
Because I hold the winning hand
Just to get to stand beside you baby

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh I'm just going to do whatever
Keeps us together, oh baby
Because I love you more then love
And I put nothing above you, oh baby

[Chorus]
And things they aren't going to mean a thing
And I mean, I mean nothing
No nothing without you

[?]

[Outro]
Oh I mean nothing without you

[?]

[Intro]
There's a place
I sometimes see you there
It's a place that I visit
Most every night

[Verse]
And I see your face
Your eyes tell me you still care
But it's suddenly over
With morning's first light

[Chorus] 

[x2]
As the day begins
This feeling is going strong
Sometimes the only thing
That keeps me going on
And until you find
Your own way back to me
I'll be forever
Dreaming the dream

[Intro]
I thought I'd let you go
In my heart and in my mind
And look towards the future
Leaving the past behind

[Verse 1]
Well maybe it's the season
That season of the year
Defying all my reason
I just want you to be here
I want you to be here

[Chorus]
Sooner or later
Sooner or later I'll forget
I want you to be here
Sooner or later
Sooner or later I'll forget

[Verse 2]
And though it's not the first time
I've thought of you this way
The darkness of the winter
Keeps my happiness at bay
It's easy to forget you
In the summer, in the light
With the days of lazy laughter
And sweet, sweet dreams in the night
Sweet dreams in the night

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
S all I really mean is
When all is said and all is done
It's all because of you babe
That I'm the lucky one
I am the lucky one

[Chorus]

I am the lucky one

[Outro]
Sooner or later
Sooner or later I'll forget
I am the lucky one
Sooner or later

[Verse 1]
Well there will be times
When the memories fade
There will be words we've said
We just can't take away
I'm only saying
That as time goes sailing on
Nothing is forgotten baby
Nothing is really gone

[Chorus]
I remember the nights in estoril
A kiss and oh the never ending thrill
And I remember the coming storm
Oh and you my ove, how you kept me warm

[Verse 2]
Well there will be times
When we can't agree
We can't help but see things
A little differently
I'm only saying
That as time goes sailing on
How can something so right
Ever be wrong

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Your hand reaching out to me
Dark clouds gathering in their wake
I've seen it all before
But I've never felt it more
This time there is no mistake
Oh I remember
And I remember the coming storm
Oh and you my love, how you kept me warm

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I remember
Remember

[?]

[Verse 1]
Baby I've been your shadow
I'm on your heels both night and day
Baby I'm getting warmer
I'm getting closer, inches away
I've been watching every move you make
And I've got feelings overdue

[Chorus]
I got it in for you
(I got it in for you)
I got it in for you
(I got it in for you)

[Verse 2]
I've been running under cover
In the darkness of the night
So if you're looking over your shoulder
You will see me out of sight
Now I'm moving into your light
I think it's high time you knew

[Chorus]
(I got it in for you)
I'm not gonna give up
(I got it in for you)
Don't want to do without
(I got it in for you)
I'll win you over
(I got it in for you)
Over and over
I got it in for you
(I got it in for you)
I got it in for you
(I got it in for you)

[Verse 3]
Baby don't you worry
You won't be lonely anymore
Baby I've been planning
All the romance you're looking for
And it's right outside your door
And tonight I'm coming through

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Well it's time to say goodnight
And finally turn out the light
How do I say in some simple way
How much you have been on my mind

[Verse 1]
But I have to let you go
It's time to move on, don't you know
But you can rely on a love that won't die
For haven't I told you so

[Chorus]
So let's stop before it's too late
And leave it all up to the fates
Beause in spite of the heartaches
And troubles in love
I'd do it all over
Do it all over again

[Verse 2]
Each of us and everyone
Carries a burden of love
But as far as I go in my heart I know
It's you I'll be thinking of
So what is there left to say
As I see us drifting away
You can always depend on a love that won't end
Won't you think of me, think of me that way

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well it's it's time to move on to the rain
And finally break the chain
In spite of the heartaches
And troubles in love
I'd do it all over (do it all over)
Do it all over again
Stop before it's too late

[Outro]
Because in spite of the heartaches
And troubles in love
I'd do it all over (do it all over)
I'd do it all over again

[Verse 1]
These strange times I think of a friend
They said was a man of the world
When all the time he was in a fight
Between the dark and the light
Yes I too, my friend, find the devil
Trying to make me do things I don't want to do
Now I find myself crying out
God is nowhere, God is nowhere

[Chorus]
These strange times I look in my heart
And see the dark not the light
And how I'm sad and wished I was in love
And I look to the sky and cry out
God is nowhere, God is nowhere
And this is hell
Being caught between the dark and the light
(Daddy, daddy, hold on
God is now here, God is now here)

[Verse 2]
These strange times I too have dreams
And things that make me wonder
If to walk a thin line is like dying alone
And I'm trying to find my way home
To where God is now here and the dark is now light
Yes I'm crying out, God is now here
God is now here and that was hell
Being caught between the dark and the light
Between the dark and the light

[Chorus]
These strange times I look in my heart
And how I'm sad and wished I was in love
And I look to the sky and I cry out
God is now here, God is now here
God is now here, God is now here
And I find that I wished I was in love
I wished I was in love (I love you)
And I wished I was in love (I love you)
I wished I was in love (I love you)

[Verse 1]
Where are you darling?
When my Moon is rising
And your sun is shining down
What are you doing?
Are you missing me
The way that I'm missing you now?

[Chorus]
The river goes on and on
And the sea that divides us
Is a temporary one
And the bridge will bring us back together

[Verse 2]
What are you doing?
Going down in to Soho
As I take my rest tonight
What are you doing?
Are you busy with your world?
Well I wish you were busy with mine

[Chorus]

[x4]

[Verse 1]
Once again she steals away
Then she reaches out to kiss me
And how she takes my breath away
Pretending that she doesn't miss me

[Chorus]
Ooh, I would bleed to love her
Ooh, bleed to love her
Ooh, I would bleed to love her

[Verse 2]
And once again she calls to me
Then she vanishes in thin air
And how she takes my breath away (breath away)
Pretending that she's not there

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Somebody's got to see this through
All the world is laughing at you
And somebody's got to sacrifice
If this whole thing's going to turn out right

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Bleed to love her

[x2]

[Verse 1]
My little demon, coming on down
My little demon's turning me around
All of my friends all telling me
That I just ain't the man I used to be

[Chorus]
I really don't like it
Ain't nothing I can do
I really don't like it
I'm leaving it to you

[Verse 2]
My little demon, making me choose
Making me an offer I can't refuse
Hard as a rock,dry as a bone
Big or little,know that I will take you home

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Why try to hide it?
Fight it, fight it

[Chorus]

[Outro]
My little demon is coming after me
My little demon it's all that I can do
To keep that little demon, to keep that little demon
Just to keep that little demon away from you

[Verse 1]
And he says, what do you love to do?
Outside your world
Who spends time with you?
Whom do you love when you're not working?
Sweet girl
Where would you go
If you had the time?
Crossing some crazy state-line somewhere?
To whom do you cry?
People are unkind
Sweet girl

[Chorus]
But I chose to dance across the stages of the world
Everyone said I'd never learn
And I still hear your words, well
I waited all my life for you
Sweet girl

[Verse 2]
I did try to come back and listen
You never knew it
I didn't wish it
And I did hear every answer of every question
It's all about protection
Still through the sunlighted days I wait
Track a ghost through the fog
The sun is burning me
And you come running out
In the wind with me
The ocean is your blanket

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I watched you fly through the world
In a golden ball
Many are the cities that I never saw at all

[Outro]
Sometimes I feel like I was always on-call
Sometimes even I am allowed to fall
He says, come down here for a minute
Well, come down here for a minute
He says, come down here for a minute
Sweet girl
What's the world coming to
What they say isn't true
You can't plant no seed
Where there's only greed
I can walk anywhere
I can walk anytime
But the lone highway
Is the only way

What's the world coming to what's the world coming to
Everyone's gone to the moon what's the world coming to

Every night every day
In this house filled with shame
I can say I care
But there's no one there
There's no truth in my lies
There's no light in my eyes
And it's all I guess
That I'll ever miss
What's the world coming to what's the world coming to
Everyone's gone to the moon what's the world coming to

I can jump right off fall right into the ocean
I can come right out mean just what I say
But if I don't call for a reservation
They'll just turn me down turn me inside out

I don't say what they want
I don't do what they say
So I'm on their list
So I'm gone I guess

What's the world coming to what's the world coming to
Everyone's gone to the moon what's the world coming to

[Verse 1]
All the sainted sinners
They pay handsomely
M S C A E they make the weapons
And they run the prisons
And they sell the justice
Because being guilty is just good business
Well we're standing out on the borderline
Ain't no one here going to stop it now

[Chorus]

[x2]
Murrow's turning over in his grave (Murrow's turning over in his grave)
Ed Murrow had a child the damn thing went wild

[Verse 2]
Half-closed eyes and unconscious death
Do you feel the ooze as your brain drains out
From the pneumatic drills and sharpened knives?
Blood in the sky are you dead or alive?
All the restless people and the bitter green
Well, it takes the gold makes the spirit mean

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Illume, says the candle that I burn
A reflection in the window
All the way to Point Dune
Illume, like it dances
I am a cliff dweller
From the old school
I like the coastal cities
I like the lights
I like the way the ocean blends
Into the city at night
Like living on a working river
This coastline is glittering
Like a diamond snake
In a black sky

[Chorus]
I'm alone now
With my thoughts
Of how we could make it
Of how we could get out
What we've been through
All of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champra
Shadow of a stranger

[Verse 2]
I will not take you for granted
I wouldn't trade you for jade
Or for diamonds
Not for one minute
Not for anything
I need you to be there
Just remember when I am haunted
That I was just so scared

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
What I saw on this journey
I saw history go down
I cannot pretend
That the heartache falls away
It's just like a river
Ooh, it's never ending
I cannot pretend
That the heartache falls away
Because it's just like a river
It's never ending
It's just like a river
It's never ending

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(What I saw on this journey, I saw history go down)
(I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away)
(It's just like a river, ooh, it's never ending)
(I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
What I saw on this journey, what legends are made of
I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away
Just like a river, ooh, it's never ending
No, I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away
Because it's just like a river, it's never ending
Falls away, like a river, it's never ending
La la la la, la la la la

[x2]

[Verse 1]
He fell for her again, she watched it happen
Every day, day by day
But more important, night by night
She watched it all come into play
He held her hands, she listened to what he had to say

[Chorus]
Thrown down, like a barricade
Maybe now he could prove to her
That he could be good for her
And they should be together

[Verse 2]
You've shaken your faith in me, no
You've shaken my faith in everything else
A decision no one makes, and now you're going home
Faith is a hard thing to hold on to
Something inside you says I don't have to
You're not like other people, you do what you want to
You're not like other people, you do what you want to

[Chorus]
Thrown down, like a barricade
Maybe now he could prove to her
That he could be good for her
And they should be together

[Verse 3]
You say you're sorry
Now you should walk away
But it's so overwhelming
You have nothing left to say
You can sit outside his door and wait
Well, you can dedicate your pain to him

[Chorus]
All thrown down, like a barricade
Maybe now he could prove to her
That he could be good for her
And they should be together

[Outro]
About just how much he never really told her
Thrown down
About how difficult it had been to be without her
Thrown down

[Verse 1]
At the end of the day
The end of the light
She keeps the remains of all of her foes
Miranda is dying with all of her might
She never comes
She always goes
She sticks the camera right into her arm
Anything to forget what the trouble's about
It causes her pain
That's part of the charm
She's down for the count then finally out

[Chorus]
Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
But the lion still rules Miranda
And Miranda is always alone

[Verse 2]
She sees her face in another magazine
And the walls all close in as the fancy takes flight
Can't stand to be loved
But she loves to be seen
She slips down headlong into the night

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And then all at once the sun starts to rise
She sees her father holding her down
All the daylight is poison to her eyes
She slips down the shade and lets herself drown

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The lights shine down the marina
All across her safety zone
But loneliness follows Miranda
And Miranda is always alone

[x3]

[Outro]
Ooh!

[x6]

[Verse 1]
Why do you come around
So very much
You know it just brings you down
It's just something you can touch
You don't belong here
I guess you never did
Whisper, look up, in your ear
You just keep it so well hid

[Pre-Chorus]
Anyone at all
Could see what was missing
Could see you were dying
But no one was crying

[Chorus 1]
And I did hear what you said
Now I can go home
All my days are blue
All my days are bright

[Chorus 2]
Red Rover, Red Rover, Red Rover
We come, we come, we come, we come
To take you over (ah)
Take you over (ah)
Red rover (ah)
Take you over (ah)

[Verse 2]
One of the quiet ones
One of the few
Now fall down onto your knees
Show us all what you can do
We came around here
To see if you were well
And there's nothing for you to fear
In Heaven or in Hell

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
Something in you brought out something in me
That I've never been since
That part of me that was only for you
That kind of romance
Comes only once, that kind of love
That kind of fever dance
That you love because you become someone else in an instant

[Chorus]
Say you will, say you will give me one more chance
At least give me time to change your mind
That always seems to heal the wounds
If I can get you to dance

[Verse 2]
Something in you put a hold on my heart
It's hard to believe now
Here in the place that will never be dark
I remember that place
That kind of touch, electricity of love
That certain kind of grace
That you love because you become someone else
