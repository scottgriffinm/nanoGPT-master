does not last
In the trials of the present
No matter how low
You bring me such peace
And you won't let me go

For when you are laughing
Like silver, like rain
You cool me, you soothe me
And love me again
For a few perfect hours
The world lets me be
You know how to break down
Oh oh
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me

In the trials of the present
No matter how low
You bring me such peace
And you won't let me go
Oh don't let me go
For when you are laughing
Lile silver, like rain
You cool me, you soothe me
And you love me again
For a few perfect hours
The world lets me be
You know how to break down
Oh oh, oh oh
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
Turn towards the neon night
And watch the spectre of the night time
Read the sign killing time
And they can't see me, they can't see
Synthetic sounds around the town
Moaning bus queues all alone
Trying to find their own way home
Some are young and some are grown

There's still time for me
With just a little help from you

There's still time for me
There's still time for me

The mist of the city has soaken through my clothes
The people who were there before were only there to gloat
Synthetic sounds around the town
Moaning bus queues all alone
Trying to find their own way home
Some are young and some are grown
Get some bitches on yo dick or keep that yee yee ass haircut

[Verse 1]
Now I've done had lots of relationships
Ain't none of them ever added up to shit
My folks they always told me what you wish
Be careful 'cause that one thing you could get
So I prayed to the Lord to send me love
Send me something like an angel from up above
But instead I got a chick who played on my heart
She had me feeling good then tore me apart, now I'm left with the hurt

[Chorus]
Love ain't supposed to feel this way
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause you pain
Love ain't supposed to make me cry
But now I'm tryna wipe my eyes, some hating love
Let me tell you, love ain't supposed to feel this way
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause me pain
Love ain't supposed to make me cry
But now I'm tryina wipe my eyes, some hating love

[Verse 2]
She was like the devil in disguise, yeah
Spending time with me and thinking of other guys
And even though I tried my best
I can't describe the way she made me feel
All over a girl, who never gave her all
Never gave me much, when it came to love
I don't know why I spent so much time
On a love that wasn't mine and the pain is so unkind, yeah

[Chorus]
Love ain't supposed to feel this way
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause you pain
Love ain't supposed to make me cry
But now I'm tryna wipe my eyes, some hating love
Let me tell you that love ain't supposed to feel this way
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause me pain
Love ain't supposed to make me cry
But now I'm tryina wipe my eyes, some hating love

[Bridge]
Now it ain't even worth my time
Love ain't supposed to feel like I'm losing my mind
I once was blind, but now I see
The girl was playing games, she ain't the one for me
I'm tryina told ya
If you find a love, just don't close your eyes, you might go blind
Gotta keep it smart, give it all your heart, if you fall too far
In love you'll find the hard way

[Chorus]
That love ain't supposed to feel this way
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause you pain
Love ain't supposed to make me cry
But now I'm tryna wipe my eyes, some hating love
Let me tell you, love ain't supposed to feel this way
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause me pain
Love ain't supposed to make me cry
But now I'm tryina wipe my eyes, some hating love (break it down)

Released as a uk b-side in 1990

We look at the table
And we look at the time
We see a short fuse burning
We're standing on a land mine

You look at the cold soup
I look at the grey wall
I see a red flag burning
Yeah, man we need a santa claus

Down on the homeless avenue
Down among the rocks and stones
The cradle falls but the buck stops here
Let's think about their hearts and bones

And we all need a medicine man
All need a medicine man
Don't we need a medicine man
His shake and his rattle and his helping hand
See the meat of a nation
On the back of a truck
I think we're waste in a dumpster
Hey sorry kid it's tough luck

She was adorable
And he was a good boy
They were inseparable
Yeah bitten by the cold war

Rags on the shapes of millions
Tears among the cuts and blows
The backbone snaps and the kids can't dance
Let's think about their hearts and bones
Baby what's wrong
Is it something that someone has said about me
What have you heard
Is there anything that you want to say to

And baby please don't you cry
Don't let the tears drown your eyes
Baby listen to what I say
I love you and that's all that matters

Come and sit down
And tell me just what is wrong with you
Don't you believe
The stories that tell you that I'm not true

I'd like to know
About the things you have heard
I'd hate to think of the things
Which mighht have occured

Baby believe me
I'll always love you
And please, please don't you cry
Don't let the tears drown your eyes
Baby listen to what I say
I love you and that's all that matters
We can spend the night right
So honey turn out the lights
And do it nice and slow
Do it nice and slow

You can work on a charm
And tell the man in your arms
To do it nice and slow
Do it nice and slow

Lying here in a way that I have always wanted
Close to you in a scene that I have always haunted
Time and time again we defended a right to cling to
Our love-shy goodbyes, for broken hearts could cry

You can do it, you can do it slow
You can do it slow, slow, slow
You can do it slow, slow
Do it nice and slow

You can turn on the heat
To keep a man on the streets
When you do it nice and slow
I like it when you do it nice and slow
You can work on a spell
And weave your magic so well
When you do it nice and slow
Come on and do it nice and slow

You can do it, you can do it I know
You can do it nice and slow
You can do it, you can do it
You can do it nice and slow, slow
I like it when you do it slow, slow

Come on and do it
Do it nice and slow
They laid beneath the pine trees with their caps over their eyes
They were drunk with home and mama as they brushed away the flies
In an instant before the sunrise they had gunned the rebels down
As their flags were torn at half mast in the ruins of the town
There were white sails on the water for the crippled on the beach
There was a lack of ammunition so the cause was incomplete
When the bugle blew at breakfast and they knew their ships were in
Signs of grand assurance were carried on the wind

Take it home, take it low, take responsibilities
Came the message from the front
For the captains, captains quarters must retreat
Pack the compass, pack the tents, take the bunks

They just chalked it down in history but they kept their uniforms
They put their medals on the sideboards and they went back to their farms
For it was just a mere reminder that they stood beside the best
That God had saved the chosen few and the devil took the rest
On the plains above the rock face where the sculptured eagles swoop
There's a haunted yell for action among the spectres of his troops
It was silent on the coastline as the crazy angels danced
With the sound of retreating footfall from his military camp
Your life stepped lightly out our hands
When no one's looking out you understand
Your world was a wheel but the cog ceased to turn
The bottom fell out and our fingers got burned

And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground
Oh your black icy stare once cut down my friend
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end

Every new version of the way of life
Leaves you reckless and searching for stars in the night
But whose kid are you when they finally decide
The lifestyle you led and the way that you died

And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground
Oh your black icy stare once cut down my friend
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end

But they're oh so simple, they're still trying to tell
The difference for you between heaven and hell
To glorify something, your legends are found
But all they bought you was a hole in the ground
Years rolling by just like a dream (ooh)
I'm partly human and I'm partly machine
They've lost you and fate put your name on a stone (ahh)
Perhaps now my friend they might leave you alone (ahh)

And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground
Oh your black icy stare once cut down my friend
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end
Music by elton john
Never released

There's a picture in the nursery of a well known soldier man
And he wants to be like father when he grows up if he can
His eyes survey the floorboards with his soldiers around him
But fear not for the future, you will climb the highest mountain

So regimental sergeant zippo
Stand up to attention will you
Hear the bugle sounding in the morning call up rising
So your cowboy castle is standing
You're the one who is commanding
Watch them march along the landing down the stairs

Just a small boy in a small boy's world
And small boys do strange things
He likes to see the match sticks fly
And hear the cannons ring
For his eider down, his battle field
And in his dreams his fights are real
Until the field is won, aim, fire the guns
Have you ever had a good time turn bad
When the leaves turn brown
And the shattered glass just splinters
It's days like this that you can't resist
A long tall drink
And a big yellow sun in the winter

And you can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

Did you ever pray you could stay away
Company excluded
From the curse of the family circle
In a big round room on the edge of the moon
There's a shooting star
In a race for the final hurdle

No need to worry, no need to worry
No need to worry when you dance alone
You already made it, you already made it
When you're dancing in the end zone
Hey armadillo what you doing in the garden
Slumbering and spherical, you're always hanging around
Leather on the outside but a delicate interior
Very like a lot of human beings I have found

Hey armadillo I can't tell which way you're facing
Maybe that's a good thing, maybe you don't even know
No one's gonna bother you if they can't find your front end
There again I guess you find your love life rather slow

In the armadillo circle
In that armour-plated set
The philosophy is simple
What you see ain't what you get
In the armadillo culture
In that well-protected creed
A solid hide to hide in
Is the only thing you need
Hey armadillo

Hey armadillo what you doing in the desert
Is a life of burrowing the answer to it all
What I would give to leave my problems six feet underground
And always be the perfect shape to be, and have, a ball
In the armadillo circle
In that armour-plated set
The philosophy is simple
What you see ain't what you get
In the armadillo culture
In that well-protected creed
A solid hide to hide in
Is the only thing you need
Hey armadillo
Hey armadillo
Time has told me
You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind

And time has told me
Not to ask for more
Someday our ocean
Will find its shore

So I'll leave the ways that are making me be
What I really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making me love
What I really don't want to love

Time has told me
You came with the dawn
A soul with no footprint
A rose with no thorn

Your tears they tell me
There's really no way
Of ending your troubles
With things you can say
And time will tell you
To stay by my side
To keep on trying
'Till there's no more to hide

So leave the ways that are making you be
What you really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making you love
What you really don't want to love

Time has told me
You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind

And time has told me
Not to ask for more
For some day our ocean
Will find its shore
I'm very low but not too dim
I can still see the faces of you and him
I remember well how it used to be
You remember too obviously

Remember when, remember when I was Tealby Abbey then
It was not so long ago maybe a hundred years or so
When I was Tealby Abbey
That's a long long time ago
When I was Tealby Abbey
That's a long long time ago

When the clock stopped and the rocks dropped
And the gravel started giving away
I can still recall when we were small
But oh what a fateful day

In younger times, children climb
Up and down your walls
And a curse on the day the fates will say
For our world, the circle turns again
Throughout the year we've seen the seasons change
It's meant a lot to me to start anew
Oh the winter's cold but I'm so warm with you
Out there there's not a sound to be heard
And the seasons seem to sleep upon their words
As the waters freeze up with the summer's end
Oh it's funny how young lovers start as friends
Yes it's funny how young lovers start as friends
Just got the price in my pocket for a one course meal
My shoes are tilting over to an angle at the heel
I should be feeling sorry for myself and I may
But I've got a little happiness, I know she's gone away

Sara's coming back to me, yes she is
To take away my suffering and pain
Sara's coming back to me, yes she is
To show me that the good times will be here once again

She's got the face of an angel and a heart made of gold
She's got me feeling like a spy that came in from the cold
Now I can shout about it, that's the way that I feel
'Cause Sara's coming back to me, she's coming back for real

Now I know that I wasn't very kind to her before
'Cause I was staying out at night, I guess it made her sore
And there were times that I thought she'd left me for good
But she wrote to me this morning, and she said she never could

[Verse 1]
Girl, you ready, say you ready
Hope you're ready, know you ready
All I ask is when I'm in that thang, hold it steady , get it, get it, true freaks
Loose sheets, you gone wet it, make that pussy hurricane
Room spins like a tornado when that thunderstorm hit it
Bet if you caught amnesia this night you still won't forget it
Made a promise to ya body, kept my word, yeah I did it
Girl, it's on

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd like to welcome you to Chapter Five
Chapter Five
Girl I been writing this story a long time
This is Chapter five

[Chorus]
Lay your body, bring your body, bring your body girl
Got ya body, I'ma treat it like it mean the world
Just some sexing and some sweating in between us girl
Show me your loving is all mine, this is Chapter Five
Woah, woah, Chapter Five
Girl I been writing this story a long time
This is Chapter Five

[Verse 2]
Girl, I'm on it, focused on it
Don't you want it? Know you want it
Yes I'm flexing, you so sexy
No contestants, no opponents
You the winner, be my dinner
Know you lonely, know I only wanna
Make that pussy hurricane
This is Chapter Five, this is Chapter Five

[Chorus]
Lay your body, bring your body, bring your body girl
Got ya body, I'ma treat it like it mean the world
Just some sexing and some sweating in between us girl
Show me your loving is all mine, this is Chapter Five
Woah, woah, Chapter Five, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd like to welcome you to Chapter Five
Chapter Five
Girl I been writing this story a long time
This is Chapter Five

[Bridge]
Take you where you know you need to go
Swept you off your feet and now we on the floor
So many positions I know, I know, I know
This is Chapter Five

[Chorus]
Bring your body, bring your body, bring your body here
'Bout to leave my name on it just to make it clear
Touch your body with my voice girl, give me your ear
Am I making myself clear? This is Chapter five
Ooh, this is the chapter
You say your man ain't there, no?
Slide me in and I'll make that pussy hurricane
This is Chapter five
Lay your body, bring your body, bring your body girl
Got ya body, I'ma treat it like it mean the world
Just some sexing and some sweating in between us girl
Ain't no stressing just some sexing and some sweating
Won't you be my special guest up in this chapter?
Lay your body, bring your body, bring your body girl
Lay your body, bring your body, bring your body girl
Got ya body, I'ma treat it like it mean the world
Just some sexing and some sweating in between us girl
Show me your loving is all mine, this is Chapter Five

[Chorus]
But I gotta go right now
I don't wanna leave
But I gotta go right now
I'll be back before you know it

[Verse]
Goodbyes are so hard
Before I go, I just wanna thank those that got me here
First and foremost, I wanna thank the Lord

Songbook baby

[Chorus]
I don't wanna leave
But I gotta go right now
I'll be back before you know it
Steamboat waiting by the waterside
Sunlight shining on the morning tide
Got my ticket in my hand
Got some celebrating planned

Can't remember when I felt so fine
I've been waiting such a long long time
Just to hear those engines hum
Look out dreamboat here I come

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
All aboard, make it fast
Thank the lord, I'm coming home at last

If you love me like you did before
Be there waiting on the distant shore
When my steamboat comes inside
Then I know we'll be alright

And I say dream on dreamboat, let your love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Turn the crank, change the gear
Raise the flag and let's get out of here
Feels so good to know that soon I'll see
You've been saving all your love for me
For honey if there's any doubt
Just be sure I don't find out

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Cast the line, check the fuse
Save some time, this ain't no pleasure cruise

Tell the captain not to take too long
Keep that big wheel turning fast and strong
Fires are burning down below
Come on steamboat don't be slow

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Wind the springs, set the course
Pull some strings before I turn to force

Dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Ring the bell, sound the horn
Move like hell, I'm heading back where I was born

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
All aboard and make it fast
Thank the lord, I'm coming home at last
And I say dream on dreamboat, let your love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Turn the crank, change the gear
Raise the flag and let's get out of here

Dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Cast the line, check the fuse
Save some time, this ain't no pleasure cruise

You're my dreamboat, yes you are

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Ring the bell, sound the horn
Move like hell, I'm heading back where I was born

You're my dreamboat, yes you are
Our glorious city
Was build by the divinities by Gods
Who saw fit to bestow
The gift of a paradise
Peaceful and harmonious upon
Us mere mortals below

And made El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
One thousand years ago
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado

But all this was granted
For only one millenium
I know my legacy is to fulfill
My promise to all my people
Who have trusted me, the Gods
Will approve of us still

Preserve El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
And I believe they will
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado

The mountains so high and waters deep
Are her disguise
Her secrets are safe from foreign hands
And eyes forever

Preserve El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
And I believe they will

El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
I hear tell some playboy has kidnapped your heart
With his plane and his plans for games after dark
Just a pain in his pocket, and the price of a room
Where the second hand sheets smell of stale perfume

If there's sharks in the water, don't swim where it's deep
For the taste of success can be bitter and sweet
It could be alright that I act like a child
But you'll be the loser when the jokers run wild

You're just playing the game, but the stakes are too high
What will you do when the chips start to fly
When the deck's stacked against you, and the living gets hard
Oh it's four walls of madness in this house of cards

Common you call me, but I know there's time
In a handful of diamonds, a heart's hard to find
And your house of cards starts weighing you down
Your nights become restless when the clubs start to pound
Do you believe in faeries
For the children's rhymes are in my mind
Seen through the colours of my eyes
A rainbow in the sky

With the flowers of seed
Taken by the beautiful people who have gone
Where have they gone
Where have they all gone

They're throwing coins in a velvet fountain
Wishing on stars and floating on air
Can somebody catch me if I stranger
And the mystery beleives me a velvet fountain
I said from the start that you'd be mine
But now it just seems I'm just wasting your time
If only you knew the hurt I've been through
You'll be sorry to see me go
You'll be sorry to see me go

I've always done the best that I could
To make you happy like I should
If only you knew what I've heard about you
You'll be sorry to see me go
You'll be sorry to see me go

I could have been mistreated if I'd been bad
But people tell me I'm the best that you've had
So there's something I want you to know
I think you'll be sorry to see me go
You'll be sorry to see me go

You said from the start that you'd be mine
But now it just seems I'm just wasting your time
If only you knew the hurt I've been through
You'll be sorry to see me go

[RADAMES]
We all lead such elaborate lives
Wild ambitions in our sights
How an affair of the heart survives
Days apart and hurried nights

Seems quite unbelievable to me
I don't want to live like that
Seems quite unbelievable to me
I don't want to love like that
I just want our time to be
Slower and gentler, wiser, free

We all live in extravagant times
Playing games we can't all win
Unintended emotional crimes
Take some out, take others in

I'm so tired of all we're going through
I don't want to live like that
I'm so tired of all we're going through
I don't want to love like that
I just want to be with you
Now and forever, peaceful, true
This may not be the moment
To tell you face to face
But I could wait forever
For the perfect time and place

[AIDA and RADAMES]
We all lead such elaborate lives
We don't know whose words are true
Strangers, lovers, husbands, wives
Hard to know who's loving who

[AIDA]
Too many choices tear us apart
I don't want to live like that

[RADAMES]
Too many choices tear us apart
I don't want to love like that
I just want to touch your heart
May this confession be the start
I was born by the river in a little tent
And oh, just like the river I
I've been running ever since

It's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change's gonna come
Oh yes, it will

It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there no, no
Beyond the sky

It's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh yes, it will

Then I go to my brother
I said brother, help me please
But he winds up knocking me down
I got to go to my knees
Oh, there's been times that I thought
I wouldn't last for long
But I think I'm able to carry on

It's been a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Keep it right there
Oh-oh-oh- Oh
Oh -oh
Oh- oh- oh

So Many Memories In My Mind
Ive Erased Like a page in a book I Written untold
So many women walk on my arm Cause the charm I put on
I Admit I Left A Bunch Of Them Swoon
Standin In A Room Full Of Mirrors Yelling
But its like they can hear When I say

I Gotta Stone Heart In My Chest
I Can't Feel No Pain
I'll never love another women
Its Just Me And My Money
I Think I Took A Shot In The Vein
Like Novocaine Novacaine
Novacaine Novacaine
Like Novacaine

Ain't enough fingers for the times that i lied
Can't even remeber last time that i cried
But i cried oh ! did i......i......
Ain't no turnin back o this road
Busy chasin stacks & the hoes
Affection is a person i don't know
Living in a world so cold

I Gotta Stone Heart In My Chest
I Can't Feel No Pain
I'll never love another women
Its Just Me And My Money
I Think I Took A Shot In The Vein
Like Novocaine Novacaine
Novacaine Novacaine
Like Novacaine

I Gotta Stone Heart In My Chest
I Can't Feel No Pain
I'll never love another women
Its Just Me And My Money
I Think I Took A Shot In The Vein
Like Novocaine Novacaine
Novacaine Novacaine
Like Novacaine
Its 5 o clock in the morning and the rising sun wakes me
Im Laying in a bed with a girl that dont belong to me
And she Whispers Come on my Darling lets go Round Two
Then she gon start to kissing me and to her surpise i quickly move
Now she got this dumb look on her face like what had she Done
How could she be so stupid as to think that she the One
Must of lost Her F**king Mind
But Damn this Girl was Fine
From the club went to her Home
She didn't want to be Alone
Here i am Trickin while my girlie's at Home
Gotta find my car keys so i can get on up out the door
She stood there mind was wondering
How he gon leave that way ?
Looked at me like i was Crazy
Then i got up and Walked Away
Man i gotta wife at Home , and to lose her OH im Scared
So now im on my Way home , Whiping off this other womans Hair

What ima say when she ask me where i been though ?
Fell Asleep and smoking to much indo

So i copped me some Febreeze and then i sprayed around
Then i walked my crazy ass up in the house
And i walked in and yelled Im Home
She said honey im in the room
I walked in there with a smile on my Face , and said honey I Been missing you
She hopped all over me and Said that she cooked and ran my Bath WAter
Im telling you now i ain't smell no food , but that bitch deserved an Oscar
Threw her in the bed and start to snatching her clothes off
Thinking to my Self Trey Songs YOu G You pulled it Off
Ain't gon believe it but things get deeper as the story goes on
We touching ,kissing,Baby Listen....That ain't Yo Phone

She tryed to hold me back but hell it was to late
I hopped up and said theres a mystery going on and im gonna solve it
And im like , God please dont let no Man be in my Partment
I walked in the Bath Room , Looked Behind the Door
She said baby come back to me , and i said Bitch say no More
I pull back the shower curtains and shes biting her nails
Then i walk back to the room , right now im sweating like hell
Check under the bed , then under the dresser
I look at the closet , get my gat out the dresser
I look back at the closet , get closer to the closet
This house that I live in has no reason
This house that I sleep in has no purpose
It has a bed and a few old chairs
Three flights up, two flights of stairs
But it has no reason

Then someone shot through the tyre swing
The dogs barked and bayed in the winter and spring
And the ivy that hung now sadly clings
To a dying season

And I cry at night when the lights go out
And the green eyes fuse and the full moon shouts
From road maps and red lines to lipstick lies
And when the lights go out it's tought to survive

This man holds a hand that shows a tremble
This man that I live in bears his faults
He has a heart and a well worn soul
Ten years a slave to Rock And Roll
But he has to tremble
For the yellow grass on the sun burnt lawn
Sleeps in her seeds from the sunset to dawn
And just like your love that's come and gone
It goes on breathing
Haven't you heard what's new
There is a rumour
Going around that suddenly I've found you
Better believe it's true
I got a feeling
This is for real and nobody else will do

You are my princess
You make me smile
You make my life seem worthwhile
You are my princess
You are the one
You make the sun shine on me
You're one fine lady
You're my princess
You're my princess

Haven't you heard them say
I was a prisoner
Buried alive now suddenly I've been freed
But love is the sweetest way
Oh I was lonely
And now you're the only lover that I'll ever need
I didn't mean to hurt you
You know it's just my way
Those things that I said yesterday
Were things I shouldn't say
Although you're blue
Just one thing I want you to do
Just forget all those things
That I said about you

'Cause I've been loving you baby
Loving you baby for a long time
And if you go away
I just won't know what to do

Yes I've been loving you baby
Loving you baby for a long time
And you know in your heart
That I'll always worship you

I couldn't bear to see you go
Oh no no no no
So don't you feel sad
It's not the thing to do
Because I worry
If I know you're feeling blue
Please put your tears away
So nobody can see
'Cause the last thing I want
Is for you to cry over me
Never thought I'd miss you
When you said goodbye
Never thought I'd see the day
That I break down and cry
Won't you come on back to me
Back where you belong

'Cause I get a little bit lonely baby
Lonely and blue missing you
I get a little bit lonely baby
If you ever come back, gonna be true

Oh I know I hurt you
Couldn't you forgive
For I know without you
It's impossible to live
I want you back in my arms again
Back where you belong

Come on baby
Let's forgive and forget
And even though things are bad
I'm gonna get you yet

[Piano playing]
Say there sexy lady
Won't you come my way
I wanna touch you
I just wanna love you
Won't you be my baby
Only for tonight
I'll understand if you say no
(Please don't say no)
Whoaaaa

[Music Cuts]
Stop

[Verse One]
Its so unsual to me
How I can see
That thang you got
From the the back
To the front
Its so beautilful to me
Girl you see
This dream I got
You'd be walking all through it
The way you do it

[Chorus]
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see ur behind yeah
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see ur behind yeah

[Verse Two]
And all I see
Is you on top of me
Watching you ride
Looking to my eyes
All I need is to be inside
I'll be sliding in the front
Going to the behind

[Chorus]
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see ur behind yeah
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see ur behind yeah

[Verse Three - Birdman]
Aye that girl so big
Aye that girl so phat
Aye the girl so big
Aye that girl so phat
Why is your back bone bigger that the usual
Little mama why you so phat
How long did it take that thang to grow
I'd love to hit that front the back
Me and my cut cuts
You and your gut guts
Rub on your butt butt
Diggin' your gut guts
And you already-dy
Put some pounds on the d d

[Chorus]
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see ur behind yeah
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see ur behind yeah
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see ur behind
Hold my hand girl much tighter, much much tighter
'Cause what I've got to say I only hope and pray
Comes out as well as I rehearsed it yesterday

And baby when the first tear shows
It's a sign for you to go
And baby when the first tear shows
It's a sign for you to go and leave her alone
With the broken dreams that she owns

It's a crime for me to tell you
It's a sin for me to stay
And I'll never look behind me
When I start to walk away
Firl I'm sorry but it's all that I can say

You know that I used to love you so
Enjoy every moment together
Well I'm not the kind of man
To forever hold your hand
In the morning there's a feeling
As I free my eyes of sleep
And think only of him running
To the promise he must keep

Such a love I've never known
It fills my life with joy
Oh the miracles the morning brings
The dark cannot destroy

You may find if he's there
It eases your mind
And besides he's so kind
It makes you feel fine
In the morning

Through my window comes a light
Like none that I have known
Well the night has passed between us
And the love has grown and grown
Like a river through a valley
Where the waters never end
Spinning down and always onward
I'm right here baby

I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces, fill the places I can't reach

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you

And all you know and how you speak
Girl, girl cause all I want is
Someone like you
Someone like you

And I've been looking around
Looking down at all I see
Written by George and Ira Gershwin
From Four Weddings and a Funeral soundtrack

They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way, I've found more clouds are grey
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Heigh ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me

It all began so well, but what an end
This is the time a feller needs a friend
When every happy plot ends with a marriage knot
And there's no knot for me
I'm just sitting doing nothing
Wondering where I should go
People tell me I'm just lazy
Weather or not it's true I don't know

So I'm just sitting doing nothing
Wondering where I should go
Many people that I've encountered
Say they wish that they were free

And I know that secretly
All those people would really like to be me

So even though they tell me I'm idle
Why should I do what they say
For they're in the same place all the time
But I'm only there for a day

So I'm just sitting doing nothing
Now I saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor
And it looked at first like the whole thing would end as a failure
He had a thing about a quarter to four
And he just couldn't handle any more
He's got his own big dipper so he won't be needing your big dipper
He's got his own big dipper and he won't be needing yours

So you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him
And you took him down to the fairground after some action
And by around about a quarter to six
You found a different way to get your kicks
Up on the real big dipper where you tried an few new tricks
Big dipper
Up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks

He hadn't been too keen at the start
Now he seems to have a change of heart
He's got his own big dipper
Only now he's not so sure, big dipper
He's got his own big dipper
But there's always room for more
Everybody's got a song to sing
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper

And at around about a quarter to ten
You got up and did it all again
He's got his own big dipper and now he knows just what it's for
Big dipper
He's got his own big dipper but he's got his eye on yours

Another ride, another tune
Another crazy afternoon
Another reason for squeezing your big dipper
Loving you was easy
Your love captured my heart
You were always pleasing
Till you tore us apart
Said you needed both of us
How could you be so unkind
Then you traded love for lust
But sooner or later I'm gonna get you
Look out girl 'cause I'm gonna fix you

I'm gonna shake it up
This time I'm gonna break it up
There won't be any making up
I'm shaking this three-way love affair
I'm gonna shake it up
This time I'm gonna break it up
There won't be any making up
I'm shaking this three-way love affair

Sneaking out on Sunday
You thought I didn't know
Well early morning Monday
Once more you didn't show
Alibis and selfish lies
Oh I've had my fill of them all
You can dry your crying eyes
I know you're faking, there's no mistaking
Look out girl your heart might be breaking

[Verse 1:]
Look what this girl done did to me*
She done cut me off from her good good love
She told me that those days are gone (gone, gone)
Now I'm sitting here going half crazy
Cause I know she still thinks about me too
And there ain't no way in hell
That I can just be friends with you (you, you)

[Chorus:]
And I wish we never did it
And I wish we never loved it
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends

[Verse 2:]
The way it felt, no faking it
Maybe we were moving just a little too fast
But what we've done we can't take it back (back, back)
Now I'm sitting here half way crazy
Cause I know she still thinks about me too
And there ain't no way in hell
That I can be just friends with you (you, you)

[Chorus:]
And I wish we never did it
And I wish we never loved it
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends
An all I can say is La La La La La La La La
La La La La La La La La La (la la la la ooo)
La La La La La La
Ain't no telling what we could have been (ain't no telling what we could of been nooo)

[Bridge:]
And if I knew we'd end like this
I never would of kissed you
Cause I fell in love with you
We never would of kicked it
Girl now everythings different
I lost my homie lover and my friend
That's why

[Chorus:]
And I wish we never did it
And I wish we never loved it (I wish we never loved it noo)
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends
La La La La La La La La
La La La La La La La La La (la la la la ooo)
La La La La La La
Ain't no telling what we could of been

[Verse 1]
Oh, I've been staying up nights
Thinking 'bout a long flight that could take me home
Or a slow train rolling
Or a big boat floating out there on that lonely ocean
I'm not the man I was
I guess the dark side lost and the sun broke through
I thought I knew it all
I was the next big thing until I thought about you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I was reaching for the stars
When I wasn't even touching you
I was lying to myself, I needed no one's help
Thought I was living proof

[Chorus]
When there's one set of footsteps
No one's gonna fill your shoes
Now I'm looking in the mirror
At a big man in a little suit
I'm a big man in a little suit
It's tight on me, hard on you
It's a short cut but it's a long way home
When you think you can make it on your own
You think you're bulletproof
But what you really are
Is a big man in a little suit

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Oh, I was part of the chain
A face with no name in a place with no soul
By a thief in the night
I was robbed of the light and left with nothing, nothing to hold
I've turned my back on a world like that
I want to get back to loving you
Give me one more chance
Won't you warm the hands of this cold headed fool?

[Pre-Chorus]
I was reaching for the stars
When I wasn't even touching you
I was lying to myself, I needed no one's help
Thought I was living proof

[Chorus]
When there's one set of footsteps
No one's gonna fill your shoes
Now I'm looking in the mirror
At a big man in a little suit
I'm a big man in a little suit
It's tight on me, hard on you
It's a short cut but it's a long way home
When you think you can make it on your own
You think you're bulletproof
But what you really are
Is a big man in a little suit

[Outro]
It's tight on me, hard on you
It's a short cut but it's a long way home
When you think you can make it on your own
You think you're bulletproof
But what you really are
Is a big man in a little suit
Big man in a little suit

You win again, you gypsy heart
I count the days that we're apart
I sleep alone when you're away
No sense in saying I wish you'd stay
It's all the same, you never change
You come and go just like the rain
I pray each day that you are gone
This time it won't be so long

Your gypsy heart will never find
Any arms as warm as mine
And gypsy when we meet again
I'll play my part
And wrap you up inside my arms
Oh you gypsy heart
Your gypsy heart can always call
When your back's against the wall
And darling then I'll just pretend
Right from the start
You never left me on my own oh you gypsy heart
I pray each day that you are gone
This time oh it won't be so long
Looking back it makes me shiver
Don't be scared to kick the past
Selling lovers down the river
Nothing built for speed will last overnight

All those years of desolation
Pretty boys and damage done
Not the way to find salvation
Looking after number one

Trust me
Try rolling with the flow
Trust me
I've been there don't you know
I'm giving you a chance, so take it
I got all you want, you'll make it
Standing there in front of me, you're naked
You can't hide a thing, you've got no choice
Trust me

Too many years your heart has wandered
Scared to make a final move
Too many nights those boys have squandered
You got nothing left to prove
I'm giving you a chance, so take it
I got all you want, you'll make it
Standing there in front of me, butt naked
You can't hide a thing, you've got no choice
Trust Me
Trust Me
Trust Me
Trust Me
Trust Me
You can win the fight, you can grab a piece of the sky
You can break the rules but before you try
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

You can stop the world, steal the face from the moon
You can beat the clock, but before high noon
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

You've got one life with a reason
You need two hearts on one side
When you stand alone and there's no one there
To share the way it feels inside and baby

You can cheat the devil and slice a piece of the sun
Burn up the highway but before you run
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

When you're gonna play with fire
You let someone share the heat
When you're on your own and there's no one there
To cool the flames beneath your feet and baby
You can win the fight, you can grab a piece of the sky
You can break the rules but before you try
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
Turn to me, turn to me when you're lonely
Brush them aside, gather your pride
Baby turn to me
Turn to me, turn to me when you're lonely
Brush them aside, gather your pride
Baby turn to me

Don't listen to the people
Who spread lies about your name
I know it hurts
But baby I've had it too

I've learned to live with their abuse
I've learned to live with those who choose
To disregard my emptiness and lose me

Your laughter has died in the heat of the night
The people they pretend that company is bright
But brighter you'll wait by the phone that has died
Don't bury your hopes, there's nothing that's left for you to confide in
But you seem to be happy just for now to go on
Try to see through them baby, can't you see what is wrong
You're hurting yourself more that you'll ever know
Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)
Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)

I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, didn't I?

Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
Oowee baby, you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire

Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)
Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)
The angel tree has grown so high
And its roots are planted deep
Never climb that willow
'Cause its trunk is awful steep
Yeah the trunk is awful steep

Seven miles south of the city
Way on a windy hill
The whistling branches of the angel tree
Are calm at the evening still

Magical ???
As the leaves are ???
And strange things happen to people
Who go on to the windy hill

??? down here
Had gone up to there
And rested underneath her bough
They slept long, what is wrong
They never woke up again
Oh it's great to see our homeland
Breathe the Iberian atmosphere
Just because we are Hispanic
Doesn't mean we're oceanic
Quite frankly we've had water up to here

We've made waves to last a lifetime
We've been saturated, almost drowned
We are Spanish not Caribbean
We are human, not amphibian
We'll seek our fortunes on Spain's solid ground

There's no future in the new world
Only fools believe the tales
Of the gold of El Dorado
Only suckers set their sails
We have seen the way the tide is turning
We see what no sailor can
We are in the ball, discerning
We're antediluvian
Sixteenth century man
Two very fine examples of
Sixteenth, sixteenth century man
There are women who are lining
Every avenue in every port
Now at last we'll get to grips with
Things they never equip ships with
We have sailed into our last resort

There's no goldmine in the new world
It's a trick to get recruits
On the boat to El Dorado
We're returning to our roots
We're going back to land locked ladies
Cortez never let them board
All in all the point we've made is
We don't want to go abroad
Two very fine examples of
Sixteenth century man
Two terra firma samples of
Sixteenth, sixteenth century man
Time has gone by
The calendar leaves
I might try phoning
If I could think of the words to try

What is there to remember
The winter was December
Just one more year left behind

She never looked around to see me
She never looked around at all
All I saw was her shadows on the wall
She never looked around to see me
Oh, she never looked around at all
All I heard was the snow that had to fall

She left in the morning
Was her way
And on returning
I find I have nothing to say
What is there to remember
The winter was December
Just one more year left behind

She never looked around to see me
Oh, she never looked around at all
All I saw was her shadows on the wall
She never looked around to see me
No, she never looked around at all
All I heard was the snow that had to fall
The grass in Ashfield Park is dying
Where everybody dreams of deeds of crime
And the Tartan Coloured Lady walks
Behind the water colours of my mind
And the Tartan Coloured Lady she is mine

People speak of willow trees in autumn
And my doesn't fit her anymore
And the Tartan Coloured Lady that I wanted
Talked of this place an hour or so before
And the Tartan Coloured Lady lost her

So if your crystal window isn't broken
And they've taken all the dust bins from your door
Take yourself the Tartan Coloured Lady
And smell the grass in Ashfield Park once more
See the trees in Ashfield Park once more

So I guess I'll read the comic books you've left me
And play marbles on the floor
And if the Tartan Coloured Lady calls me
Just tell her I won't be home till four

[Verse 1]
Look what this girl done did to me
She done cut me off from her good, good love
She told me that those days were gone (gone, gone, gone)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm sittin' here going half crazy (oh, oh, oh)
'Cause I know she still thinks about me too (oh, oh)
And it ain't no way in hell
That I can be just friends with you (you, you, you)

[Chorus]
And I wish we never did it
And I wish we never loved this
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends
Right..

[Verse 2]
The way it felt, no faking it
Maybe we were moving just a little too fast
But what we've done we can't take it back (back, back, back)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm sittin' here halfway crazy (oh, oh)
'Cause I know she still thinks about me too (oh, oh)
And it ain't no way in hell
That I can be just friends with you (you, you, you)

[Chorus]
And I wish we never did it
And I wish we never loved this
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends
And all I can say is
La-la-la la la la la
Laahaahaa
La-la-la la la la la la la
La la la la-ooh
La-la-la la la la laah
Hey, ain't no telling what we could've been
Ain't no telling what we could've been
No..

[Bridge]
And if I knew it ends like this
I never would've kissed you 'cause I fell in love with you
We never would've kicked it
Girl, now everything's different
I've lost my own recoverin' my friend

[Chorus]
That's why I wish we never did it (hoo, oh yea)
And I wish we never loved this (I wish we never loved this)
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends
Friends, we can't be friends

[Outro]
La-la-la la la la la
La-la-la la la la la la la
La-la-la la la la laah
(Ain't no tellin' what we could've been)
Beautiful morning, ahh
Down by the river, ahh
Without a warning, ahh
Who'd ever guess you'd come across a snake in the grass

Every day now, ahh
You take a walk here, ahh
What do you say now, ahh
If you should meet an evil-minded snake in the grass

Stop and watch where you're putting your feet, my sweet
I don't want to do anything bad
But you make me mad and I might bite your face, bite neck, bite arms, bite bite
'Cause I'm, oh, a snake in the grass, oh
A snake in the grass

Looking around you, ahh
You never see me, ahh
You'll get a surprise, ahh
Should you get entangled with a snake in the grass
Under my thick skin, ahh
I can be lonely, ahh
Please can I come in, ahh
And end my sad existence as a snake in the grass

Under my thick skin, ahh
I can be lonely, ahh
Please can I come in, ahh
And end my sad existence as a snake in the grass

Stop and watch where you're putting your feet, my sweet
I don't want to do anything bad
But you make me mad and I might bite your face, bite neck, bite arms, bite bite
'Cause I'm, oh, a snake in the grass, oh
A snake in the grass
The more I learn, the more I see
The less the world impassions me
The hungry heart, the roving eye
Have come to rest, do not apply
The frantic chase, the crazy ride
The thrill has gone, I step aside

And I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you, I love you without question, I love you

The more I want the more I steal
The more I hold the less is real
All worldly things I follow blind
In hope not faith was paid in kind
The line is drawn, the change is made
I come to you, I'm not afraid

And I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you, I love you without question, I love you
I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you, I love you without question, I love you

He would recount the stories he had learned so well
Fourteen years is a long time in one cell
When the pipe is passed the opium does its rounds
Papa legba sitting pretty in a chicken little town

His textured skin, like leather in the sun
Fingers beating hard upon a native drum
He picks his teeth with a splintered back rib bone
Papa legba bears his fangs and lays alone

Hey papa legba, hoo-boo-be-do
Hey papa legba, no one gonna bother you
Hey papa legba, hoo-boo-be-do
Shake papa legba, no one's gonna bother you tonight, alright

He was free to dance alone where the spirits run
His almond eyes would twinkle on a hundred sons
His champagne toast and white meat on a spit
Papa legba's drunken with a smile upon his lips
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen

See the little baby
Wrapped in a manger
On Christmas Morning

Amen, Amen, Amen

See him in the Temple
Talking with the Elders
Tomorrows Wisdom

Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen

Down at the Jordan
And John was baptising
And Savin' all sinners

Amen, Amen, Amen
See 'em at the Seaside
Talking with the fisherman
And makin' disciples

Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen

Sing it through the mountains

Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen

Down at the Jordan
John was baptising
Savin, savin, all sinners

Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
{Funeral for a Friend}

[Instrumental]

{Love Lies Bleeding}

[Verse 1]
The roses in the window box have tilted to one side
Everything about this house was born to grow and die
Oh, it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day
You said, "I'm sorry, honey, if I don't change the pace
I can't face another day"

[Chorus]
And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands

[Verse 2]
I wonder if those changes have left a scar on you
Like all the burnin' hoops of fire that you and I passed through
You're a bluebird on a telegraph line, I hope you're happy now
Well, if the wind of change comes down your way, girl
You'll make it back somehow

[Chorus]
And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands

[Chorus]
And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands

[Outro]
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Love lies bleedin' in my hands
Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo!
Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
I'm stoned in the twilight
Screaming on the inside
Give me your water, help me survive
Gonna miss the sunlight
When I lose my eyesight
Give me my red shoes, I want to dance
They search for an answer
But that old man wouldn't listen
Back then I was handsome
Back then he was ignorant
And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed
Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore
Had garlands in the wings back then
All the pretty little things back then
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings
After curtain calls and bows
I can't see the front row now
Hand me my red shoes just one more time
They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listen
And it's yours, go out and get it
Don't get wet, please keep dry
Think about the people who made you cry

I believe in the ??? of every man
Where ??? take notice of ???
If you see the road turning straight ahead
Got to run on down, never never be afraid

I know a man, well he's six feet tall
Buckskin jacket ???
From the Boston town, yeah, is educated well
And he ??? about himself

Behind the curtain, upon the shelf
Lived a man ???
Behind his his eyes, behind his smile
What's going on, anybody in the world can tell
Music by elton john
Released as a uk b-side in 1980

The night we met, we stood
Divided by defenses as old as time
But love has found a way
To bring me to your senses and you to mine

So we meet in the cloak of evening
And we try to go on believing
Two different worlds can still be one
You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun

The night we met, we knew
What love would soon be leading us to do
And so it goes, and now
When wanting turns to needing, i turn to you

And it's hard to go on deceiving
But we have to go on believing
That someday our love will overcome
You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun
As i lie here and feel you breathing
It's not hard to keep on believing
That someday our love will overcome
You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun
I've always said that one's enough to love
Now I hear you're bragging one is not enough
Something tells me you're not satisfied
You got plans to make me one of four or five

I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood
But you won't catch me carving up my love
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit
If it takes more than me let's call it quits

'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you honey I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that

It gets so hard sometimes to understand
This vicious circle's getting out of hand
Don't need an extra eye to see
That the fire spreads faster in a breeze

And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you honey I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
No I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just have to quit them if you want me back
'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Oh if you wanna spread it around sister that's just fine
But I don't want no second hand feeding me lines
If you wanna hold someone in the middle of the night
Call out the guards, turn out the light

And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you honey I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
No I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just have to quit them if you want me back
'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that

I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna go on with you like that
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna go on with you like that
Come on, come on
I can't go on living without you, oh no
I once said I could go on without your love
I would be strong but things have changed and heaven's above
I know that I need you more than I did before

I can't go on living without you, oh no my love
I can't go on living without you, oh no my love
I can't go on living without you, oh no

If you could see the state I'm in you'd never know
That it was the same old me that told you to go
I've never been happy since I walked out on you

You know that I've missed you more than anything at all
If there's any way to get you back I'll try it
I won't deny it, I'm lonely for you girl
Twentieth century blues are getting me down
Blues, escape those dreary twentieth century blues
Why, if there's a god in the sky, why shouldn't he grin
High above this dreary twentieth century din

In this strange illusion, chaos and confusion
People seem to lose their way
What is there to strive for, love or keep alive for
Say, Hey hey, call it a day

Blues, nothing to win or to lose, it's getting me down
Blues, escape those weary twentieth century blues

Why is it that civilized humanity can make this world so wrong
In this hurly-burly of insanity, our dreams cannot last long
We've reached a deadline, a press headline, every sorrow

[Verse 1]
The sister of sunlight
Comes to my lonely life
Bearing the crosses I hung
I hung on my lonely wife
And the anchor told me
If I prayed by the river
That the sweet sound of water
Would always go with her

[Chorus]
All across the havens to the waterfall
They told me I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains
For all across the havens
I must stumble locked in chains

[Verse 2]
Then the mother of mercy
Showed me her stable
And told me you would be safe
Safe in her cradle
And the waterfall opened
And the water withdrew
Leaving me standing
On a road leading through

[Chorus]
All across the havens to the waterfall
They told me that I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains
For all across the havens
I must stumble locked in chains
Take every ray of sunshine from the sky
Let the rain fall, I don't care if the flowers die
The night lights can forget me
The stars will never glow
The days just seem so worthless
The hours, they come and go

Reminds me of you
Reminds me of you
The things we used to say
The things we used to do
All these happy hours are now just empty days
And I can't bear the strain to pass the time away
Reminds me of you

I see couples walking down the street
I watch them here
With tear filled eyes there's nothing left for me
For I just think about the times
That you and I were two
And still these things remind me of you
Oh they do
"I meant to do my work today
The brown bird sang in the apple tree
I know that's why ....
And a butterfly flittered accross the field
And all the leaves were calling me
And the Buttercups nodded their smiling heads
Greeting the bees who came to call
And I asked the lizard the time of day....."
And the wind went sighing over the land
Tossing the grasses to and fro
And a rainbow held out its shining hand—
So what could I do but laugh and go?
In the nicotine glare of a cold naked light
I drag my body from the covers and down forty flights
I run out the front door into the center of the street
I scream out your name as the steam just swells around my feet

I hear you after midnight from the inner city
As every little Cinderella turns to drop dead pretty
We were built out of the darkness into this West Side Story
We came together in the shadows but the moon just steals our glory

Well, this is my battleground, baby
This is my plaything
The only thing I've ever known
Outside of a wedding ring

And I swear I heard the night talking
Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless
Telling me we're running lonely, loose and broken
Stronger now on passion but haven't we really spoken
And all we ever do, is listen to the night talking
On the burden of insanity, we can't find the cause
On a flatbed truck, well, the home girl, she paints her claws
There's a coward who gets his courage under cover of the dark
And it's a strange breed of the devil, freeze at night to go walking in the park

This is my battleground, baby
This is my plaything
The only thing I've ever known
Outside of a wedding ring

And I swear I heard the night talking
Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless
Telling me we're running lonely, loose and broken
Stronger now on passion but haven't we really spoken
And all we ever do, is listen to the night talking

This is my battleground, baby
This is my plaything
The only thing I've ever known
Outside of a wedding ring

And I swear I heard the night talking
Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless
Telling me we're running lonely, loose and broken
Stronger now on passion but haven't we really spoken
And all we ever do, oh yeah, is listen to the night talking
Oh yeah, oh yeah
And I swear I heard the night talking
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I swear, I swear, I swear I heard the night talking
Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened it's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

Did we, didn't we, should we couldn't we
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says
Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes
And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
But our empty sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile
When I was a boy I had a lot of fun
I lived by the sea, I was a fisherman's son
My mother she was a fisherman's wife
She was scrubbing floors most of her life

They said screw you
I ain't got nothing to lose
I could paper a matchbox
With the money I use

At the school I attended I got into fights
I was beaten in an alley on a cold winter night
The teachers cared less for the blood in our veins
They got most of their thrills out of using a cane

They said screw you
Oh you bloody young fools
I could get more sense
Out of the back end of a mule

So you see there's man who get paid for being slaves
And men who get paid for being free
And there's men behind bars who pray for the light
And men in the suburbs who pray for the night
And they're all trying to climb to the top of the mine
And all of them say most of the way
Screw you
I worked in the mill from seven till nine
Tears in my eyes nearly drove me half-blind
Trying to make wages that weren't even there
Taking hell from a foreman with the build of a bear

He said screw you
This is all you'll ever do
It's the only existence for someone like you
Whoo, good evening
I'd like to thank everybody for coming out
Hope your flights were safe
Feeling real breezy, swift like the wind
It's calling my body
It's calling my soul
It's calling my mind
But girl I gotta go
Baby, it's the grind
Yes I had a good time
(Don't get me wrong)
You were so good
And I really wish I could
Stay a little bit longer
Love you a little bit stronger
And go a little deeper
Baby with you
But since this thang is calling I
Gotta answer dry your eyes
Girl don't cry
'Cause your making it hard for me
'Cause I don't want to leave
(Ooo girl)
But I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
(I don't wanna)
I don't want to leave no
But girl I gotta go right now
But I'll be back before you know it
So hold that thought
(That thought)
Don't you move
See I'm coming right back
Right back for you
Don't you change your position
Girl I'm on a mission
Baby trust I'll be missin'
Missin' you
'Cause I don't wanna leave
I don't want to leave
(Leave, leave, leave you baby)
But I gotta go right now
(But I gotta go though)
I'll be back to hold you down
But I don't want to leave no no no
But girl I gotta go right now
But I'll be back before you know it
Streets be calling me
(Ooh, they be callin' me)
They be calling my name
And when they call I gotta go
So I'm letting you know
(But I)
I won't be gone for long
And already I can't wait
To come home to you
I don't want to leave
(Ohh girl)
But I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
(I don't wanna, but I gotta)
(I'll be back to hold you down)
I don't want to leave
But girl I gotta go right now
But I'll be back before you know it
I don't want to leave
But I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave
But I gotta go right now
But I'll be back before you know it
Break it down now, ow
Naw I don't want to leave
But you know how it is when
Whoa baby keep that on
Don't take it off, keep in on
So I can take it off when I come back
Yeah fo' sho
I don't want to leave
(Since this thang is calling I)
But I gotta go right now
(Gotta answer dry your eyes)
I don't want to leave
(Girl, don't cry)
But girl I gotta go right now
(Since this thang is calling I)
I'll be back before you know it
(Gotta answer dry your eyes)

[Intro]
Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon

[Verse 1]
Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me

[Chorus]
Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon

[Verse 2]
I still believe
I still put faith in us
We had it all
And watched it slip away
Where are we now?
Not where we want to be
Those hot afternoons
Still follow me

[Chorus]
Someday out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again someday soon

[Bridge]
I still believe, I still put faith in us
I still believe, I still put faith in us
I still believe, I still put faith in us

[Verse 3]
Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me

[Chorus]
Someday out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again someday soon

[Chorus]
Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon

[Outro]
I still believe, I still put faith in us
I still believe, I still put faith in us
I still believe, I still put faith in us
I still believe, I still put faith in us
I still believe, I still put faith in us
I still believe, I still put faith in us

[Verse 1]
I can't really explain it
I haven't got the words
It's a feeling that you can't control
I suppose it's like forgetting
Losing who you are
And at the same time, something makes you whole

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like that there's a music
Playing in your ear
And I'm listening, and I'm listening
And then I disappear

[Chorus]
And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free

[Verse 2]
It's a bit like being angry
It's a bit like being scared
Confused and all mixed up and mad as hell
It's like when you've been crying
And you're empty and you're full
I don't know what it is, it's hard to tell

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like that there's some music
Playing in your ear
But the music is impossible
Impossible to hear

[Chorus]
But then I feel it move me
Like a burning deep inside
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free

[Outro]
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free
Oh, I'm free
I carried you in my arms
Through the hotel to our room
The night was filled with music
Those old historic tunes
Songs of revolution
Filled our hearts and fed our souls
As the fireworks exploded
Like those cannons long ago
See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See 'em shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight
Five hundred wooden saints below
The color's cracked and dry
You said their stories should be told
Did they suffer when they died?
Give us your tradition
Give us hope and send us home
We'll be the cracked bells tolling
The voice of dust and bones
See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See 'em shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight
The pillow that you dream on
Lies rolled up on the floor
You tossed it at the TV screen
At the drug lord and his war
Thinking of the courtyard
Forced a tear from your eyes
The white shirts in the moonlight
The warm forgiving smiles
See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See 'em shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight
Yea, yea, yea
Yea, yea, yea
Please don't talk about the flintstone boy
He's alright with me
Please don't talk about the flintstone boy
He's alright with me
Please don't worry about the flintstone boy
He got trouble but he ain't got joy
Please don't talk about the flintstone boy
Please don't talk about the flintstone boy
Don't you worry, he's alright with me, oh yeah, oh yeah

Please don't worry about the flintstone boy
He's alright with me
Please don't worry about the flintstone boy
He's alright with me
Please don't talk about the flintstone boy

He got trouble and he ain't got joy
Please don't worry about the flintstone boy
Please don't worry about the flintstone boy
Don't you worry, he's alright with me, oh yeah, oh yeah
Well Joey had a lover but he had to run for cover
When someone told a lie
Jo Jo his lover, he'd been cheating on him
Shouldn't he know why
Joey had a lover but he had to run for cover
When someone let him down
Jo Jo his lover, he'd been cheating on him
He'd been messing around
Talk of making love
Take your time
To bluff your way to stay
Let me use your eyes
Please don't amuse with words that cut me down to size
With your lovely mind
Never taking time
To treat a man so kind

You remain to me a vision of sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honesty

Do I need to say
That I'm wiser with surprise for borrowing your eyes
Morning sets the scene
The more you stay the more you go away from me it seems

With your lovely mind
Never taking time
To treat a man so kind
You remain to me a vision of sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
You tell me there's an angel in your tree
Did he say he'd come to call on me
For things are getting desperate in our home
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know

Everybody now bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky

Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside

Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today
My wife cried when they came to take me away
But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn burn burn burn down the mission walls
Now everybody bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky

Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside
When I die and they lay me to rest
Gonna go to the place that's best
When they lay me down to die
Goin on up to the Spirit in the sky

Goin on up to the Spirit in the sky
(Spirit in the sky)
That's where I'm gonna go when I die
(When I die)
When I die and they lay me to rest
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best

Prepare yourself, you know it's a must
Gotta have a friend named Jesus
So you know that when you die
It's gonna recommend you to the Spirit in the sky
(Spirit in the sky)

Goin on up to the Spirit in the sky
That's where you're gonna go when you die
(When you die)
When I die and they lay me to rest
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best
Never been a sinner, I've never sinned
I've got a friend named Jesus
So you know that when I die
It's gonna set me up with the Spirit in the sky

Oh set me up with the spirit in the sky
That's where I'm gonna go when I die
When I die and they lay me to rest
Gonna go to the place that's the best
I'm Gonna go to the place that's the best
Forgotten scars remind us of
Too much war, too little love
Beneath the fault-line truth to burn
Within the page so much to learn

Wounded birds look to us
Who can heal? Who to trust
Bring down the giants old and new
Strike up the band and waltz on through

I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through

Love in ruins, torn apart
Victims of the careless heart
Skating on the cold grey ice
Before the flood toward the light
Muddy boots to shiny shoes
Headlines screaming out the news
From dirt and damp to hardwood floors
Beyond the burned out broken walls

I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through

I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through
And the dancers danced on through

[Verse 1]
We are amazed but not amused
By all the things you say that you'll do
Though much concerned but not involved
With decisions that are made by you

[Chorus 1]
But we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
Cause if you really want to hear our views
You haven't done nothin'
Uh

[Verse 2]
It's not too cool to be ridiculed
But you brought this upon yourself
The world is tired of pacifiers
We want the truth and nothing else, yeah

[Chorus 2]
And we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
Cause if you really want to hear our views
You haven't done nothin'

[Post-Chorus]
Jackson 5 join along with me, say
Doo doo wop, hey hey hey doo doo wop
Oh oh doo doo wop, oh oh doo doo wop
Oh oh Doo doo wop,  oh oh doo doo wop

[Verse 3]
We would not care to wake up to the nightmare
That's becoming real life, hmmm
But when misled who knows a person's mind
Can turn as cold as ice, mm hmm

[Chorus 3]
Why do you keep on making us hear your song
Telling us how you are changing right from wrong
Cause if you really want to hear our views
You haven't done nothin'
Yeah, nothin' (Na-na-nothing)

[Post-Chorus]
Jackson 5 join along with me, say
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop

[Outro]
Sing it loud for the people, say
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop

[Verse 1]
You can't always count on the prayers in your sleep
But this cold light's still killing me
If I pay the ransom
Well can they guarantee
To split the chains, slip the knots
I don't know if they'll ever set you free

[Bridge]
I just can't rely on all these twisted signs
Too many bright lights turn you blind
The history of the blues
Seems to swim in your eyes
Pick yourself up, throw your head back
Take a long, long look into the sky

[Chorus]
Are you out there, are you listening
Am I'm coming across to you
Is the North Star still shining
In the sky outside your room
You can listen but they're lying
Don't let them tell you
What you've always known
It's the North Star that's the big one
And it's always gonna lead you home

[Verse 2]
Can't always agree on all my dumb ideas
I'm still looking for a way out of here
You can value what you want
But you pay for change
There's full moons, cold lifeless nights
And tumbled stars spell out your name

[Chorus]
Are you out there, are you listening
Am I'm coming across to you
Is the North Star still shining
In the sky outside your room
You can listen but they're lying
Don't let them tell you
What you've always known
It's the North Star that's the big one
And it's always gonna lead you home

[Verse 3]
Close your eyes, take a ride
Think of everytime that you
Missed your opp
Click your heels, see how it feels
Something so childish
Sometimes seems so real

[Chorus]
Are you out there, are you listening
Am I'm coming across to you
Is the North Star still shining
In the sky outside your room
You can listen but they're lying
Don't let them tell you
What you've always known
It's the North Star that's the big one
And it's always gonna lead you home

[Outro]

[x2]
It's the North Star that's the big one
And it's always gonna lead you home
She's a honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

I met a gin soaked, bar-room queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She tried to heave me right across her shoulder
And I just can't seem to drink you off my mind

She's a honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

I laid a divorcee here in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me in roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind

She's a honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

She's a honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

[Verse 1]
I've always said one's enough to love
Now I hear you're braggin' one is not enough
Well, somethin' tells me you're not satisfied
You got plans to make me one of four or five

[Verse 2]
I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood
But you won't catch me carvin' up my love
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit
If it takes more than me, let's a-call it quits

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
It gets so hard sometimes to understand
This vicious circle's gettin' outta hand
Don't need an extra eye to see
That the fire spreads a-faster in a breeze

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just a-have to quit 'em if you want me back
'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, if you wanna spread it around, sister, that's just fine
But I don't want no second hand a-feedin' me lines
If you wanna hold someone in the middle of the night
Call out the guards, turn out the light

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
No, I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just have to quit 'em if you want me back
No, I don't wanna go on with you like that

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah

[Outro]
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna go on with you
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
Go on with you like that
Oh yeah
Oh-oh
Oh yeah
Ah yeah
Takin' me back
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
Go on with you like that
Oh yeah
That was brilliant, what was that?
I know you
You're trying to do all you can for me
I appreciate your help
But it's best just to leave me be

There's many things that I have done
And I'm sorry for them now
So darling please don't you comfort me
I'll sort it out somehow

So sing me no sad songs, tell me no lies
Please don't you make me blue
Sing me no sad songs, tell me no lies
Girl I can do without you

Don't go breaking my heart
It would tear me apart
'Cause then I'd be finished for good
So sing me no sad songs, tell me no lies
Please don't you make me blue
I don't want you to think I'm mean
Refusing all your help
The time has come, but my need is none
And I want to be alone with myself

There's many things that I have done
And I'm sorry for them now
So darling please don't you comfort me
You know Dasher and Dancer
And Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid
And Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
(reindeer)
Had a very shiny nose
(like a light bulb)
And if you ever saw it
(saw it)
You would even say it glows
(like a flash light)
All of the other reindeer
(reindeer)
Used to laugh and call him names
(like Pinochio)
They never let poor Rudolph
(Rudolph)
Play in any reindeer games
(like Monopoly)
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
(Ho Ho Ho)
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Then all the reindeer loved him
(loved him)
And they shouted out with glee
(yippee)
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
(reindeer)
You'll go down in history!"
(like Columbus)

[AIDA]
I am here to tell you we can never meet again
Simple really, isn't it, a word or two and then
A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when
You think of me or speak of me and wonder what befell
The someone you once loved so long ago so well

[RADAMES]
Never wonder what I'll feel as living shuffles by
You don't have to ask me and I need not reply
Every moment of my life from now until I die
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand
How a perfect love can be confounded out of hand

Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Or some god's experiment
In which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day

[AIDA, spoken]
Marry the princess, Radames.  You can help my people, this could be our chance to do something important!  Don't you see?

(sung)
Nothing can be altered, there is nothing to decide
No escape, no change of heart, no anyplace to hide

[RADAMES]
You are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learned

[BOTH]
What it is to be in love and have that love returned

[AIDA]
Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time

[BOTH]
Or some god's experiment
In which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day
You stare through a tunnel of
Solid wall that should be broken down
And you can't see the field of green
Has been turned into a raging battleground
And you'll live with the consequence
Tell me why don't you understand
You'll destroy all the love that's been created
Be a miser with an empty hand
And it's all such a simple thing
Changing everything
Listen to the one who brings all this love to you
Some other world, some other world, that's where you live
Some other world, some other world, that's where you live
Don't you care, stop and think about us and what you feel
I'll be there, don't you cut yourself off from what is real
Don't live in some other world
You don't live in some other world
There's a boat bound for paradise
If you hurry you can ride it back
'Cause once the bait hits the water
It don't take long 'till the sharks attack
Oh but it's all such a simple thing
Change is everything
Let me be the one who brings all this love to you
Some other world, some other world, that's where you live
Some other world, some other world, that's where you live
Don't you care, stop and think about us and what you feel
I'll be there, don't you cut yourself off from what is real
Don't live in some other world, in some other world
Oh you don't live in some other world, in some other world
Got to stop living in some other world
Let me help you with a change of mind
And it's all such a simple thing
Changing everything
Listen to the one who brings all this love to you
This is our world, not some other world
You don't live in some other world
Live in our world, not some other world
You don't live in some other world
The sound of one heart breaking, the sound of someone waking
To the cold hard truth before the sun goes down
If I could ever catch you a little bit of that
I'd wrap it up and bury it in the deep dark ground

On the ledge with one last chance to beg
To the deepest root of the oldest tree
If we could only bottle a little bit of rain
Wrung out from the history in its ancient leaves

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

The never ending stories of the victor and the spoils
The treasure and the lesson to be learned
If I could ever wrap up a little piece of this
I'd strike a match and watch the contents burn

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place
All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

Love will always lead to a candlelit bedroom
Only if you want it bad enough
Every waking moment you believe that
You must have a little faith in the light of love
Every waking moment you believe that
You must have a little faith in the light of love
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was there with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was there with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
I miss the way you kiss
I miss the way wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way your hair blows in the wind
And I miss you stayin' here till the mornin'
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everythin' about you, baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out, do you still live at your old house?
Do you got somebody new in your life?
'Cause I can't get you out of my mind
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seein' your face
In every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it? Simply 'cause I can't
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was there with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was still there with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop
Missin' everythin' you say
Missin' all the crazy love we made
Why'd you throw it all away?
I want you to know
It's been hell tryna do this without you here
Baby, '07 supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts every time you was goin' out
'Cause I knew you were tell me lies
And I can't get that outta my mind
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seein' your face
In every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it? Simply 'cause I can't
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was there with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was there with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
Wish I could wake up and forget about you
Not tryin' to call you when I know I want to
I gotta fight this feelin' can't let it take over me
You just don't understand how much you were a part of me
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was there with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was there
With you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missin' you
I can't stop missin' you
I don't wanna stop, I can't stop missin' you
Baby, I can't stop missin' you
No, no, no, no, I can't stop missin' you
Feet are feeling light
Head on out to see the sights
Ain't life a many splendored thing?

Ducking up and down
All these crazy sights and sounds
Bounce around like puppets on a string
Never gonna find, anything to change my mind
Famous last lines of a fool

Just when you think
You're a chain with just one link
Something comes to tip you off your stool

Hello hello
Hello hello
My my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

Hello, Hello
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out threr dropped say hello
Hello!
Do a dizzy dance
Twirl around and take a chance
Nothing's easy
Nothing comes for free

Sniffing on a flower
Run through an autumn shower
Bumping into someone else like me

Hello hello

Hello hello
My my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

Hello, Hello
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello!

And I could fly on the back of a bird
I could shake all the leaves from a tree
If there's a quest I'm a Knight
Where's there's wrong I'll do right
Two is better than the one I used to be
Hello hello
Hello hello
My my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

Hello, Hello
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello, Hello
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello

Hello Hello
Hello Hello
When I was a boy I had a lot of fun
I lived by the sea, I was a fisherman's son
My mother she was a fisherman's wife
She was scrubbing floors most of her life
They said screw you
I ain't got nothing to lose
I could paper a matchbox
With the money I use
Screw you
I ain't got nothing to lose
I could paper a matchbox
With the money I use
At the school I attended, I got into fights
I was beaten in an alley on a cold winter night
The teachers cared less for the blood in our veins
They got most of their thrills out of using a cane
They said screw you
Oh, you bloody young fools
I could get more sense
Out of the back end of a mule
Screw you
Oh, you bloody young fools
I could get more sense
Out of the back end of a mule
So you see there's men who get paid for being slaves
And men who get paid for being free
And there's men behind bars who pray for the light
And men in the suburbs who pray for the night
And they're all trying to climb to the top of the mine
And all of them say most of the way screw you
I worked in the mill from seven till nine
Tears in my eyes nearly drove me blind
Trying to make wages that weren't even there
Taking hell from a foreman with the build of a bear
He said screw you
This is all you'll ever do
It's the only existence
For someone like you
Screw you
This is all you'll ever do
It's the only existence
For someone like you
Screw you
Screw you
Screw you
Screw you
Screw you
Screw you
...

[Verse 1]
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

[Verse 2]
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions on a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Verse 3]
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

[Verse 4]
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Outro]
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Intro]
This right here's a panty dropper
Whoa oh, whoa oh oh oh oh oh
This right here's a panty dropper
Whoa oh oh oh, yeah, whoa oh
This right here's a baby maker
Can I sing my song?

[Verse 1]
If you up in the club tryna get a rub
Then you need to tell the DJ to put this song
Put-put-put-put this song, put this song on
Let me tell you what it is, put away the kids
Time to get it up, get a cup fill it up
Feeling on her booty, touching on her butt
Time to get her back to the crib, beat it up

[Pre-Chorus]
We been spending time, wanna make you mine, oh oh
When you're not around you're still on my mind, oh oh
And I hope this ain't surprising that I been fantasizing
This ain't no joke, let me clear my throat, ahem

[Chorus]
I wanna make love to you
This right here's a panty dropper
This is my panty dropping love song
Nothing but your heels on, loving you
This right here's a baby maker
And we'll be making babies tonight
I wanna make love to you
This right here's a panty dropper
This is my panty dropping love song
Nothing but your heels on, loving you
This right here's a baby maker
And we'll be making babies tonight

[Verse 2]
Legs like a model, coke is the bottle
Hour glass shawty, bee-vo-ladi give you more head than she got body
Skin of a goddess, smile of you got it
And we gonna get it in just like we should
Put in the hole like tiger woods
We been spendin time, wanna make you mine
When your not around you're still on my mind
And I hope this ain't suprising but I been fantising
This ain't no joke let me clear my throat (Uh uh uh)

[Chorus]
I wanna make love to you
This right here's a panty dropper
This is my panty dropping love song
Nothing but your heels on, loving you
This right here's a baby maker
And we'll be making babies tonight
I wanna make love to you
This right here's a panty dropper
This is my panty dropping love song
Nothing but your heels on, loving you
This right here's a baby maker
And we'll be making babies tonight

[Bridge]
I wanna make love
Put this song, Put this song, (YEA) Put this song on. (Panty droppin love)
Put this song, Put this song (I I I I wanna make love) Put this song on
Put this song, Put this song (make make make love)
Put this song on. Put this song on
I wanna make love. Oweee

[Chorus]
This right here's a panty dropper
This is my panty dropping love song
Nothing but your heels on, loving you
This right here's a baby maker
And we'll be making babies tonight
I wanna make love to you
This right here's a panty dropper
This is my panty dropper purse, shirts, skirts all coming off
Loving youu
This right here's a baby maker (Yeah)
And we'll be making babies, you're my lady
And I know this may sound crazy but
This right here's a panty dropper
Run my fingers through your hair
This right here's a baby maker
That's what it is. Heels up in the air
This right here's a panty dropper (Trouble!)
This right here's a baby maker
Put your heels up in the air
He talks a lot but never talks to anyone at all
He shakes his fists at busses and old posters on the walls
He knows someone who knew something about J.F.K
But his friends are just the shadows in the halls and alleyways
The rumbling frozen pipes whisper secrets in the night
In the coffee grounds, his fingers sketch a portrait of his wife
She knew the legal eagle when his wings swept through the stars
Before he shut the furnace down and sealed away his heart

[Chorus]
It's Gauguin gone Hollywood again
A sleeping giant inside a rabbit's skin
Tahitian doors beyond the painted veil
Another simple mind adrift
Like Gauguin going Hollywood again
The day lacks color, days are duller than a butter knife
Rusty water running through hands out of touch with life
A man of independent means, he'd have us all believe
A soul who throws his wings away before he goes to sleep

[Chorus]
If only for a moment, the dead weight were alive
An invitation for the flame to shine a light inside
Illuminating darkness, giving him release
Then someday in his trash can we'll find a masterpiece

[Chorus]
Like Gauguin going Hollywood again
Maybe, you're always maybe
Maybe, maybe I love you
My thanks jaunty for the lower time
Maybe, you're always maybe
Maybe, maybe I love you
But I keep follow something other side

She sold me magic
She sold me magic
And all the believer things I needed every day
She sold me magic
She sold me magic
And all the believer things I needed every day

Maybe, you're always maybe, maybe, maybe I love you
My thanks jaunty for the lower time
Maybe, you're always maybe, maybe, maybe I love you
But I keep follow something other side

She sold me magic
She sold me magic
And all the believer things I needed every day
She sold me magic
She sold me magic
And all the believer things I needed every day
She said I'm in my better life time
She said my soul is matching her a sign
She turn mine in all about she loves me strong
Will you love me love? She push me all again your love
Will you love me love? She push me all again your love

Maybe, you're always maybe, maybe, maybe I love you
My thanks jaunty for the lower time
Maybe, you're always maybe, maybe, maybe I love you
But I keep follow something other side

[Verse 1]
From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done
Some say, "Eat or be eaten"
Some say, "Live and let live"
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give

[Chorus]
In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life

[Verse 2]
Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars
There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rollin' high through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

[Chorus]
In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding, yeah
In the circle, the circle of life

[Outro]
It's the wheel of fortune, yeah
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding, yeah
In the circle, the circle of life
On the path unwinding, yeah
In the circle, the circle of life
I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word I'm a madman don't you know

Once a fool had a good part in the play
If it's so would I still be here today?
It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way
They think it's very funny everything I say
Get a load of him, he's so insane
You'd better get your coat dear
It looks like rain

We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The in-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water

I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word I'm a madman don't you know
The ground's a long way down but I need more
Is the nightmare black
Or are the windows painted?
Will they come again next week
Can my mind really take it?

We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The inlaws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water
When the day is done
Down to Earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done

When the day is done
Hope so much your race will be all run
Then you find you jumped the gun
Have to go back where you begun
When the day is done

When the night is cold
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the night is cold

When the bird has flown
Got no one to call your own
Got no place to call your home
Now the bird has flown
When the game's been fought
Newspaper blowing across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Now the game's been fought

When the party's through
Seems so very sad for you
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Now there's no time to to start anew
Now the party's through

When the day is done
Down to Earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done
Day is done
When the day is done
Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me I could honestly say
That things can only get better
And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man
Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Laughing like children, living like lovers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Laughing like children, living like lovers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

[Chorus]
I can't let my Heaven walk away
Just can't let my Heaven walk away
Gotta find a way to make her stay
I don't know what I've done wrong
Look up and find my Heaven gone

[Verse 1]
Called her name but I called in vain
I know she can't answer from a picture frame
Only an hour ago I held in real flesh and blood
She just grabbed her coat and said, "Please, I've had enough"
She kept me well like a Sunday prayer
Just like my own right hand the girl was always there
To every man but me, her eyes were blind
I was in the promise land long before my time

[Chorus]
I can't let my Heaven walk away
Just can't let my Heaven walk away
Just gotta find a way to make her stay
I don't know what I've done wrong
Look up and find my Heaven gone

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 2]
I accused my angel of being a liar
I said the flesh is weak in God's key trial
I only accused her to hear her tell me no
But my question backfired, I didn't expect her to go
Oh no no

[Chorus]
I can't let my Heaven walk away
Just can't let my Heaven walk away
Just gotta find a way to make her stay
I can't let her go, oh no
I can't let my Heaven walk away from me, no no
Just can't let my lady walk away, no
Just gotta find a way to make her stay, oh

[Harmonica solo]

[Outro]
I can't let it her go, you see I love her so
I can't let my Heaven walk away
I can't let my Heaven walk away
Just gotta find a way to make her stay
I don't know where she's gone, you see I love her so
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, please baby, please please don't walk away
I can't stand the way my baby walk away
Just gotta find a way to make her stay
I can't let it her go, you see I love her so

[Verse 1]
Seems the wisdom of man hasn't got much wiser
Than the very beginning of our time
Agree or war has been our way of compromising
"Let live and love" has become our biggest lie
Seems to me that fools are even more foolish
Thinking of themselves and nobody else
But then if asked for poor will riches be replenished
They say bootstraps must be pulled up by themselves

[Chorus]
Feeding off the love of the land
Leaving much to be desired
Living off the love of the Lord
While the price for life is higher
Isn't love to be admired?
Has the good in man expired?
Stealing all the love and the beauty from the land

[Verse 2]
I awake each morning to the birds a-singing
Singing out to God to come and save his own
But when throughout the world the cry of love is ringing
Is then when He'll stop to hear our song
Did you know that when you feel the earth a-shaking
It's only Mother Nature with a crying heart
You see, we have taken from her for so many ages
Will there be a time when taking stops and giving starts?

[Chorus]
'Cause we're feeding off the love of the land
Leaving much to be desired
Living off the love of the Lord
While the price for life is higher
Isn't love to be admired?
Has the good in man expired?
Stealing all the love and the beauty from the land

[Outro]
Yes, we're feeding off the love of the land
Never hearing what He's saying
Living off the love of the Lord
Never feeling what you're praying
Never praising Him for beauty
Only praying God please give me
Stealing all the love and the beauty from the land
Stealing all the love and the beauty from His land
I'm counting on a memory to get me out of here
I'm waiting for the fog around this spooky little town to clear
All this time I spent being someone else's friend
Just one more time, for old time's sake I'd like to go back home again
The world had seven wonders once upon a time

It's sure enough the favored nations aided their decline
And all around me I've seen times like it was back when
But like back then, I'd say a men if I could get back home again

If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I'd never left, I'd never have known
We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end
Spending all our time trying to get back home again

Could have been a jailbreak and a spotlight hitting me
Or was I just some nightclub singer, back in 1963
In the old part of Valencia, on the coast of Spain
Never tiring once of hearing songs about going home again

If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I'd never left, I'd never have known
We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end
Spending all our time trying to get back home again
If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I'd never left, I'd never have known
We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end
Spending all our time trying to get back home again
Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
Make just one heart the heart you sing to

One smile that cheers you
One face that lights when it's nears you
One girl you're everything to

Fame if you win it
Comes and goes in a minute
Where's the real stuff in life to cling to?

Love is the answer
Someone to love is the answer
Once you've found her, build your world around her

Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
And you will be happy, too

[Instrumental break]
Yeah
Once you've found her
Now build your world, build your world around her
Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
And you will be happy, too
Make someone happy, oh
And you will be happy, too

[Chorus]
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning, I'll come following you

[Verse]
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
All my senses have been stripped
And my hands can't feel to grip
And my toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it

[Chorus]
Oh, hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning, I'll come following you
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the milky way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
Maybe someday, you'll see my face amoung the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la la, la la la la la la

[Verse 1]
They say, Ruby, you're like a dream
Not always what you seem
And though my heart may break when I awake
Let it be so, I only know
Ruby, it's you

[Verse 2]
They say, Ruby, you're like a song
You just don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes, I see heartaches for me
Right from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you

[Bridge]
I hear your voice and I must come to you (must come to you)
I have no choice, so what else can I do? (what else can I do?)

[Verse 3]
They say, Ruby, you're like a flame
Into my life, you came
And though I should beware, still I just don't care
You thrill me so, I only know
Ruby, it's you

[Bridge]
(I hear your voice and I must come to you)
(I have no choice, what else can I do ?-what can I do?)

[Verse 4]
They say, Ruby, you're like a flame
Into my life, you came
And though I should beware, still I don't care
You thrill me so, I only know
Ruby, it's you
Hey!

I wanna make her love me till the rock ain't stone
And I wanna make her love me till the cows come home
And I wanna make her love me till the fire don't burn
And I wanna make her love me till the world cease to turn

Oh papa, I'm like a little lost lamb
Reaching for a girl that's out of reach
Ah, sit right down and talk to me man to man
Tell me how to practice what you used to preach
Oh, papa used to tell me that a man could do
Anything he ever put his heart into

But I wanna make her love me till them seas run dry
And I wanna make her love me till money can't buy
I wanna make her love me till the fifth week in May
And I wanna make her love me till Ol' Man River runs away

Oh, she's a ditty and as pretty as Mona Lisa
Papa's rich and her mama's proud
I worked three jobs tryin' to get what might please her
But still she lives in a world where I ain't allowed
Ah papa, you used to tell me it might take a little sweat
But when a man wakes up he sure enough will get
I wanna make her love me till the kingdom come
I wanna make her love me till the cows come home
I gonna make her love me till right is wrong

Ah Hey, yeah Hey

Ah, I can't compete with Baby Face Pete
And I ain't no match for Lou
He gave her a diamond, a diamond ring the other week
And all I can give her is a heart so true
Oh, papa used to say a true heart will reign
What a true heart desires it sure enough will gain

But I wanna make her love me till the rock ain't stone
I wanna make her love me till the cows come home
I gonna make her love me till it snows in June
Hey, hey, save on my baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe in magic
And if I should ever go away
Well just close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember...

Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times, and bad times
I'll be on your side forever-more
That's what friends are for

Well you came and opened me
And now there's so much more I see
And so by the way I thank you...oh
And then for the times when we're apart
Well then close your eyes and know
The words are coming from my heart
And if you can remember...oh
Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times, and bad times
I'll be on your side forever-more
That's what friends are for

Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times, and bad times
I'll be on your side forever-more
That's what friends are for

Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times, and bad times
I'll be on your side forever-more
That's what friends are for

On me for sure, on me for sure, on me for sure
For thats what friends are for

Bad things about me

Ooh, send me some lovin'
Send it I pray
How can I love you
When you're far away?
Oh, send me your picture, girl
(Send me a picture, baby)
Send it, my dear
(Send me a picture, baby)
So I can hold it
And pretend that you're here

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you send me your kisses, girl?
I can feel their touch
I need you so badly, girl
I miss you so much, oh yeah

[Chorus]
My days are so lonely
(Send me some lovin', baby)
My nights are so blue

Come on, send me some lovin', lovin', lovin'

[Chorus]
I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
I've gone white-girl crazy, she's gone black-boy hazy
We're each others baby, we're in love

[Verse 1]
I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love

She can't love me, I can't love her
'Cause they say we're the wrong color
Staring, gloating, laughing, looking
Like we've done something wrong
Because we show love strong, get real, come on
Calling us names too bad to mention
But we pay them no attention
For color blind are inner feelings
If we feel happiness
And know our loves the best, forget their mess

[Chorus]
I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
I've gone white-girl crazy, she's gone black-boy hazy
We're each others baby, we're in love

[Verse 2]
Everyone's created equal
Hell with all you ignorant people
Trying to stereo type us
You really ought to quit
'Cause you don't know jack, you make us sick
Get off my jock, you're trying to ride me
Because I got my girl beside me
You'll only make yourself look stupid
I love you're trying to diss
'Cause we've got happiness, I bet you're pissed

[Chorus]
I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
I've gone white-girl crazy, she's gone black-boy hazy
We're each others baby, we're in love
Hit me, drummer...
I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
I've gone white-girl crazy, she's gone black-boy hazy
We're each others baby, we're in love

I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love

[Spoken Intro]
When I look at love, I look at you
Look at me and you'll see
Love is burning inside of me
But the flame needs you to make it brighter
Give to me what you see
Make the moment a lifetime

[Verse 1]
Give your love
Give your love to only me
Give the chance I need
To let you see
You will be the other half of me
Give your love
Oh, give your love and lead the way
Turn the cold of winter into May
Through a thousand winters
Love will stay

[Bridge]
We'll build a dream
Just big enough for two, girl
We'll build a world that's made of only love
You'll be the one
Who makes my life worth living
You'll keep me strong
When I stumble and I fall

[Verse 2]
So, give your love
Give your love, don't let me down
Don't reduce me to a nervous clown
You know that I'll always be around

[Spoken Interlude]
Every day that we're apart, I cry, girl
When you're gone all I long for
Is when you'll be near me
Every day a thousand times I die, girl
Far away how I pray there is some way
You'll hear me

[Verse 3]
Give your love
Oh, give your love, your tears and pain
I will be your shelter through the rain
Through the storm, my love for you won't change
So, give your love
Give your love and give your heart
Never, never will love let us part
We were meant to be lovers from the start

[Outro]
So, la la la
Oh, give your love, don't let me down
Don't reduce me to a nervous clown
You know that I'll always be around
Angie, give your love
Oh, give your love, don't make me cry
Gray skies are gonna clear up, yeah
Put on a happy face
Brush off the clouds and cheer up
Put on a happy face

Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy
It's not your style
You'll look so good that you'll be glad
You decided to smile

Pick out a pleasant outlook
Stick out that noble chin
Wipe off that "full of doubt" look
Put on a happy grin

And spread sunshine all over the place
Just put on a happy face
Ha ha

Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy
It's not your style
You'll look so good that you'll be glad
That you decided to smile
Pick out a pleasant outlook
Stick out that noble chin
Wipe off that "full of doubt" look
Put on a happy grin

And spread sunshine all over the place
Just put on a happy face
Yeah yeah yeah, just put on a happy face

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm glad I've got you, oh oh oh
Baby, I'm glad I've got you, oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
Somebody tried to tell me
That you've been running around
They must have you mixed up
With another girl in town

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause as sure as I know
That a broken heart has got its pain
That's how sure I know
Baby, I can claim
That I've got you

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm glad I've got you, oh oh oh
I've got you
Baby, I'm glad I've got you, oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
In a thousand little ways
I can tell you really love me (really love me)
In a thousand little things you do
I can tell you really love me (really love me)

[Pre-Chorus]
And as sure as I know
That a crying child has got his tears
That's how sure I know
I can love you with no fear
'Cause I've got you

[Chorus]
Baby I'm glad I've got you, oh oh oh
Oh baby, I've got you
Baby I'm glad I've got you, oh oh oh

[Harmonica solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
And as sure as I know
That a singing bird has got his song
That's how sure I know
Baby I can't be wrong to say that I've got you

[Chorus]
Baby I'm glad I've got you, oh oh oh
Oh baby, I've got you
Baby I'm glad I've got you, oh oh oh
Woo, I said I've got you
Baby I'm glad I've got you, oh oh oh
And I, I, I
Baby I'm glad I've got you, oh oh oh
I've got you
Baby I'm glad I've got you, oh oh oh

Miscellaneous
Never Say Goodbye
There isn't much I haven't shared
With you along the road
And through it all there'd always be
Tomorrow's episode
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
Ask no questions, take no side
Who's to say who's right or wrong
Whose course is braver run
Will ever be, ask one
What is done has been done for the best
Though the mist in my eyes might suggest
Just a little confusion about what I'll lose
But if I started over I know I would choose
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and tought me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Sudenely that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
I would choose
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and taught me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
She wrecked my life cursed my pride
Smashed my dreams then threw me aside oh baby yeah

Holy only blessed me when she put me down
Heaven smiled on me when you I found
You gave this life of mine a bright new chance
Now Beverly's is back to upset our plans

For each tear that she may cry
It's too late now
(To late now)
For each sweet little lullaby
It's too late now
(Too late now)

'Cause I'm more than happy girl I'm satisfied
And I more than love you girl I idolise you

She can beg and plead swear up what she needs
But I'll leave you never, I love you forever
You pick me up from by the wayside
Wiped the dust from my walked on pride
You are the one that patched up all my dreams
Showed me what a true heart really means

For that baby talk, she talks
It's too late now
(Too late now)
For that wiggly walk she walks
It's too late now
(Too late now)

'Cause I'm more than happy girl I'm satisfied
And I'll never never never leave my baby's side

With you I remain
She can't break the chains
That binds us together
I'll love you forever

I love you, I love you, I love you love baby

Beverly might as well go on her away
Her magic touch faded with yesterday

You're the sweetest thing under the sun
And now that I found you
I'm sure holding on
'Cause I love you baby
Really need you baby
Really want you baby
Sure ain't gonna leave you baby

And I'm more than happy girl I'm satisfied
And I more than love you girl I idolise you

('Cause I'm more than happy, girl, I'm satisfied)
'Cause I love you baby, and I need you baby
(And I never, never, never leave your side)
Ooh, don't go and I love you, sure ain't gonna leave you baby
('Cause I'm more than happy girl, I'm satisfied)
And I more than love you, said I need you baby
(And I more than love you girl, I idolize you)
Ooh, have mercy I love you

[Harmonica outro]

[Verse 1]
Got no place to be
No one's needing me
My girl just said we're through
Love was here to stay
Only yesterday
Today my world is blue

[Chorus]
So show me to where there's music
Show me to where there's music
With music I just might go on
I gotta have a song
To go it alone
I gotta have a song

[Verse 2]
Had a happy home
Now it's turned to stone
Kitchen's cold and bare
She'd cook all day for me
I still hurry home to see
But I know that she's not there

[Chorus]
So show me to where there's music
Show me to where there's music
With music I just might go on
I gotta have a song
To go it alone
To a song

[Chorus]
Show me to where there's music
Show me to where there's music
With music, I just can't go wrong
I gotta have a song
A happy happy song
A happy happy song
I gotta have a song, baby
A happy happy song
I gotta have a song
On the beach where young lovers meet
You can see them there as they sit and build
Castles in the sand
Heavenly, she's so heavenly
When she smiles at you
And she helps you build
Castles in the sand

The time comes when you stop pretending
For all dreams must come to an ending
Remember what happens to castles of sand
The sea will wash them away
Oh

On the beach where they used to meet
By the sand and sea, waves have washed away
Castles in the sand
Castles in the sand
Where did they go?
Castles in the sand
Tell me, where did they go?
Castles in the sand
I wanna know where did they go
Castles in the sand
Please tell me where did they go...

[Verse 1]
There is something that I'd like to say to you
There are people who will try to put us down
They will tell us we're too young to see it through, girl
Try to make us cry
But don't you worry, you have me and I have you
Well, there is something that I think you ought to know, yeah
There are people who will say our love won't grow, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
It's important that you face them with a smile, girl
And you tell them
Honey, maybe someday lovin' just might be worth while, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Well, there is something that I'd like to say
And there is something that we can do today
And there is one thing that I know has come our way
Oh baby

[Verse 2]
They can't hurt us, though I know they'll try
And it will work out, but they won't know why
And there is something to our love that just can't die

[Harmonica solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
It's important that you face them with a smile, girl
And you tell them honey
Maybe someday, lovin' just might be worth while
Oh baby

[Chorus]
There is something that I'd like to say
And there is something that we can do today
And there is one thing that I know has come our way
Oh baby

There is something that I'd like to do
Well, there is something just for me and you
Yes there is something that I'd like to say to you, oh

There is something that I'd like to say
And there is something that we can do today
And there is something that I'd like to say to you
Hey, hey yeah

And there is something that I'd like to say
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you

Little girl again you are blue
Another fellow has gone and left you
I see you've come back to me
Your best friend
To tell another tragic story again
And once more you look into my eyes
And one more time you ought to realize

I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you

I must confess you're not to be blamed
For being caught in those boys' vicious games
This time I won't let you go back
Never again, my dear, in fact
I'm gonna stop the blueness
In you
Also confess what my heart
Wants me to
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you

Just once more you look in my eyes
And one more time you ought to realize

I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
Some folks say a man is made outta mud
But a poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood, skin and bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong, yeah

You load sixteen tons and what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store, yeah, ha

I was born when the sun didn't shine
I became a man who would work in the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
The foreman said, "Well, a-bless my soul"

I was born in drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble was my middle name
When I come around, you better step aside
A lot of men didn't and a lot of men died, yes they did

You load sixteen tons and what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
Yeah, sing it one time with me
Sixteen tons and what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

Everybody humming only
Mmm, hmm, ooh, ooh, yeah
Mmm, hmm, ooh, ooh
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 1]
She was five and I was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
I wore black and she wore white
She would always win the fight

[Chorus]
Bang bang, she shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

[Verse 2]
Seasons came and changed the time
I grew up, I called her mine
She would always laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play?"

[Chorus]
Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down

[Bridge]
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bell rang
Hey! Bang bang bang bang
Hey! Bang bang bang bang
Yeah! Bang bang bang bang
Yeah! Bang bang bang bang

[Verse 3]
Now she's gone, I don't know why
'Til the day sometimes I cry
She didn't even say goodbye
She didn't take the time to lie

[Chorus]
Bang bang, she shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

[Intro]
Every time I feel a little groove coming on
I just have to move
I got a tune I play

[Verse 1]

[Outro]
Workout, Stevie, workout

[Verse 1]
If my world seemed dark and gloomy
And my life seemed not worthwhile
Would you leave me here alone, girl?
Would you leave me here to cry?

Now you say you idolize me
Don't leave me in dismay
Now you know my heart is dying
Yet you turn and walk away

[Chorus]
You give me love enough to ease the pain
And then you take your love away
You give me love enough to ease the pain
And then you take your love away from me

[Verse 2]
Now I've been my own palm reader
And I've shown myself the way
Girl, you don't have no good intentions
For with a dying heart you play

[Chorus]
You give me love enough to ease the pain
And then you take your love away
You give me love enough to ease the pain
And then you take your love away from me

[Instrumental Break]

[Harmonica Solo]

[Outro]
You give me love enough to ease the pain
And then you take your love away
You give me love enough to ease the pain
And then you take your love away
You give me love enough to ease the pain
And then you take your love away
You give me love enough to ease the pain
Hey, hey, he-he-hey
Yeah baby

See that house, that house up on the hill
Let me tell you that's where my little darlin' lives
Come late tonight I'll have a hand full of rocks
And I know I'm straight strong enough to make one hit the top
And if I do, whoo, she'll come runnin' I'll bet you (she'll come runnin' I'll bet)

She's gonna know that it's me, me, me, me
That's our signal can't you see, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh what joy that house holds for me
That's why I stand her all night throwing rocks, can't you see
Tryin' to get the attention of the girl I love
So she can be here with me under the stars above
And when I do, whoo (when I do, when I do)
She'll come runnin' I'll bet you (she'll come runnin' I'll bet)

She's gonna know that it's St-Stevie, Stevie, St-St-Stevie
That's our signal can't you see, oh yeah, hey hey hey
And I can see that girl runnin' down the hill
Me runnin' out to meet her, oh what thrill
(When I see her face, moonlight in her hair)
When I see her face, moonlight in her hair
My heart beats fast because she's in my arms and that's
Hey, hey, sure enough
Aw play that thing boy
Y'all gotta see
(Y'all gotta see)
See that house, see that house up on the hill
(House up on the hill)
There's gonna be a wedding there, oh yes there will
(Oh yes there will, yeah baby)
This old arm of mine won't have to throw no more rocks
Because I'll have my cookie here with me all around the clock
(Have my cookie here)
And when I do we'll have happiness I bet you

She's gonna belong to me, me, me, me
We'll have a life of ecstasy, oh yeah, oh yeah
Just us two up on the hill
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright, Lord yeah, yeah
Everything's gonna be outta sight up on the hill
Lovin', good lovin', sweet lovin', every single night
Up on that hill
Everyone's a kid at Christmas time
A holly jolly kid at Christmas time
Everyone from Maine to Baton Rouge
Got the news - even Scrooge!
Everyone's a kid at Christmas time
A holly jolly kid at Christmas time
Mistletoe is now the latest rage
And no one wants to act their age
The older folks are playing with their trains
Eating candy canes and trimming trees
Some nice old guy is riding through the sky
Would you believe he's jumping into chimneys?
Whoa, everyone's a kid at Christmas time
A holly jolly kid at Christmas time
Now's the time to throw your cares away
The world is on a holiday
There's even people singing in the street
Life is such a treat and goodness knows
That same old guy, still riding through the sky
And talking to a reindeer with a big red nose
Whoa, everyone's a kid at Christmas time
A holly jolly kid at Christmas time
Everyone from one to ninety-three
Feeling free, look at me!
Oh, everyone's a kid at Christmas time
A holly jolly kid at Christmas time
Now's the time to throw your cares away
And do the things you did, when you were just a kid
The world is on a holiday
Everyone's a kid at Christmas time
A holly jolly kid at Christmas time
Everyone from Maine to Baton Rouge
Got the news - even Scrooge!

[Repeat and fade]
Look down, look down
That lonesome road
Before you travel on

Look up, look up
And see your maker
Before Gabriel blows his horn

Weary toting such a heavy load
Tredging down that long lonesome road

Look down, look down
Look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on

(True love, true love) True love, true love
(What have I done) Tell me what have I done
(Yeah) That you should treat me so
(Mmm, the pain you've caused) You caused me, yes you caused me
(To walk and talk) To walk and talk
(Yeah, yeah) Like I never did before
(Don't you get weary sometimes?) Weary toting such a heavy load
(Gotta keep on moving) Tredging down that
Long (long), long (long), lonesome road (woo)

Look down (look down), look down (look down) that
Look down that lonesome road
Before (before) you travel on (you travel on)
(Somebody help us now) Before (before) you travel on
(Give another warning, Stevie) Before (before) you travel on
'Yeah'
'Yeah'

Ladies and gentlemen, now I'm going to do a song
Taken from my album, 'The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie'
The name of the song is called, umm, 'Fingertips'

Now, I want ya to clap yo' hand, come on
Come on!
Yeah!
Stomp yo' feet
Jump up and down, do anything that you wanna do!

Yeah!
Yeah!

[Chorus]
My world is empty without you, babe (you, babe)
My world is empty without you, babe (you, babe)

[Verse 1]
And as I go my way alone, yeah
I find it hard for me to carry on
I need your strength, I need your tender touch
I need the love I miss so much

[Chorus]
My world is empty without you, babe (you, babe)
Oh, my world is empty without you, babe (you, babe)

[Verse 2]
From this whole world, I try to hide my face
But from this loneliness, there's no hiding place
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell
In darkness with memories I know so well

[Chorus]
My world is empty without you, babe (you, babe)
My world is empty without you, babe (you, babe)

[Verse 3]
I need your love more than before
I can hardly carry on anymore

[Chorus]
My world is empty without you, babe (you, babe)
Without you, babe, without you, babe (you, babe)

[Verse 4]
My mind and soul have felt like this
Since love between us, no more exists
And every time that darkness falls
It finds me alone with these four walls

[Outro]
Well, my world is empty without you, babe
Without you, babe, without you, babe
Without you, babe, without you, babe
Without you, baby yeah
La la
La la
My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the milky way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
Maybe someday, you'll see my face among the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
...

[Chorus]
Do I love her? Do I love her?
With a heart that's true
Do I love her? Do I love her?
Don't you know I do

[Verse 1]
Mrs. Jones won't you put my darling on the phone
Let me tell her
I shouldn't have left her
'Cause I love her just as long as
Bees love honey
Banks love money
Birdies love to fly
Little Jack Horner in the corner loves his Christmas pie
Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
Let me speak to your daughter
If she gives me one more chance
I'm gonna love her like I oughta

[Bridge]
I can't forget (I can't forget)
That lacy dress
That she used to wear for me
We'd sit under the apple tree
And I remember (I remember, I remember) that night in September
When my baby cried and cried 'cause they told her love has died

[Chorus]
Do I love her? Do I love her?
With a heart that's true
Do I love her? Do I love her?
I swear I do

[Verse 2]
I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed
For stringing her along
Like a playboy with a play toy
And she loved me just as strong as
Bees love honey
Banks love money
Birdies love to fly (Birdies love to fly)
Little Miss Muffet loves her tuffet
Babies love to cry (Babies love to cry)
Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
Please don't hang up that receiver
If she heard one sweet word
She'd know I would never leave her

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
She's the best
Oh, the very best
Everything worth living for
Everything that I adore

[Outro]
Do I love her? Do I love her?
With a heart that's true
Do I love her? Do I love her?
I swear I do
As much as bees love honey
Banks love money
Birdies love to fly
Do I love her? Oh yeah
Will I love her? Baby, woo, woo, yeah
I love my baby
I love her

[Verse 1]
Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
Oh, the dark days are gone and the bright days are here
My Sunny one shines so sincere
Oh, Sunny one so true
I love you

[Verse 2]
Oh Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny, oh thank you for the love you brought my way
You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel ten feet tall
Sunny one so true
I love you

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 3]
Oh, yeah yeah
Sunny, thank you for the truth you let me see
My sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z
My life was torn like wind-blown sand
Then a rock was formed when we held hands
Sunny one so true
I love you

[Verse 4]
Whoa
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sunny, oh thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true
I love you

[Outro]
I love you, yeah
Yes I do
I love you

[Verse 1]
Lonely, my life used to be lonely
Lonely like the single lonely number one
Lonely like a lonely sun
Without a single iota to shine upon, yeah

Crying, deep inside I was crying
Like the muddy Mississippi, my tears flowed
Carrying with it my lonely soul
Leaving no clue of who, where or what I would become

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody
To hold me, control me, show me what I should do with my broken life
But oh, was I lifted when I let your light inside my body
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and you
In my, my, my, my li-li-life

[Chorus]
I'm dancing to the rhythm of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Forever grateful for your love

[Verse 2]
Money, oh, how did I have money
Enough to last me from start 'til the end of time
With some more to leave behind
And yet I was a cent-less pauper in distress, hey hey
I can, feel the very presence of your love here
Though I've never seen the pleasure of your smile
No, I've never touched your hand
And yet you've given me eternal happiness

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody
To hold me, control me, show me what I should do with my broken life
Oh, was I lifted when I let your light inside my body
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and you in my
My, my, my li-li-life

[Chorus]
I'm dancing to the rhythm of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Forever grateful for your sweet, sweet love
I'm dancing to the rhythm of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Forever grateful for your sweet, sweet love
I'm dancing to the rhythm of your love
Forever grateful for your love

[Breakdown]

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody
To hold me, control me, show me what I should do with my broken life
Oh, was I lifted when I let God's light inside my body
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and you
In my, my, my, my li-li-life

[Chorus]
I'm dancing to the rhythm of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Giving all praises for your sweet, sweet love
I'm dancing to the rhythm of your love
Forever grateful for your love

[Intro]
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmmm, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Them that's got shall get
Them that's not shall lose
So the Bible says and it still is news

[Chorus]
Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, yeah
That's got his own
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Yes, the strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, yeah
That's got his own
Oh yeah

[Bridge]
Money, you've got lots of friends
Crowding 'round your door, oh yeah
But when you're gone and spending ends
Oh, they don't come around anymore, oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Rich relations give
Crust of bread and such
You can help yourself
But please don't take too much, no, no, no

[Chorus]
Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, yeah
That's got his own

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 3 repeated]
Oh, rich relations give
Crust of bread and such
You can help yourself
But oh don't take too much, no, no, no

[Chorus]
Mama may have, papa may have
God bless the child that's got his own, hoo
That's got his own, oh, hmm
That's got his own, yeah, hmm

[Outro]
I've got my own, hmm
That's got his own
Hey there miss fine, sweet little clinging vine
Your actions kind of show me you love me truly, yeah
You're warmer than July, sweet as apple pie
I can't let you know you're getting to me, yeah

Yeah, 'cause you can't judge a book by its cover
My papa used to say, "Look child
Look beyond a tender smile
'Cause you can't judge a look by the lover"

Girl, I'm sweet on you though you can't see through
This unconcerned expression I've been wearing, yeah
Hey, I practice looking bored so you can feel ignored
But that don't mean that I'm not really caring, yeah

'Cause you can't judge a book by its cover
And you can't judge a look by its lover
Maybe my coldness is a mask, maybe your loving ways will last
But you can't judge a book by its cover, baby
Ah, hoo
Somewhere beyond the skin, somewhere deep within
Somewhere, somewhere
We may find that love is there to test us, yeah
But we've got to have the nerve to give it all it deserves
And maybe, baby, we'll find something precious, yeah

'Cause you can't judge a book by its cover
Only time it's gonna show, only time will let us know
'Cause you can't judge a book by its cover, baby, ooh
And you can't judge a look by its lover

We've got to search each other's minds
We've got to read between the lines
Oh, take a different look
And make our hearts an open book

Oh, you can't judge a book by its cover
No, no, no, no
And you can't judge a look by its lover
Without a song, the day would never end
Without a song, oh, the road would never been
When things go wrong, a man ain't got no friend
Without a song, mmm, without a song

That field of corn, would never see a plow
That field of corn, would be deserted now
A man is born, but he ain't no good no how
Without a song, yeah yeah, without a song

I've got my trouble and woe, but sure as I know
The Jordan will roll
I'll get along, as long as a song
Is strong in my soul

I'll never know, what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know, what makes the grass grow tall
I only know, that there ain't no love at all
Without a song, mmm yeah, without a song, yeah

[Instrumental break]
I've got my trouble and woe, but sure as I know
The Jordan will roll
I'll get along, as long as a song
Is strong in my soul, in my soul

I'll never know, what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know, what makes the grass grow tall
I only know, there ain't no love at all
Without a song, yeah yeah, without a song
Mmm-hmm, without a song, yeah, without a song

[Verse 1]
Though you don't call anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I want to tell you, baby
The changes I've been going through
Missing you

[Chorus]
Until you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do

[Verse 2]
Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free
I'm gonna swallow my pride
Beg you to please see me
I'm gonna walk by myself
To prove that my love is true
All for you

[Chorus]
Until you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do

[Bridge]
Living for you, my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear
Hear my plea, I've got to make you see
That our love is dying

[Verse 3]
Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must explain
I'll have to rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I'm gonna camp on your steps
Until I get through to you
Change your view

[Chorus]
Until you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do
Oh, 'til you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do

[Outro]
I'm gonna tap on your window pane
Don't wanna wait in vain
I'm gonna tap on your window pane
When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this:
They have the power to make a dream come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you

If your heart is in your dreams
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longings, oh yeah

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true
When you wish upon a star
With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start
But it still is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells
I'm holding your hand
It tells that you're standing near, and

At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice
That a love such as ours came to be?
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you

[Instrumental Break]

But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart
With a song in my heart
With a song in my heart for you

[Verse 1]
Now I'll admit that you've been playing with my heart
Just like it was a toy
And I've been playing along
And letting you treat me wrong
Because it seems to give you joy

[Chorus]
Are you sure love is the name of this game?
Are you sure love is the name of this game?

[Verse 2]
For days on end, you just stay away
Waiting for my heart to weaken
It's more like we're playing hide and seek
And I'm the one who's always seeking

[Chorus]
Are you sure love is the name of this game?
Are you sure love, oh love is the name of this game?

[Bridge]
Well, if everything's right, and uptight
How come the heartaches keep repeating?
With every beat my heart is beating
Now can it be that you've been cheating
Cheating on me? Yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now how come you keep on telling me lies
Filling my life with sorrow
Don't know what to expect from your affection
It's here today and gone tomorrow

[Outro]
Are you sure love is the name of this game?
I wanna know
Are you sure love, love, love, love is the name of this game?
Are you sure L-O-V-E, love is the name of this game?
Tell me are you sure love, oh love is the name of this game?
Spring will come to those who seek it
Love belongs to those who speak it
And in awhile you're sure to smile
If you'll give your heart a chance

Joy is not beyond achieving
If you're not beyond believing
True faith you'll find if you look in your mind
If you only give your heart a chance

[Instrumental break]

True faith you'll find if you look in your mind
If you only give your heart a chance

[Verse 1]
It's Christmas time and its magic is here
It's Christmas time and its wonders appear
The scent of pine fills the Christmasy air
While the church bell chimes and there's joy everywhere

[Bridge]
Some precious gift (Some precious gift)
Lights a little one's eyes (Light's a little one's eyes)
God's blessed lived (God's blessed lived)
Stays the weary and wild (Stays the weary and wild)

[Verse 2]
This Christmas time, keep its magic right here
Within your heart every day of the year

[Harmonica solo]

[Bridge]
Some precious gift
Lights a little one's eyes
God's blessed lived
Stays the weary and wild

[Outro]
This Christmas time, keep its magic right here
Within your heart every day of the year
Ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
About you're plans to make me blue
With some other guy that you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah
I know that a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love somebody else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah
People say believe half of what you see
Son, and none of what you hear
I can't help being confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

[Intro]
Oh yeah
Hey, whoever you are
I want you to listen to my story
Yeah, yeah, yeah, my story
While I tell you, mmm

[Verse 1]
Hello young lovers, whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All of my good wishes go with you tonight
Yeah, I've been in love like you
Oh, be brave young lovers, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave, be faithful and true
You've got to cling to each other, very close tonight
I've been in love like you, hey, yeah

[Bridge]
I've had a love of my own
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've had a love of my own
I know how it feels, ha, to have wings on your heels
And fly down the street in a trance
You fly down the street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers, young lovers, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey

[Harmonica solo]

[Outro]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've had a love of my own
Yeah, yeah
Be brave young lovers, be brave, brave, brave
Yeah yeah yeah, I'm in love...
Like a fool, I went and stayed too long
Now, I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Ooo baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now, I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Ooo baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am, baby
You got my future in your hands
Here I am, baby
You got my future in your hands
I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, didn't I?
Oh baby, seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl
Ooo baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, I'm yours
Oowee baby, you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire
Ooo baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am, baby
You got my future in your hands, baby
Here I am, baby
You got my future in your hands, baby
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands, baby)
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands, baby)
Yeah, I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
I could be a broken man

[Incomprehensible], here I am, baby
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am, baby
I'm yours, yeah, I'm yours, yeah
I'm yours, yeah, I'm yours
Here I am, baby
I'm yours, yeah, I'm yours
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, yeah
Here I am, baby, yeah
I'm yours
La la la la...
Look, there's a lollipop on the holly
And there's a toy that pulls
Look, there's a jingle bell in a dolly
It's time I saw the miracles
Do you know, that mistletoe
Comes from the holly trees
And do you know, twelve below
Can make the snowman freeze
Do you know an Eskimo
Has ice upon his chin
Do you know that tippy-toe
Is Santa creeping in
La la la la...
Look, there's a choo-choo train and a rocket
And there's a bell that rings
Look, there's a candy cane in your pocket
And so many wondrous things
Do you know, so long ago
That Christmas had its start, yeah
Even though there's ice and snow
It melts the coldest heart
For when we pray on Christmas Day
A miracle was born, yeah
As we behold the ground is cold
But everyone is warm
Everyone is warm

[Intro]
Ha ha yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, my pretty little angel baby
Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby, don't you ever leave me

[Verse 1]
My little precious angel
Don't you know I'm glad I found ya, ha
I'm gonna dedicate my life to you
And build my world around you
I'm gonna love you through the years
I'll never bring you pain nor tears
I wanna keep you satisfied
So you'll never, never, never leave my side

[Chorus]
Oh, my pretty little angel baby
Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby, don't you ever leave me
Angel baby, Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby, don't you ever leave me

[Bridge]
'Cause I love ya and I need ya
And I'll treat you oh so kind
If you ever leave me, baby
I'd go right out of my mind

[Chorus]
My little angel baby
Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby, don't you ever leave me
Angel baby, don't you spread your wings
Angel baby, don't you ever leave me

[Verse 2]
Girl, you're my sunshine
You make me smile when skies are grey
But I'll never, never smile again
If somebody take my sunshine away
So I'm gonna work and toil, sweat and strain
Try to give you everything
So no rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief
Could ever steal you away from me

[Chorus]
My little angel baby
Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby, don't you ever leave me
Angel baby, don't you spread your wings
Angel baby, don't you ever leave me

[Bridge]
'Cause I love ya and I need ya
And I want you for myself
I couldn't make it, baby
If you leave me for somebody else

[Chorus]
My little angel baby
Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby, don't you never ever leave me
Angel baby, don't you spread your wings
Angel baby, don't you ever leave me

[Intro]
Now I want everybody to clap your hands in this groove
Come on! Ha, yeah
Ah yeah, now let me get myself together, yeah

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 1]
Put on your red dress, baby, 'cause we're going out tonight, ha ha, yeah
Put on your red dress, baby, 'cause we're going out tonight, ah yeah
Ah, you better wear your boxing gloves
In case some fool might wanna fight, yeah

[Chorus]
Put on your high heeled sneakers
And wear your wig hat on your head, oh yeah
Put on your high heeled sneakers, girl
And wear your wig hat on your head, ha ha, yeah
'Cause I'm pretty sure now, baby
I'm pretty sure you're gonna knock 'em dead, ha ha, yeah

[Harmonica solo]

[Chorus]
Ha ha, yeah
Put on your high heeled sneakers
And wear your wig hat on your head, ah baby
Put on your high heeled jump shoes, girl
And wear your wig hat on your head, na na na
'Cause I'm pretty sure now, baby
I'm pretty sure you're gonna knock 'em dead, yeah, ha ha, yeah

[Verse 1]
A chair is still a chair, even when there's no one sitting there;
But a chair is not a house, and a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss good night

[Verse 2]
A room is still a room, even when there's nothing there but gloom;
But a room is not a house, and a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a brok - en heart

[Verse 3]
Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears;
But it's just a crazy game; when it ends, it ends in tears

[Verse 4]
Darling, have a heart - don't let one mistake keep us apart
I'm not meant to live alone; turn this house into a home
When I climb the stair and turn the key
Oh, please be there, still in love with me

[Verse 1]
You never see the little sparkle in my eye
I wonder why
Sometimes I wish you'd stop and hold me, but you pass right by
I wonder why

[Pre-Chorus]
I've tried everything I could
I even change my walk, the way that I stood
But you pass by me and pretend that you don't even see me
But I want you to know, mmm

[Chorus]
If one day you decide to smile and say hello and I say goodbye, mmm
Don't wonder why, my baby, no
Don't wonder why, my baby

[Verse 2]
When I think of how you hurt me, it brings the tears to my eyes
I just can't seem to make you happy, no matter how hard I try
I wonder why

[Pre-Chorus]
Seems like no matter what I do
It's never good enough for you
My pain, it shows loud, but it still can't let go now
But I want you to know now

[Chorus]
Nights grow old and winds blow cold and so
If my loves grows cold and I don't wonder why, my baby, mmm baby
Don't wonder why, sugar, oh yeah

[Harmonica solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, seems like no matter what I do
I'm never, never, never, never, never good enough for you
My pain it shows now
Oh, you know I still just don't wanna, I just can't let go now
But I want you to know, oh baby

[Outro]
Nights grow old and winds blow cold, and so
If my love grows cold and dies, don't wonder why, baby
No, no, no, no, don't wonder why, my baby
Baby, don't wonder why, don't wonder why, my baby
Don't wonder why, my baby
No, no, no, no, no, don't wonder why my baby, ooh
Don't wonder why, my baby
Can you hear me? Can you hear me, baby?

[Verse 1]
We've got love a go go
Faithful as the dawn
Lover lover go go now
Love a love a go go now
Tomorrow it may be gone

[Verse 2]
We've got love a go go
We've got love to spare
Lover lover go go now
Love a love a go go now
Tomorrow we may not care

[Chorus]
Maybe you'll be true
And never say we're through
But lover love me now as though
You really mean you'll always love me so

[Verse 3]
We've got love a go go
Let's not wonder why
Lover lover go go now
Love a love a go go now
Tomorrow our love may die

[Chorus]
Maybe you'll be true
And never say we're through
But lover love me now as though
You really mean you'll always love me so

[Verse 4]
We've got love a go go
Let's not wonder why
Lover lover go go now
Love a love a go go now
Tomorrow our love may die

[Outro]
We've got love
Love a go go
We've got love
Love a go go
Did you say I've got a lot to learn
Well don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is a perfect spot to learn
Come on teach me tonight

Starting with the ABC of it (A, B, C)
Right down to the XYZ of it (X, Y, Z)
Help me solve the mystery of it
Whoa, I wanna be taught tonight

Because the sky's a blackboard high above me
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write, "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear my love, yeah
Should that teacher stand so near my love (ah ah yeah)
Graduation's almost here now love
Come on teach me tonight (ah ah yeah)

Hey now, come on fellas (come on fellas)
Ah ha ha yeah (teach me tonight)
Ah ah ah, yeah yeah yeah (Yeah yeah yeah)
Come on teach me tonight, yeah
'Cause the sky's a blackboard high above me
And if a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write, "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, Stevie
Should a teacher stand so near (oh no)
Graduation's almost here and I
I wanna be taught tonight

Hey, come on baby, yeah yeah yeah
Come one teach me tonight (yes I will)

Teach me (yeah)

[Verse]
You can bet you're sweeter than ever
And your love is making it better
I can feel it in my bones
Ooh, each time we're alone
I live in ecstasy
And my soul refuses sleep
'Cause joy, joy, joy takes over me
Through thick and thin I'll stay
Loving you always
Yes, I need you, mama
To take the heartaches away
I know the sun's gon' shine
As long as you're mine
'Cause joy, joy, joy, joy I feel inside

[Bridge]
Oh, oh yeah, oh

Your love's potion
Gives me the notion
To shout out loud, oh baby, baby, baby, baby
Like a spinning top
I can't stop
Ooh, loving you
You know Stevie loves you
Needs you baby, oh ah

[Harmonica solo]

[Outro]
Oh, you know my love is meant to live
And until the end
And I do believe, girl
You were meant for me
'Cause I live in ecstasy
And my soul refuses sleep
'Cause joy takes over me
Ooh baby joy
Joy, joy, joy, joy
Joy joy joy joy joy joy
The way you love me, joy, baby
Takes over me
Oh, the way you love me
The way you need me
Baby, please don't leave me
I get joy, ah, woo
Joy, ah, joy, ah, hey
There's a warm little home on a hill
And the presents that's hiding somewhere
And the world is so peaceful and still
You can almost hear love in the air
There's a blanket of snow on the ground
And a bright little star in the sky
And your heart knows that Santa is around
By the twinkle in everyone's eye

There's gift bringing and bells ringing
And warm little feet by the fire
There are kids playing and folks praying
And somewhere the sound of a choir

There's two people who never will part
And two stockings we still have to fill
There's a warm little place in my heart
For our warm little home on the hill

There is gift bringing and bells ringing
And warm little feet by the fire
There are kids playing and folks praying
And somewhere the sound of a choir
There's two people who never will part
And two stockings we still have to fill
There's a warm little place in my heart
For our warm little home on the hill
Forget your troubles, come on, get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Sing Hallelujah, come on, get happy
And get ready for the judgment day

The sun is shinin', come on, get happy
The Lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout Hallelujah, come on, get happy
We're going to the Promised Land

We're heading 'cross the river
Wash our sins away in the tide
It's all so peaceful
On the other side

Forget your troubles, come on, get happy
You'd better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
And get ready for the judgement day, yeah

[Instrumental break]
We're heading 'cross the river
Wash our sins away in the tide
It's all so peaceful
On the other side

Forget your troubles, come on, get happy
You'd better chase your cares away
Shout Hallelujah, come on, get happy
And get ready for the judgement day

[Verse 1]
They say your love will surely fade girl
When things go wrong and trouble calls
But they don't know that your sweet sunshine babe
Will never fade when darkness falls
They say that when the chips are down girl
Your love won't stay so long my friend
But they don't know that your sweet lovin' babe
Has been around through thick and thin

[Chorus]
And I'd be a fool right now
If I should hurt you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
If I should leave you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
If I wouldn't love you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
On the outside looking inside

[Verse 2]
They say your love is surely goin'
Just like a snowman in the sun
But they don't know that your sweet lovin' babe
Was here when all my friends were gone

[Chorus]
And I'd be a fool right now
If I should hurt you girl
Oh, such a fool right now
If I should leave you girl
Baby, baby, a fool right now
If I wouldn't love you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
On the outside lookin' inside

[Verse 3]
All my dreams would fall and crumble into dirt
If I walk away from you I'd be the one to hurt
One day my dreams were surely dying, dying, dying baby
Just like a flower without rain
They just don't know that your sweet sunshine babe
Made my life blossom again
And so the story goes around baby yeah y-yeah
That this is just a passing thing
But I believe in your sweet lovin', lovin'... babe
With every summer fallin' rain

[Chorus]
And I'd be a fool right now
If I should hurt you girl
Oh, such a fool right now
If I should leave you girl
I'd be a fool right now
If I wouldn't love you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
Oh, hey!
And I'd be a fool right now
If I should hurt you girl
Oh, such a fool right now
If I should leave you girl
Baby, baby, a fool right now

[Verse 1]
In life we have our pains and sorrows
Face mountains we think we can't climb
Not thinking there's always tomorrow
You feel like giving up
You say you're out of luck
But then you hear a voice in your mind
Telling you to

[Chorus]
Hold on to your dream
'Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a father to his son
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you
Hold on to your dream
'Til the day that life is said and done

[Verse 2]
This world is filled with peaks and valleys
With rivers we think we can't cross
Too busy keeping sorrows telling
You say you're at you're end
You say you never win
But then a light comes on in your mind telling you to

[Chorus]
Hold on to your dream
'Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a father to his son
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you
Hold on to your dream
Until the day that life is said and done

[Bridge]
If you wanna hold on to something
You better hold on to your dreams
If you want to hold on to something
You better hold to your love
To your love

[Verse 3]
So if they try to burst your bubble
It's 'cause they have none of their own
And when you feel you are in trouble
Hold your head up high
And feel your heart inside
And know that you are never alone
Just as long as you

[Chorus]
Hold on to your dream
'Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a father to his son
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you
Hold on to your dream
Until the day that life is said and done
Hold on to your dream
'Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a mother to her child
Don't let anyone ever steal your dreams from you
Hold on to your dream
And do your best to always wear a smile

[Outro]
(I love you, papa)
Hold on to your dream

Fade

[Verse 1]
My outer self looks happy as can be
A perfect dream, love as clear as all can see
But just like that, real has hit me suddenly
My outer is a liar

[Chorus]
'Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me
Loud and clear my soul cries out with total honesty
I need the fire, fire, fire
To keep me warm, I got to feel the fire

[Verse 2]
My smiling face with laughter on the side
You'd say no doubt I get passion every night
But if in our bed your arms don't hold me tight
Means it leaves much to be desired

[Chorus]
'Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me
Loud and clear my soul cries out with total honesty
I need the fire, fire, fire
To keep me warm, I got to feel the fire
And if you look into my eyes
And you told yourself the truth
You can't make a body hot if you don't light the fuse
I need your fire, fire, fire
To keep me warm, I got to feel the fire

[Bridge]
It don't take a rocket scientist to know
That if you don't fan the flame then the fire will eventually go

[Chorus]
'Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me
Loud and clear my soul cries out with total honesty
I need the fire, fire, fire
To keep me warm, I got to feel the fire
'Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me
Loud and clear my soul cries out with total honesty
I need your fire, fire, fire
To keep me warm, I got to feel the fire

[Outro]
I need the fire, fire, fire
To keep me warm, I got to feel the fire
To keep me warm, I've got to feel the fire
Angel, a pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel

Wish you knew just how I felt about you
Wish you felt the same way as I do
I can bring you love if you just open up your heart
Little girl, I'm so in love with you

If you ever tell me that you love me
If you ever show me that you care
I will be so proud to have you standing by my side
Little girl, I'm so in love with you

We'll be so happy together
We'll build a heaven of our own
And darling, if you just play your part
And let me steal your heart
I know I'll have your love forever

Angel, for your love I've been praying
Hoping someday you will look my way
I can make you mine if you just open up your eyes
Little girl, I'm so in love with you
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
Oh my
A pretty little angel
My, my, my
A pretty little angel

[Verse 1]
I was sittin' in my classroom the other day
Playin' my harmonica in a mellow way
Some teachers seemed to have gathered around
Tryin' to figure out what I was puttin' down
I call it pretty music
But the old people call it the blues

[Break]
Ain't that pretty 

[?]

[Verse 2]
They were lookin' at me sittin' there all alone
Mumblin' to each other in a real low town
I couldn't figure out what they was sayin'
They couldn't understand what I was playin'
Well, I call it pretty music
But the old people call it the blues

[Break]
Ain't that pretty 

[?]

[Refrain]
Well, I call it pretty music
But the old people call it the blues, ooh yeah
I call it pretty music
But the old people call it the blues

[Intro]
Ow...

[Verse 1]
Tossing and turning all night long
My girl is gone, can't take it
I'm trying to conceal the loneliness I feel
But it's real, can't fake it
The pain in my heart is tearing me apart
Her memory, can't shake it
I tried to tell myself to find somebody else
But my heart, won't make it

[Chorus]
Ah ah, I need love and that's a natural fact
And more than anything I want my baby back
(I want my baby back)
I want her here with me
(I want my baby back)
(I want my baby back)

[Verse 2]
She's the only girl that brightens up my world
What can I say, don't make her do it
She's fine as can be and was so good to me
I had a good thing, and I blew it
Now I'm all alone, the love we had is gone
What can I do, to renew it
If I only had a chance to continue our romance
I wouldn't hestiate, to get to it

[Chorus]
Ah ah, I need love and that's a natural fact
And more than anything I want my sugar back
(I want my baby back)
I want her here with me
(I want my baby back)
Ah ah ah, ah ah yeah
(I, want my baby back)

[Outro]
Ah ah ah, ah ah I need love and that's a natural fact
And more than anything I want my baby back
(I want my baby back)
I want her here with me
(I want my baby back)
Ah ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah I, want my baby back
My heart is aching, think it's breaking
Ah ah, ah ah I want my baby back
My world is lonely, need her only
Everybody sing I want my baby back now
(I want my baby back)
Ha ha ha, ha ha I, want my baby back...
My love is warmer than a smile
My love gives to every needing child
If anyone should ask you who's my true love
Tell them my love true
Is ever letting all their love come through
My love sees love with not a face
And lives to love through time and space
If all of everything about my love
Fits to the tune of you
Then you can say that you are my love too

(1st chorus)
Let my love shine through out the world
To every mountain top and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
'Til love's all over
Let it reach out to every heart
To every disenfranchised people
'Til it is present and no more
Is pain all over
Our love sees love's the key to peace
We'll pray 'til all world wars have ceased
Should you or anyone you know enough
To say they feel as we
Then let our universal song be free
(2nd chorus)
Let our love shine through out the world
To every mountain top and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
'Til love's all over
Say words of love to all we see
To rich and poor for love is equal
Let us lift up humanity
Spread love all over
Let all its forces join as one
So to rebuke all signs of evil
Through every valley, land and sea
Our love's all people
Get your hat and get your coat
And leave your worries on the doorstep
Yeah, just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street

Can't you hear, oh, that pitter pat
Each happy step is your step
You know, life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With my blues, blues, blues, blues, blues on parade
But I'm not afraid, no no, I'm not afraid
Head over, cross over

If I never had a cent
I'd be as rich as Rockefeller
With gold dust all around my feet
On the sunny side of the street

[Harmonica solo]
I used to walk in the shade
With my blues, blues, blues, blues on parade
But I'm not afraid, no no, I'm not afraid
Head over, cross over, oh

But if I never, never, never, never, never had a cent
Now I'd be rich as Rockefeller
With gold dust all around my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Yeah, on the sunny, sunny side of the street
Yeah, you better move on over on the other side
Hey, now on the sunny, sunny, sunny side of the street
Yeah, on the sunny, sunny side of the street

[Intro]
Hey

[Chorus]
Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
Nothing's too good for my baby
Oh, no (Nothing's too good for my girl)

[Verse 1]
I'm the luckiest guy in the world
'Cause I've got one pearl of a girl
For my baby I work part-time
Down at the neighborhood five-and-dime
Half of my money goes to buy her
Some of the things her little heart desires
The other half goes dime by dime
To show my cookie a real good time, because

[Chorus]
Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
Nothing's too good for my baby
Oh, no (Nothing's too good for my girl)

[Verse 2]
She's sweet and she's kind
And she tells me that she's mine all mine, now
Ain't that lovin', ain't that livin'
Ain't that half the fun of givin'

[Chorus]
Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
Nothing's too good for my baby
Oh, no (Nothing's too good for my girl)

[Verse 3]
I walk around with my chest stuck out
'Cause my baby's worth bragging about
Every Johnnie, Jack, and Jim
Wished that she belonged to him
I gave up the old gang of mine
'Cause with my girl goes all my time
One of these days I'm gonna buy a ring
And marry her and everything, 'cause

[Chorus]
Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
Nothing's too good for my baby
Oh, no (Nothing's too good for my girl)

[Verse 4]
She's sweet and she's mellow
And she tells me that I'm one heck of a fellow, now
Ain't that lovin', ain't that livin'
Ain't that half the fun of givin'

[Outro]
Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
(Nothing's too good for my baby)
She's all right and out of sight
And I love her ah-ha-ha, yeah ah-ah-ha-ha-ha ha
(Nothing's too good for my girl)
Ah-ha-ha yeah, I'm gonna get her a diamond ring, everything

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Oh baby

[Verse 1]
You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Hey girl, you know you couldn't get much higher

[Chorus]
Hey, come on baby, light my fire
Come baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

[Verse 2]
Whoa, the time to hesitate is through
There's no time to wallow in the mire
If we try now we can only lose
And our love may come a funeral pyre

[Chorus]
Hey, come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire, yeah
Try to set the night on fire

Oh baby, ah

[Harmonica solo]

[Chorus]
Hey, come on baby, light my fire
Oh baby, come on baby, light my fire, woo
Try to set the night on fire
Yeah baby, woo, oh baby

[Verse 3]
Know that it would be untrue
And you know that I would be a liar
Don't live it but what I'm sayin' to you
Hey baby, we couldn't get much higher

[Chorus]
Hey, come on baby, light my fire, hey
Come on baby, light my fire, baby, yeah baby
Try to set the night on fire
Yeah, woo, oh baby

[Harmonica solo]

[Chorus]
Hey, come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire, baby, hey
Try to set the night on fire, ow
Aw baby, baby

[Harmonica solo]

[Intro dialogue]
- Mommy, it's so cold, it's like I'm freezing ice
- Okay, you get under the covers, and I'll tell you a bedtime story, and maybe that'll warm you up, okay?
- Okay
- You comfortable?
- Yes
- Alright. Once upon a time, not too long ago, there was a garden, where children from all over the world came to play and laugh, and they lived together there. And each morning, a big yellow sun would shine over the horizon on the sleeping children, and a bright blue robin would start singing in the trees so happy that all the children would awaken and rub their eyes and stretch. Now, in this garden, there were big beautiful fruit trees with big brown limbs...

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
Hey
I ain't gotta worry no more, no

[Verse 1]
At last, my love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh baby, at last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

[Bridge]
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

[Verse 2]
Hey, you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
'Cause you're mine at last
Woo baby, yeah, woo

[Harmonica Solo]

[Bridge]
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheeks to
A thrill that I have never known

[Verse 3]
Hey, you smiled
And then the spell was cast
Here we are in heaven
And you're mine at last
Woo

[Harmonica Solo]

[Outro]
Woo, ow, whoa

[Chorus]
Sugar, Sugar
How I wanna be your main boy
Sugar, Sugar

[Verse 1]
Got no time for every woman
Thinking that she's looking fine
Got no pockets full of money, no, no, no
A fox would just be wasting her time

[Pre-Chorus]
All I got is good, good lovin'
Yeah, good loving is hard to find, hey

[Chorus]
Sugar, Sugar
How I wanna be your main boy
Sugar, Sugar

Got no need to walk the line

And some sugar after supper time, hey

Old pirates, yes, they rob I;
Sold I to the merchant ships--
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the 'and of the Almighty
We fought in this generation
Triumphantly
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom? --
'Cause all I ever have:
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery;
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look? Oooh!
Some say it's just a part of it:
We've got to fulfill the book
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom? -
'Cause all I ever have:
Redemption song
Redemption song
Redemption song

EMANCIPATE yourselves from mental slavery;
None but ourselves can free our mind
WoAH! Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them-a can-a stop-a the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Yes, some say it's just a part of it:
We've got to fulfill the book
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom? --
'Cause all I ever had:
Redemption songs --
All I ever had:
Redemption songs...
These songs of freedom
Songs of freedom

[Verse 1]
I was drifting from day to day
Like a child that's lost his way
In a great big world
Then a miracle happened by
When you happened into my life
And said you love me
All around me the world was cold
Then you tenderly touched my soul
With your sunshine girl

[Chorus]
And my future you gave it birth
And my living you gave it worth
Little Angie
Cause I love you, Angie girl
I love you
Yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true
Oh, ho, ho

[Verse 2]
When I'm feelin' my faith is gone
You're my reason for going on
Through another day
'Cause the tender times that we share
Truly show me that you care about me
Whenever life makes you cry
Just remember I'm standing by
To lead the way
And together we'll never fall

[Chorus]
Together we'll conquer all
Little Angie
Cause I love you, Angie girl
I love you
Yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true

'Cause I love you, Angie girl
I love you
Yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true
Darling, I love you
Oh, so long for this night I've prayed
That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Well, a ribbon's in the sky for our love
If allowed, may I touch your hand
And if pleased, may I once again
So that you too will understand
That there's a ribbon in the sky for our love
This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what it is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love
We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry
From now on, it will be you and I
And our ribbon in the sky, ribbon in the sky
Ribbon in the sky for our love
There, there's a ribbon in the sky
There's a ribbon in the sky
There's a ribbon in the sky
A ribbon in the sky
There's a ribbon in the sky
There's a ribbon in the sky
There's a ribbon in the sky
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love
Ribbon in the sky for our love

[Verse 1]
Something deep inside of me
Keeps me moving aimlessly
Always been, I'll always be
A lonely travelin' man
Something that I can't explain
Holding me from wind and rain
Wild and free and hard to tame
A lonely travelin' man

[Chorus]
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man
Got no goal got no plan
Just an old worn out heart in my hand
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man
I'll get there anyway I can
I'm just an uninspiring tired out travelin' man

[Verse 2]
Please don't ask me where I've been
I've been alone through thick and thin
On the outside looking in
A lonely travelin' man
Something that I haven't found
Keeps me seeking all around
Moving on from town to town
A lonely travelin' man

[Chorus]
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man
Got no goal got no plan
Just an old worn out heart in my hand
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man
I'll get there anyway I can
I'm just an uninspiring tired out travelin' man
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man
Got no goal got no plan
Just an old worn out heart in my hand
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man
I'll get there anyway I can
I'm just an uninspiring tired out..

[Verse 1]
I'd sing you a song, without a word
Still you would hear my tune
I'd give you a day, without a time
So it won't end too soon

[Chorus]
Anything, I would do
And that really is my point of view
If ever, my darling, in my life
I ever had a chance to love you

[Verse 2]
I'd build you a world, made of the dreams
That dances in your head
Take a rainbow, with colors bright
To hang over your bed

[Chorus]
Anything, I would do
And that really is my point of view
If ever, my darling, in my life
I ever had a chance to love you

[Bridge]
Fate's been waiting for the right time
To put us in each other's arms
But why should we sit and waste time
To start right now would do no harm

[Verse 3]
Give me a sign and I will show you
The magic of which I speak
Open your heart, let me come in
My love is yours to keep

[Chorus]
Anything, I would do
And that really is my point of view
If ever, my darling, in my life
I ever had a chance to love you
Ooh, oh, if ever I had a chance to love you

[Outro]
I'd sing you a song, without a word
If ever I had a chance to love you
I'd give you a day, without a time
If ever I had a chance to love you
I'd take a rainbow, with colors bright
If ever I had the chance to love you
I'd sing you a song, without a word
Oh, if ever I had a chance to love you
I'd give you a day, without a time
If I, if I, if I had a chance to love you
I'd build you a world, made of the dreams
That dance in your head
If ever I had a chance to love you
Never needed a wishing well to make my happy with my baby
Never needed a magic spell to start me thinking someday maybe
I'll build a house of gingerbread someday
And bring my sugar cookie home to stay 'cause

Ain't no lovin like my baby's
Ain't no lovin like my baby's love
Ain't no lovin like my baby's

She's the girl that I am dreaming of
Oh, my Angel Love can't stop dreaming of
How it's gonna be
It's gonna be for Angel Love and me
Goin' down to the wishing well
Cause that's where I'm gonna meet my baby

Mr Moon mixed a magic spell
He's telling me that I better hurry
To find the girl beneath the willow tree
And run and take my baby home with me 'cause
Ain't no lovin like my baby's
Ain't no lovin like my sugar's love
Ain't no lovin like my baby's

She's the girl that I am dreaming of
Ain't no love (ain't no love)
Ain't no love (ain't no love)
Ain't no love (hey) Hoo, hooo
Ain't no love (ain't no love)
Ain't no love (ain't no love)

Never, never, never, never, never ha, ha

[repeat and fade]
Spoken by SW:
"When you say that you kill in the name of God or in the name of Allah
You are truly cursing God, for that is not of God
When you say that you hate in the name of God or Allah
You are lying to God, for that is not of our Father
Let us pray that we see the light."

[Verse 1]
I love you
But I've been away from you so long
God take me back to where I belong, baby
I'll do what you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to do
I'll do anything

[Verse 2]
I want you
I never needed you so bad
Why do you feel like making me so sad?
Girl, I'll do whatever you want me to
I'll do what you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to do

[Bridge]
Love's the thing that's made us happy
Love's the thing that's made us sad
If we don't get back together
We might lose our romance
Might not get a second chance

[Verse 3]
I love you
And I wanna be your man
If you tell me that I can, baby
You know I'll do whatever you want me to
I'll do what you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to do

[Bridge]
Love's the thing that's made us happy
And love's the thing that's made us sad
If we don't get back together
We might lose our romance
Might not get a second chance

[Outro]
I love you
And I wanna be your man
If you tell me that I can, baby
I'll do whatever you mant me to
I'll do what you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to do
I'll do what you want me to
I'll do what you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to do
Oh, everything you want me to
I'll do what you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to do
Every every every every every every every every every
I'll do what you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to do
Everything, everything you want me to do
I'll do what you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to do
Oh yeah, I'll do what you want me to do
Smile though your heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find the sun come shining through for you

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

Light up your face with gladness
And hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
Now that's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
Smile, you smile
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard sleeping tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although It's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
Woo!

Girl, I've been crying ever since you left
My mama told me, "Get a hold of yourself"
And be cool, calm and keep yourself together
She said be cool, calm and keep yourself together, ha ha ha, ha

Sugar plum, you're really gold
And it just don't help to cry
So I wiped my tears away the other day
And hung my handkerchief up to dry
Then I changed my style, puttin' on a smile
And went out to face the world
The smile I wear see, ha, I don't care that I just lost my girl
But I still get that old yearnin'
Can't be cool when my heart is burnin'
I still get that old feelin'
Can't be calm when my head is reelin'

I say mother dear, see here, see here
Tell me now what shall I do
Can't have that girl and I love her true
She said when things get rough, be man enough
To be cool, calm, and keep yourself together
That's what my mama said
Be cool, calm, and keep yourself together, ha ha

Sugar pie, you said goodbye
And I cried myself to sleep
That's when my mother said, "Don't lose your head, son
It just don't help to weep"
Now I'm the great pretender
I don't surrender to what I feel inside
I'm the life of the crowd, and ha, I laugh out loud
But it's all a fake disguise
'Cause I still hear my heart poundin'
Hard to be cool when you come around me
I still feel my heart purrin'
Hard to be calm when my insides stirrin'

I say mother dear, see here, see here
Tell me now which way to go
Can't have that girl and I love her so
She said, whenever you're blue, whatever you do

Be cool, calm, and keep yourself together
That's what my mama said
Be cool, calm, and keep yourself together

[Verse 1]
Once upon the blood of many
We were cast as less than any
To so much a point some still believe
Smaller scene, a world much bigger
Where it's okay to play with the word "nigga"
Yet would we knowing all the grief and death it breeds

[Chorus]
But that was some years ago
When we had more hope than money
A time and a world ago
When our hearts were made of steel
Back then it was all about
Stamping all the hatred out
So that now there would be no doubt
Who wouldn't have to heal
But why if so long ago
We're seen safe only when funny
As if there's no need to show
Deep inside what we really feel
Yet those things when brought to view
Seem to bother but a few
Know if we don't come for real
Our wounds won't heal

[Verse 2]
Black silhouettes used as target practice
There's Darkie Toothpaste borne out of this malice
These stereotypical images come to mind
Figurines, mascots, postcards of us hanging
Most recent here, of one of us dragging
The propaganda machine must tell the truth
This time stop lying

[Chorus]
But that was some years ago
When we had more hope than money
A time and a world ago
When our hearts were made of steel
Back then it was all about
Stamping all the hatred out
So that now there would be no doubt
Who wouldn't have to heal
But why if so long ago
We're seen safe only when funny
As if there's no need to show
Deep inside what we really feel
Yet those things when brought to view
Seem to bother but a few
Know if we don't come for real
Our wounds won't heal
Oh, but that was some years ago
When we had more hope than money
A time and a world ago
When our hearts were made of steel
Back then it was all about
Stamping all the hatred out
So that now there would be no doubt
Who wouldn't have to heal
Oh, what if so long ago
We're seen safe only when funny
As if there's no need to show
Deep inside what we really feel
Yet those things when brought to view
Seem to bother but a few
Know if we don't come for real
Our wounds won't heal

[Outro]
Know if we don't come for real
Our wounds won't heal

[Verse 1]
Oh yellow moon you make me think of home
Down in Arkansas where I was raised and born
Oh muddy street where I used to play
I think of leaving here and coming home one day

[Chorus]
Somebody knows, somebody cares
This dream of mine my baby shares

[Verse 2]
Deep in her heart though she won't tell me so
There's something troublin' her
And I know I know
She dreams of rocky hills
Pretty little corn fields
And sitting 'round that mighty oak
Talking to those friendly folks

[Chorus]
Somebody knows, somebody cares
This dream of hers, oh yeah
My little heart shares

[Bridge]
One of these days
I'm gonna take my own two hands
Build us a cottage
On that old southern land

[Chorus]
Somebody knows, somebody cares
This dream of mine my baby shares

[Verse 3]
I'm coming back, oh yeah
Back to old Little Rock, hey
I'm coming home yeah yeah
Back to that old Little Rock, ha
Gonna stay there, yeah
Ain't going nowhere

[Chorus]
Somebody knows, somebody cares
This dream of mine my baby shares
Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to her arms I'd go sailing

It's far beyond the star
It's still beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing...
Would you like to go with me
Down my dead end street
Would you like to come with me
To village ghetto land
See the people lock their doors
While robbers laugh and steal
Beggars watch and eat their meals
From garbage cans
Broken glass is everywhere
It's a bloody scene
Killing plagues the citizens
Unless they own police
Children play with rusted cars
Sores cover their hands
Politicians laugh and drink
Drunk to all demands
Families buying dog food now
Starvation roams the streets
Babies die before they're born
Infected by the grief
Now some folks say that we should be
Glad for what we have
Tell me would you be happy
Still in 1995 livin' in village ghetto land
Village ghetto land
Why don't we take a little piece of summer sky
Hang it on a tree
For that's the way to start to make a pretty world
For you and for me

And for the sun we'll find a lemon bright balloon
You can hold the string
Oh don't you know that little world of ours will be
The prettiest thing

We can have rain enough for the stream
To hold our happy faces
When we want a breeze, I'll blow you a kiss or two
Take me in your arms and our little world
Will be the place of places
Nothing left to make but breakfast and love

We'll hang a little sign that just says Paradise
Population two
And we together can make a pretty world
For me and for you
For you
It's what I wanted to do for you
To make a world – with you!

[Intro]
Yeah, ah

[Verse 1]
Ah the language of music Is known around the world
It's the language that's understood by people everywhere
(Yes everywhere)
Soon you'll hear the trumpets begin to blow
Ah listen to the trombones playing way down low
Well everybody seems to be playing
With a lot of soul
Fellas do you mind if I join in and play along

Everybody yeah

[Bridge]
Just a little bit of drum

[Verse 2]
Ahh I think the drummer has found a new groove
Listen close and you will hear the saxophones move
If you're feelin' what you hearing well don't you know
Yeah, ah it's just the music that friendly music talking to your soul
It can make you blue or make you feel so glad
It's best way of talking that man has ever had
Everybody around the world sing with me now

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Once upon a Christmas Eve
A shepherd who believed
That peace could come to any man
Made a promise to the star above
The day that love began

[Verse 1]
I will give to him my lamb
A shepherd's all I am
And so he walked the lonely sand
To find the place his heart was dreaming of
The day that love began

[Bridge]
Over meadows, over mountains
They came from valleys and from streams
Every poet and every king
And one little shepherd with a dream

[Verse 2]
But as the shepherd knelt to pray
His lamb just ran away
And tear drops filled his empty hand
He broke his promise to a star above
The day that love began

[Bridge]
Then the smiling face of Mary
Beckoned the shepherd to her side
Today, you gave Him the best gift of all
The moment that you cried

[Chorus]
Oh, once upon a Christmas Eve
A shepherd who believed
That peace could come to an-any man
Found the place his heart was dreaming of
And he kept his promise to a star above
The day that love began, mmm, mmm-hmm

[Intro]
Ooh baby
Yeah, yeah, ooh baby
My sweet baby
Ha, ha
Yeah

You and me, eternally
You and me, we're a reality
Piece of mind others are searching for
End of the vine, we had it all the time

So in love that's how we live
Never take, darling, we always give
Happiness is every day
But it never would be if it wasn't for you lovin' me
I was lost, like a rolling stone I had to roll
As if I knew, in time I'd find my way to you
Here I am in a paradise that's built for two
It's good enough for me, it's good enough for you, ah
You and me, eternally
You and me, we're a reality
Piece of mind others are searhcing for
End of the vine, we had it all the time

One more thing I wanna say
I'll sacrifice day and night, to keep me that wife
One more thing I forgot to say
I'm blessed the day I found you 'cause I build my world around you, ah

You and me, eternally
You and me, we're a reality
Piece of mind others are searching for
End of the vine, we had it all the time

Hey, so in love that's how we live
Never take, darling, we always give
Happiness is every single day
But it never would be, baby, if it wasn't for you lovin' me

[Harmonica]

You and me, eternally
You and me, we're a reality
Piece of mind others are searhcing for
End of the vine, we had it all the time
I want to walk you home
Please let me walk you home
I want to walk you home
Please let me walk you home

You look so good to me
Ooh ooh wee
I wish I was the lucky guy
Who could walk you right on down the aisle

I love the way you walk
I love to hear you talk
I love the way you walk
I love to hear you talk

I'm not trying to be smart
I'm not trying to break your heart
But if I ask you for a date
Will you tell me that I'm not too late

I want to hold your hand
Please let me hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
Yeah, please let me hold your
You look so good to me
Ooh ooh wee
I saw you walking all alone
That's why I wanna walk you home

So let me walk you home
Please let me walk you home
I wanna walk you home
Oh baby, let me walk you home

Well, you look so good to me
Ooh ooh wee
I'm not trying to be smart
And I love the way you talk
I wanna hold your hand
So let me hold your hand
And let me walk you home
Oh babe, I want to walk you home

Oh, you look so good to me baby
All I want to do is walk you home
Let me walk you home, baby
Yeah, we could walk and talk
Uh hmm, I'm not tryin' to be smart
I just wanna walk you home

[** feat. Drake, Rick Ross & Lil Wayne:]
(Get em on)*
I’m on one
(Get em on)
I’m on one
(Get em on)
I said I’m on one

[Drake:]
I’m getting so throwed
I ain't work this hard since I was 18
Apologise if I say, anything I don’t mean
Like whats up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And whats up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy
But get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot with a little more cash than I already got
Trippin off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient, me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumours, hate the bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations, I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it!

[Chorus: ~Drake~]
All I care about is money and the city that I’m from
I’ma sip until I feel it, I’ma smoke it till it’s done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one
Yeah, fuck it, I’m on one
Yeah, I said I’m on one
Fuck it, I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, never get that shit
Cause I’m on one
I said fuck it I’m on one

[Rick Ross]
I’m burning purple flowers
It’s burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognise the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (BOSS)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I out on bond I might be facin’ 8′s
Still running with the same niggas til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it’s double M G until I get the chair

[Drake - Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I’m a made nigga
I should dust something
You niggas on the bench
Like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the swishas
I’m focused might aswell say cheese for the pictures
Ohhh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like Mayans
This a celebration bitches, Mazel Tov
It’s a slim chance I fall, Olive Oyl
Tunechi be the name, don’t ask me how I got it
I’m killin’ these hoes I swear I’m tryna stop the violence

[Chorus]

Got my headphones on and I'm under

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Because I Grab The Microphone And I Pick It Up
And Then I Fuck It Up And Then I Turn It In
And Then I Turn It Out, Got The Body Rockin' Sound
And Then You Know I'm Gonna Get Down And
Eat A Scooby Snack And Take Disco Nap
Because I'm Shopping At Sears, Cause I Don't Buy At The Gap
Sending This One Out To All The Funky Inspirations
Pretty Purdie On The Drums With The Beat Relations
Well, I'm Working On Rhymes, They're Coming Line By Line
Trying To Put What I Feel Into Word And Rhymes
I've Got A Feeling Coming On, I've Got To Make Some Shit
A Little Something Stupid, For The Twisted And Sick
Because I Drive Like A Maniac On The Streets
And I Don't Give Fuck Cause I've Got The Beats
Got My Nuts Swingin' From Left To Right And
Right To Left And I'm Death Defying

(Chorus)
I Spin My Fortune On A Wheel Like Sajak
Here's The Payback Keep Going Strong Like Since The Way Back
I Try To Be Myself But I Lose Track
Cause The Shit Gets Complicated Now I've Got To Get Back
As We Learn To Breed Love For One Another
In These Times Of Melding Cultures
I Give Respect For What's Been Borrowed And Lent
I Know This Music Comes Down From African Descent
Because I Don't Need A Magic Potion
Let Me Talk About Back Field In Motion
My Girls Got Cheeks For Weeks And I'm Happy
You Know I'm A Sneak Like My Old Grand Pappy
I Gotta Give Thanks To My Man Archie Sheep
For Staying True To Inspiration And I Don't Half Step
So I Kick Out The Jams And Tell You Who I Am
And I Talk To The People Like Les Mccann
(Chorus)
I Ask God For A Rhyme Or Two
A Little Something For The Wise As Well As The Fool
A Little Something To Affect A Little Taste Of Change
For The Together And The Strong As Well As the Dearanged
I'll Do You Right Like Bobby Knight
And Then I'm Rapping On The Mic To The Broadway Light
Stomp My Hands, I Clap My Feet And
I'm Bugging Off Yusef Lateef
I Got A Match To My Ass And I'm A Keep It Lit
I Need To Get Some Cash, Call My Accountant Britt
I'm Rushing Around Town Taking Care Of My Functions
Always Got One More Thing So Forget About Function
We Create This World And The Problems Go On
Create Our Lives And The Things That Gor Wrong
So To The Deaf, The Blind, Look Around And Listen
To What It Is You Want And For What You're Wishing

(Chorus)
Dear Alex and Marilyn
The Lovely and Thurston howlin'
The grasshopper unit is prowlin'
And Rufus is back home growlin'

For all of y'all that be dozin'
On Hornblower's lederhosen
Like Walt Disney, he is frozen
And in the Swiss Hall of Fame he goes in

'Cause when he's out in space carousin'
Pick up my mic and start joustin'
My name plate medallion
Says never trust a Hal 9000

Check the horizontal hold and check the tint
Are these three fools back at it again?
Inspector Clouseau and Derek Flint
Nothin but sparks ignitin'

Check two one two mic testin'
This one goes out to Dechen
Rise fallen fighters take your stance again
Don't think too much about the color of skin
Order in vegetarian sharks fin
Try to keep my life non-violent
Mario, rewind the tape and punch me in
Like Chuck D with the where you never been I'm in

I'm a long way from where I've been
But I gotta keep movin', movin' on

Ooh my my I'm really not feeling it
Ooh my my something's really wrong

The p.a. sound is deafenin'
Bitin MCs I'm oustinin'
With spinach in your teeth you're grinnin'
So on your way out please take a mint

Got the studio to throw a craze in
The basslines Yauch just lays in
This song is the grass you're grazin'
Just add a little flange and phase in

Don't get mad 'cause I'm beguilin'
I'm off the hook so don't bother dialin'
They're gonna put me in the b.i.n
And if I die notify the next of kin
It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all

Movin' on
Kick it!

You wake up late for school, man, you don't wanna go
You ask your mom, "Please?" but she still says "No!"
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kinda jerk

You gotta fight
For your right
To party

Your pop's caught you smokin', man, and he says "No way."
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, livin' at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag
Busted!

You gotta fight
For your right
To party
You gotta fight

Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said "What's that noise?"
Aw, mom, you're just jealous, it's the Beastie Boys

You gotta fight
For your right
To party
You gotta fight
For your right
To party

Party
Party
To the, to the, to the people up top!

[Verse 1: Mike D]
Bam! God damn!
Holy mackerel, pulling suckers' cards out the satchel
You can sleep tonight, it's OK
B Boys in the cut and we're here to stay

[Verse 2: MCA]
Vibration, sensation
Chatter up on the mic and it's an incantation
Revelation, elation
A little patience with the tribulations

[Verse 3: Ad-Rock]
Heed my flow, I got more in store
Rhymes are not just for breakfast any more
Always on vacation, like Clark and Rusty
Don't wanna make the beer fest, trust me

[Hook]
Boys in the cut, cu-cut
And we here, here, here to stay

[Verse 4: MCA]
Your wack style is beyond a pale
Heel up, wheel up, to the one Judge Smails
Come at me with rain, I'm coming back with hail
My broad sword will cut through your chain mail

Back up, Mike

[Verse 5: Mike D]
Well, Ad-Rock, one of the greatest of all time, no disrespect
I gotta go for mine
Big Mike D, up here spitting lead paint
Bringing it back, begin da oh-ah-oh-ah

[Verse 6: Ad-Rock]
A-D-R-O-C-K spells relief
There's holes in my story like Leon Spinks' teeth
Good grief, the middle name's Keefe
I keep a microphone in a little, weird sheath

[Hook]
Boys in the cut, cu-cut
And we here, here, here to stay

[Verse 7: Mike D]
I'm like Oscar the Grouch, trashy
Rockin' Derelicte, flashy
I keep it raw y'all
Just imagine the 42nd Street C train bathroom

[Verse 8: MCA]
I sizzle on the mic like a battered fried fish
Pundits in the house say -- WHOOP! -- that's rich!
This is the type of shit that's gonna scratch that itch
Now I'm-a set it off from up inside this bitch

[Verse 9: Mike D]
I see you're looking at me and thinking 'What him do?'
Well, I rap upon this mic, Mike D, Sweet Lou
Also known as Pretty Lou, a-k-a Pretty Mike
I switch up my name pretty much how I like


This routine dates way back
A lot of people may remember this routine
But it's evolved now
Yeah, from the summer before last

[Outro: Mike D, Ad-Rock, MCA]
Well, my name is Mike D, and I gotta new name, and that new name is LARRY!
Well, my name is Ad-Rock, and then I gotta new name, and my new name is HARRY!
Well, my name is MCA, but I gotta new name, and that new name is GARY!
Well, our DJ's name has stayed the same, cause his new name is BARRY!
Yes, yes, yes

Ill out the gate, I set it off
I suppose you're exposed, so get lost
You break off, cut all connections
Join the sucker emcee witness protection

Muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-MIKE D!
Slip off my lows in the place to be
Always on time so I never botch
The tick to the tock of the Mike D watch

Now here's a little somethin for ya
I'ma grab a little and store yah
Do some balancin' for ya
And if you feelin' chilly I'ma get you a shawl

Get ready, get set (get set, get set)
Place your bet (your bet, your bet)
What you get (you get, you get)
Cause I ain't done yet, done yet, done yet
Get ready, get set (get set, get set)
Place your bet (your bet, your bet)
What you get (you get, you get)
Here's a little somethin for ya

Honest Mike, what? Honest Mike D
Don't really get in the press like Z
Cause I speak my conscience and speak my mind
Don't trip and flip and then I stop to find

Queens up front, Brooklyn's in the back
Laugh and crack guns while squads smokin' crack
The odds are stacked for those who lack
Been a lucky motherfucker when it comes to that

I slow roast, I'm steady tappin'
Oh yes, I guess I'm the toast of Manhattan
In Miami, I'm sleazy with John Salley
Shout to Andre, Lee on Tally

Get ready, get set (get set, get set)
Place your bet (your bet, your bet)
What you get (you get, you get)
Cause I ain't done yet, done yet, done yet

Get ready, get set (get set, get set)
Place your bet (your bet, your bet)
What you get (you get, you get)
Here's a little somethin for ya
This shit is crazy
This shit is cra-zyyyy! (DING)

Dr. Karl to proceed, a/k/a Jewish
Dr. Bombay is the ladies choice
Step on stage so we smoke and dry moist
Every time I bring it twoice as noice

Now he's a breddern, take an Excedrin
Aldermen check your rhymers Tippy Hedrin
I'm undefined, I'm gettin much finer
Steady loungin in my La-Z-Boy recliner

Bruisin' and jabbin', amped up on coffee
Like kids goin wild at the sight of Mr. Softee
I smash around the corner (GASP) and sneakin up
When you're breathin down your neck (GASP) just keepin up

Get ready, get set (get set, get set)
Place your bet (your bet, your bet)
What you get (you get, you get)
Cause I ain't done yet, done yet, done yet

Get ready, get set (get set, get set)
Place your bet (your bet, your bet)
What you get (you get, you get)
Here's a little somethin for ya
There weren't no rhymin' at the beginning right there

Ahh yeah, I'm just gonna bring them in like an introduction
I gotcha, I gotcha super Mario. Mario... Mario

Ahhhhright y'all, comin' to you with full force
Yo, I'm not on the sauce
But we gonna do it a little something like this

Never trust a HAL-9000
When it comes to fire, I'm dousin'
Pick up your mic and start joustin'
Prayin' mantis style, not Shaolin

I don't want the capers, I'm frownin'
Order in vegertarian shark's fin
Throwin' chrome-domes in a tail spin
'Cause I don't drink scotch and I don't drink gin

When it comes to books with rhymes within
Packed like sardines in a tin
Tight-ass parties I'm roustin'
Karate-chop some round-housin'
Ahh, that was Mario's fault!

(Beatboxing)
Shall we try it one time?
Mikey?

Shall we start on the one, or in the middle of the bar?
No, start on the one
Okay

Is that right?
For me, that was too, was that too quick, or?
It might have been right, I might have space
Let's just try it from the top again and see what happens
"C'mon"
"Let's try to negotiate"
"And let's try to negotiate"
"And let's try to negotiate"
"And let's try to negotiate"
"And let's try to negotiate"
"And let's try to negotiate" "C'mon"
"And let's try to negotiate" "C'mon"
"And let's try to negotiate" "C'mon"
"And let's try" "C'mon"
"And let's try" "C'mon"
"And let's try" "C'mon"
"And let's try" "C'mon"

"C'mon"

"To negotiate" "C'mon"
"And let's try to negotiate" "C'mon"
"And let's try to negotiate" "C'mon"
"And let's try to negotiate" "C'mon"
"And let's try to negotiate" "C'mon"
"And let's try to negotiate" "C'mon"
"And let's try to negotiate" "C'mon"
Yeah, that's right
It's time to set the record straight
Ain't nobody got to spell it for me
I said, "Ain't nobody got to yell I can see"
I said, "Ain't nobody got the pain I can hear"
But if I have to I will yell in your ear
Time for living, time for giving
Time for living, time for giving
Time for living, time for giving
Time for living, time for giving
Check this out
Ain't nobody got to spell it for me
I said, "Ain't nobody got to yell I can see"
I said, "Ain't nobody got the pain I can hear"
But if I have to I will yell in your ear
Soul on fire
Soul on fire
And we ain't got no water
We don't have no water
Time for living, time for giving
No time for making up a monster to sell
Time for living, time for giving
No time for breakin' out a lie to sell
Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That has known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight, so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound

Say, Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet
Oh, but they're so spaced out, B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie, she's really keen
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
Oh, B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe you're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong
Say, Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet
Oh, but they're so spaced out, B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie, she's really keen
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
Oh, B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

(Repeat)

B-B-B-Bennie, Bennie..., Bennie and the Jets
Bennie....

[Intro]
Love you too
Alright, can you turn on my guitar in my ears please? Thank you
You guys ready? Are you sure?
Alright, let's go

[Verse 1]
I always knew you were the best, the coolest girl I know
So prettier than all the rest, the star of my show
So many times I wished, you'd be the one for me
But never knew it'd get like this, girl what you do to me?

[Pre-Chorus]
You're who I'm thinking of
And girl you ain't my runner up

[Chorus]
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl I want you

It's you, it's you
My favourite, my favourite
My favourite, my favourite girl
My favourite girl

[Verse 2]
You're always going out your way to impress these Mr. Wrongs
But you can be yourself with me, I'll take you as you are
I know they said believe in love, it's a dream that can’t be real
So girl let's write a fairytale and show 'em how we feel

[Pre-Chorus]
You're who I'm thinking of
And girl you ain't my runner up
And no matter what
You're always number one

[Chorus]
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you

[Verse 1]
For you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin, "It's time to sink or swim,"
Watch them play for ya
For you, I'd be, whoa oh
Running a thousand miles just to get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need a whole lot, but for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby listen...

[Chorus]
I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody

[Verse 2]
Every day I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds, smile for me
I would take every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime, step to the beat of my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need a whole lot, but for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby listen...

[Chorus]
I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody, somebody to love
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody, I just need somebody to love

[Bridge]
And you can have it all
Anything you want, I can bring
Give you the finer things, yeah
But what I really want, I can't find
Cause money can't find me somebody to love
Oh oh, find me somebody to love, oh

[Chorus]
I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody, somebody to love
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody, I just need somebody to love

[Outro]
I need somebody, I need somebody, I need somebody to love
Is she out there? Is she out there?
Is she out there? Is she out there?
I just need somebody to love
Face down don't turn around
Listen to the bass pound
From all type of angles
This ain't no star spangled banner
More juice than tropicana
Rock from New York to Savannah
Cause it's Macka Framma?
When I go to a show
Some run some come plenty have fun
To watch a nig get dumb
The right way, the hype way, the tight way
You're f**king right that I might say...
Chorus
Fronters get confronted while stunts get stunted
And my homies get blunted while the rats get hunted
So if you want it here it is so put em up or shut em up
Smack'em down and I'll yell pick'em up so get'em up
Word em up, as I f**k it up I tear it up
So listen up and don't move just play the groove
Don't dime when I crime cause kid that's
Fessin' up but when I pull out my mag
Just raise em up
Chorus
One to the Three to the motherf**kin' two
And you don't know what I'ma do
That's because you're new but
I got the kaya ta make you feel higher
So say what you want you motherf**kin' liar
Don't mean to boast I don't mean to brag but I got the grab bag
Of funky shit you wish you had
But It's the pace that we gotta pick up so stickem up
Hands high reach for the sky
But don't try to get fly cause it's easy to die
Just like a blink of an eye when the shots rang
Boom bang rat ta tat tat
Watch your back cause I'm coming black
Kill that yig yag put the money in the bag
Pass the zags with the Billboard Mag
But freeze feel the breeze if ya sneeze than you're shot
Now ya gotta run what'cha got
Chorus
Look out baby
I'm in a dangerous mood
I done called up the bossman
Told him where to go
And just what to do

Call me crazy
But i did what I had to do
You can call me stupid
I just did what I had to do
I had to steal a little time baby
So I could spend it all on you

I parked the car down the street
And I unplugged the phone
So it would look just like
Ain't nobody home

I put a rose on your pillow
Where you lay your pretty head
I'm gonna rub your tired shoulders
Bring your dinner to your bed
Look out baby
I'm in a dangerous mood

I had to steal a little time baby
So I could spend it all on you

I'm gonna light a candle
Put the champagne on ice
And if one ain't enough
Well we'll just have to do it twice
I done made myself a will
And I've called my next of kin
'Cause I'm gonna love you over
And over and over
Again and again
Look out baby
I'm in a dangerous mood
I had to steal a little time baby
So I could spend it all on you
Look out baby
I'm in a dangerous mood
Look out baby
I'm in a dangerous mood
I just this one last paycheck baby
And I'm gonna spend every dime on you

[Intro]
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl

[Verse 1]
How many I told you's and start overs and shoulders have you cried on before?
How many promises? Be honest girl, how many tears you let hit the floor?
How many bags you packed just to take 'em back tell me that? How many either or's?
But no more, if you let me inside of your world there'll be the one less lonely girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, saw so many pretty faces, now all I see is you
Oh no, don't need these other pretty faces
Cause when you're mine in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

[Chorus]
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl, there's gonna be one less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first, I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world, there's gonna be one less lonely girl

[Verse 2]
Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February, not one of 'em spent with you
How many dinner dates, set dinner plates and he didn't even touch his food?
How many torn photographs are you taping back? Tell me that, couldn't see an open door
But no more, if you let me inside of your world, there'll be one less lonely girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, saw so many pretty faces, now all I see is you
Oh no, don't need these other pretty faces
Cause when you're mine in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

[Chorus]
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first, I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world, there's gonna be one less lonely girl

[Bridge]
I can fix up your broken heart, I can give you a brand new start
I can make you believe, I just wanna set one girl free to fall
She's free to fall with me, her hearts locked and know what, I got the key
I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely girl, one less lonely girl

[Chorus]
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl, there's gonna be one less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first, I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first, I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world, there's gonna be one less lonely girl

Drink a six pack and then you play some ball
Walking down the stairs and then he starts to fall
Add on two joints and then he starts to sweat
Two hundred seventy five pounds, that you can't forget
Heart attack, heart attack man
Spend all your money on your health insurance plan
Heart attack, heart attack man
Keep on getting bigger, because you know that you can
Why do you force yourself on top of that girl?
Laugh with all your buddies, because it's a man's man's world
Someday that shit will come back to you
You've been throwing your weight around and your shit is through
Heart attack, heart attack man
Going nowhere, got no master plan
Heart attack, heart attack man
Heart attack
Weighs in at two seventy five
Yeh, my man is lucky to be alive
Smokin' and drinkin' too
My man, the heart attack man, is gonna be running over you
Got no God damn respect
Had to put the big big bitch ass in check
Heart attack, heart attack man
Lungs full of tar and a stomach full of spam
Heart attack, heart attack man
Time to change your ways heart attack man
{What do we know about partying or anything else?}
You know me... are you comfortable? Aw yeah

You got me open like a book, shook, by the way you look
I see you in your whip dipped, couped, fully equipped
Diamonds shinin, earring studded, watch flooded with jew-els
It seems to me as if you might be livin it well
New York to Cali, be in and out of town, body by Bally's
I like the way you flex, I wonder 'bout the sex
What next? Miss, you remind me of a spliff
I mean you smokin, no jokin, and I'm hopin you get with this
My previous dames, played devious games
Wanted a piece of my livin, so I dismissed the pigeons
However I stay concurrent with leathers in cold weathers
Forget Batman, I guess it's Fat-man forever (and)
I keep peepin yo' game, you don't be creepin the same
You smooth, you don't even move like them other dames
They out your reach as you be on blue beaches sunnin
You keep shinin like a ring I do my thing and keep it comin
Aww Heavy (aww Heavy)
Keep on comin {big lovable, make ya comfortable, what? }

Lookin all drop dead, ma-ma, you a hot head
Po-ppa, I be Waterbed, ohh, but you knew
You, remind me of somethin on my magazine cover
And I be Heavy D yo' in between the sheets lover
It seems to me that you ain't ready to be
Better you be with he, steady you frontin on me, listen
My main concern is long term
I like you cause you're full of jokes high hopes plus that indo you smoke
I feel your, tattoo of who you used to do, now you regret it
Don't sweat it boo, I know it was a long time ago, now feel me
I live the saga, hip-hoppa's, Don Dada
Dem fools talk about it, but rules I be about it
You out their reach as you be on blue beaches sunnin
You keep shinin like a ring I do my thing and keep it comin

Aww Heavy (aww Heavy) {I hear you talkin baby}
Keep on comin {I keep it comin ma, I keep it comin mami}
Keep it comin {ya don't stop, big lovable, make you comfortable}
Cause it feels good {Ain't no-bo-dy, like Hea-vy}
Uhh, you can get it if you want it girl
C'mon, you can get it if you want it (if you want it)
Now you can get it if you want it girl
C'mon, now you can get it if you want it (if you want it)
Uhh - my state of mind is prime time (what? ) Never you mind
Who's the baddest, the way I roll on my own confirms my status
All of these fake players around, they tryin to get you
They drench you cause they sweat you, flossin like they met you
(Yeah) Them dudes be bluffin, frontin, they ain't about nuttin
They steady with that ying-yang, you already my thing-thang
Let's fly, two first class, mimosas in the glass
White sand, when we land, beach resort, what you thought?
No one else, top shelf, top notch, I love you like you hip-hop

Keep on comin {what, uhh, hear me out now}
Keep it comin {no-bo-dy, like Hea-vy}
Cause it feels good {no-bo-dy, like Hea-vy}
{ya don't stop, ya don't stop, Dofat in the house}

[Verse 1]
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I'll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time and I was like

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

[Verse 2]
Oh for you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I gotta play it cool, cause I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
Cause I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around and I'm like

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm 16, and I thought that you'd be mine
I used to tweet you and text you and call you and hit you on Facebook all the time
But but but now you're gone, so far long that I can't even find you
You know that feeling when you leave your love and it's right behind you
Can't believe that you did me wrong, we were on iChat all night long
Listening to our favourite song, she was wrong, I am gone
I thought I loved her, never but no one above her
Yes she was my lover, but now until another like

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

[Outro]
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone
I'm gone
'Cos nobody can do it like Mix Master can, come on now
I've got the D double O, D double O style
Here we go again 'cos it's been awhile
Do me a favor don't touch that dial
I rock from Manhattan to the Miracle Mile
My name's Mike D and I'm the ladies choice
I want to get next to you like Rose Royce
Y'all gather round to hear my golden voice
''Cos when it's time to rhyme you know I get noice
Cruisin' like a fan boat on the glade
He'll tweak ass, your ass across the cross fade
So watch your back when he takes the stage
Or he'll send you off on a naked rampage
3 MC's and one DJ
And we be gettin' down with no delay
Mix Master Mike what cha got to say?
Sweet and sour like a tangerine
Fresh like a box of Krispy Kremes
Kenny Rogers' Gambler is my gamblin' theme
Mix Master Mike with the scratch routine
Always updated and in the know
You know we break it down goin' toe to toe
The bass is boomin' from down below
And Norton is chillin' with Mario
And well, my name is Adrock, I'm a Scorpio
Don't ask me 'cos I just don't know
I'm known to mop and I'm known to glow
But don't get mad when we got to go
We just Three MC's and one DJ
And we be gettin' down with no delay
Mix Master Mike what cha got to say?
Mix Master, cut faster
Mix Master cut, cut, cut faster
This is all top secret and classified
I grab a hold of a mic and let the words glide
It's all hypnotic and sanctified
So I never wanna let a bad day slip by
We be gettin' stupid in your area
We 'cosin' all kinds of hysteria
My beats is sick like malaria
But don't worry I'll take care of ya
Just me and Adam, Adam and Mario C
In the studio it's the place to be
To all beings everywhere be happy and free
With Mix Master Mike we're makin' history
We are just Three MC's and one DJ
And we be gettin' down with no delay
So Mix Master Mike what cha got to say?
I can't think of nothing to say
I can't think nothing to say
But I am a drunk that way
You think you got it all right
So I am nothing to say
Pick up the drama and pitch it all away

Ah yeah
Brand new
Ya Ya Ya Yawn
Ya Ya Ya Yawn

What happened to my dream of fame
I can't think nothing to say
I can't problem nothing to say

[Verse 1]
Now Romeo & Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie & Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I, both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

[Verse 2]
See like Adam & Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny & Cher
I don't care, I got you baby
See we both
Fighting every inch of our fibers
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
And we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
But fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

[Bridge]
See like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree and I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray, reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go, so we'll never know

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place, oh no no
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do, nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

[Ad-Rock:]
Yes, here we go again, give you more, nothing lesser*
Back on the mic is the anti-depressor
Ad-Rock, no pressure, yes, we need this
The best is yet to come, and yes, believe this

[Mike D:]
Leggo my Eggo while I flex my ego
Step off my Seco, dressed up tuxedo
Sipping coffee, playing Keno in the casino
Want a lucky number, ask Mike Dino

[MCA:]
I burn the competition like a flamethrower
My rhymes age like wine as I get older
I'm getting bolder, competition is waning
I got the feeling and assume the lane and

[Hook:]
We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gonna party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
Make some noise if you're with me

[Mike D:]
Armed insurrection, popular election
Get paid every year like tax collection
Hear my perfection, rotary connection
Taking MCs down by lethal rap injection

[MCA:]
I'm like an ornithologist when I get pissed
You must have drank a fizzy-lifting drink and you got lifted
And sifted, I'm just whiffed
And when I catch MCs it's time for wing-clipping

[Ad-Rock:]
I fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle
A seagull, I sniff suckers out like a beagle
My ego is off and running and gone
Cause I'm about the best and if you diss than that's wrong

[Hook]

[MCA:]
Pass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision
I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching
Put it in formaldehyde and put it in the shelf
And you can show it to your friends and say "that's my old self"

[Ad-Rock:]
Can't do me nothing, can't tell me nada
Don't quote me now because I'm doing the lambada
The forbidden dance, here's my chance
To make romance in my B-boy stance

[Mike D:]
Parlay romancing into the financing
Opened up a restaurant with Ted Danson
The roaches check in, but they never check out
I set the record straight, no doubt

[Hook]

[Intro]
Soulja Boy Ain't Got No Money?
Shit, go home bitch, ayy

[Hook x4]
Soulja Boy ain't got no money?
Shit, ho home bitch
Shit , ho home bitch
Shit, ho home ho home

[Verse 1]
Soulja Boy ain't got no money man hold up
Stacks on Deck, watch them big face fold up
I got the blow for the low
The five for the hive
Nicks and the dimes tow for five you know why
I'm the money man, stacks in the caseload

Soulja Boy ain't got no money, nah, ho home folks

[Hook x4]
Soulja Boy ain't got no money?
Shit, ho home bitch

Shit, ho home ho home

[Verse 2]
II got what you need, I got what you like
SOulja Boy ain't got no money now we know that that's a lie
Stacks on Deck it's busting out my pockets
Searching for the one yeah you know she's a blockhead
I got them stacks and you already know
Soulja Boy up in this thing all them girls hit the floor
Soulja Boy got money ho, and that's what happening
Stacks on Deck hit the track and I'm sliding in

[Hook x4]
Soulja Boy ain't got no money?
Shit, ho home bitch
Shit , ho home bitch
Shit, ho home ho home

[Verse 3]
Ain't got no money, what you talking 'bout
I got 

[prints of stacks?] invisible sets up in my mouth
Nigga don't get capped, claiming you can rap
Prince of snap music since I did a beat with a snap
Ain't got no money you done lost your mind
So much ice, it'll make you blind
Flip phone phone chrome, fit that on my done
I get more head than your fifty cup let's carry on

[Chorus]
Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, whoa, back it up, now let me see your hips swing
Now drop it low and let me see your hips swing
Down to the floor now let me see your hips swing
Down to the floor now let me see your hips swing

Uh oh, lean back, girl you got some mean racks
You got a mean ass and I really mean that
But can't you see, that I need a girl, that can move
Make her hips swing, and, look, just like you
But come to think about it, I think this club is crowded
It's kinda hard to do your thing when everyone's surrounding
So let me form a circle everybody step back
I heard somebody yell "savage where the chorus at?!"

[Chorus]
Uh oh, let it pop, ladies drop it like it's hot
Hell yeah, that's the spot, now bring it back to the top
Stop! woah, now back it up, now back it up
Let it rise then watch it dump, shaking your junk in the trunk
And, I, like, the way you move it smoothly
Now why, don't, you move that booty, to, me
I'm tryna come up with some thoughts of attack
Until I heard somebody yellin' out "savage where the chorus at?!"

[Chorus]

[Repeat x2]
Knees bent, ass out, come on push your ass out
(Let me see your hips swing)
Bring it up then back down, bring it up then back down
(Let me see your hips swing)
All my ladies on the floor, all my ladies on the floor
(Let me see your hips swing)
Pick it up then dip it low, pick it up then dip it low
(Let me see your hips swing)

[Chorus]
Root down, I put my root down
I kick it root down, I put my boot down
So how you gonna kick it, gonna kick it root down
Yeah, how you gonna kick it, gonna kick it root down
So how you gonna kick it, gonna kick it root down
Gonna break or damn, gonna kick it root down
It's not a put down, I put my foot down
And then I make some love, I put my root down
I'm like sweetie pie by the stone alliance
Everbody knows I'm known for dropping science
I'm electric like Dick Hyman
I guess you'd expect to catch the crew rhymin'
Never let you down with the stereo sound
So Mike, get on the mic and turn it out
We're talking root down, I put my root down
And if you want to battle me, you're putting loot down
I said root down, it's time to scoot down
I'm a step up to the mic in my goose down
Come up representing from the upper west
Money makin' putting me to the test
Sometimes I feel as low, I've been blessed
Because I'm doing what I want, so I never rest
Well, I'm not coming out goofy like the fruit of the loom guys
Just strutting like the meters with the look-ka py py
'Cause downtown Brooklyn is where I was born
But when the snow is falling, then I am gone
You might think that I'm a fanatic
A phone call from Utah and I'm throwing a panic
But we kick it from the root when we break it on down
Jimmy Smith is my man, I wanna give him a pound
I kick it root down, I put my root down
I kick it root down, I put my root down
So how you wanna kick it, gonna kick it root down
Yes, how we gonna kick it, we gonna kick it root down
So how we gonna kick it, gonna kick it root down
We gonna break it or damn, gonna kick it root down
Well, Ad Rock, don't stop, come on
Just get on the mic with the tic and the tac
I'll fill you with the fuckin' rim like brim
I'm walking down your block and you say that's him
There goes the guy with the funky sound
The Beastie Boys, you know we come to get down
Because I've got the flow where I grab my dick
And say oh my God, that's the funky shit
So I'm going to pass the mic and cause a panic
The original nasal kid is doing damage
Every morning I took the train to High Street station
Doing homework on the train, what a fucked up situation
On the way back up hearing battle tapes
Through the underground, underneath the sky scrapes
It's like Harlem world battles on the Zulu beat show
It's Kool Moe D. vs. Busy Bee, there's one you should know
Enough of that, I just want to give some respect due
M.C.A. grab the mic and the ma bell will connect you
Bob Marley was a prophet for the freedom fight
If dancin' prays to the Lord, then I shall feel alright
It feels good to play a little music
Tears running down my face 'cause I love to do it
And no one can stop this flow from flowing on
A flow master in disaster with a sound that's gone
I'll give a little shout out to my dad and mom
For bringing me into this world and so on
I kick it root down, I put my root down
I kick it root down, I put my root down
So how we gonna kick it, gonna kick it root down
Yeah, how you wanna kick it, gonna kick it root down
So how we gonna rock it, gonna kick it root down
Gonna break it or damn, gonna kick it root down

[Leading Halfway to End at Fast Pace]
Shoot It, Shoot It, Shoot It, Shoot It,.. Shoot It, Shoot It, Shoot It...
Baby, out all night
Until the break of day
Snap me up in everything I say
Little by little
Only you know that I can see
Bit by bit
Your love is slipping away from me

What you're doing, baby
You know it ain't right
I wonder what you're doing
That takes all night
Little by little
Only you know that I can see
Bit by bit
Your love is slipping away from me

Get so disgusted
When I try to kiss you
I just don't feel
Like I used to do
Little by little
Only you know that I can see
Bit by bit
Your love is slipping away from me
Tried to trail you last night
Baby, in my car
But I'm scared I might see
What I'm looking for
Little by little
Only you know that I can see
Bit by bit
Your love is slipping away from me

[Verse 1]
You worked two jobs
To keep a roof above our heads
You chose
A life for me, no you never gave up
I admire you, for the strength you’ve instilled in me
You were so young
You were just my age when you had me mom
You were so brave
There was nothing gonna stop or get in our way
And I know you will always be there for me

[Chorus]
So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
'Cause I, I still turn to you
I still turn to you, I still turn to you

[Verse 2]
It was ’94
The year that everything started to change
From before
You had to be a woman, you were forced to change your ways, to change your ways
Then you found the Lord
You gave your life to Him, and you could not ignore the love he had for you
And I wanted more of your heart

[Chorus]
So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
'Cause I, I still turn to you

[Bridge]
I don’t know what I’d if you left me
(So please don’t go away)
Everything that you are is who I am
Who I am today

[Chorus]
So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher (you higher)
'Cause I, I still turn to you (to you, to you, to you)
I still turn to you (to you, to you, to you)
I still turn to you (I still turn to you)
Yeah-Yeah
Cause I
I turn to you

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Left ring, 10 hundred cash
Neck piece, 30 grand
Whip, cost 300 grand
God damn, I'm on a shopping spree
Bracelet, 20 bands
Rims, cost me 5 grand
House, cost 500 cash
God damn, I'm on a shopping spree

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Lying in a whip that don't release until 2010
50 thousand dollars spent just to make my rims spin
Half a million dollars spent on the house I live in
Even more spent on the seat I sit my ass in
Soulja Boy Tell Em, A.K.A The Assassin
Prises cuts in my watch, like I threw some glass in
Damn, exclusive shit sent from China
If you looking for me, I'm probably in your girl's vagina
I'm looking in the mirror, tell me who's finer
Bought a Lamborghini, didn't need a cosigner
Hey, what I spent was just minor
Every cut served Soulja Boy's headliner
Damn, now tell me you don't feel this
Ay, you can't say I'm just one hit
Ay, are you bitch niggas serious?
I'm quick on the track, like the Fast and the Furious

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Left ring, 10 hundred cash
Neck piece, 30 grand
Whip, cost 300 grand
God damn, I'm on a shopping spree
Bracelet, 20 bands
Rims, cost me 5 grand
House, cost 500 cash
God damn, I'm on a shopping spree

I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree (Gucci baby!)
I'm on a shopping spree (It's Gucci, Soulja Boy!)
I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
From a Cutlass to a Chevy, Chevy to a Lamborgini
You can't be me or see me, unless you see me on T.V
Shiny and greesy, I wonder if Stevie Wonder can see me
Necklace a jungle of BBs, just check my selection of pieces
Uhh, I got a stupid collection you see it
Chain worth a millie, you silly, really a millie and 20
Hah, man I pass out 50s and 20s
I pass out 50s and 20s
I pass out 100s and 50s
We make more money than chemists, doctors, and lawyers, and dentists
Chemists, the doctors, the lawyers, money together, couldn't get me
2 door Gulardo, 160
Drop, top, 120
House worth a million and three, Dula truck, 63 g's
Old school's a hundred a piece
That cost me 75 g's, 65 actually, but my rims cost me 10 of them things
Gucci, Yo Gotti, the king
Soulja done did it again
This team be 82 g's, that beat is 82 keys
Soulja!

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Left ring, 10 hundred cash
Neck piece, 30 grand
Whip, cost 300 grand
God damn, I'm on a shopping spree

Rims, cost me 5 grand
House, cost 500 cash
God damn, I'm on a shopping spree

I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree (Yo Gotti!)
I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
See money ain't the object
Let's give you a option
You go to your stash, partner and I'll come out my pockets
2 hundred hundreds
That's like 20 grand
Just enough for me to buy my bride a new band
I'm like Soulja Boy Tell Em
They think that I'm playing
Come down here to Tennesse and see that I'm the man
Ain't talkin about no rappin
I'm talkin about that trappin
I'm talkin about that brick, I'll ram it straight up pistol package (Check!)
Ringpiece 2,000 grand
Neckpiece 4,000 grand
Fin to cop a Chevy but instead I went and copped a Lamb
Woo! Took your bitch on a shopping spree
Gucci this, Prada this, I think that hoe in love with me
Ain't got security, I keep lots of thugs with me
We call them goons, cause I rock lots of jewlery
Cocaine everything
Who the fuck ain't feelin me?
Gun powder on the market
Realest nigga in the streets

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Left ring, 10 hundred cash
Neck piece, 30 grand
Whip, cost 300 grand
God damn, I'm on a shopping spree
Bracelet, 20 bands

Like Sweetie Pie By The Stone Alliance
Everbody Knows I'm Known For Dropping Science
I'm Electric Like Dick Hyman
I Guess You'd Expect To Catch The Crew Rhymin'
Never Let You Down With The Stereo Sound
So Mike, Get On The Mic And Turn It Out
We're Talking Root Down, I Put My Boot Down
And If You Want To Battle Me, You're Putting Loot Down
I Said Root Down, It's Time To Scoot Down
I'm A Step Up To The Mic In My Goose Down
Come Up Representing From The Upper West
Money Makin' Putting Me To The Test
Sometimes I Feel As Though I've Been Blessed
Because I'm Doing What I Want So I Never Rest
Well, I'm Not Coming Out Goofy Like The Fruit Of The Loom Guys
Just Strutting Like The Meters With The Look-ka Py Py
'Cause Downtown Brooklyn Is Where I Was Born
But When The Snow Is Falling, Then I'm Gone
You Might Think That I'm A Fanatic
A Phone Call From Utah And I'm Throwing A Panic
But We Break It From The Root When We Kick It On Down
Jimmy Smith Is My Man, I Want To Give Him A Pound
Ad Rock Don't Stop, Just Get On The Mic With The Tic And The Toc

The Beastie Boys You Know We Come To Get Down
Because I've Got The Flow Where I Grab My Dick
And Say Oh My God, That's The Funky Shit
So I'm Going To Pass The Mic And Cause A Panic
The Original Nasal Kid Is Doing Damage
Every Morning I Took The Train To High Street Station
Doing Homework On The Train, What A F*cked Up situation
On The Way Back Up Hearing Battle Tapes
Through The Underground, Underneath The Sky Scrapes
Like Harlem World Battles On The Zulu Beat Show
It's Kool Moe D Vs. Busy Bee There's One You Should Know
Enough Of That, I Just Want To Give Some Respect Due
M.C.A. Grab The Mic And The Ma Bell Will Connect You
Bob Marley Was A Prophet For The Freedom Fight
"If Dancin' Prays To The Lord Then I Shall Feel Alright"
I'm Feeling Good To Play A Little Music
Tears Running Down My Face 'Cause I Love To Do It
And No One Can Stop This Flow From Flowing On
A Flow Master In Disaster With A Sound That's Gone
I'll Give A Little Shout Out To My Dad And Mom
For Bringing Me Into This World And So On
I can't stand it I know you planned it
I'm gonna set it straight, this watergate
I can't stand rocking when I'm in here
Because your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this f*cking thorn in my side
Oh my, it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all it's sabotage
So listen up 'cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me down with a push of your button?
But yo I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now I keep it on and on
'cause what you see you might not get
And we can bet so don't you get souped yet
You're scheming on a thing that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now it's sabotage
Why; our backs are now against the wall
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
But I'm gonna set it straight this watergate
But I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
I'm buddy rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be, it's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing - that's sabotage
1-2 1-2 Keep It On
Listen To The Shit Because We Kick It Until Dawn
Listen To The Abstract Got It Going On
Listen To The Ladies Come On And Let Me Spawn
All Your Eggs Then You Go Up The River
Listen To The Abstract That Freaky Nigga
I'm Ad Rock And I Shock And I Tick And I Tock
And I Can't Stop With The Body Rock
See I've Got Heart Like John Starks
Hitting Mad Sparks
Pass Me The Mic
And I'll Be Rocking The Whole Park
I'm The M To The C To The A And It's A Must
The Rhymes That We Bust On The Topic On Lust
And My Moms Is Not Butt, But F*ck It
Let Me Get Down To The Rhythm
Yes I'm Getting Funky And I'm Shooting All My Jism
Like John Holmes, The X-rated Nigga
Listen To The Shit 'Cause I'm The Ill Figure
Nobody's Getting Any Bigger Than This
Get It Together, Get It Together
Phone is Ringing, Oh My God
Get It Together
See What's Happening
Ad Rock's Down With The Ione
Listen To The Shit Because Both Of Them Is Boney
Got To Do It Like This Like Chachi And Joanie
Because She's The Cheese And I'm The Macaroni
So Why All The Fight And Why All The Fuss
Because I Ain't Got No Dust
Yea, You Know I'm Getting Silly
I've Got A Grandma Hazel And A Grandma Tilly
Grand Royal prez And I'm Also A Member
Born On The Cusp In The Month Of November
I Do The Patty Duke In Case You Don't Remember
Well, I Freak A Funky Beat Like The Shit Was In A Blender
Well, I'm Long Gone Word Is Born
Don't Need A Mother F*cking Fool Telling Me Right From Wrong
I Don't Think I'm Slick Nor Do I Play Like I'm Hard
But I'm a Drive The Lane Like I Was Evan Bernhard
And I've Working On My Game Because Life Is Taxing
Got To Get It Together And See What's Happening
Get It Together, Get It Together
Get It Together
See What's Happening
I Go One Two Like My Name Was Biz Mark
But I Had To Do The Shit Just Let Me Embark
On The Lyric And The Noun And The Verb
Let's Kick The Shit Off 'Cause Yo, I'm Not The Herb
Well, It's Not The Herb But The Spice With The Flavor To Spare
The Moog With The Funk For Your Derriere
While We're On That Topic, Yes I Like To Mention
When It Comes To Boning I'm Representing
Spacing, Zoning, Talkin' On The Phone And
My Brain Is Roaming And I Don't Know Where It's Going
Talking Lots Of Shit A Little Tweaking On The Weekend
I've Got To Get Him By The Reigns Because I Know That I'm Freaking
Well, I'm A Funky Skull And I'm A Scorpio
And When I Get My Flow I'm Dr On The Go
So Q-tip, What You On The Mic For
Because I Had To Talk About The Times That I Rhyme
And When M.C.S Come In My Face, I'm Like Mace
Because I Back Them Off With The Quills
Nigga 'Cause I Tell You, Nigga 'Cause I'll Keep You Under Prills
Resting On Nine One One Sixteenth Ave Off The Farmes Boulevard
I'm From Manhattan M.C.A.'s From Brooklyn
Yea, M.C.A., Your Shit Be Cooking
Praying Mantis On The Court And I Can't Be Beat
So, Yo Tip, What's Up With The Boot On Your Feet
I've Got The Timbos On The Toes And This Is How It Goes
Oh One Two, Oh My God
One Two, Oh My God, I've Got Some Shit
I've Got The Kung Fu Grip Behind My Green Trap Kit
Never Ever Ever Smoking Crack
Never Ever Ever F*cking Wack
I Eat The F*ckin' Pineapple Now & Laters
Listen To Me Now, Don't Listen To Me Later
F*ck It 'Cause I Know I Didn't Make It F*ckin' Rhyme For Real
But, Yo Technically I'm As Hard As Steel
Gonna Get It Together, Watch It, Gonna Get It Together Ma Bell
I'm Like Ma Bell, I've Got The Ill Communications

[Instrumental]
I Can Hear The Trumpets Blowing Screaming Out The End Of Time
Look Around And Listen And You'll See Every Sign
The Waters Are Polluted As The Forests Are Cut Down
Bombing And Drilling Deep Below The Ground
Check The Prophecies From Around The World
And Look Around Now As It All Unfurls
Look Into Yourself And See What Goes On
Get A Feeling In Your Heart Of The Right From Wrong
Because The Mother Earth Needs To Be Respected
Been Far From Too Long That She's Been Neglected
Race Against Race, Such A Foolish Waste
It's Like Cutting Off Your Nose To Spite Your Face
And At The End Of The Wars, What Was The Cost
It's Clear That The Earth Was The One Who Lost
We Are One With Her As She Is One With Us
It's Unreal How She Is Treated So Unjust
As Our Planet Grows Smaller Each And Every Day
Everyone Affecting Everyone In Every Way
We're All Citizens Of The World Community
All Here Together And We're Searching For Unity
Over The Years, I've Grown And Changed So Much
Things I Know Now Years Ago, I Couldn't Touch
There Are Things I've Done That I Wouldn't Do Again
But I'm Glad That I Did 'Cause I've Learned From Them
I Just Try To Stay Present Right Here, Right Now
No Worries, No Fears And Without Any Doubts
It's About Time
'Cause In These Times, These Changing Times
A Transition Is Occuring And I Am Not Blind
As The Pendlum Swings A New Age We Enter
And With Every Swing, It Draws Closer To The Center
Yes The Storm Before The Calm And The Wars That Lead To Love
Things Must Run Their Course So We Push And We Shove
But We're Here To Work It Out In One Way Or Another
To Find A Mutual Respect For Ourselves And One Another
And The True Key Is A Trust In Self
For When I Trust Myself, I Fear No One Else
I Took Control Of My Life, Just As Anyone Can
I Want Everyone To See It's In The Palm Of Your Hand
The Past Is Gone, The Future Yet Unborn
But Right Here And Now Is Where It All Goes On
I Know We Can Fix It And It's Not Too Late
I Give Respect To King And His Nonviolent Ways
I Dream And I Hope And I Won't Forget
Someday I'm Going To Visit On A Free Tibet
Someday I'm Going To See Us All Joined As One
And It Would Be Too Bad To Blow It Up Before We're Done
'Cause We Long Behind The Rage Learning From The Pain
The Love Behind The Tension Like The Sun Behind The Rain
I'm Sending Loving Light To All That Is
To All Creation And The Life We Live
I'm Not Preaching Bull Shit, Just Speaking My Mind
'Cause I'm Here Now And It's About Time
"When Two Are Served, You May Begin To Eat"
Gene Futterman
Because I Grab The Microphone And I Pick It Up
And Then I F*ck It Up And Then I Turn It In
And Then I Turn It Out, Got The Body Rockin' Sound
And Then You Know I'm Gonna Get Down And
Eat A Scooby Snack And Take Disco Nap
Because I'm Shopping At Sears, 'Cause I Don't Buy At The Gap
Sending This One Out To All The Funky Inspirations
Pretty Purdie On The Drums With The Beat Relations
Well, I'm Working On Rhymes, They're Coming Line By Line
Trying To Put What I Feel Into Word And Rhymes
I've Got A Feeling Coming On, I've Got To Make Some Shit
A Little Something Stupid, For The Twisted And Sick
Because I Drive Like A Maniac On The Streets
And I Don't Give F*ck 'Cause I've Got The Beats
Got My Nuts Swingin' From Left To Right And
Right To Left And I'm Death Defying
Alright Hear This
Alright Hear This
I Spin My Fortune On A Wheel Like Sajak
Here's The Payback Keep Going Strong Like Since The Way Back
I Try To Be Myself But I Lose Track
'Cause The Shit Gets Complicated Now I've Got To Get Back
As We Learn To Breed Love For One Another
In These Times Of Melying Cultures
I Give Respect For What's Been Borrowed And Lent
I Know This Music Comes Down From African Descent
Because I Don't Need A Magic Potion
Let Me Talk About Back Field In Motion
My Girls Got Cheeks For Weeks And I'm Happy
You Know I'm A Sneak Like My Old Grand Pappy
I Gotta Give Thanks To My Man Archie Shep
For Staying True To Inspiration And I Don't Half Step
So I Kick Out The Jams And Tell You Who I Am
And I Talk To The People Like Les Mccann
I Ask God For A Rhyme Or Two
A Little Something For The Wise As Well As The Fool
A Little Something To Affect A Little Taste Of Change
For The Together And The Strong As Well As the Dearanged
I'll Do You Right Like Bobby Knight
And Then I'm Rapping On The Mic To The Broadway Light
Stomp My Hands, I Clap My Feet And
I'm Bugging Off Yusef Lateef
I Got A Match To My Ass And I'm A Keep It Lit
I Need To Get Some Cash, Call My Accountant Britt
I'm Rushing Around Town Taking Care Of My Functions
Always Got One More Thing So Forget About Function
We Create This World And The Problems Go On
Create Our Lives And The Things That Go Wrong
So To The Deaf, The Blind, Look Around And Listen
To What It Is You Want And For What You're Wishing

[Instrumental]
Moon Me!
So, Just Sit Back And Max And Relax
Off Tracks That I Kick, Come On And Give It Up
'CauseI Get Funky Like Diaper Rash
And You Know I'm Mad Spunky And I'm Making Cash
I've Got Sex Rhymes Like Victoria's Got Secrets
To All You Porne Peepers Who Are Trying To Peep This
I'm Like Al Goldstein, I'm All About Screwing
Lead My Team To Sixty Wins Like My Man Pat Ewing
Like Getting Shot Out The Barrel Of A Wave
Like Virgin Pow On The Peaks Of A.K
Like A Sound That To The Depths Of The Soul
Well That's The Feeling That I Make My Goal
A Little Wine With My Dinner So I'm In The Grape Ape
I Feel Like A Winner When I Make A Mix Tape
Because I Get Ill When I'm On The Pause Button
And I Get My Fill And You Can't Say Nothing
More Soul On This Train Then Don Cornelious
Got The Mad Subwoofer Pumping Bass For Your Anus
Just Getting On The Mic At The Monthly Function
Wires Hitting Switches Connecting At The Junction
Perlman's Got Beats And It Ain't No Secret
Dante Found His Shit But You Know He Freaked It
And So The Story Goes On And On
Down In S.D. 50 'till Early Morning
Like The Black Birds I'm A Do It Fluid
Building Rhymes Like Buildings, Like A Stonehenge Druid
Step Up And Get Enlightened, Educating My Mind
I Play The Tape Forward, It's Not Time To Rewind
Step Inside The Mother F*cker And I Get My Flow On
Amalgamating Styles So I've Got Something To Grow On
Season's Change When It Comes Their Time
Falls Brings The Winter And On Back To Springtime
Well, It's The King Ad Rock And That's Who I Am
Listen All Of Y'all I'm Not The Son Of Sam
'Cause I'm Thin And I Don't Grin
But Check It Out People 'cause I Love To Go And Swim
Caught Up On The Phone Fiber Optic Distraction
Information Super Highway Got The Brain Contraction
I'm The Kung Fu Master Vs. The Sumo Wrestler
Got The Beats In Manhatten You Can Hear In Westchester
Well, My Mother Was Born Out In Coney Island
Raised On The L.E.S. Manhatten Island
My Dad Camo Out From Detroit And They Had Me
And Back On Through Ellis Island Goes Through The Family Tree
Well, I'm A Six Point Seven On The Richter Scale
I've Got Rhymes Gallot And Then I Never Fail
Like Gravy To Potatos, Luke To Darth Vader
I'm A Souped Up Sucker And I'll See You All Later
You See Me Coming Down The Block With The Funky cuts
You Say Mike D. And I Say Mic These Nuts
I've Got Attractions Like I'm Elvis Costello
Adam Yauch Grab The Mic 'Cause You Know You're My Mellow
Well When I Get It Into The Zone
I'm Gonna Take It To A Place Where It's All One
My Shit Is On And The Rhyme Style's Kicking
My Brain Is Flowing Honest Like Abe Lincoln
'Cause I'm The F*ckin' Rythm Ace With The Rhyme Selection
Listen All Y'all I Rap With Perfection
Because I Got The Mother F*ckin' Old School Flavor
That You Savor So Watch Your Behavior
Talking Other Dimensions, Levels Higher
Why Did Billy Joel Say We Didn't Start The Fire
Take You To Another Realm, Another Level
I've Got The Funky Rhymes But I'm Not The Funky Devil
I Step From Minute To Minute, Lifetime To Lifetime
Step From Stage To Stage To See It All Unwind
Slowly But Surely I Seek To Find My Mind
And Every Wall That I Face Is Of My Own Desig
Glendale Boulevard Boulevard
Glendale Boulevard Is Where I'm At
It's Where I'm At, Where I Live
Check It Out Because My Head Is Like A Siv
And We Turn It Out

[Instrumental]
Drink A Six Pack And Then You Play Som Ball
Walking Down The Stairs And Then He Starts To Fall
Add On Two Joints And Then He Starts To Sweat
Two Hundred Seventy Five Punds That You Can't Forget
Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man
Spend All Your Money On Your Health Insurance Plan
Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man
Keep On Getting Bigger Because You Know That You Can
Why Do You Force Yourself On Top Of That Girl
Laugh With All Your Buddies Because It's A Man's Man's World
Someday That Shit Will Come Back To You
You've Been Throwing Your Weight Around And
Your Shit Is Through
Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man
Going Nowhere, Got No Master Plan
Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man
Heart Attack
Weighs In At Two Seventy Five
Yeh My Man Is Lucky To Be Alive
Smokin' And Drinkin' Too
My Man The Heart Attack Man Is Gonna Be Running Over You
Got No God Damn Respect
Had To Put The Big Big Bitch-Ass In Check
Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man
Lungs Full Of Tar And A Stomach Full Of Spam
Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man
Time To Change Your Ways Heart Attack Man
What do we know about partying or anything else?
I Don't get Blind I Don't Drink Wine
I Took A Sledge Hammer And I Broke My Nine
Because My Record Is Mine, Word Is Born I Rhyme
And Everey Day I Write The Book Down Line By Line
I'm Feeling Good When I Do It Like This
So Come On And Turn It Up Because You Can't Resist
Because I'm Back With Another Track Wich You Lack
'Cause Things Is Wack And That's A Fact
Because I'm On Time, You're Shouting Rewind
You Know It's Ad Rock That's Blowing Your Mind
My Shit Is Rough And You Know It Is So Damn Tough
I'm Getting Intense, Not Talking Nonsese
I Made Up My Mind, Not Sitting On The Fence
I Don't Always Know The Right From The Wrong
I Do My Best To Figure It Out And Work It Out In The Long
I Try To Do A Lot More Than I Can Chew
Balance Out My Ambition's What I've Got To Do
Because You Hide In Broad Day Light, A Parasite
A Hypocrite, You Take A Peek Quick
You Turn Your Nose Up, You Think You're High Up
You Play It Real Safe And Now Your Shit's Fake
I Seen You Hawking And Then You Clock My Style
And Then You Try To Play It Off Like You Think You're Wild
D.I.Y. That Means Do It Yourself
I Don't Sit Around Waiting For Someone's Help
Don't Sit Back And Say Good Enough
Keep On Striving, Reinventing But Keeping It Off
The Cuff
So Kick The Level Up Cuhootnified
Mackadocius Vibes Positively Fortified
I'm Throwing Rhymes Down Kicking Them Downtown
Traveling High Speed Through The Underground
I Kick It Free Style, Make It Worth Your While
I've Got Shelves Of Rhymes That I Keep On File
I'm Feeling Good Now Back Home Again
New York City Is The City That I Feel At Home In
A Blast From The Grasshoff Awhile It's Been
Stepping Into The Future Again
I'm Straight From The 88 To 93 To 94, I'm Out The Door
Step Into The Party With The Fila Fresh Gear
People Looking At Me Like I Was David Koresh Here
Kicking Rhymes From The Heart 'Cause That's Where I'm At
F*ck The Bullshit, Be It Far From Me To Pop That
In The Search For Truth, I Go A Lot Of Ways
There's Not A Lot Of Peace, That I Find These Days
I Try To Stay Cool, I Try To Stay Calm
But My Life Is Getting Hectic Like A Smoke Bomb
So I'll Say It Like The Group Huggy Bear
There's A Boy-Grrrl Revolution Of Wich You Should Be Aware
You Can't Dis Me, It Ain't Worth It, B
You Put Yourself Down And You Don't Even See
Cause I Don't Play That, I Know Who I Am
For A Minute, I Did But Now I'm Back Again
I'm Feeling Strong See, Trust Myself G
Well I Stopped Smoking Cheeba
And That Was Part Of The Key
We've Got Fire, We Need Water
There ain't No Water So I Guess I Ought To
Leave You Broke In A Comatose State Of Mind
And I'm Blind And I'm Working Overtime, So Check It
I Keep My Rhymes In A Little Black Book
And I Know You Want To Take Another Look

[Tibetan Gregorian Chants - Instrumental]
As I Develop The Awakening Mind I Praise The Buddha As They Shine
I Bow Before You As I Travel My Path To Join Your Ranks
I Make My Full Time Task
For The Sake Of All Beings I Seek
The Enlighted Mind That I Know I'll Reap
Respect To Shantideva And All The Others
Who Brought Down The Darma For Sisters And Brothers
I Give Thanks For This World As A Place To Learn
And For This Human Body That I Know I've Earned
And My Deepest Thanks To All Sentient Beings
For Without Them There Would Be No Place To Learn What I'm Seeing
There's Nothing Here That's Not Been Said Before
But I Put It Down Now So I'll Be Sure
To Solidify My Own Views And I'll Be Glad If It Helps
Anyone Else Out Too
If Others Disrespect Me Or Give Me Flack
I'll Stop And Think Before I React
Knowing That They're Going Through Insecure Stages
I'll Take The Opportunity To Exercise Patience
I'll See It As A Chance To Help The Other Person
Nip It In The Bud Before It Can Worsen
A Change For Me To Be Strong And Sure
As I Think On The Buddhas Who Have Come Before
As I Praise And Respect The Good They've Done
Knowing Only Love Can Conquer In Every Situation
We Need Other People In Order To Create
The Circumstances For The Learning That We're Here To Generate
Situations That Bring Up Our Deepest Fears
So We Can Work To Release Them Until They're Cleared
Therefore, It Only Makes Sense
To Thank Our Enemies Despite Their Intent
The Bodhisattva Path Is One Of Power And Strength
A Strength From Within To Go The Length
Seeing Others Are As Important As Myself
I Strive For A Happiness Of Mental Wealth
With The Interconnectedness That We Share As One
Every Action That We Take Affects Everyone
So In Deciding For What A Situation Calls
There Is A Path For The Good For All
I Try To Make My Every Action For That Highest Good
With The Altruistic Wish To Achive Buddhahood
So I Pledge Here Before Everyone Who's Listening
To Try To Make My Every Action For The Good Of All Beings
For The Rest Of My Lifetimes And Even Beyond
I Vow To Do My Best To Do No Harm
And In Times Of Doubt I Can Think On The Dharma
And The Enlightened Ones Who've Graduated Samsara

It's early in the morning and I can't get right
'Cause I had a little date with my baby last night

Now it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

I went to all the places where we used to go
I went to her house but she don't live there no more

And it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
I went to her girlfriend's house, but she was out
I knocked on her door and her mother started to shout
"Get away from here!"

Too early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
Went to Jenny Lou's to get something to eat
The waitress looked at me, she said, "B., you sure look beat"
It's early in the morning, baby
Early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

Had a lot of money when I first started out
I couldn't find my baby, now my money's run out

Now it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

It's early in the morning
I ain't got nothin' but the blues

Once upon a time, a long long time ago, wherever you'd lead me, I would surely follow
Girl, you put me through some pain and misery
And now you are standing on my doorstep, telling me how much you need me
Baby, ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home

How many times I begged for you to come home, but you laughed at me and said let me alone
Through my falling tears I saw you walk away
And now you're beggin' me to forgive you, but this time, baby, it's your turn to beg
Baby, ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home

Girl, I used to love you, placed no one else above you
Gave you everything that I own
Girl, you can't come back here
Ain't nobody home

Once upon a time, when you went on your way
But, girl, I hoped and prayed, that you'd come back some day
But time has made some changes, turned me upside down
So, you can beg me to forgive you, but this time, baby, you can turn right around
Ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home
Girl, you hurt me once
I hear you knockin'
Mary...Mary...Mary
Live ya life girl

Whoa, love is all we need
'Cause everybody needs love

Love is all we need
To make everything complete
If we try to live together and be happy
You and me are one
And we've only just begun
So let's make a new beginning and have some fun

Love is all we need
To make everything complete, all we need is L-O-V-E
Love is all we need (said it's all we need)
'Cause to love you would mean everything
'Cause everybody need love

Dealing with tough times
Seems to always blow my mind
But I know where my heart is so I am fine (Live ya life girl!)
If we remain friends
It would never ever end
On this love I give to you, you can depend
Love is all we need
To make everything complete, all we need is L-O-V-E
Love is all we need (said it's all we need)
'Cause to love you would mean everything
'Cause everybody need love

Love is all we need
To make every little thing complete, yeah, yeah
Oh, if you would trust in me
I would let you know that I love you

Love is all we need
(said I love you, said I love you)
(Oh, Lord knows that we need it, said we need it, said we need it)
Love is all we need
(Oh said it's all we need...yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on)
'Cause everybody need love

Feel this hit banging in your residential district
Presidents you checked out
Canary rock sizzlin'
Mary's hop hop
Cris shorty got this
Fly angel
My dreams of a queen came true in this land that's dark
If you my man and you my heart
I blast for you
Need bail put up the cash for you
Girls who mad loyal die for you
Leave them if they acting too fly for you
All up in your mix then in somebody else six
Quick to put your name in some murder one shit
I'm not the one cheatin' on you or beatin' on you
'Cause I'm laid back you thought that I was sleeping on you?
Real love make a ill thug feel bug
Nas analyze, are you trustworthy by the looks in your eye?
Stay with me
Be my dog like dollar and Richie
She convinced me
All we really need is love, strictly
Love is all we need...'Cause everybody need love

Love is all we need to make everything complete
I want to be happy yeah, want to be happy
Love is all we need, and I know that it can be done
If we can love, if we can love, everybody needs love

'Cause everybody need love!
When I feel you dreaming
I think of sunsets
How high my high gets

I wanna give to you an everlasting love
I wanna fill your life with a satisfying love
All you need is an everlasting love
All you want is a mystifying love

Sun breezes
Moonlight teases
Friendly invasion
Late night persuasion

I wanna give to you an everlasting love
I wanna fill your life with a satisfying love
All you need is an everlasting love
All you want is a mystifying love

Each time you pass me by
You saw me fade away
I'll give you more each day
Party in the Ipanema baby

I want to party
I want to samba
I want to party
I want to samba
I want to party
And live my life (my life)
I want to party (party)
And fly

Hey!

'Cause once we start it baby
Ain't no, ain't no stopping then (hey!)
'Cause I just want to live my life and party! (hey!)
All I want is to be free and rock my body (okay!)
Ain't nowhere around the world that I want to live my life
In Rio 'cause in Rio, 'cause in Rio I realize that

I want to party (party)
And fly

I'm that samba

Jonas Brothers Dear God Lyrics
Oohhh
Dear God
I hate to be a bother
But I got to say
This world is getting crazier with every day
I hope You'll hear me out now as I stop and pray

Dear God
People take Your words and try to twist them 'round
I know You can't be happy with what's going down
I'm searching for some answers
But they can't be found
Can You help me out?
Dear God
Oohhh

Dear God
Just the other night I heard somebody say
"What's the use believing in you anyway?"
I guess it was just heartache talking through the pain
It's a crying shame
Dear God
I know You're disappointed in the things we've done
Can't they see the truth that they're all running from?
Try to preach your message with a loaded gun

What they thinking of?
Dear God

Oohhh
Ooohh

Everybody's searching for an easy solution
Yeah
They can't see beyond, the selfish world they're living in
Your words of love get lost in all the confusion
Yes they do
But I still believe
Someday You're going to speak to me

Dear God
I know You've got a million other calls to take
You're dealing with a lot of things that just won't wait
But there is one request that I just got to make

Oohhh whoa
Dear God
Won't You send a sign down, just to ease my doubt
I'm trying to hear you but the silence is just to loud
I think I see a rainbow from behind the clouds
And I hear you now
Dear God
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In southern california, much like arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they pour
When i'm thinkin' 'bout you
(ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
(you know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (ooh, ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (ooh, ooh)
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool
Enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kiss you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get fly it, though
I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you
(ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
(you know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (ooh, ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (ooh, ooh)
Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget?
How you feel?
And though you were my first time
A new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul
Not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road
'til it turns from color to black and white
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (ooh, ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (ooh, ooh)
It was you
You made me love you
It was you
You made me need you
Darling darling
You made me
You made me love you
Yes you did

It was you
You made me need you
It was you
I'll never I'll never be seein' you
Darling darling
You made me you made me you made me love you

You know I love you
You know I care
Darling darling
You made me you made me you made me love you
You know I love you
You know I care
Darling darling darling darling
You made me love you
Yes you did
Yes you did
Hey baby hey baby
It was you who made me love you
Hey baby
Darling
It was you
It was you darling
It's New Math
What's a pirate minus the ship?
Just a creative homeless guy
And an anteater plus a large hungry mutant ant
An ironic way to die
And what's domain domain range
A kid with too much in his pants
And two balls, minus one
Seven titles at the Tour de France

Get's worse...
Yo, split a decision with long division
Take the circumference of your circumcision
Live like your data, when you're all set
Put it all together, and whatever you get

It's New Math
It's New Math

And what's a bag of chips divided by five?
Well that's a Nike worker's meal
And Santa Claus multiplied by i
Well I guess that makes him real
And the square root of the NBA
Is Africa in a box
How do you trace a scatter plot?
You give the pencil to Michael J. Fox
Whatever
Take the approximate moral proportion
Of the probable problem of a pro-life abortion
Live like your data, when you're all set
Put it all together, and whatever you get
It's New, It's New, It's New, It's New, It's New Math

And if you took a factor tree
Of the factors that caused my girl to leave me
You'd have a tree
Full of Asian porn
C-A-L-C-U-later
Mathematical minds make industrial smog
What's the opposite of ln(X)?
Duraflame, the unnatural log

Support the farmers with a pro-tractor
Link Kennedy and Lincoln with a common factor
Live like your data, and when you're all set
Put it all together and whatever you get
It's New, It's New, It's New

All right, word problems, ready?
If there's a fat guy in a pastry shop
With a $20 bill and he's ready to buy
In order to predict his volume change
You'll need to know the value of pi
And there's a metal train that's a mile long
And at the very back end a lightning bolt struck her
How long til it reaches and kills the driver
Provided that he is a good conductor

And if 10% of men are gay
20% of men are Chinese
What are the odds that a man chosen at random
Spends his free time and mealtime while on his knees?

And if Kim is half as old as Bobby
Who is two years older than 12 year old Tori
For how many more 30 day months
Will their threesomes be considered statutory rape?

Cos math can be sexy
Cos having sex is like quadratic expansion
If it can't be split then it's time to stop
And having sex is like doing fractions
It's improper for the larger one to be on top

Having sex is like math homework
I do it best when I'm alone in my bed
And squaring numbers are just like women
If they're under 13 just do them in your head
It's New Math
Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me
Starlight and dewdrops are awaiting thee
Sounds of the rude world heard in the day
Led by the moonlight have all passed away

Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song
List while I woo the with soft melody
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng

Beautiful dreamer awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me!

Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea
Mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelei
Over the streamlet vapors are borne
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn

Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart
E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
Ooooh, ooooh, oooh
Send me that love
I've been created for
As the sunshine is above, uh
There is someone for me, to love
Do you believe, me?
Can you, understand I'm crying
Baby baby, c'mon
Need you so!
I'll never never let you go o-ho!
Baby, baby, c'mon..
Oh darling...
I need your love
That's all I can say right here, now
Oh oh oh baby c'mon
You know I need you so
Oh darling I'll never never let you go
Baby baby oh darling, c'mon
Uh uh uh
I say: send me that love, oh darling
I've been created for
As the sunshine is above, uh uh we
There is someone who needs to love
Do you believe me?
Oh darling, can you understand I'm crying
Oh oh darling, baby baby, oh darling, oh darling
I need you tonight
/fadeout/

[Intro]
Ohh, ah, yeah
Page one

[Verse 1]
You work so hard, you really do
I don't think that anyone could ever work as hard as you
Hot desert sun, you can feel the heat
Every drop of sweat on your brow is well earned
So you best believe

[Chorus]
I got a thousand hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby
(Ooh woo)
I got a thousand hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby
(Ooh woo)

Turn the page

[Verse 2]
When you give 'em your all, and still it's only second best
You can come and lay your head upon your baby's chest
Every one of your worries
(All your worries)
All your miseries
(All your miseries)
You can put them in a little boat and ship them off to sea
'Cause

[Chorus]
I got a thousand hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby
(Ooh woo)
I got a thousand hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby
(Ooh woo)

[Spoken]
I got a thousand hugs and kisses
For when you come back home
Uh, come here!

[Bridge]
The world can be
Well to put it frankly
Such a bitch sometimes
Seems like love that lasts forever
Is kinda hard to find
Most of the people we know just lookin' for a reason to cry
As long as you got me I got your back and this is why

[Verse 3]
You work so hard, you really do
I don't think that anyone could work as hard as you
You can lock the door (lock the door)
You better turn off the phone (turn off your phone)
'Cause I'm gonna give you a thousand reasons why we need to be alone

[Ad lib]
Oh oh
Ooooh oooh
Hey baby
I got a thousand hugs for you
And when you come back home
Sugar baby

[Verse 4]
I wanna hold you
Tie you up in lace
And I wanna kiss you
Kiss you all over your face
I wanna love you all up and down
Give you love like you never had
Blindfold, gagged, and bound
I'm wanna love you, baby
One time
Two time
Three time

[Outro]
I got a thousand hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby
Love you up and love you down
Love you 'til you make them sounds

[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Love don't give no compensation
Love don't pay no bills
Love don't give no indication
Love just won't stand still

[Chorus]
Love kills, drills you through your heart
Love kills, scars you from the start
It's just a living pastime, ruining your heartline
Stays for a lifetime, won't let you go
'Cause love (Love), love (Love), love won't leave you alone

[Verse 2]
Love won't take no reservations
Love is no square deal
Hey, love don't give no justification
It strikes like cold steel

[Chorus]
Love kills, drills you through your heart
Love kills, scars you from the start
It's just a living pastime, burning your lifeline
Gives you a hard time won't let you go
'Cause love (Love), love (Love) love won't leave you alone

[Bridge]
Hey, love can play with your emotions
Open invitation to your heart
Hey, love kills
Play with your emotions
Open invitation to your heart (To your heart)
Love kills (Love kills), hey, hey
Love kills (Love kills)
Love kills, kills, kills, kills
Love can play with your emotions, open invitation

[Chorus]
Love kills, hey, drills you through your heart
Love kills, scars you from the start
It's just a living pastime, ruining your heartline
Won't let you go
Love kills, hey, drills you through your heart
Love kills, tears you right apart
It won't let go, it won't let go
Love kills, yeah

[Outro]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Sugarpie, honeybunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

In and out my life
Come and you go
Leavin' just your picture behind
And I kissed it a thousand times

When you snap your fingers
Or wink your eye, I come-a runnin' to you
I'm tied to your apron string
And there's nothing that I can do

Can't help myself
No, I can't help myself

'Coz sugarpie, honeybunch
Weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through and I've tried
But every time I see your face
I get up all choked up inside

When I call your name
Girl, it starts the flame
Burnin' in my heart, tearin' it all apart
No matter how I try, my love I cannot hide

'Coz sugarpie, honeybunch
You know that I'm weak for you
Can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

Sugarpie, honeybunch
Do anything you ask me to
Can't help myself
I want you and nobody else

Sugarpie, honeybunch
You know that I love you
Can't help myself
No, I can't help myself
All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes

Seemed a good idea
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here
Only one man could be seen
And he was old and so serene
Captain sat in his deck chair
And the red light flashed, beware
Pilot felt quite big-time
As the bomb sailed through the air
Well, they danced and sang
When the bang went bang
When the lights popped out
And the smoke began to clear
It was positively queer

All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
"Die" said the General
"Cobblers" said the man
So the Pentagon sent a cable
And the Queen a telegram
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones
Ripped apart that sand
'Til the stench was just revolting
And the sky a greenish tan
But the soldier said "Sir
There's a crack in the world"
And the figures went "squash"
And the bits flew far and wide
How the universe sighed!

All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes

All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
When the smoke had blown away
There was nothing left to view
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you
Floating high up in the sky
Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong
Lies jumped the queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design

He thinks he's well screened from the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time

He's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
He's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me

She's quite enthralled with the childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure not a she

When lovers chose each other now the perk's are due
Another memo to screw

She's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
She's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
Can you wipe your nose my child without them spotting in your file a photograph
Can you sleep alone at night wake to find the scorching light of neighbor Jim
He's come to turn you in

Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another do, do
Didn't hear it from me
I love the rain
Love the way it falls on everything
Its way of turning brown to green
And gray to blue
That's what I love about rain
That's what I love about you

I love the sun
Love the way it shines on everyone
The way it makes the morning come
And colours true
That's what I love about the sun
That's what I love about you

I don't know why mountains crumble
Or what could hold the stars apart
And I may never know but still I wonder
Why you let me in your heart

I love the rain
Love the rain it washes something clean
And pushes rivers to the sea
To fall anew
That's what I love about the rain
That's what I love about you
I don't know why mountains crumble
Or what could hold the stars apart
And I may never know but still I wonder
Why you let me in your heart

I love the rain
Love the way it washes something clean
And pushes rivers to the sea
To fall anew
That's what I love about the rain
That's what I love about you

That's what I love about the rain
That's what I love about you
Sail, sail away
There you go
To a place you know
Why not let me come along
I won't tell no one

Now our bodies have entwined
Touch me with your mind
Your dreams are a mystery
Please share them with me

Curiosity is killing me
I just got to know
Curiosity is killing me
I just got to know

Where, tell me where...
Where are you sailing?

Sail, sail away
There you go
To a place you know
Why not let me come along
I won't tell no one
Sail, sail away
Sail, sail away...
I will not fall
Once more I'm called
Time comes for all
Then dark is whole

But oh, my heart was flawed
I knew my weakness
So hold my hand
Subscribe me not to darkness

I will not speak of your sin
There is a way out for him
The mirror shows not
Your values are shot

But oh, my heart was flawed
I knew my weakness
So hold my hand
Subscribe me not to darkness

But oh, my heart was flawed
I knew my weakness
So hold my hand
Subscribe me not to darkness
And I fall short
And I fall short
And I fall short
And I fall short

But oh, my heart was flawed
I knew my weakness
So hold my hand
Subscribe me not to darkness

[Verse 1]
You can keep what you want
I want none of this
They're just bad memories
I don't want
In my sunshine (shine, shine)
You can pack it all up
And be gone
And be gone

[Verse 2]
If it matters to you
You can sell it all up
If the price feels right
I won't judge
If you get off your knees
You'll be out on the breeze
Take a lesson from me
Don't get stuck on a dream

[Intro]
What up, Jerm?
Haha, ayy

[Chorus]
Stop bitchin', stop bitchin', stop bitchin'
Stop bitchin', stop bitchin', stop bitchin'
Shit ain't gon' change, ain't nobody gon' listen
Y'all need to just stop bitchin' (Stop bitchin')
Uh

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Mac got your favorite sentence (Uh-huh)
These other bitches just table tennis (Aha)
Put some weed with some rice in this Cajun
That spicy Jamaican, I smite you for hatin'
Rap shit's nice, but I might need some Franklin's (Dollar's)
I'll be that rap all them white people playin'
The game, well, it's changin'
These radio stations controllin' them dollars (Uh-huh)
And I'm the scholar (Yeah)
Hip-hop today ain't 

[?] and paid
Dr. Dre wouldn't get The Chronic played
And that's a shame (A shame)
Just some shit I gotta handle (Handle)
I give these bitches lil' somethin' they can dance to (Cheah)
I ain't gon' be a show that gets cancelled
You ain't like what's on, change the motherfuckin' channel
My hip-hop peoples, I feel ya pain
But it ain't no reason to just sit and complain (Uh-huh)
On a track, sayin' "Fuck rap, all of it's wack"
'Cause cream muhfuckers said, "It's all for the cash" (Cash)
So for ya single, sing a lil' jingle
Then you can stack chips like Pringles (Haha)
It ain't hard, it's easy, it's magic
Dance, do a backflip, make some cool ad-libs (Yeah!)
Once you see that check that you like, say "Fuck it"
And go back to blessin' the mics
It's hip-hop forever, but it's stressin' to fight
And money makes it easier to rest here at night
Hatin' on Soulja Boy? It shouldn't happen
Look at him laughin' (Haha), he know he ain't that good at rappin'
You can hate but it ain't gon' solve shit (Solve shit)
Hip-hop's the culture, it's gon' evolve quick
There's some music I don't bump and bang
But it is what it is, let 'em do they thang

[Chorus]
Stop bitchin', stop bitchin', stop bitchin'
Stop bitchin', stop bitchin', stop bitchin'
Shit ain't gon' change, ain't nobody gon' listen
Y'all need to just stop bitchin' (Stop bitchin')
Uh

[Verse 2]
And a lot of cats sulk and won't fuck with this new shit (Uh)
But, ayo fam, music is music (Music)
Y'all need to stop bitchin', give this shit a listen (Listen)
Some of these cats is actually spittin' (Spittin')
There's a lot of wack cats in the game
But it ain't no reason to hate on they name
Worry 'bout yourself, let 'em do what they do (Do)
Soon it's out with the old and in with the new
Most cats is only hot for six months (Six months)
But real hip-hip is gon' be around forever (Forever)
What sell is gon' change every day, it's basically the same as the weather (The weather)
And big ups to everybody who spit it from the heart (Heart)
You do it for the real and you live for the art (Art)
Sayin', "Hip-hop's dead" is gettin' played out
Everybody just lookin' on how to get they name out
Some shit to dance with? That's what's up too
But it ain't it the same shit you smokin' blunts to
Fuck bein' famous, who cares if you make it
Just make the music that you love and stop hatin'

[Chorus]
Stop bitchin', stop bitchin', stop bitchin'
Stop bitchin', stop bitchin', stop bitchin'
Shit ain't gon' change, ain't nobody gon' listen
Y'all need to just stop bitchin' (Stop bitchin')
Uh
In mornings she's so regal that the valley sighs
In the chilly sea that killed her real slows
Now we're swimming up farther with the doll by our sides
Fill the cup with these sleepy souls

Shimi Kapoor
It's clear that some things never take
Shimi Kapoor

With such feats like sex only brought upon
Ooh lady, ooh baby, maybe I'll live my lies alone

Have you met Dolores? She's queen of the forest
Have you met Olivia? Her I'd gladly give ya
Have you met the queen, the rulah, Tallulah
For that gal Tallulah I would fight a duela
I would climb a hillah, I'll paddle to Priscilla
But this is getting sillah, I'm getting lots of thrillah, Tallulah
When she starts to lock on to a man to love she wants to fricassee
No one doing the hula, can do what Tallulah can do to me
I have met Fatima (Fatima is a schemma)
I have met Marquita (Marquita is a cheeta)
I have met Jemima, she's a social climba
I have met Ophelia, she will double deal ya
Just one girl is Trullah, I'll take Tallulah
Now here you go again
You say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should
Play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
They say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

Now here I go again
I see the crystal vision
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to
Wrap around your dreams and
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Ooh, what you lost
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
They say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know
You'll know
You will know
Oh, you'll know
Show me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say, forever gaze, if only
Beauty roams to an endless love
There's no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
There's nowhere to run, I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body and soul
How can it be you're asking me
To feel the things you never show?
Tell me why can't I be there where you are
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

[Intro: Harry Belafonte, Odetta]
I now have the pleasure to sing with Mr. Belafonte

Henry? Oh, Henry? (Yes, Liza)
Could you fetch the water? (Go fetch the water?)

[Verse: Harry Belafonte, Odetta]
There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza
There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, a hole

Well, fix it dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry
So fix it dear Henry, dear Henry, fix it

With what shall I fix it, dear Liza, dear Liza
With what shall I fix it, dear Liza, with what?

With straw, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry
With straw, dear Henry, dear Henry, with straw

But the straw is too long, dear Liza, dear Liza
The straw is too long, dear Liza, too long
Cut it dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry
Well, cut it dear Henry, dear Henry, cut it!

With what shall I cut it, dear Liza, dear Liza
With what shall I cut it, dear Liza, with what?
With an axe, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry
With an axe, dear Henry, with an axe

The axe is too dull, dear Liza, dear Liza
The axe is too dull, dear Liza, too dull

Sharpen it, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry
Well, sharpen it dear Henry, dear Henry, hone it!

On what shall I sharpen it, dear Liza, dear Liza
On what shall I hone it, dear Liza, with what?
On a stone, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry
On a stone, dear Henry, dear Henry, on a stone
But the stone is too dry, dear Liza, dear Liza
The stone is too dry, dear Liza, too dry
Well, wet it, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry
Well, wet it dear Henry, dear Henry, wet it

Ha ha ha, with what shall I wet it, dear Liza, dear Liza
With what shall I wet it, dear Liza, with what?
Try water, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry
Try water, dear Henry, dear Henry, use water
In what shall I fetch it, dear Liza, dear Liza
In what shall I fetch it, dear Liza, in what?
In a bucket dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry
In a bucket, dear Henry, dear Henry, in a bucket
There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza
There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, a hole

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You just popped in the Lil Jon remix of "The Workout Plan", and
And 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
And here come the 5 to the 7 and 6
I dropped out of college, I can't count worth shit
When the album dropped I was dissing this
Now everybody know this the shit
Part 2, this the update
First rule: stay away from the cupcakes
The second rule is so underrated
They claim the song was so degradin'
"But shit it's still my favorite
And he ain't talkin' 'bout me though"
Hello, then who I'm talking about, people?
OK, whatever you want to believe though
And I even took my own advice
This gut ain't nothing these hoes’ll like
I said, I look like LL
Took my shirt off, she claimed "I can't tell"
But never say I can't sell
Pat, where we at right now, 3 mil?
Who the best? Who the best now?
OK leave me out of it
Tell me who the rest now?
Who the rest now?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
‘Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

[Verse 2: Twista & Kanye West]
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set Twista said... said... said...

They call me the Twista, now work that Motha'Fucka
But not to hard, baby you can do what you do
Cause I like a fat ass, but 

[1?]
So, if you could drop it to the floor go and 

[?]
So, its crush time, Shawty show me you can do so
Now gon’ work it, put down the philly steaks
Hit the 

[?] like five dro from 

[?]
I know you love how my Lexus ride
But get them with them legs, don’t flex them thighs
You know want it, don’t testify
Try my New Workout Plan called Sex-ercise
That’s real
You don’t wanna go a day without me
She don’t really wanna lay without me
I know you love when I'm workin' it in now, baby we can work it out

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

[Verse 3: Farnsworth Bentley]
B-E-N-T-L-E-Y
Yee ain't know, you betta ask somebody
What we gonna do is twirk that body
All day at they fitness party
Lock them doors, don't tell nobody
Gentlemens in the Gentlemen's Club
And hitting them with an interesting dub
It's upside down that for the A-Town
What...y'all...sayin?
F.J. Bentley caught misbehaving
Yes I'm the captain and I'm saving, all my money
Yes I'm just gonna...stand...and watch you dance from over here
Matter fact pass the Couvorsier
But I will walk you to your car my dear
Cheers

[Chorus: Kanye West]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
‘Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out

Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

[Outro: Luke]
Work it out, work it out, girl

[Verse 1]
Lady luck sure smiled on me
When she blessed me with your loving charms
I've found my place in the sun
With heaven right here in your arms
I feel so lucky, so lucky, baby
Oh, lucky to be loved by you
And I wanna thank you, thank you, baby
For all the little loving things you do

[Chorus]
I've got to tell the world about it
I've got to stand right up and shout it
(Hey) Look at lucky me
Ooh baby, ooh baby

[Verse 2]
I don't mind stormy weather
The rain no longer makes me blue
And I don't care when my friends all get together
And leave me out of everything they do
It's alright if the sun don't shine
It's impossible to darken my day
Makes no difference if I don't have a dime
I'll be wealthy anyway

[Chorus]
Hmm, I'm no good without you
But listen baby, as long as I got you
(Hey) Lucky, lucky me, hey, ooh baby

[Verse 3]
In my life, there's no misfortunes
No struggle or strife today
You're my lucky charm, my guiding star
So just smile and chase my blues away
I can't help it, baby, you're so wonderful
Oh, how lucky can one man be
Oh, your tenderness and sweet caress
And it all belongs to me

[Chorus]
I wanna tell the world about it
I wanna stand right up and shout it
(Hey) Look at lucky me, well

[Outro]
So lucky, baby, I've been blessed
Fate sure smiled at me, oh baby
I'm lucky, lucky, yeah, woo
Sail away, sail away home
Sail away, till you are gone
You have so far to go
There's so much that you don't know

Dream away, see what you find yea
Dream away, it's all in your mind
Things that you like to see
Things that you like to be

Don't you know, it seems so wrong yea
Don't you know, it's gone on too long
I can't take the guns any more
I can't take the screams any more

I can't take the pain
It's got to stop, it's got to change
It can't go on, it can't go on

Don't you know, it's gone on too long, yes
Don't you know, it seems so wrong
I can't take the guns any more
I can't take the screams any more
I can't take the pain
It's got to stop, it's got to change
It can't go on, it can't go on

We'll find a way
I know you can
We'll find a way
I give you my hand

We're on our way back home
We've been a long time gone

Sail away, sail away home
Sail away, sail away home yea
Sail away, sail away home
Sail away, sail away home yea
Sail away
Somewhere, my love, there will be songs to sing
Although the snow covers the hopes of Spring
Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold
And there are dreams, all that your heart can hold
Someday we'll meet again, my love
Someday whenever the Spring breaks through

You'll come to me out of the long-ago
Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow
Till then, my sweet, think of me now and then
Godspeed, my love, till you are mine again

[Jazz instrumental-first four lines]

Someday we'll meet again, my love
I said "someday whenever that Spring breaks through"

You'll come to me out of the long-ago
Warm as the wind, and as soft as the kiss of snow
Till then, my sweet, think of me now and then
Godspeed, my love, till you are mine again!
Wrapped, Packaged
Pleasing to the eye
Advertised, Brainwashed
You're ready to buy

Want not need
Consumer greed

Don't know where it came from
And don't really care
As long as there's more
As long as it's there
Everyone has one
Why haven't I?
Saw it on TV
Just gotta buy!

Want not need
Consumer greed
Be my girl, be my girl, oh oh be my girl
I want you to be my girl
Baby you got the love I needed
?girl to be with you, be my girl
I want you to be my girl

Baby choose it, but still refuse it
And it?s foolish, I?m cool in
I don?t know if she know what I?m doing
I?m rule in, pushing game around like a ..
Taking ? table clueless
My jewelry keep in jewel I?m improving
I?m used to be such a .. what a difference
? all I need to do is go around with
..we can make history, so I can be a president ..of the history, history
Adios amigo, your beauty amazes me give a lady for Gucci

You just the girl I?ve been looking for

You just the girl I?ve been searching for

[Verse 1]
Lonely people gathering there to be one
Gonna be the last time wasted
Gonna be seen to be gone
Run a mile for the minute
Gonna mind another day without you in it and you

[Chorus]
You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
No, you
You promised me paradise

[Verse 2]
All my days of loving you under my skin
Gonna be a wild, wild world
When nobody wants to give in
Gonna call me on the hour
Gonna mind if I don't hear it
I would hate to be you

[Chorus]
You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
No, you
You promised me paradise

[Bridge]
Can you tell me if there's gonna be another reason to cry
Will I be the last to know
Unless we make another way of doing what we do we won't believe it anymore
Will I be the one to cry

[Verse 3]
Problems, problems haunting me, circle my head
Gonna be a wild world, let me hide away under your bed
Run a mile for the minute
Gonna mind another day without you in it and you

[Chorus]
You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
No, you
You promised me paradise
You promised me paradise

[Outro]
Ahhh...
Ahhh...
You promised me paradise
You promised me paradise
You promised me paradise
You promised me paradise

[Verse 1]
I can't read and I can't write down
I don't know a book from countdown
I don't care which shadow gets me
All I've got is someone's face

[Verse 2]
Can I see the family smile?
Can I reach tomorrow?
Can I walk a missing mile?
Can I feel?
Can I please?

[Chorus]
I can't reach it anymore
I just sit back and ignore
I just can't seem to get it right, get it right
I can't reach it, I can't reach it
Where are you
Where have you gone without me
I thought you cared about me
Where are you

Where's my heart
Where is the dream we started
I can't believe we're parted
Where are you

When we said good-bye love
What had we to gain
When I gave you my love
Was it all in vain

All life through
Must I go on pretending
Where is my happy ending
Where are you

When we said good-bye love
What had we to gain
When I gave you my love
Was it all in vain
All life through
Must I go on pretending
Where is that happy ending
Where are you
Where are you
See here's the thing

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig the attitude and how you're actin' like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travie and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me?
Hmm, that sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burgulary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some naked peekaboo
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Such an angel with a devilish angle
I'm quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl
And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Now here's another bar, I'm coming for the slow gunners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your mom and 'em
No turning back so you better buckle up
Shit, don't be concerned with mine
I feel like a Speak and Spell way I got you learning my lines
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I change my name to "Did He Really Just Say That Shit?"
Yep
I'll take a mile if you let me
6-5, 200 plus and so sexy
My legs going numb for keeping my phone on vibrate
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been tryin' to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

[Verse]
Good god girl, you're giving me goosebumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you
It's not a scam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan, I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like the antidote's under my tongue
Whoa

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Damn
There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes

And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say, "Brandy, fetch another round"
She serves them whiskey and wine

The sailors say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)
"Yeah your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea"
(Dooda-dit-dooda)
(Dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)

Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of the man that Brandy loves
He came on a summer's day
Bringin' gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home

The sailor saidn "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)
"But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"
(Dooda-dit-dooda)
(Dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)

Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes
When he told his sailor stories
She could feel the ocean foam rise
She saw its ragin' glory

But he had always told the truth, lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand
(Dooda-dit-dooda)
(Dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)

At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say
She hears him say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)
"But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"
(Dooda-dit-dooda)
(Dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)

"Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)

"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)
"But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"

[Hook: Estelle]
I guess I'm guilty 'til proven innocent
And I'll be gone before they know what I hit em' with
And this predicament is pure coincidence
Oh brother here comes another incident
I guess I'm guilty 'til proven innocent
And I'll be gone before they know what I hit em' with
And this predicament is pure coincidence
Oh brother here comes another incident
And if you're innocent, let me see you two step
Come on, let me see you two step
And if you're innocent, let me see you two step
Come on, let me see you two step, yeah

[Verse 1]
Slam the gavel Judge Judy got a grudge
Interrogating me for days on end and I won't budge
I'm on some Eddie Murphy raw "Baby it wasn't me" shiz
Wrong place, wrong time, I was there but I didn't see shit
And you can throw the book at me and I'm a throw it right back
Slap the district attorney and ask him "How you like that? "
Then I'm a jump in front of the jury like my life is in your hands
Then break each and all their fingers just to make em' understand
This is obviously a case of mistaken identity
Plus this face is too pretty to be in a penitentiary
Paranoid like Chris and Snoop was out to kill me
Walkin' on a thin wire. Why they tryin' to Marlo Stanfield me?

[Hook: Estelle]
I guess I'm guilty 'til proven innocent
And I'll be gone before they know what I hit em' with
And this predicament is pure coincidence
Oh brother here comes another incident
I guess I'm guilty 'til proven innocent

And this predicament is pure coincidence
Oh brother here comes another incident
And if you're innocent, let me see you two step
Come on, let me see you two step
And if you're innocent, let me see you two step
Come on, let me see you two step, yeah

[Verse 2]
And I think it went down like this
All I remember was the studio, next thing you know everything goes black
I woke up in the back of a squad car
Handcuffed until they threw my ass behind bars
I never claimed to be an angel, I just makin' music
Something a little different you can bob your head to it
If that's crime, then fuck it, I'll do the time
But they tryin' to give me 25 to life for every line
Go ahead and lock me up, throw away the key
But just imagine the monster you gonna make of me
And the moment that we all feared
Guilty on all charges for the dopest album of the year!

[Hook: Estelle]
I guess I'm guilty 'til proven innocent
And I'll be gone before they know what I hit em' with
And this predicament is pure coincidence
Oh brother here comes another incident
I guess I'm guilty 'til proven innocent
And I'll be gone before they know what I hit em' with
And this predicament is pure coincidence
Oh brother here comes another incident

[Bridge: Estelle]
I'm innocent, ooh
I'm innocent, ooh
I'm innocent, ooh
I'm innocent, ooh

[Hook: Estelle]
I guess I'm guilty 'til proven innocent

And if you're innocent, let me see you two step
Come on, let me see you two step, yeah
(Ronnie VanZant -- Gary Rossington)

Why are you praying, my sweet morning dove
You're so afraid, but so hungry for love
Well I can give you love baby
Hugs and kisses, I can give you everything that you been missing
Just don't be afraid, oh
Sweet little missy

She's twenty years old and a full grown woman
Sure enough
I'm the one that wants her
Are you ready for love
Well I'm the one that wants you forever and a day
Come on baby, what'd you say
Just don't be afraid, oh
Sweet little missy

Sweet little missy
She's saving her love
But givin' us hope like the Lord up above
This ain't the worst thing she'll ever do
'Cause like a dollar bill you can't take it with you
Well I'm the one that wants you forever and a day
Come on baby, what'd you say
Just don't be afraid, oh
Sweet little missy

She's so damn pretty, I can't take it no more
You and me babe, giving my soul for sure
Well I can give you love baby
Hugs and kisses, I can give you everything that you been missing
Just don't be afraid, oh
Sweet little missy

Sweet little missy
She's saving her love
But givin' us hope like the Lord up above
This ain't the worst thing you'll ever do
'Cause like a dollar bill you can't take it with you
Six numbers one more to dial
Before I'm before you I tried to call
Been busy all night gave up waiting at daylight
Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can?
Though we both know that the worst part about it
As I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
Oh, I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
One of the many
But one of the few
To stand back and wait for you
Excuse me, Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can?
Though we both know that the worst part about it
As I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me, if you wanted me
Oh, I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
Life as the man on the side
I fell in love with a dream that I built of you
Playing the part of the queen
Taking my own advice, I'm giving up tonight
Good luck to you and the king
Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil in?
Though we both know that the worst part about it
As I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me, if you wanted me
I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man you know life as the man
Living life as the man on the side

[Verse 1]
All my life I've kept my feelings deep inside
Never was a reason to let somebody know
"Lover here, lover there" - Who cried? Who cared? Foolish pride
"Never was a good seat at any of this man's shows"

[Chorus 1]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus 2]
But now I've got to let it go
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go
Lay back and let my feelings show
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel

[Verse 2]
All my life this heart's been under lock and key
My curtains were drawn, there wasn't nobody home
Trigger here, Trigger there - everybody's high except for me
Better off dead if I couldn't be alone

[Chorus 1]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus 2]
But now I've got to let it go
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go
Lay back and let my feelings show
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel

[Verse 3]
Fourteen years and tears I've longed to sing my song
But a horse couldn't drag your ass to put me on
But now I've got an army and we're three million strong
This song will ring in your ears when we are gone

[Chorus 1]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus 2]
But now I've got to let it go
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go
Lay back and let my feelings show
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel

[Outro]
I am ready for the real (Come a little closer)

(let it go)
(Lay back an' let the vibe just flow)
..and I’m a fool
Each star’s a pool of water, cool clear water
But with the dawn I’ll wake and yawn
And carry on to water
Cool, clear water

The shadows sway and seem to say
“Tonight we pray for water
Cool, clear water.”
And way up there He’ll hear our prayer
And show us where there’s water
Cool, clear water

Keep a-movin’, Dan, don’t you listen to him, Dan
He’s a devil not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can you see that big green tree
Where the water’s running free
And it’s waiting there for you and me
Cool, clear water
Dan’s feet are sore, he’s yearning for
Just one thing more than water
Cool, clear water
Like me, I guess, he’d like to rest
Where there’s no quest for water
Cool, clear water
I wake up and got four or five bitches in the bed

Before I learned to call your name
Now you're in love with someone else
I know that's gonna drive me insane

Oh, baby, you sure look good to me
Please tell me, pretty mama
Who can your great new lover be?

[Verse 1: Ryan Dusick]
Living easy, lovin' free
Season ticket, on a one - way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too

[Chorus: Ryan Dusick]
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

[Verse 2: Ryan Dusick]
No stop signs, speedin' limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me 'round
Hey Satan! Paid my dues
Playin' in a rockin' band
Hey Mama! Look at me
I'm on my way to the promise land

[Chorus: Ryan Dusick]
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell

[Chorus: Ryan Dusick]

Highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell

[Outro: Ryan Dusick]
And I'm goin' down... ahh, all the way!
I'm on the highway to hell
Thank you, have a good night!
Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods, among the evergreens
There stand a country cabin, made of tar and wood
Where lives a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read or write a book so well
He could play his guitar just like a-ringing the bell

Go, go, go, Johnny, go, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Aah - Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees by the railroad track
Oh, sitting and a-playing in the shade
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by used to stop and say:
"My, but how that country boy could play"

Go, go, go, Johnny, go, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Aah - Johnny B. Goode
Ooh

Well, his mama told him, "Someday, you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music till the sun goes down
Maybe someday, your name will be in lights
Saying: 'Johnny B. Goode tonight' "

Go, go, go, Johnny, go, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Johnny B. Goode
All you need to do is say this little word
I know it sounds absurd but it's true
The magic in the mantra will give you the answer
And swallow this that's all you gotta do

Everything you need is here
And everything that's not here is not there
And if if there's something missing in this God almighty plan
Could it be you need a woman?

All you need to do is say this little word
I know it sounds absurd but it's true
The magic in the mantra will give you the answer
Just swallow this that's all you gotta do

Everything you need is here
But everything that's not here is not there
And if there's something missing in this God almighty plan
Could it be you need a woman?

Well all you need to do is say this little word
I know it sounds absurd but it's true
The magic in the mantra will give you the answer
And swallow this that's all you gotta do
Take three times a day after every meal

All you need to do is say this little word
I know it sounds absurd but it's true
The magic in the mantra will give you the answer
And swallow this that's all you gotta do
You think you're so way out
And you got all the action
Still you can't find no satisfaction
Baby - try me, and I'll make you see

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
Ah ah, at all

You like to kiss and run
And that's where it is
'Cause somebody told you
Love was heartaches and tears
Baby, although you're free
I'll make you see

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Oh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
You ain't livin' at all
To be in love, I know it's not your ambition
But before you go, think about my proposition
You may conquer the world and be king on a throne
But you still ain't nobody, baby
When you're sittin' all alone

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
Ooooh Babe
Don't leave me now
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you Babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends
Ooooh Babe
Don't leave me now
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
Ooooh Babe
Don't leave me now
How can you treat me this way
Running away
Ooooh Babe
Why are you running away?
Ooooooh babe
Ooooooh babe
Ooooooh babe

Stop! In The Name Of Love
Before you break my heart

Baby, baby, I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet
This time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
(Think it over) After I've been good to you?
(Think it over) After I've been sweet to you?

Stop! In The Name Of Love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In The Name Of Love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?
But this time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(Think it over) Haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over) Haven't I been sweet to you?
Stop! In The Name Of Love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In The Name of Love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you'll stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever

Stop! In The Name Of Love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In The Name Of Love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In The Name Of Love
Before you break my heart
Yes the nights are so long, baby, and the days are so blue
Seems like everything has gone wrong
Baby 'cause I'm without you
I guess this is that awful feeling
Baby that feeling they call the blues

All by myself baby, yes I began to weep
Yes, and when I dry my eyes, baby
You know I still can't sleep
Yes, I guess this is the feeling
Baby the feeling they call the blues

Yes as I sit here in my dark room, woman
With the tears running down my face
Yes as I sit here in my dark room, woman
With the tears running down my face
Yes I can feel and I can see you, woman
I can see you all over the place

Yes, then I start walkin', woman
Start walkin' all over the floor
Yes, my heart is telling me, woman
Tellin' me you won't be here no more
Oh, I guess this is the feeling
Baby the feeling, the feeling they call the blues

True love is one thing I've been dreaming of
I give my love to you. And when I do
You are to me, the very deepest part of me

I am the world
I am the sky
I am the sea
I'm anything that you want me to be

When you hurt me, then I become the night time
The shadows in my eyes don't make it good for
Me to see the way I should

I am the world
I am the sky
I am the sea
I'm anything that you want me to be
I'm the sun, I'm the falling rain
I'm the kind of man that you can't explain

I am the world
I am the world
Dearest Esmeralda, in another age
Antiques would be modern, we would be the rage
Silk would be in fashion, we would dress in lace
Love would be the passion and the saving grace

I slept one rainy night with you in Paris
Made up for a thousand wasted years
Dearest Esmeralda, you are magic
I close my eyes and you make love appear

Dancing in the shimmer of a crystal chandelier
Shadows singin' so low only we could hear
Moving to the glimmer, shaking to the storm
Outside it was raging, but inside it was warm

We said goodnight in the candlelight and thunder
Now I wake and find you're never there
I'm becoming old enough to wonder
Happy that I'm still too young to care

Masterpieces crumble, empires tumble down
Refugees and fantasies go underground
Romance lasts forever, love don't fade away
They may take our future, but they don't stop yesterday
‘Cause somewhere in the cloudy skies of Paris
We were part of some artist's design
Dearest Esmeralda, you are magic
In the gray around me how you shine

Oh oh, how you shine
Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
When I try, I'm just wastin' my time
Lord, I've tried and I've tried, all night long I've cried
But I can't get you off of my mind

And you think you would leave me behind
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind
Do you think that it's smart to jump from heart to heart
When I can't get you off of my mind?

Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
When I try, I'm just wastin' my time
Lord, I've tried and I've tried, all night long I've cried
But I can't get you off of my mind

You believe that a true love is blind
So you fool every new love you find
You've got stars in your eyes but they can't hide the lies
Oh, I can't get you off of my mind

But I can't get you off of my mind
When I try, I'm just wastin' my time
Lord, I've tried and I've tried, all night long I've cried
But I can't get you off of my mind
Skiddily beat bop we rock
Steady over kicks and snares
So what you scared for unprepared for
Tunnel rat schematics far from your average rappers new era
We rockin' sewer caps

Breathin' bricks exhale trainrail city life at its finest with
That nonsense behind us
This is how we do it
I'm just a hooligan get drunk while in a j spittin raw sewage

Splinter cell movements. turnstyle jumper
Punks step up to get beat down bumper
Alias and bright colors
So bright leave you cryin' like late night mothers
Hover board kick flips
Landin' a little to the left
As you can bet every result was a split lip
Skip school make shortcuts
Act foolish like kids with the windows on the short bus
CHORUS: (X 2)
Welcome to shellshock
Ringin' in your ears like the bells that el rock
It doesn't matter whether or not the cell locks
If you can find silence in the coldest cell block
This is shellshock

Welcome to shellshock

I did it my way
Sat back and let 'em live soft
So he can die hard yippie kye yay
We exist in circles
So the first grader to push me gets boxed like girl scout cookies
This is not a test
(we don't trust you)
Not a fan of men
(that rock ugg boots)
I don't understand
(Can you blame me?)
I guess that's just the way
(Ma pop's raised me)

A penny for a thought, a nickel for a swift fist to the face
For letting them think that I let my players go to waste (no)
Top of the food chain but way too cool to not drop a little
Sarcasm in your water main
D-Did i stutter man
C-could you please make a toast for the kicker cause you know
I'm spittin' water man
Same day, new day dismantle
Same Travie time
Same Travie channel
CHORUS REPEAT X6

Yo Momma's breath smells like rusty pennies!
Yo Momma's breath smells like salamander stew
Yo Momma drink country club out of the bottle, a baby bottle
Yo Momma Smells diseased
Yo Momma got leprosy in gold nikes
Yo Momma smells like a problem Hah
BOO
Yo Momma got 6 elbows... and she got... BOOO
Yo Momma smells like the inside of this recording booth!
Your eyes are blue, your kisses too
I never knew what they could do
I can't believe that you're in love with me

You are telling everyone I know
I'm on your mind each place you go
They can't believe that you're in love with me

I have always placed you far above me
I just can't imagine that you love me

After all is said and done
To think that I'm the lucky one
Cannot believe that you're in love with me

I have always placed you way up there above me
Could never imagine that you love me

And after all is said and done
To think that I'm the only one
I can't believe that you're in love
Can't believe that you're in love
Can't believe that you're in love with me
Whoa whoa

Mermaid (that's right)
Mermaid (mermaid...)
Mermaid in mermaid
Mermaid

Mermaid murmur into my ear
The answers to questions I want you to hear
Like does it relax you to hear the sound of the land? (whoa oh)
Do you all mermaid have slight webbed hands? (that must be freaky)

Is it normal for a guy to wear scuba apparatus when he makes love in the sea? (make love to me)
Make love to him
Would it be weird for you if I touched your fishy half? cause it would for me

Whoa whoa
Waii-yah, waii-ya
Whoa whoa
Ooh ah ooh ooh
Do you have mermaid parties beneath the sea? (and am I invited?)
At these mermaid parties do you smoke seaweed? (if so, then how do you light it?)
Are you the answer to a drunken sailor's lonely wish? (shhh)
Or are you an optical illusion caused by a woman sitting on a rock, holding half a fish? (half a shapely halibut)

(everybody) whoa whoa
Waii-yah, waii-ya
Whoa whoa
Ooh ah ooh ooh

[pause]

Oh fish-like lady!
Oh lady-like fish!
I don't think so bro, she's a lady lady lady lady lady
No no she's a fish that's just a little bit lady-ish! (yeah)

Speaking:

Jermaine: You wish. Fish is your favorite dish
Bret: Let me let you in on a secret: that night the mermaid and I, we had a little bit of dinner together
J: Oh yeah, what did you have?
B: (beat) ...Caviar
J: Oh ya see? She's a lady! (Cymbals Crash in a "TSS!" sound)
B: Yeah well she would have been if she hadn't laid them! (TSS!) (yeah!)
J: But surely, surely Bret the fact that she has breasts would indicate that she's, um, capable of producing milk for her young? Um, making her a mammal, you know, mammary glands making her a woman, really, um and in effect, a lady. (TSS!)
B: Well, let's just say she definitely had breasts! (TSS!) (Ooh! Ow! Yeah, ooh!) (TSS!)
J: How did you know? Did you grope her? (TSS!)
B: (Ooh!) No way, she'd have battered me! (TSS!) She'd only just left school! (TSS!) (ooh! thank you, yeah!)
One two three four!
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Waiiiiiiioooo, waiiiiioooo
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

We were talking
About the space between us all
And the people

Who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late
When they pass away

We were talking
About the love we all could share
When we find it

To try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world
If they only knew

Try to realize it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you
Enihsnus
Enihsnus ho

[Verse 1]
The strange setting of our story
Represented nothing but a super falling star
The landscape was no mystery
The idea of a mind so vain, at the point of infinity

[Chorus]
I've seen it, I've heard it
I've seen it, I've heard it
I've seen it, I've heard it
I've seen it, I've heard it

The last look is in my eyes
Take a shape in my eye
Take a shape in my eye

[Verse 2]
Whatever enters the eye will see
Let the hand go for it, grasp it
It is stranger than setting enough
It will leave them with a pounding dream

[Chorus]
I've seen it, I've heard it
I've seen it, I've heard it
I've seen it, I've heard it
I've seen it, I've heard it

The last look is in my eyes
Take a shape in my eye
Take a shape in my eye
New York, New York
Or a village in Iowa
The only difference is the name
If you're alone
Whether on Main Street
Or on Broadway
If you're alone
They are both the same
A town's a lonely town
When you pass through
And there is no one waiting there for you
Then it's a lonely town
You wander up and down
The crowds rush by
A million faces pass before your eyes
Still it's a lonely town
Unless there's love
A love that's shining
Like a harbor light
You're lost in the night
Unless there's love
The world's an empty place
And every town's
A lonely town
Oh, Claudia, don't take it away, girl, if you leave me this way
I'm gonna search night and day to find your love
Oh Claudia, don't take it this way
What kind of bad mistake is worth our saying goodbye?

The last time we vowed we would not part, my love
And so take heart, my love, don't let it end this way
Remember the good things that we shared, my dear
And so take care, my dear, don't throw our love away

Oh Claudia, girl don't leave it this way, it's gonna take both me and you
But we can see this thing through and save our love
Oh Claudia, don't take it away, girl can't you see it's all wrong?
Till you come back where you belong, I need you babe

The last time we vowed we would not part, my love
And so take heart ,my love don't let it end this way
Remember the good things that we share, my dear
And so take care, my dear don't throw our love away

This last thing I've tried to keep inside myself
I never told you so but girl you ought to know I'm your man
Don't take it away, girl if you leave me this way
I'm gonna search night and day till I find your love
Hey Claudia, don't take it away

I know I should pity me
But I don't because, you see
I have loved and I have learned
And as far as I'm concerned

I should care
I should go around weeping
I should care
I should go without sleeping

Strangely enough I sleep well
'Cept for a dream or two
But, then, I count my sheep well
Funny how sheep can tell you to sleep, so

I should care
I should let it upset me
I should care
But it just doesn't get me
Maybe I should find
Someone as lovely as you
But I should care
And I do

Flash Gordon: This isn't happening, Dale. We're not here. It's just a bad dream
Dale: Oh, I agree completely. Why, we'll wake up any minute in our car and have a laugh about all this

This 

[?]
He was stranded in some tiny town
On fair Prince Edward Isle
Awaitin' for a ship to come and find him
A one-horse place, a friendly face
Some coffee and a tiny trace
Of fiddlin' in the distance far behind him

A dime across the counter then
A shy hello, a brand new friend
A walk along the street in the wintry weather
A yellow light, an open door
And a welcome friend, there's room for more
And then they're standing there inside together

He said I've heard that tune before somewhere
But I can't remember when
Was it on some other friendly shore
Or did I hear it on the wind
Was it written on the sky above
I think I heard it from someone I loved
But I never heard it sound so sweet since then
Now his feet begin to tap
A little boy says I'll take your hat
He's caught up in the magic of her smile
And leap the heart inside him went
And off across the floor he sent
His clumsy body graceful as a child

He said there's magic in the fiddler's arm
There's magic in this town
There's magic in the dancers' feet
And the way they put them down
People smilin' everywhere
Boots and ribbons, locks of hair
And laughter and old blue suits and easter gowns

Now the sailors' gone, the room is bare
The old piano settin' there
Someone's hat's left hanging on the rack
And empty chairs, the wooden floor
That feels the touch of shoes no more
Awaitin' for the dancers to come back

And the fiddle's in the closet
Of some daughter of the town
The strings are broke and the bow is gone
And the cover's buttoned down
But sometimes on December nights
When the air is cold and the wind is right
There's a melody that passes through this town
I'm glad to see you back, baby
You been gone such a long, long time
And now that you're back, baby
Let's make up for long lost time
Well, the day that you left me, baby
I nearly went out of my mind
I couldn't hardly sleep at night, baby
Every morning I woke up crying

So let's get down to business
Yeah, let's get down to business
Well, let's get down to business, baby
You been gone such a long time

Now I know that I love you, baby
And I thought that you loved me, too
Now, now that we're together, baby
Tell me what are you going to do
Well, what made us break up, baby
I don't know till today
But if it was my fault, baby
I swear I'll change my ways
So let's get down to business
Yeah, let's get down to business
Well, let's get down to business, baby
You been gone such a long time

Hey, let's, let's
Let's get down to business, baby
Well, well, well
Let's get down to business
Yeah, let's get down to business, baby
You been gone such a long time

I know that I love you, baby
I say I thought that you loved me, too
Now, now we're together, baby
What are you going to do
I said whatever made us break up, baby
I don't know till today
But if it was my fault, baby
I swear I'll change my ways

So let's get down to business
Yeah, let's get down to business
Well, let's get down to business, baby
You been gone such a long time
(Chorus:)
Afromans pimpin Pennsylvania
If you don't know how to suck, I'll train ya
Flyin down the 76 like a 76er
Between the turn table keep the Colt 45 in the mixer.)

Chillin With My girl in Pittsburgh
Fuckin her tits whiles I hit the herb
Fucking her friend in State College
No degree, just ghetto knowledge
She's from Penn State
I'm from the State penn

I'm afro mutherfuckin M A N
Getting licked by a girl in Lancaster
Leavin her face a complete disaster
Pots Town, Weeds Ville
Pennsylvania getin high for real
Betty with the Gettysburg Address
I raised her dress and left a mess
This girl from Altoona
I opened her legs, it was all tuna
I met this girl from Clearfield
When the coast was clear, I fucked her in the field
(Repeat Chorus:)
Just up in the city of brotherly love
What a bunch of Faggots
I'm just playin damn
You know I like Randall Cunningham
Dr. J, Charles Barkley
Iverson, I ain't done
The Fresh Prince, Jazzy Jeff
Schooly D, smokin blunts to death

So Dr. J, fuck that J
Roll me a Philly for the city of Philly
We used to be boys but we turned them in with the munchies
Eatin Philly Cheese steak again

Who's that smoking by the liberty Bell?
It's Afroman from East Palmdale
Signing the declaration of independence from our dependence

(Repeat Chorus:)
Lauren, from the city of Warren told me I was boring
I pimp slapped Lauren now I got Lauren out there whoren
Met this girl form Grove City, as I drove, she flashed her titties
I dropped her off in Clarion, Slapped her on her ass, said carry on

Took my hoes to Johnstown, they jumped out the car, sucked the Johns down
Fucked this girl, form Kittaning, while she was in the backyard tanning
Met this girl form Chevy Chase Heights, my dick takes frequent flights in her pussy and around the globe
Back to Latrobe, fuckin in a Ford Probe
(Repeat Chorus:)
Winter time, feeling leery, van broke down right by Lake Erie
Met a little girl in Mill Creek, put my cold hand on her warm butt cheek
Got a motel up 79, turned on the heat and everything was fine
My van got (indc) in Corry
While I fucked the receptionist Laurie

Did a show that night in Titusville
Afro is the tightest and that's for real
I know why the call it Oil City
All the women like oil on their tittys

I met a new girl in New Castle
Nothin feels better than a brand new asshole
Virgin girl, from St. Marry
Afroman poppin that cherry
Summer, from Somerset
In the wintertime she's still wet
I met a rich lady in Buter
I said, I'm Afroman, your new butler

[Verse 1]
I wasn't born to be alone
That was a lesson I was shown
To know that love was just a lie
I ran away to think it over
But it's over and I try to take a stand on what is real
Someone has shown me how to feel
I'm like a shadow in the night
I'm like a river in an ocean
I'm a flame without a light

[Chorus]
And now I'm cryin' every day
And I've been cryin' every day
And I've been thinking of your love
I keep turnin', I keep turnin'
I keep turnin' I keep turnin'
Well your love was a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now I'm cryin' every day

[Bridge]
Can there be any wonder why to be living under
Love is a revelation only few can share
I could be a mountain strong but the pain about you
Long as I live without you
I would still be there
I wanna die, die away, never love, never cry

[Verse 2]
And I been walkin' in the rain
And I been hangin' on a dream
All the faces and the places that our love has ever been

[Chorus]
And now I'm cryin' every day
And I've been cryin' every day
And I've been thinking of your love
I keep turnin', I keep turnin'
I keep turnin' I keep turnin'
Well your love was a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now I'm cryin' every day

[Bridge]
Can there be any wonder why to be living under
Love is a revelation only few can share
I could be a mountain strong but the pain about you
Long as I live without you
I would still be there
I wanna die, die away, never love, never cry

[Breakdown]
I wasn't born to be a fool but I'm a fool to be around
I'm a man without a country, I'm a King without a crown
And then you're throwin' me away
Another world, another time
But if anyone belongs to anybody - you were mine

[Chorus]
I'm cryin' every day
And I've been cryin' every day
And I've been thinking of your love
I keep turnin', I keep turnin'
I keep turnin' I keep turnin'
Well your love was a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now I'm cryin' every day

[Outro]
I'm cryin', cryin'
I'm cryin' every day, I've been thinking of you love...
I wanna bring love, back to the radio
Can I bring love songs, back to the radio?
I wanna be blind tonight, while I'm loving you
I wanna have to find my way
And I don't wanna have a clue
Just let the universe surprise me
When I walk into your room, babe
I got a whole lot of kissing and a whole lot of touching
And a whole lot of loving waiting on you, babe
Got a whole lot of feeling, and a whole lot of thrilling
And a whole lot of healing, wanna please you
So, let's turn off all the lights because:

Baby tonight, I wanna be lost in your love
Baby tonight I wanna get lost in your love
Girl, tonight!
Baby tonight I wanna get lost in your love
Baby tonight I wanna get lost in your love!
I wanna get lost babe!
I wanna get lost babe!
I wanna get lost babe!
I wanna get lost babe!
I wanna make love in braille
I love feeling on you, yeah, babe!
And I don't wanna have to care
You just do what you wanna do
To me, babe!
I wanna drift far out in your waters girl

And get trapped in your wilderness
I got a whole lot of kissing and a whole lot of touching
And a whole lot of loving waiting on you, yes baby!

Got a whole lot of feeling, and a whole lot of thrilling
And a whole lot of healing, wanna please you

Baby tonight, I wanna be lost in your love
Baby tonight I wanna get lost in your love
Girl, tonight!
Baby tonight I wanna get lost in your love
Baby tonight I wanna get lost in your love!
I wanna get lost babe!
I wanna get lost babe!
I wanna get lost babe!
I wanna get lost babe!

We don't need no explanation
Cause this love will make our confirmation
So let it do, let it do
Girl, let us lose ourselves in the middle of this magic
Now babe tonight!
Baby tonight, I wanna be lost in your love
Baby tonight I wanna get lost in your love
Baby tonight I wanna get lost in your love
Baby tonight I wanna get lost in your love
Baby tonight I wanna get lost in your love!

[Verse]
I'm picky with words
I edit my verses
You bet if I said it, I said it with purpose
I'm just not a regular person
Hard to sympathize with Early
I hug the wall like a mural
Need percocets in plural
Young nigga lost in the world, just spent up all of my euros
I don't have time for you girls, that's why I be with my girl
I give her dick and she gives referrals
All of these hoes, it's just me in a jersey
I'm playing the venue, see that's what my work is
No need to research me, boogeyman is the I.D. for my work
I know that you heard of me
Wait for your sleep then your feet feel a jerk
We on a murder spree
This is a burglary
Taking your soul and the bling off your shirt
Like we rehearsed and the screaming don’t work
We got your mafuckin' dream in a hearse
We make it work
Cut the loose ends
No new friends
So I'm always lonely
Even if he shakes yo' hand
That don't make that man your homie
Maybe cause I'm up right now while all these hoes on me
Maybe cause I'm up right now while all these bitches on me
Can't forget what they told me
Fuck em
My older homie told me
Fuck ‘em, motherfuck 'em
My momma told me nigga
Fuck 'em, motherfuck 'em
I say fuck 'em, fuck 'em
We've got the groovy potential

Another long night
Or another mystery
Tell me babe, tell me
What's it gonna be?

We've got the groovy potential
Can't you hear the sound?
You better get up, get up, get up
So we can get down

We've got the groovy potential
C'mon baby
Let's get down

There's no time for sleeping
Cause the night is so young
It's time for you and me
To have a little fun
Cause you and me we've got the groovy potential
Can't you hear the sound?
It's time to get up, get up, get up
So we can get down

We've got the groovy potential
(Groovy, groovy)
(Groovy potential)
(I like it when you dance for me)

(We've got the groovy potential)
(I didn't want to, but I'm going to talk about it)

Your body's a movie
I know by heart
And it's hard to stop ya
Once the movie starts

We've got the groovy potential
I've learned my lines
And I'm ready to play the part

C'mon, we've got the groovy potential

I was trying so hard now not to
But I got the groovy potential
I can't take another long lonely night
C'mon baby, c'mon baby
Treat me right, treat me right
We've got the groovy potential, Oh Lord

(You want to get down?)
(Break, break, shake away)
(Break, break away)
(I did what, did what I wanna do)

Time will not wait for me
Time is my destiny
Why change the part of me
That has to be free

The love that passed me by
I found no reason why
But now each day is filled with the love
That very same love
That passed me by
And that is why

I can break away
From that lonely life
And I can do what I wanna do (I did what, did what I wanna do)
And break away from that empty life
And my world is new
When I laid down on my bed
I heard voices in my head
Tellin' me now hey, it's only a dream

The more I thought of it
I had been out of it
And here's the answer I found instead (baby, baby)
Found out it was in my head (baby, baby)
Found out it was my head (baby, baby)
Found out it was in my head (baby, baby, baby)

And I can break away to the better life
Where the shackles never hold me down
I'm gonna make a way for each happy day
As my life turns around

Oh boy, you'd jump for joy (Come on with me to break away)
When you (Won't you come on with me to break away)
Break away (Come on with me to break away)
Break away (Come on with me to ride away)
Break away (Won't you come on with me to break away)
Break away (Come on with me to ride away)
Feel the vibration
It's an arming sensation (Break away)
Feel the vibration
It's an arming sensation (Break away)
Wyclef:
We used to be number 10, now we permanent on one
In the battle lost my finger, Mic became my arm
Pistol nozzle hits your nasal, blood becomes lukewarm
Tell the woman be easy Naah squeeze the Charmin
Test Wyclef, see death flesh get scorned
Beat you so bad make you feel like you ain't wanna be born, Jon
And tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn
Chicken George became Dead George stealin' chickens from my farm
Damn, another dead pigeon
If your mafiosos then I'm bringin' on Haitian Sicilians
Nobody's shootin', my body's made of hand grenade
Girl bled to death while she was tongue-kissing a razor blade
That sounds sick maybe one day I'll write a horror
Blackula comes to the ghetto, jacks an ACURA
Stevie Wonder sees Crack Babies
Be-Coming Enemies Of their own families
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side, just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Trying to front like he's down with Mount Zion
Lauryn Hill:
Oooh La La La
It's the way that we rock when we're doing our thang
Oooh La La La
It's the natural LA that the Refugees bring
Oooh La La La La La La
Lalala La Laaah
Sweeeeet Thing

Yeah in saloons we drink Boone's and battle goons till high noon
Bust rap toons on flat spoons, take no shorts like poon poon's
See hoochies pop coochies, for Gucci's and Lucci
Find me in my Mitsubishi, eatin' sushi, bumpin' Fugees
Hey Hey Hey, try to take the crew and we don't play play
Say say say like Paul McCartney, not hardly
ODD-ly enough I can see right through your bluff
Niggas huff and they puff but they can't handle us, we bust
Cause we fortified, I could never hide
Seen "Cooley High", cried when Cochise died
I'm twisted, black-listed by some other negroes
Don't remove my Polos on the first episode
Ha Ha Ha Ha, You shouldn't diss Refugees, and
Ha Ha Ha Ha, You whole sound set's bootie, and
Ha Ha Ha Ha, You have to respect JERSEY
Cause I'm superfly when I'm super-high on the Fu-Gee-La
Oooh La La La
It's the way that we rock when we're doing our thang
Oooh La La La
It's the natural LA that the Refugees bring
Oooh La La La La La La
Lalala La Laaah
Sweeeeet Thing

Pras:
I sit 90 degrees underneath palm trees
Smokin' beadies as I burn my calories
Brooklyn roof tops become Brooklyn tee-pees
Who that be, enemy, wanna see the death of me
From Hawaii to Hawthorne, I run marathons, like
Buju Banton, I'm a true champion, like
Farakkhan reads his Daily Qu'ran it's a
Phenomenon, lyrics fast like Ramadan

Wyclef:
What's goin' on - Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Trying to front like he's down with Mount Zion
What's goin' on - Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Trying to front like he's down with Mount Zion

It's the way that we rock when we're doing our thang
Oooh La La La
It's the natural LA that the Refugees bring
Oooh La La La La La La
Lalala La Laaah
Sweeeeet Thing

Oooh La La La
It's the way that we rock when we're doing our thang
Oooh La La La
It's the natural LA that the Refugees bring
Oooh La La La La La La
Lalala La Laaah
Sweeeeet Thing
Whenever skies look gray to me and trouble begins to brew
Whenever the winter winds become too strong
I concentrate on you

When fortune cries "Nay, nay" to me
And people declare "You're through"
Whenever the blues become my only songs
I concentrate on you

On your smile, so sweet, so tender
When at first my kiss you do decline
On the light in your eyes when you surrender
And once again our arms intertwine

And so when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true
To prove that even the wise men can be wrong
I concentrate on you

Turn the other cheek or kick a nut 'til it coughs

Get off

I will still be hip, when the words from your lip
Take a dip in the ratings
And I'll be stripping your Mercedes
Of your Lubricated Lady
And taking her for a walk, taking her for a walk

I don't have to spank you 'cause this is my ship

New, new, new Power
Rain all around, windshield wipers movin'
Water on the ground, sure don't feel like groovin'
Working on a guru
Working on a guru
Working on a guru, before the sun goes down

Rain all around, I need me an umbrella
Water on the ground, I am that kind of fella
Looking for a guru
Working on a guru
Working on a guru, before the sun goes down

Walking on the street, I need me an umbrella
Just to keep it sweet, I am that kind of fella
Looking for a guru
Working on a guru
Working on a guru, before the sun goes down

Rain on the ground, windshield wipers movin'
Water all around, I sure don't feel like groovin'
I'm working on a guru
Yes, I'm working on a guru
But I'm working on a guru, before the sun goes down
Working on a guru
Working on a guru
Well, it's true, it could be you
I'm working on a guru
Don't look for no worries, worries and troubles come around
Yes, I don't look for no worries, people, worries and troubles come around
The world keep on turning, I got to keep my feet on the ground

Nobody saw me cryin' - nobody knows the way I feel
Nobody saw me cryin' - nobody knows the way I feel
Yeah, the way I love the woman, it's bound to get me killed

I loved the little girl so good, she made my low down butter come
Loved the little girl so good, she made my low down butter come
I need the woman so bad, I need her like the sky needs the sun
It's very far away
It takes about half a day
To get there, if we travel by my a.....dragonfly

No, it's not in Spain
But all the same
You know
It's a groovy name
And the wind's just right

Hang on, my darling
Hang on if you want to go
You know it's a really groovy place
And it's just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic

The clouds are really low
And they overflow
With cotton candy
And battle grounds
Red and brown
But it's all in your mind
Don't think your time
On bad things
Just float your little mind around
Look out

Hang on, my darling, yeah
Hang on if you want to go
It puts everything else on the shelf
With just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic
Just a little bit of daydream here and there

Hang on, my darling, yeah
Hang on if you want to go
It puts everything else on the shelf
With just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic
Just a little bit of daydream here and there
In the port Of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps to the old willow tree
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries in a drunken down fight
But in the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy, hot morn by the dawns early light

In the port of Amsterdam where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish heads and tails
He will show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can swallow the moon that can haul up the sails
And he yells to the cook with his arms open wide
Bring me more fish, put it down by my side
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to pot
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croak
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
To the rancid sounds of the accordion burst
Then their out into the night with their pride in their pants
With a slut that they tow underneath the street lamps
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men
And they bargain their bodies, and their virtue long gone
For a few dirty coins and then when he can't go on
He plants his nose in the sky and he wipes it up above
And he spits like I'd cry for an unfaithful love
In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam
I've had my fun If I don't get well no more
I've had my fun, people, If I don't get well no more
My heath is fallin' on me
Yes, and I'm going down slow

I want you to write my mother and tell her the shape I'm in
Oh please write my mother, tell her the shape I'm in
I want you tell her to pray for me, people
Well, to forgive for my sins

On that next train South, mother
You can look for my clothes on
On that next train South, mother
You can look for my clothes on
Yes, I had my fun, mother, this is all in prayers
Yes, I had my fun, people, mother, this is all in prayers
Yes, if you don't see this old body, mother
You know I'm gone out of this world somewhere
I know what you're doing
I hear what you're saying
So who do you think you're fooling

You remember me hey
I hear you call out in the night
I keep your secrets well
I hold your vision from the sight
Of anybody else

(Won't you stop your fooling)

'Cause you know and I know
We're talking to ourselves
We might as well go on as though
There ain't nobody else
There is no one else
If you need a clue
The secret to me
Is you
No matter what you think
You're still just dreaming
No matter where you go
You're still right there
No matter what becomes of all your scheming
I can watch it vanish in the air

'Cause you know and I know
We're talking to ourselves
We might as well go on as though
There ain't nobody else
There is no one else
If you need a clue
The secret to me
Is you

No matter what you think
You're still just dreaming
No matter where you go
You're still right there
No matter what becomes of all your scheming
I can watch it vanish in the air
What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' bout my bundle of joy

And even if time ain't really on my side
It's one of those days for takin' a
Walk outside
I'm blowin' the day to take a walk
In the sun
And fall on my face on somebody's
New mowed lawn

I've been havin' a sweet dream
I've been dreamin' since I woke up
Today

It's starred me and my sweet dream
'Cause she's the one makes me feel
This way
And even if time is passin' me by a lot
I couldn't care less about the dues you
Say I got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for droppin'
My load
A pie in the face for bein' a sleepy
Bull toad

And you can be sure that if you're
Feelin' right
A daydream will last a long into
The night
Tomorrow at breakfast you may pick
Up your ears
Or you may be daydreamin' for a
Thousand years

What a day for a daydream
Custom made for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy
Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' .44 beneath my head

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico

Laid in the hot joints takin' the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down

Said yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Early next mornin' bout a half past nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Up then he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, "Come on you dirty hack - into that district court"

Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about

In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I hollered, "Lawdy Lawdy, have mercy on me"

The judge, he smiled as he picked up his pen
99 years in the Folsom pen
99 years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down

Come on you've gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be

[Chorus]
I can change, I can change
I will try every day
Do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?
Fucked this up in front of everyone

[Chorus]
I can change, I can change
I will try every day
Do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?

[Verse 1]
I'm so cold
I'm the bad bitch, yo
Heart got froze
Don't trust those bros
Feel my love up high
I'll protect the prize
No love inside my eyes
Don't trust those guys

[Chorus]
I can change, I can change
I will try every day
Do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?
Fucked this up in front of everyone

[Chorus]
I can change, I can change
I will try every day
Do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?

[Chorus]
I can change, I can change
I will try every day
Do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?

[Outro]
Sorry that my body like ice
Super hot supply, never gonna faze me
Sorry that my ice is so low
Queen bitch pro, vision so hazy
You keep on trying to break me down
But my wall stays high
It's protection like crazy
Sorry that I love you so
Gonna try to change but it's so hard, baby
And it's so hard, baby

[Verse 1]
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there

I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there

[Bridge]
I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world and dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you, baby
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on
Holding on, holding on, holding on

[Verse 2]
Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, girl, it's all I'm after
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
Oh, baby, I'll be there to protect you
(Oh, you better believe it when I say)
With this unselfish love
That will always respect you, baby
(I'm down on my knees, trying explain to you, darling)
Just call my name and I'll be there

[Bridge]
I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world and dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on
Holding on, holding on, holding on
Holding on

[Verse 3]
If you should find someone new
I know he'd better be good to you
(Good to you)
Oh yeah, guess what?
'Cause if he doesn't, I'll be there
You can count on me, baby
(Baby, yeah)

[Outro]
I'll be there
(Through the rain, through the sleet, through the snow)
I'll be there
(You can count on me anywhere you go, all the way)
Just call my name, I'll be there
(Call my name, I'll be there)
(Just pick up the telephone, girl)
(You know you need somebody, ooh)
I'll be there
(I'll be standing on your door step, darling)
I'll be there
(You'll find it out, I hear you call my name)
Just call my name, I'll be there
(I'll be there, baby, right away)
Look over you shoulder, baby
I'll be there with open arms
Can't nobody take that away from me
(Just call my name, I'll be there)
Just call my name, call my name, call my name
I'll be there
(I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there)
I'll be there
(I don't wanna be no other place, baby)
I'll be there
(I don't care what you're going through)
I'll be there
(I will always be a pillow to you, baby)
I'll be there
(If times are good, if times are bad)
Just call my name
(You can always call me, darling)
I'll be there

[Intro]
Oh!

[Verse 1]
I just talked to my baby on the telephone
She said, "stop what you're doing and come on home"

[Chorus]
I can't hold out
I can't hold out too long
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone

[Verse 2]
She said, "Daddy, you know I love you, you're my desire"
I love you, baby, I hate to see you cry

[Chorus]
I can't hold out
I can't hold out to long
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
She said, "Daddy you can run, walk, or fly"
I love you, baby, and you're my one desire

[Chorus]
I can't hold out
I can't hold out to long
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone

[Bridge]
Woah, talk to me, baby

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Talk to me, baby!
Very old friend
Came by today
As he was telling everyone in town
Of all the love that he'd just found

And marie's the name (of his latest flame)

Talked and talked
And i heard him say
That she had the longest blackest hair
Prettiest green eyes anywhere

And marie's the name (of his latest flame)

The last night of the fair
By the big wheel generator
A boy is stabbed
His money is grabbed
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine

She is famous
She is funny
An engagement ring
Doesn't mean a thing
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh
The last night of the fair
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
A hideous trait (on her mother's side)

Then someone falls in love
Someone's beaten up
Someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine
And someone falls in love
Someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine

This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said : "how quickly would i die
If i jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"

This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said : "how quickly would i die
Oh, if i jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...oh, walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout

[Verse 1]
I heard that you were lonely
Ever since you sent me away (Away)
I'm lonely too, baby (I'm lonely too)
Just like you

[Chorus]
So, all you got to do is-uh
Just let me know and I'll (ah, come back) come running back
Just let me, just let me know
And I'll (ah, come back) come running back
As fast as I can, baby (Straight to you-ou-ou)

[Verse 2]
Hmm
I told my friends to wait and see
That some day you'll be crawling, crawling back to me
Oh, but I was wrong
'Cause love is much too strong

[Chorus]
So, all you got to do is-uh
Just let me know and I'll (ah, come back) come running back
Just let me, just let me know
And I'll (ah, come back) come running back
As fast as I can, baby (Straight to you-ou-ou)
Hmm, yeah (Straight to you-ou-ou)
Baby, baby clap your hands
If you understand
Give me some kind of sign
If you want to be mine

[Chorus]
All you got to do is-uh
Just let me know and I'll (ah, come back) come running back
Just let me, just let me know
And I'll (ah, come back) come running back
As fast as I can (Straight to you-ou-ou)
Hmm (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I love you. (Straight to you-ou-ou)
Hmm

[Outro]
(Just let me know)
And I'll (ah, come back) come running back
Just let me know
(Just let me know and I'll come back)
'Cause I love you, yes indeed
I'll come, come running back (Back)
Straight (straight t.) you
Hmm (Yeah, yeah, Straight to you-ou-ou)
Staright to you (Yeah, yeah, Straight to you-ou-ou)
'Cause I love ya, I need ya
Just say you want me

[Intro]
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
How can I refuse your body laying next to me
(Next to me, next to me)
I wanna know if you see the same thing that I see
(I see, I see, I see)
Listen baby
Laying right here in your bed is where I wanna be
(I wanna be, I wanna be)
Making love to your body with your body on top of me

[Chorus]
Oh, how I wanna love you, babe (Come on)
Just like this (Just like this), just like this (Woo, yeah)
Oh, how I wanna touch you, babe (All night long)

Just like this, just like this (Woo)

[Verse 2]
I wanna try something new, baby (Freaky)
That we never tried before
I wanna do something to you, babe (Well, well, well)
Wait a minute, come down here on the floor
Oh, tell me how do you like Mr. Biggs' cashmere rug, baby
(Well, yeah, woo)
Does it feel good to your body, baby? (Well, well, well)
Make you feel right

[Chorus]
Oh, how I wanna love you, babe
Just like this (Yeah), just like this (And ooh)
Oh, how I wanna touch you, babe (You know)
Just like this (Yeah), just like this
(Back that thing up, baby)
Oh, how I wanna feel you, babe (Yeah, baby)
Just like this, just like this
(Oh, just like that, baby)
Oh, how I wanna love you, babe (Hit me, baby)
Just like this, just like this

[Bridge]
Oh, keep on pushing, babe
Don't stop now
Slow it down
Make it go round and round
And round and round and round
It's time to go down
Don't stop what you doing, baby
I'm going down

[Chorus]
Oh, how I wanna love you babe
(This feeling's all over me)
Just like this, just like this
(You're gonna make me scream, baby)
Oh, how I wanna touch you babe
(Cream, baby)
Just like this, just like this
(Right there, ah)
Oh, how I wanna feel you babe
(Come on, baby, don't stop, baby)
Just like this, just like this
Oh, how I wanna love you babe
(Keep going down)
Just like this, just like this
(Sure know what you're doing, baby)
Oh, how I wanna love you babe
(How you do it, baby? Keep it up now)
Just like this, just like this
(Keep on pushing)
Oh, how I wanna touch you babe
(Show me, baby; right there, baby)

[Outro]
La da da da da da da, oh oh
(Just like this, just like this)
Oh oh, oh oh, well, well, well
(Just like this, just like this)
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)

Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)
(Ahh)
(Ah, my my, what elation)

We were flurtin after junior high playin like some kids
When out of nowhere she kissed the lips of the kid
Now Nicole is a lady somewhere someone want to have
But her and the kid ???
I would walk the other way when Nicole would cross my path
Cause I know what she would say and i couldn't help but to laugh
She would ask me for a date and somethin she would love to have
Me take her to the ?? so we can do it bad
Sorry Nicole baby but look u dont have a chance
I got 10 grand in every pocket thats the battle of the band ?
Im the man
(hook)
Two tears, my own
Fall on my collarbone
Roaming in shade in the north of France
Beneath where her shoulder meet
And the rivers dance

Two weeks, have flown
Like water runs over stone
Bicycle wheels through the fields of grain
To fell what I have to feel
Learn how to speak your name

And it's turn by turn
Every memory carries me on my way
If I return
Are you prepared to see all of me in every way
Turn, don't turn away

Two words, "I'm gone"
Your scent on my jacket lingers on
Lavender sunrise in Chateauroux
I wish I could paint it black
We do what we have to do
And it's turn by turn
Every memory carries me on my way
If I return
Are you prepared to see all of me in every way
Turn, don't turn away

With one stroke of the brush I'd be back in LA
In our same day to day
But we're better than this
Don't the both of us know
Diamond used to be coal, diamonds used to be coal

And it's turn by turn

The wheels on this gravel road
Tell me what I need to know

And it's turn by turn
Every memory carries me on my way
If I return
Are you prepared to see all of me in every way
Turn, don't turn away

[Verse 1]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids, all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I’m on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don’t want to see another generation drop
I’d rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I’m in the black, maybe I’m on my knees
Maybe I’m in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear’s a waterfall, is a waterfall

[Chorus]
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, ooh
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, ooh
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, ooh
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, ooh

[Bridge]
So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I’ll raise the flag

[Chorus]
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, ooh
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, ooh
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, ooh
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, ooh
It's a circle
I believe in change for the better girl
Those ebony eyes
Does love only seem to be satisfied

And in a world that lives without it
It makes the safest medicine
And all the summer nights
And you know that I know
I dream about you and I won't let go

And it's been so long
And I can't go on
It's my destiny
And I must be strong
You know it's all right
And it may be wrong
My destiny
And I must go on

Ooh , hold you 'til the sun comes out
Ooh , smother me
I must be insane in love
To let you treat me like a fool
Kinder to be cruel of you gotta lie
By your side
That's the place to be seen
'til the day I die

Ooh , I did nothin' to start it
I'm just an aimless passenger
And all the summer nights
I've been lost to the storm
I dream about you
And it keeps me warm

And it's been so long
And I can't go on
It's my destiny
And I must be strong
You know it's all right
And it may be wrong
My destiny
And I must go on

Make me tremble when I'm seeing you
I'm born to live through the pain again
I'm moving high and low
I'm gonna get you but I don't know when

[Verse 1]
At the far end of the midway by the double ferris wheel
There's a band that plays so snakey, you can't help how you feel
Emmie Mae ran away with a man as dark as night
You can see him if you go there, second trumpet to the right

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They play "Night Train" so snakey
Black girls dancing long and lanky
Barkers barking, step right up, folks

[Chorus 1]
The show is about to begin
It's Harlem in Havana time, step right in
Silver spangles, see 'em dangle in the farm boy's eyes
Hootchie kootchie, Auntie Ruthie would've cried
If she knew we were on the inside

[Verse 2]
When Emmie Mae ran away, she came back a bottle blonde
God, the gossips had a gourmet feast chomping on how she was born
But miracle of miracles, 'cause we were underage
She got us nearly front row seats to the right side of the stage

[Pre-Chorus 2]
See that tall girl?
That's a man, that one, too
Big yellow feather fan
Barkers barking, step right up, folks

[Chorus 2]
The show is about to begin
It's Harlem in Havana time, step right in
Silver spangles, see 'em dangle in the farm boy's eyes
Hootchie kootchie, Auntie Ruthie would've died
If she knew we were on the inside
Everybody gonna dance tonight
Everybody gonna feel alright
Everybody gonna dance around tonight

Everybody gonna dance around
Everybody gonna hit the ground
Everybody gonna dance around tonight

Well you can come on to my place if you want to
You can do anything you wanna do

Everybody gonna dance tonight
Everybody gonna feel alright
Everybody gonna dance around tonight

Well you can come on to my place if you want to
You can do anything you wanna do

Everybody gonna stamp their feet
Everybody's gonna feel the beat
Everybody gonna dance around tonight
Everybody gonna dance tonight
Everybody gonna feel alright
Everybody gonna dance around tonight

Everybody gonna jump and shout
Everybody gonna sing it out
Everybody gonna dance around tonight

Well you can come on to my place if you want to
You can do anything you wanna do

Everybody gonna dance tonight
Everybody gonna feel alright
Everybody gonna dance around tonight

Everybody gonna dance around tonight

Everybody gonna feel alright tonight

[Intro]
Ummm pum pum pum, pum pum, pum pum, pum pum

[Verse 1]
Looked behind myself
As I reflect on all the memories
Good times, they come and go
Lost everything from friends to Family

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could turn back the hands
There would be some things I'd change about me
I know that my past is not what my future holds

[Chorus]
Where I come from
Who could believe
All the pain and misery
Look in my eyes and you'll see
The diary of me

[Verse 2]
Rewind my life
Just go back and correct all the wrong
And ask God to direct my path
So that I can make it home

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I could turn back the hands of time
There would be some things I would change about me
But I know that my past is not what my future holds
'Cause...

[Chorus]
Where I come from
Who could believe
All the pain, misery
Look in my eyes and you will see
The diary of me

[Bridge]
Years ago a child was born (a child was born)
And raised without a man (without a man, raised in the streets)
My mother's gone
But still reached out her hand
Just open the book
Turn the pages of my life and you will read
A true story about one man's journey

[Chorus]
Where I'm from
Who would believe, yeah
All the hurt and pain and misery
Look in my eyes
You'll see the diary of me

Where I'm from (where I'm from, who could believe)
Who could believe (the hurt and pain and misery)
(Look in my eyes) in my eyes (and you will see)
(The makings of) the makings of
(My diary) My diary
(Where I'm from) look in my eyes
(Who could believe) you'll see
(The hurt and pain and misery)
(Look in my eyes)
(And you will see) yeah yeah yeah yeah
(The makings of my diary)
(Where I'm from, who could believe...)
(Jimmy Webb)

"If they ever drop the bomb," you said
"I'll find you in the flames."
But now we act like people
Who don't know each other's names

Well, sometimes it makes me sad, you know
Sometimes it makes me smile
'Cause you know how the game goes, honey
We all eat it once in awhile

Scissors cut, paper covers rock
Breaks the shining scissor
You hurt me
I hurt her and she goes and we will miss her

Now, I look around at people
Playing children's games
And I wonder if you're still thinking
You might find me somewhere in the flames
Scissors cut, paper covers rock
Breaks the shining scissor
You hurt me
I hurt her and she goes and we will miss her

[Verse 1]
I keep your picture beside my bed
And I still remember everything you said
I always thought our love was so right, I guess I was wrong
I always thought you'd be by my side, mama; now you're gone

[Chorus]
What I wanna know, baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore, yeah?
Oh, anymore?

[Verse 2]
(Listen...)
I still light the fire on a rainy night
I still like it better when you're holding me tight
(OK, now, umm...)
Everybody said, everybody said that we should never part, ooh yeah
(I always said that we were kinda cute together myself)
Tell me baby, baby, baby, why, why'd you wanna go and break my heart? (Why'd you wanna do it, baby?)

[Chorus]
All I wanna know, baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore, yeah?
(Why don't you call me girl?
Oh yeah, oh yeah)

[Bridge]
Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me, mama; girl, you gotta try
Down on my knees, beggin' you please, please, oh
Why can't you call me sometime, baby?
It's just one lousy dime, baby...
Why can't you call me sometime?
Oh, no no

[Outro]
Why on Earth can't you just pick up the phone, yeah?
You know I don't like to be alone
Why, why must you torture me baby?
Why you gotta treat me so bad?

I've lost the blues there's nothing else to lose
I'm gonna count my twos I'm takin off my shoes
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home
When I first heard this boy, I did the twist
My baby's comin home

The things I did before that made her go
I ain't doin no more and I'm telling you so
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home
When I first got her wire boy I thought I would die
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home

Im meatin allmy planess i'm meatin all my trains
I'm checkin on the bus boy I'm kickin up a fuss
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home
If she was comin back to you boy you'd be a fool too
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home

I ain't had what it take to make me shake
I'm bout to get a break and lose this ole ache
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home
I'm gonna change my ways i'll be busy for days
My baby's comin home
Well, I'm running down the road tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy

Well, I'm a standing on a corner in Southern California
And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win though
But we will never be here again so open up, I'm climbin' in take it easy

Well, I'm running down the road trying to loosen
My load, got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
Well you know we got it easy
We outta take it easy, yeah

[Spoken Intro: Dennis Edwards]
I was playing for keeps
But she was playing a game
Now she's gone and left
And I don't know if I'll ever be the same

[Chorus: The Temptations & (Dennis Edwards)]
(Oh I) I wonder who she's seeing now (Oh baby)
I wonder who she's holding now (Who she's holding now)
I wonder who she's seeing now
I wonder who she's foolin'

[Verse 1: Dennis Edwards]
She doesn't know now
She's tearing me apart
Breaking my heart, well
Doesn't know what I'm goin' through
I don't know what I'm gonna do
It's getting harder every single day

[Chorus: The Temptations & Dennis Edwards]
Without her
I wonder who she's seeing now
Oh, I wish that I knew
I wonder who she's holding now
Oh baby
I wonder who she's seeing now
I wonder who she's foolin'

[Verse 2: Dennis Edwards]
If I could find a way to turn back the time
When she was still mine
To the love I'll remember with
I'll hold her in my arms again
And never let her slip away

[Chorus: The Temptations & Dennis Edwards]
I wonder
I wonder who she's seeing now
Every day
I wonder who she's holding now
So close tonight, girl
I guess it's 

[?] anyhow
I wonder who she's foolin'

[Bridge: Dennis Edwards & (The Temptations)]
I wonder (I wonder)
Who she's seeing now
(Who she's seeing now)
I wonder (I wonder)
Who the girl's seeing right now
(Who she's seeing now)

(Even though she'd be gone today)
Now I got to find my own way, yeah
(Even though I need her more each day)
I wonder, I wonder who she's seeing now
I wonder who's holding her right now
I don't know, I wonder who's she seeing now
Whoa, I wonder who she's foolin', baby

[Outro: The Temptations & Dennis Edwards]
I wonder, I wonder who she's seeing now
Let me love you like I do
I wonder who she's holding now
Oh does he take good care of you? Oh baby
I wonder who she's seeing now
Who she's seeing now, oh
I wonder who she's fooling
Does he got everything you need?
I wonder who she's seeing now
Does he give you all the love you want?
I wonder who she's holding now
Does he know how to love you, baby, love you, baby
Love you, baby, like I used to do
I wonder who she's seeing now
Baby
I wonder who she's fooling
Been a long time
I wonder who she's seeing now
Since I've seen you girl, ah baby
I wonder who she's holding now
Do you think you remember me at all? Baby
I wonder who she's seeing now
And oh, oh baby
I wonder who she's fooling
Does he love you like I do?
I wonder who she's seeing now
Oh, is he giving you all the love you need?
Shooby-do-do-do-doo-doo I'm dreaming
Shooby-do-do-do-doo-doo I'm dreaming

You had me thinkin' right from the start
That our feelings would never keep us apart
You had me thinkin' that I was the one
But I never knew it was only for fun

Chorus
Tell me that I'm dreaming
Say you're never leaving
Don't you wanna be with me
(Don't you wanna be with)
Tell me that I'm dreaming
Say you're never leaving
You're heart will be safe you'll see

Isn't it true
That my love for you
Is here to stay
It'll never go away
Isn't it true
That my love for you
Is here to stay baby
There will always be that day
Chorus

Oh how I know that summer days are getting longer
Oh how I know that my love is getting stronger

Spoken
Girl if you only knew
Just how much I really love you
I think about you night and day
My love for you will always stay

I never knew it was only for fun
You had me thinkin' I was the one

Chorus

You and me girl we were meant to be
Together forever in harmony yeah
(4x)
I'm down to a roll of dimes
I'm stalking the slot that's hot
I keep hearing bells all around me
Jingling in the lucky jackpots
They keep you tantalized
They keep you reaching for your wallet
Here in fools' paradise

I talked to a cat from Des Moines
He said he ran a cleaning plant
That cat was clanking with coin
Well, he must have had a genie in a lamp
'Cause every time, I dropped a dime, I blew it
He kept ringing bells, nothing to it

He got three oranges, three lemons, three cherries, three plums
I'm losing my taste for fruit
Watching the dry cleaner do it
Like Midas in a polyester suit
It's all luck, it's just luck
You get a little lucky and you make a little money
I followed him down the strip
He picked out a booth at Circus Circus
Where the cowgirls fill the room with their big balloons
The Cleaner was pitching with purpose
He had Dinos and Pooh Bears and lions, pink and blue there
He couldn't lose there

It's all luck, it's just luck

Des Moines was stacking the chips
Raking off the tables
Ringing the bandit's bells
This is a story that's a drag to tell in some ways
Since I lost every dime I laid on the line
But the cleaner from Des Moines
Could put a coin
In the door of a John and get twenty for one, it's just luck

Lucky, lucky, so lucky, real lucky

That cat's got luck
That cat's got luck
That cat's got luck
That cat's got luck
That cat's got luck
Really lucky (Lucky)
Lucky
(Lucky, lucky)
Lucky
Lucky (Lucky, lucky)
Lucky, lucky, lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
Lucky (Lucky)
Lucky
(Lucky, lucky)
Lucky, lucky
Lucky, lucky
Lucky
I'm gonna be round my vegetables
I'm gonna chow down my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vega-table

If you brought a big brown bag of them home
I'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot

I'm gonna keep well my vegetables
Cart off and sell my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vega-table

I tried to kick the ball but my tennie flew right off
I'm red as a beet 'cause I'm so embarassed

(Mom and daddy says) Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)
Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)
Oh oh dum do dum de dooby do
Oh oh dum do dum de dooby do
Oh oh dum do dum de dooby do
Oh badumday oh dum do dum de dooby do
Oh badumday oh dum do dum de dooby do

I threw away my candy bar and I ate the wrapper (wink, wink)
And when they told me what I did I burst into laughter

(Mom and daddy says) Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)
Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)

I know that you'll feel better
When you send us in
Your letter an'
Tell us the name of your
Your favorite vega-table

I know that you'll feel better
When you send us in
Your letter an'
Tell us the name of your
Your favorite vega-table
Pa pa pa pa, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa...

[Intro]
Woah, ayy
Little things mean a lot (Ayy)
Little things mean a lot (Ayy, oh-woah)

[Verse 1]
When I wanted someone to give me the world
You accepted me and smiled
And let me know that you were my girl
And when I wanted fancy things
Gold watches, diamond rings
You gave me your hand
'Cause only you could understand, oh

[Chorus]
Little things mean a lot (Oh, little things, yeah)
Appreciate what you got
If you give what you have
It forever will last (It forever)
Don't sit around and wait for all
The great things in your life, sweetie
Little things mean
Little things mean
Li-li-li-li-little things mean a lot, uh

[Verse 2]
Giving me the best doesn't mean
Giving me happiness
I'll be satisfied with anything that comes close
I don't wanna settle for less
But if I do, I must confess
I won't take it if it's not from your heart
Sometimes we get wrapped up in all the fancy things
Don't expect life to be perfect
It don't come with static cling (Oh)

[Chorus]
Little things mean a lot (Little things, ooh-oh)
Appreciate what you got (Yeah)
If you give what you have (If you give what you have)
It forever will last
Don't sit around and wait for all
The great things in your life (Sweetie)
Little things mean
Little things mean
Li-li-li-li-little things mean a lot (Ooh, baby)
Little things mean a lot (Little things)
Appreciate what you got (Oh)
If you give what you have
It forever will last (It forever)
Don't sit around and wait for all
The great things in your life, sweetie
Little things mean
Little things mean

Well, my baby don't have to work
And she don't have to rob and steal
Well, my baby don't have to work
And she don't have to rob and steal
Yes, I'll give her everything she needs
'Cause I am her driving wheel

Yes, she left me this morning
And she said she'd be back soon
Yes, she left me this morning
And she said she'd be back soon
Yes, she would be back early Friday mornin'
Or laid over Saturday afternoon

Yes, every time she walk
She shakes like a leaf tremblin' on a tree
Yes, when my baby walk down the street
She shakes like a leaf tremblin' on a tree
Yes, the women all hate her
But man, she's alright with me
Wo, I sent the U.N. a telegram
Don't want nobody else to break the seal
Wo, I sent the U.N. a telegram
Don't want nobody else to break the seal
I want the whole world to know
That I am my baby's driving wheel
Please forgive me!
What now, I think this woman's waiting for a...
What now, why I let her go and put that s** on me
What now, I pop this shit I watch that girl undress for me
Uh standing her perfume in the air
Got it feeling different in here, yeah
Yeah, she took my breath away
On to some fancy shit into another place
Such an expensive trip
But she didn't make me pay for it with my money

Chorus:
Oh, it's the sins of my father
He left a debt to his son
To pay the the girl who's a mother
Collect the one, let me run, no
But she didn't make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father
I'm praying I can reverse this curse

Oh, now she's speaking in a tongue that sounds new to me
Oh, momma tell me what this could do to me
Oh now, I wouldn't fall for something like this usually
No, no, no tell me how could I ever prepare
If my mother never was there
Oh, she took my breath away
On to some fancy ship
And to down the place... Such an expensive trip!
But she didn't make me pay for it with my money
Chorus:
Oh, is the sins of my father
He left a debt to his son
To pay the the girl who's a mother
Collect the one, let me run, no
But she didn't make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father
I'm praying I can reverse this curse

I don't deserve a debt that came with my birth
Oh, oh, oh, what happened...

Chorus:
Oh, is the sins of my father
He left a debt to his son
To pay the the girl who's a mother
Collect the one, let me run, no
But she didn't make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father
I'm praying I can reverse this curse
Long time ago in Trinidad
Happen such a thing to make you sad
Had a big fire where they make the rum
For miles around all the people come
And they shouting

Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there

A little old woman past eighty eight
Running in the fire thru the burning gate
Before you could beat on a funeral drum
She was rollin' out a peck o' rum
And she singing

Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
The way de woman runnin' into the flame
Man you would think was a Carnival game
I Tell you friends it was a sight to see
I never had known such bravery
And she screaming

Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there

The way de woman runnin' with a bucket and line
Man she was working overtime
She work up her sweat and never complain
She was drinking rum and prayin' for rain
And she singing

Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there

You could see the fire way down the road
Everybody waited for the thing to explode
The distillery burnt down to the ground
Not a single drop of rum could be found
And they singing
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there

Although it all happened a long time ago
There is one thing that I don't know
She was eighty eight there is no doubt
How she get all the rum in she mouth
And she singing

Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Lonely lover cryin' through the night
'Cause the one you love has left you
Lonely lover cryin' alone in the dark
Your sighing just breaks my heart

I hear you cryin' from across the street
It keeps me awake, unable to sleep
I close my window, not wanting to hear
Still your cries echoes in my ears, hey, hey

Lonely lover cry your little heart out
Tryin' to wash away your hurt, yeah
Lonely lover, how I long to comfort you
'Cause when you're hurting, I'm hurt too

From my window across the street
I watched you kiss him tenderly
Kissing you like I never could
To you I'm just another guy in the neighborhood, hey, hey

I've heard neighbors sayin' that he's gonna put you down
For another girl, across town
Lonely lover sobbing through the night
How I long to hold you tight
Many nights I've wakened from my sleep
Hearin' you cryin' from across the street
Your neighborhood friend is all I'll be
But I still love you so tenderly, hey, hey

Lonely lover cryin' through the night
Lonely lover cryin' through the night
Ooh, lonely lover cryin' through the night
Ohh, lonely lover sobbin' and weepin', baby
If you ever go across the sea to Ireland
It maybe at the closing of your day
You will sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay
Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream
The women in the meadow making hay
And to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin
And watch the barefoot gosoons at their play

For the breezes blowin' o'er the sea from Ireland
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow
And the women in the uplands diggin' praties
Speak a language that the strangers do not know

Yet the stangers came and tried to teach us their way
They scorned us just for bein' what we are
But they might as well go chasing after moon beams
Or light a penny candle from a star

And if there's is going to be a life hereafter
And somehow I am sure there's going to be
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven
In that dear land across the Irish sea

[Verse One]
They say, "B.O.B why not put the guitar down and rap?"
It's easier to sing than put my soul on a track
Cause the media has made a competition out of rap
So constantly they comparin' me to 3 Stacks (Andre 3000)
I try to grow freely but they hold me to my past
Sayin' the music that I'm makin' doesn't appeal to the mass
Hmm
What am I to do about that?
When the syndicated radio is always playin' trash
Every single song is the same old track
About Patron, Patron, Patron and swag, swag, swag
Patron and swag and the whole hood is singin'
"Patron and swag"
And everybody wonder why the kids so bad
Cause they only thing they know is Patron and SWAG!
Tear a star from out the sky
And the sky feels blue
Tear a petal from a rose
And the rose weeps too

Take your heart away from mine
And mine will surely break
My life is yours to make
So please keep the spark awake

Would you take the wings from birds
So that they can't fly
Would you take the ocean's roar
And leave just a sigh

All this your heart won't let you do
This is what I beg of you
Don't take your love from me
In our Christian society
There's something wrong with having pleasure
Pleasure more precisely is called sin
Therefore our well thinking citizens
Have decided it was best to hide, deny pleasures such as sex and drugs
Out of the repression of pleasure
Something logically take into the light
Something much graver than sex, drugs
Perversion could only entail regression
Of a civilization that would avoid mastering anxiety
That would disrupt the truth
Corrupt behaviour
We are traveling in the footsteps
Of those who've gone before
But we'll all be reunited (but if we stand reunited)
On a new and sunlit shore (then a new world is in store)

Oh when the saints go marching in
When the saints go marching in
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the moon turns red with blood
When the moon turns red with blood
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

On that hallelujah day
On that hallelujah day
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
Oh when the trumpet sounds the call
Oh when the trumpet sounds the call
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

Some say this world of trouble
Is the only one we need
But I'm waiting for that morning
When the new world is revealed

When the revelation (revolution) comes
When the revelation (revolution) comes
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the rich go out and work
When the rich go out and work
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the air is pure and clean
When the air is pure and clean
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When we all have food to eat
When we all have food to eat
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
When our leaders learn to cry
When our leaders learn to cry
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
Work all the summer and all the fall
Just trying to find my little Lenore
But now she's gone, and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

One summer day when she went away
Just when she left me, she's gone to stay
But now she's gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

There was days when I didn't know your name
Why should I worry and prayer in vain
But now she's gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world, alright

Going to the station, down in the yard
Gonna get me a freight train, after worked and got too hard
Now she's gone and I don't worry
Because I'm sitting on top of the world

The lonesome days they have gone by
Why should I beg her when she's saying goodbye?
But now she's gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse 1]
Sorry, mama
There are times I get carried away
Please, don't worry
Next time I'm home, I'll still be the same

[Chorus]
And I know it's no fun
When your first son
Gets up to no good
Starts freaking out the neighborhood

[Verse 2]
Really, I'm fine
Never been better, got no job on the line
Sincerely, don't worry
Same old boy that you hoped you would find

[Chorus]
And I know it's no fun
When your first son
Gets up to no good
Starts freaking out the neighborhood

[Verse 1]
She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came down
Gets colder day by day, I miss her

[Chorus]
I hear children singin'
It felt like Christmas time

[Verse 2]
In these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream you appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow sparkle

[Chorus]
And our hearts were singin'
It felt like Christmas time

[Bridge]
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go

[Verse 3]
She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came falling now
Gets colder day by day, I miss you

[Chorus]
I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time
I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time
I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time
I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time
Ain't no need to worry about it
Won't do you one bit of good
If you don't treat your baby
Treat your baby like you should
There's been a change in the weather
And it's so plain to see
So plain to see
Everybody's welcome to try
Try and get my airplane running
You're the only one can make it fly

You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit

Don't be listening to no jealous friends
When they start slinging mud
And don't let nobody come between
'Cause I've got you in my blood
I wanna start dealing, dealing
Dealing in reality, reality
I'm just trying to survive
And keep my head above the waterline
So I won't get buried alive
You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit

Not so very long ago
There was nothing you could say
That ever would
Have convinced me, darling
I couldn't turn and walk away
You got me stung out, baby
Stung out on the end of your line
Yeah, and the hook's in deep
Got the kind of love
Kind of love I wanna keep
Everybody's welcome to try
Try and get my airplane running
You're the only one can make it fly

You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit

No matter how hard I try
I just can't break free
You've become a habit to me
'Cause you're my honey and I'm your bee
A habit to me
I said -
You've become a habit to me
Habit to me, habit to me
We are one
One for sure
All united

Bono: Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Chris: Brother, brother, brother
There's too many of you dying
You know you've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here to stay
Bono: Father, father
We don't need to escalate
And war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
Chris: You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here to stay
Picket lines won't block our way
Bono: Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, and you can see
What's going on

What's going on
What's going on
Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong
But who are they to judge us
Together we can be strong
Chris: You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here to stay
Picket lines won't block our way
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
What's going on, What's going on
What's going on, What's going on
What's going on, What's going on
What's going on, What's going on
We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day

So keep smiling through
Just like you always do
Till the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away

So will you please say hello to the folks that I know
Tell them I won't be long
They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go
I was singing this song

We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day

So will you please say hello to the folks that I know
Tell them I won't be long
They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go
I was singing this song
We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day

[Intro: The Temptations & Dennis Edwards]
I'm a bachelor, it's not by choice
I'm a bachelor, I've got to speak my voice
Listen here

[Verse 1: Dennis Edwards]
I've been a lot of places in my lifetime
I've had a lot of women that I thought was mine - many times
There's not many things in life that I won't do - naw
But I'm still a lonely man, and I've got to tell you

[Chorus: The Temptations & Dennis Edwards]
That I'm a bachelor, it's not by choice
I'm a bachelor, I've got to speak my voice
Well...

[Verse 2: Dennis Edwards]
I really want a girl I can bring my money to - yes I do
And do all the things that the sweet thing wants me to - yeah
But I'm not rushing, I'm taking it one step at a time
'Cause when I find that girl, she'll know that she's mine
Until I do...

[Chorus: The Temptations & Dennis Edwards]
I'm a bachelor, it's not by choice - naw
I'm a bachelor - I've got to speak my voice

Until I do...

Spoken: Not now, Moose! I'll tell ya when!

Here's a dance you should know
When the lights are down low
Grab your baby, then go

Do the Hucklebuck (do the Hucklebuck)
Do the Hucklebuck (do the Hucklebuck)
If ya don't know how to do it
Boy, you're out of luck (boy, you're out of luck)

Push your partner out (push your partner out)
Then you hunch your back (then you hunch your back)
Start a little movement in your sacroiliac (sacroiliac)
Wiggle like a snake (wiggle like a snake)
Waddle like a duck (waddle like a duck)
That's the way you do it when you do the Hucklebuck

(Here's a dance you should know)
(When the lights are down low)
(Grab your baby, then go)
Spoken: Yeah, Dad! Right now!!

Here's a dance you should know
When the lights are down low
Grab your baby, then go

Do the Hucklebuck
Do the Hucklebuck
If ya don't know how to do it
Boy, you're out of luck

Push your partner out
Then you hunch your back
Start a little movement in your sacroiliac

Wiggle like a snake
Waddle like a duck
That's the way you do it when you do the Hucklebuck

[Verse 1]
Little Miss Lover
Where have you been in this world for so long?
Well, I love a lover
That feels like you, would you like to tag along?
Well, I really don't need any help little girl
But I think you could help me out anyway
Aw, shucks

[Verse 2]
Would you believe baby
I've been looking for a soul that feels like you for some time
Excuse me while I see
If the gypsy in me is right if you don't mind
Well, he signals me ok so I think it's safe to say
I'm going to make my play
Aw, yeah

[Bridge]
You see me comin' towards you now
Hey, aw yeah
Aw, give it to her!
Oh, get into it

[Outro]
Hey, hey, little miss lover
There is so much you and me can discover
And I think we should start right now
Right now! Right now...

[Guitar Solo]
Say you never send me away
Makin' me a memory and
Tellin' me to find me a life
Change, there's nothing changing
What cannot be changed
And you are witness to a silent conversation
Nothin' but the black of night
No-one ever takes your place
Gotta let the pantomime
Play
Not to worry, my telepathy
I bring you into me there's be no seperation
And I tell you
I will climb inside your world
And all my history
Must revolve around this girl
And I can see you with my eyes closed
I can feel you when you're near me
Just the knowing that you
Hear me, could be
You could measure my love
I can touch you with my hands tied
It don't take no extra feeling
Let your imagination, just run
You can measure my love
And they tell you
They can stop these tears you cry
And we can ride this storm together
And all the love that lasts forever
And forever, and forever
Cling to the vine and the vine never breaks
It's a message from a ship to store
For the soul and the sacrifice
Pain
There's no fury
Like a woman scorned
We could be victims of a lethal combination
It's the hourIt's the sword that hides the stone
And one of us holds the power
There to forge our hearts together
Here forever, and forever
As we go marching, marching, in the beauty of the day
A million darkened kitchens, a thousand mill lofts grey
Are touched with all the radiance that sudden sun discloses
For the people hear us singing, Bread and Roses, Bread and Roses

As we go marching, marching, we battle too for men
For they are women's children and we mother them again
Our lives shall not be sweetened from birth until life closes
Hearts starve as well as bodies, give us Bread, but give us Roses

As we go marching, marching, we bring the greater days
For the rising of the women, means the rising of the race
No more the drudge and idler ten that toil where one reposes
But the sharing of life's glories, Bread and Roses, Bread and Roses
But the sharing of life's glories, Bread and Roses, Bread and Roses
My name is Francis Albert (Francis Albert Sinatra)
And I sing love songs mostly after dark, mostly in saloons
I've had some very good years
I haven't missed a whole lot in those firecracker years
And I don't want to miss a thing when the future appears

I like to sit outside on a summer night with a drink in my hand
And a little moonlit music on the stereo
And look at the stars
Then I get an urge to travel through that fabulous sky
If they can do it in the movies, why can't I?

("Seats are now available on the Satellite Special leaving for Mercury, Venus, Pluto, Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune.")

What time does the next miracle leave?
I want to be on board
Save me a seat by the window where I can see
All those marvelous things to be seen out there
(Will the trees be green out there, or bare?)

What time does the next miracle leave?
Let's get this show on the road
And when the satellite tours begin
Count me in, count me in , count me in
Count me in, count me in , count me in
("Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.")

When I arrive at Venus, it will surely be spring
And the girl I have waited for, will be waiting for me
And she'll dance with me all the afternoon
Comfort me when the darkness falls
And she'll still be there in the morning when I need her the most
Maybe when I get to Venus, I will never be lonely again

("The Satellite Special leaving for Jupiter, Saturn")
(Jupiter, Saturn)
Jupiter makes with the rain, Saturn makes with the crops
A nicer trade was never made, and hopefully never stops
If Saturn's fields are dry, Jupiter won't stay fat
So Jupiter leaves his faucets on and that is that

("Next stop, Pluto -- where the devil dwells, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha")

Pluto is a rotten place, an evil misbegotten place
It's Hades (It's Hades)
Filled with graduates of the pen, a sordid flock of criminal men
And ladies (Ladies?) (Ladies, ladies, ladies)
It's pure hell when your journey ends there
But you can bet your ass I'll meet a lot of friends there
(We did it our way)
("Next stop, Mercury, Mercury, the messenger, Mercury the messenger")

Mercury will lead us out to Neptune and his deep blue sea

(And then) And then to Uranus (Uranus)
Uranus is heaven
(Heaven, heaven)
(How will you know, Francis, if it's really heaven?)
How will I know?
I will know
If they meet me at the station with a cheese and tomato pizza
Well done (well done), and a little red wine

("The Satellite Special now leaving non-stop for earth, non-stop for earth")

(We'll be on board when the next miracle leaves
It's time we were gettin' on home)

Please let me off at the desert, where I can see
All those wonderful things to be seen down there
(Will the trees be green down there, or bare?)
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know my love not fade away

You know my love not fade away
Not fade away

My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel

Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad, hey hey hey, yeah
Don't wanna be treated this-a way
Going where the climate suits my clothes
I'm going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Don't wanna be treated this-a way

Going down the road feeling bad
Well I'm, going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad, hey hey hey, yeah
Don't wanna be treated this-a way

Going where the water tastes like wine
Well I'm, going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
I don't wanna be treated this-a way

Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad, hey hey hey, yeah
Don't wanna be treated this-a way

Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad, hey hey hey, yeah
Don't wanna be treated this-a way

Well I'm, going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad, hey hey hey, yeah
Don't wanna be treated this-a way

[Intro: Ronald Isley]
Oh no, no, no, no, no
No, whoa
I still love you, baby
You know, you know

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq, Ronald Isley]
You didn't see me (I don't know why, baby)
But I saw you (But I saw you, oh, yes, I did)
You didn't see me, baby (No, no, no, no, no)
But I saw you (You, yeah)

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
I can remember those nights and days again
Sometimes I cry for what might have been, babe
You say you love me but how do you know? (How do you know?)
If I didn't leave you then where did you go?

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq, Ronald Isley]
You didn't see me (No, you didn't but)
But I saw you (Oh)
You didn't see me, baby (No, baby)
But I saw you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]
Whatever's going on inside your mind (Ah yeah)
Think about us, think about us and give us some more time
And there's so much more I'm leaving unsaid, babe
'Cause there's that little voice inside of your head

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq, Ronald Isley]
You didn't see me (Won't let you see me, girl)
But I saw you (Oh, yes, I did, you know why)
You didn't see me, baby (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But I saw you (It's all about you, girl)

[Bridge: JS, Ronald Isley]
(You're all about) You're all about yourself
You can't see nobody else
(You're all about) You're all about yourself
You can't see nobody else
(You're all about) You're all about yourself
You can't see nobody else
(You're all about) You're all about yourself (Yeah)
You can't see nobody else

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq, Ronald Isley]
You didn't see me (Ooh, yeah)
But I saw you (I saw you)
You didn't see me tonight (Oh)
But I saw you (I saw you, girl)
You didn't see me tonight (No, no)
But I saw you (Ooh, I saw you, baby)
You didn't see me, darling (Oh baby)
But I saw you (Ah, it's all about you, girl)

[Outro: Ronald Isley]
You're so into yourself babe, oh yes
Ah, can't see nobody, nobody else
But I saw you, baby
'Cause it's all about you girl, oh yeah
All about you, baby

Lil' Mama I See You Gone

[Keri Hilson:]
I got your back boy

[Chorus: Keri Hilson & T.I.]
When were high(T.I.:From when its all good)
When were low(T.I.:To when its all bad)
Boy I promise I will never let you go
Said I got I got I got I got yo' back boy
(Now What you call dat)
I got I got I got I got yo' back boy
(I know you got my back right)
Keep my swagger
Keep it looking good for ya
Keep it looking hood for ya
Shawty if you don't know
I got I got I got I got your back boy
I got I got I got I got your back boy

[T.I. Verse 1]
Hey it's whatever shawty
You ain't gotta ask
Yes, Valentino blouses, summer houses, cash, check!
You can get it you deserve it, flawless diamonds, Louie purses
My mission's to purchase Earth for her
Present the gifts without the curse
Her pleasure is my purpose
Pleasure to be at your service
We front row at fashion shows
As well as Sunday morning service
But better days or for worse
If I'm paid or I'm hurting in my pocket
She still got a nigga back, know that's for sure
No matter what may occur in life
Everyday with her is like a plus
I'mma love her til she be like that's enough
Pop a bottle get a couple wine glasses fill em up and lift em up
Let us toast to the future here's to us
No, here's to her

[Keri Hilson - Bridge]
They wonder how we do what we do
Panamera Porsches me and you
Stuck to your side like like like glue
Be by your side whatever your gonna do

[Chorus]

[T.I. Verse 2]
This is for the women who man caught a sentence
Who gon be there for a minute but they didn't keep their distance
They stayed home waiting on the phone
And on visit day show up looking good smelling better, playing kissy face
Just wanna let you know we appreciate(I appreciate you baby)
Everything you do for us on a day to day
And I know we don't show you all the time but we lucky that you ours
No bouquet of flowers could ever show how much we know we need you
We do all that's in our power just to please you
See boo, fuck them girls, I would leave the World 'fore I leave you
May God say even Eve and Adam ain't got shit on these two

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[T.I. Verse 3]
Sure enough
Even though them chicks be hating on us
Still I'm gonna keep her by my side
In whatever situation we gon ride
Make all my fantasies come alive
That's no lie now
Ill be, alright just as long as you beside me
10 million dollar mansions won't suffice
If you ain't gon be in there with me at night
The pieces to the puzzles in my life
With all of my good days and all of my bad
You stood by your man(stood by my man) and you know you got my back
Worth every car, every bag, with me they wanna be that
I know what I got at home
I ain't gon never leave that
Them bitches best believe that

[Chorus]
Oh, let your little light shine
Let your little light shine

[Verse 1]
Shine on Vegas and Wall Street. place your bets
Shine on the fishermen with nothing in their nets
Shine on rising oceans and evaporating seas
Shine on our Frankenstein technologies
Shine on science with its tunnel vision
Shine on fertile farmland buried under subdivisions

[Chorus]
Oh, let your little light shine
Oh, let your little light shine

[Verse 2]
Shine on the dazzling darkness that restores us in deep sleep
Shine on what we throw away and what we keep
Shine on Reverend Pearson who threw away the vain old God
Kept Dickens and Rembrandt and Beethoven and fresh-plowed sod
Shine on good earth, good air, good water and a safe place for kids to play
Shine on bombs exploding half a mile away

[Chorus]
Oh, let your little light shine
Let your little light shine

[Verse 3]
Shine on world-wide traffic jams honking day and night
Shine on another asshole passing on the right
Shine on the red light runners busy talking on their cell phones
Shine on the Catholic Church and the prisons that it owns
Shine on all the churches, they all love less and less
Shine on a hopeful girl in a dreamy dress

[Chorus]
Oh, let your little light shine
Shine, shine, shine
Let your little light shine

[Verse 4]
Shine on good humor, shine on good will
Shine on lousy leadership licensed to kill
Shine on dying soldiers in patriotic pain
Shine on mass destruction in some god's name
Shine on the pioneers, those seekers of mental health
Craving simplicity, they traveled inward past themselves

[Outro]
May all their little lights shine
May all their little lights shine
Then she walked away
Quietly so afraid
Smiling but no doubt
Crying her heart out
She really just wants to stay

Then she walked away
Leading her own parade
Nobody's cheering
The voices she's hearing
Are empty remarks she made

How was she to know
That it would come to this
Sorry Miss
They forgot to tell you it was just a game
Just a sad illusion
Now you're on your own
Really on your own
It's still a long way home
Then she walked away
Quietly so afraid
Smiling but no doubt
Crying her heart out
She really just wants to stay

How's she ever gonna face it after this
Emptiness
Got her feeling like she don't exist
Who were you expecting
Now you're on your own
Really on your own
And it's still a long way home

Now you're on your own
Really on your own
And it's still a long way home

Then she walked away
Quietly so afraid
Smiling but no doubt
Crying her heart out
She really just wants to stay

Then she walked away
Leading her own parade
Nobody's cheering
The voices she's hearing
Are empty remarks she made
After the party's over can I smoke a blunt with you?
After we smoke a blunt can I stick it in your pussy too?
After the party's over can I smoke a blunt with you?
After we smoke a blunt can I stick it in your pussy too?
Now if you've ever been down to New Orleans
Then you can understand just what I mean
All thru the week it's quiet as a mouse
But on Saturday night they go from house to house
You don't have to pay the usual admission
If you're a cook, a waiter or a good musician
So if you happen to be just passin' by
Stop in at the Saturday Night Fish Fry

It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn

Now my buddy and me was on the main stem
Foolin' around just me and him
We decided we could use a little something to eat
So we went to a house on Rampart Street
We knocked on the door and it opened up with ease
And a lush little Miss said, "Come in, please"
And before we could even bat an eye
We were right in the middle of a big fish fry
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn

Now the folks was havin' the time of their life
And Sam was jivin' Jimmie's wife
Over in the corner was a beat up grand
Being played by a big fat piano man
Some of the chicks wore expensive frocks
Some of them had on bobbie socks
But everybody was nice and high
At this particular Saturday Night Fish Fry

It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn

Now the women were screamin' and jumpin' and yellin'
The bottles was flyin', and the fish was smellin'
And way above all the noise we made
Somebody hollered, "You better get outta here, this is a raid!"
I didn't know we was breaking the law but
Somebody reached over and hit me on the jaw
Now they had us blocked off from front to back
And they was puttin' 'em in the wagon like potatoes in a sack
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn

I knew I could get away if I had a chance
But I was shakin' like I had the St. Vitus dance
So I tried to crawl in under a bath tab
When a policeman said, "Where are you goin' there, bub?"
Now they got us out of there like a house on fire
And put us all in the black Maria
Now they might have missed a pitiful few
But they got both me and my buddy too

It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn

Well we headed for jail in a dazed condition
They booked each one of us on suspicion
Now my chick came down and paid my bail
And finally got me outta that rotten jail
Now if you ever want to get a fist in your eye
Just mention a Saturday Night Fish Fry
I don't care how many fish in the sea
But don't ever mention a fish to me
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn

I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)

[Intro]
"The victims are what mean the most to us and that we cared so much about...."
"I just really feel that we are going to be known as the school that overcame"

[Interlude: R. Kelly]
This goes out to all of those that were lost in Virginia
Parents, families, friends, we light a candle
And let you know Virginia will rise again

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
I know you're feeling pain right now
And you don't wanna talk right now
I know you're going through something
And you don't wanna be bothered right now
Not gonna lie and say I understand
I just wanna be here for you if I can
To hold your hand and be by your side
And together we will get through these times

[Pre-Chorus: R. Kelly]
And we will cry together
And we'll fight this together
And we'll be strong together
Stand together, pray together

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Rise up, when you feel you can't go on
Rise up, when all of your hope is gone
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong
Rise, rise up
Rise up, and when the tears start to fall
Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all
Rise up, when your back is up against the wall
Rise, rise up

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Now I know the burdens that you bear
And you don't think nobody cares
A storm comes out of nowhere
And you're feeling like it just ain't fair
Not here to preach about the brighter side, no
'Cause I understand that now is not the time
See, I just wanna help you make it right
Walk with you, holding up candlelights

[Pre-Chorus: R. Kelly]
And we will cry together
And we'll fight this together (stand up and fight)
And we'll be strong together
Stand together, pray together

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Rise up, when you feel you can't go on
Rise up, when all of your hope is gone
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong
Rise, rise up
Rise up, and when the tears start to fall
Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all
Rise up, when your back is up against the wall
Rise, rise up

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
You see struggle has no color, no color
In the midst of Christ, you are my sister and I'm your brother
And side by side we'll face this thing
Standing tall, you and me

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Rise up, rise
Rise up, rise
Rise up, rise
(Hey we gon' rise, rise up to the sky)
Rise up, rise (when all hope is gone)
Rise up, rise (we'll stand tall)
Rise up, rise (and we gotta know tomorrow coming)
Rise up, rise (we will have a victory)
Rise up, rise (hey, rise up)
Rise up, rise (hey hey hey hey hey)
Rise up, rise (in the middle, in the middle of the storm)
Rise up, rise (when you think you cannot make it)
Rise up

[Outro: R. Kelly]
God bless you, Virginia
Our hearts go out to you and your families
Peace
Mister Banker
Mister please, how much does money mean
Won't you reconsider mister
Won't you do this thing for me
Ain't got no house
Ain't got no car
All I got, Lord, is my guitar
But you can have that mister banker
Won't you bury my papa for me
Oh mister banker please
Listen to {the} way it sound

I would not be here on my knees
But hey mister banker
It means so much to me
Oh won't you reconsider mister
Won't you do this thing for me

I told you mister
I ain't got no house
Ain't got no car
I got me a 1950 Les Paul guitar
Won't you take it mister banker
Won't you bury my papa for me
Oh mister banker please
You've been gone so long
No matter who's right, no matter who's wrong
Come on home, come on home
'Cause that's where you belong, girl

Every morning I save my grace
Hoping that we'll both get back into the rains
Come on home, come on home
'Cause that's where you belong, girl

I know the bright lights, they all glitter like gold
But girl, we ain't getting no younger an' this is getting old
Come on home, come on home
'Cause that's where you belong, girl

I know we both, we both broke along
Let's get together, girl an' call it a draw
Come on home, come on home
'Cause that's where you belong, girl

Come on home, come on home
'Cause that's where you belong, girl
He said, "I'll love you 'til I die."
She told him, "You'll forget in time."
As the years went slowly by
She still prayed upon his mind

He kept her picture on the wall
Went half crazy now and then
But he still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again

Kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'

I went to see him just today
But I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today
You know, she came to see him last time
And we were all wonderin' if she would
And it kept runnin' through my mind
This time he's over her for good

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today
Oh Judy, do you hear me call your name
Oh Judy, do you really feel the same
Oh Judy, if I were you I'd take the blame
Judy, it's gettin' stronger every day

Oh Judy, I felt it's you in every way
My Judy, that's why you're always here to stay
I love you so
I want you to know

I can't let you
Give me a chance to show
Judy, I smell love's perfume in the air
Oh Judy, I know my love will never wear

Then Judy, tell me that you really care
Well Judy, I smell love's perfume in the air
Oh Judy, I know my love will never wear
Please Judy, tell me that you really care
(In background)
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can that huh?
I spit it through the wire man
To much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kayne titter....
Chi-Town what's going on man

(Verse 1)
I drink a boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizerk
Not to worry the Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back wizzork
How do you console my mom or give her light support
When you telling her your son's on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a Delta so she been throwing them dynasty signs
I'm use to trying to reline
I been trying to be sign
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here is history in the making man
(In background)
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

I really apologize how I sound right now man
This ain't fair at all man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstru....
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah

(Verse 2)
What if somebody from the Chi-town was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't to cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep my safe book safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I look like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
It was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
(In background)
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

Know what I'm saying
When the doctor told me I had a um.. I was goin' to have a plate on my chin
I said dawg didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
It's bad I got all this jewelry on
Can't be serious man
These guys aren't tough and stuff
They can talk that shit when the chips are up
But the chips are down, cause i put them there
And i got a Hot Chip like the indie band
This is Christmas man and my flow is Miami
And the only goal that i have is my Emmy bitch
Yes and a nigga stay down like i'm into this
These niggas never did shit different, i was tired of it
See the other side of it, hate how they say how
Hip-hop is dead and everybody is the same now
I am not the same, how could i ever be?
I am so fly and on fire like a phoenix wing
I go light speed, you go slow pace
And i go hard like G-O in bold face
Used to do me cause i had to, now a nigga like to
Cause i get cheese like the mice do
I am a work of art, crush niggas like i'm crushing on Annie Clark
They stop sleeping on me
Good morning, like Alonzo
Go ahead and cut that shit out like a tonsil
Yes i stay weird and fuck chicks like i'm gonzo
Sleeping on a cow pie, tired of the bullshit
Dick is her baby, why does she abuse it?
Eight shots and a beer and i'm passing out
Glasses, leather jacket, i'ma ask you out
Spend the night if you got your own toothbrush
I really think i like you, but not too much
I got big plans, yeah i feel myself hard like both hands
Yeah I feel myself hard like both hands
(Throw the phone out the window)
(If you want the neighbours woke)
(You'll have to shout out loud)
(And set the bed alight and slow)
(If you want the neighbours woke)
(You'll have to shout even louder)

This is all fun yeah, my work is vacation
Me and six shots, that's a bad combination
I don't need your money, this is free download it
Play it at a party, watch it pop like a soda
Thick indie black girl, double stuffed Oreo
Make a shit rapper pissed off like a urinal
You can not see me, i can change your perspective
Sick boy clique, that's an Animal Collective
Fuckin with you raw like i don't need protection
I am just a rapper, i'm in search of perfection
Spit hot shit, yeah my mouth is a toaster
Shit look easy like a turd in a short skirt
I am not a fairy tale, i earned this shit
Leave a track on the stove and watch me burn this bitch
Sick as a dog, fly as an angel
I am just a rapper, better learn sign language
Cause i don't talk, yeah i fight Teddy Ruxpin
Yeah i got paper like i just ate a muffin
This is all wrong man, this is all wrong
Have a nigga, have a hit, and then they sing the same song
That is so not me, i'ma change it all up
Doctor knows i'm sick dude, i don't need a follow up
Tell me when you can't take the track any longer
Weird soufflé

[?!] and the noise make me stronger
I have gotten stronger, tongue like a shotgun
If you let the track loose, you can watch me pop one
Sick boy bitch, and it's back to the future
Cause i'm McFly and it's not what i'm used to
Cause they used to call me other name of a rooster

[?]
Sky is the limit like a jet pack booster
Fuckin with a nigga like he fuckin with a time bomb
Can't see a nigga, motherfucker turn your eyes on
I am so different y'all don't even know the half of
I do not talk, motherfucker i'm a rapper

[Chorus: Kanye West]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Down, down, down, down, down

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Kanye West]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found

[Chorus: Kanye West]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Down, down, down, down, down

Good night, my love
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me
Before you go, there's just one thing I'd like to know
Is your love still strong for me
Or has it grown old?

If you should awake, in the still of the night
Please have no fear, for I'll be there
You know I care, please give your love to me dear only

[Verse 1]
You better tie them heels up tight
'Cause I'ma make you work for it tonight
You been messing with me too long
Now it's time to come and get the game on
'Cause you been playing hard to get, now I got you here
Come on, girl
Baby, tell me what you wanna do
I know exactly what I'm doin' to you
All you need is a t-shirt and a thong
And let me turn this camera on
'Cause you been playing too hard to get, now I got you here come on girl
And I'll be like, yeah!

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm trying to get this pleasure thang poppin', should we be stopping?
And you be like no!
Girl, I know your nervous, but it ain't no time, like showtime
No, it ain't no time like showtime, come on girl

[Verse 2]
Baby come and lay down on your back
Don't look at me like that
Cause you already know and what it is
You about to see me handle my biz
Girl, I hope your ready, you ain't never had it like this
Come on, girl
You know I ain't faking, so your scared now
From the floor to the bed now, you believe everything I've said now
Fight that feeling, fight that headboard
Put your hand down! Oh!
Girl, you wasn't ready, you can better feel your legs now
And when you feel that thing coming
All you gotta say is, "Yeah!"

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm trying to get this pleasure thang poppin', should we be stopping?
And you be like no!
Girl, I know your nervous, but it ain't no time, like showtime
No, it ain't no time like showtime, come on girl

[Bridge]
Hey, girl it's all about that pleasure thang
Better put your running shoes on
Energizer bunny, baby, I just keep going and going and going all night long
Trying to make you feel good, just like you know I would
And if you ask if I finish what I start, all I got to is "Yeah!"

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm trying to get this pleasure thang poppin', should we be stopping?
And you be like no!
Girl, I know your nervous, but it ain't no time, like showtime
No, it ain't no time like showtime, come on girl
The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the empty skies, my love
To the dark and the empty skies
The first time ever I kissed your mouth
And felt your heart beat close to mine
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love
That was there at my command
The first time ever I lay with you
I felt the earth move in my hand
I thought our joy would fill the earth
And last 'till the end of time, my love
And last

[Chorus: The Temptations]
War, huh
What is it good for?
Nothing
War, huh
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, say it again
War, huh, good god
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing

[Verse 1: Dennis Edwards]
War, I despise
'Cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears to thousands of mothers' eyes
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives

[Chorus: The Temptations]
I said, war, huh
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, say it again
War, huh
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing

[Verse 2: Dennis Edwards]
War, it's nothing but a heartbreak
War, friend only to the undertaker
War, is an enemy to all mankind
The thought of war blows my mind
War has caused unrest within the younger generation
Induction then destruction, who wants to die?

[Chorus: The Temptations]
Oh, war, huh, good God, y'all
What is it good for? (You tell 'em)
Nothing
War, good God, huh
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, good God

[Verse 3: Dennis Edwards]
War, it's nothing but a heartbreaker
War, friend only to the undertaker
Wars have shattered many young men's dreams
Made him disabled, bitter and mean
Life is much too short and precious to spend fighting wars these days
War can't give life, it can only take it away

[Chorus: The Temptations]
Oh, war, huh, good God
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, mhm
War, huh, good God almighty, listen
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, yeah

[Verse 4: Dennis Edwards]
War, it's nothing but a heartbreaker
War, friend only to the undertaker
Peace, love and understanding, tell me
Is there no place for them today?
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But Lord knows it got to be a better way
I said

[Chorus: The Temptations]
War, huh, yeah yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, say it again
War, huh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, say it again
War, huh, nothing but a heartbreaker
What is it good for?
You're the greatest thing in my life, baby
Without your love, baby
I don't know just what I would do
Years of loving you, you've been so true
I believe I'd lose my mind if I lost you

I guess I've been lucky to have someone so dear
To talk and laugh and always bring me cheer
After all of these years you've been so true to me, baby
I believe I'd lose my mind if I lost you

After all of the lies I've told you
Just like giving you the stars
And buying you mink coats
Mink coats and diamonds, baby
Money in the bank and each year
Each year two brand new cars

You're the greatest thing in my life, baby
Between me and you I know I've got the best deal
Let me thank you, baby, you've been so true
I'd lose my mind if I lost you
Oh my home is in the mountains
I am free, I am free
I am one with wind and eagles
I am free
Given wings to sail in gracefulness
The sky, The sky
Given voice to sing in breathlessness
I find that I can fly! (fly away)

I been a long time on the highway
I been a long time one the run
And it gets to be like chaos
When I'm so long away from home
And sometimes its just too much to bare
And I hide behind my eyes
I can picture friendly faces and I can dream of friendly skies
And I guess that I'm the lucky one
For the truth of what I know
For my heart has not denied me, and I have somewhere to go
I shall never be a prisinor twix steel and glass and stone
And if I leave I will return to my Rocky Mountain home
Oh my home is in the mountains
I am free I am free
I am one with wind and eagle
I am free
Given wing to sail in gracefulness
The sky the sky
Given voice to sing in breathlessness
I find that I can fly, fly away

In the Hands of my Father
Inthe Light of the Sunshine
On the Wings of an Eagle
I'm flying again (I'm flying again)
I'm flying again (I'm flying again)
I'm flying again (I'm flying again)
I'm flying again (and I'm flying again)
Words and music make a song for our hearts to sing along
Like a choir within the air , there'll be music everywhere
A bitter tear across your cheek
A smile from you is all I need
We'll give them cause to breathe the air
There'll be lovers everywhere

I'll be your singer and your song
For all the love you've brought along
I'll be your day , I'll be your night
I'll see that everything's all right
I'll turn the ocean into sand
Like my heart at your command
I'll make the raindrops turn to snow
And then everyone will know that we're in love
Yeah, yeah , yeah

And when the morning brings it's light
And Mister Moonlight says goodbye
My hand is shaking when you smile
You make me feel just like a child
My mind is searching for a way
So that you won't have to say
You've got to go and can't come back
But I can't think you'd make me sad
I'll be your singer and your song
For all the love you've brought along
I'll be your day , I'll be your night
I'll see that everything's all right
I'll turn the ocean into sand
Like my heart at your command
I'll make the raindrops turn to snow
And then everyone will know that we're in love

(take away the pain in me)
I'll be your singer and your song

(soon you'll see a change in me)
For all the love you've brought along

(what's the point of going on)
I'll be your day , I'll be your night (the story ends, the feelings gone)
I'll see that everything's all right
I'll turn the ocean into sand
Like my heart at your command
I'll make the raindrops turn to snow
And then everyone will know that we're in love

(the story ends, the feelings gone)
I'll see that everything's all right
I'll turn the ocean into sand
Like my heart at your command
I'll make the raindrops turn to snow
And then everyone will know that we're in love

[Verse 1]
It was love, love alone
Caused King Edward to leave his throne
It was love, love, love, love, love alone
Caused King Edward to leave his throne

On the 10th of December we heard the talk
He gave his throne to the Duke of York
It was love, love, love, love, love alone
Caused King Edward to leave his throne

King Edward was noble, King Edward was great
It was love that caused him to abdicate
It was love, love, love, love, love alone
Caused King Edward to leave his throne

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
He said he was sorry that his mommy would grieve
He cannot help it, he would have to leave
It was love, love, love, love, love alone
Caused King Edward to leave his throne
You can take his power you can take his bought
Leave him with his yachting boat
It was love, love, love, love, love alone
Caused King Edward to leave his throne

[Bridge]
Woo, yeah, love, love, love, love, love
Caused King Edward

[Verse 3]
You can take his money, you can take his store
But leave him that lady from Baltimore
It was love, love, love, love, love alone
Caused King Edward to leave his throne

I don't know what Mrs. Simpson got in her bone
That caused the king to leave his throne
It was love, love, love, love, love alone
Caused King Edward to leave his throne

On the 10th of December 1936
The Duke of Windsor went to get his kicks
It was love, love alone
Caused King Edward to leave his throne

Love, love, it was love, love alone
Caused King Edward to leave his throne
It was love, love alone

Caused him to leave his throne
Treat her like a lady
Hoo
Ooh, yeah, baby
Whoa, mmm
Now I'm the kinda guy who don't believe
That chivalry is dead, no
Cause I believe a woman should be treated
With the utmost respect, mmm
Don't be afraid, don't turn and walk away
I wanna get to know ya, well
Don't be ashamed, don't say that love's to blame
Just come and look me over
(You'll find a heart)
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for
How could anybody ask for much more, woah hoo

Now I like openin' doors
Pickin' up her hanky off the floor
(Yeah, yeah)
Treat her like a lady
(Treat her like lady)

Even
(Help her with her coat)
Well, treat her like a lady
(Treat her like lady)
In this world of liberation
It's so easy to forget, mmm
That it's so nice to have a man around
To lend a helping hand, you can bet, bet you can, baby
When I was young, my mama used to say, "Boy
A woman's like a flower with love on her you shower"
Ever since that day, her words never went away
I always will remember to treat my baby tender
(You'll find a heart)
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for
How could anybody ask for much more, whoa
(More, more, more)
Now I like openin' doors

If only I could be less blind
If only I knew what to find
Everywhere and all of the time
It's bending my mind

Confusion's prince is at my door
The crown I wear is the one he wore
He's here to bring me down some more
And bend my mind

The friendly stranger calls my name
He only wants me for his game
But it don't matter, just the same
I'll bend his mind

I've waved my flags into the sun
I've fought my wars and now they're won
And I didn't need nobody's gun
I bent their mind

If only I could be less blind
If only I knew what to find
Everywhere and all of the time
It's bending my mind
Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside, there was something going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart, we got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah ha
From one love to another, ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, ah ha
From one love to another, ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha
Ghetto superstar
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Fall away with me
To another place
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha
You know there is Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid an Donner and Blitzen
Oh, but do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

Whoa-o-o-o-o

His name is
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other, other, other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

(Then one foggy Christmas eve)
You know (Santa came to say...)
(Hey Rudolph)
You, with your nose so bright
Come on, come on, come on, come on and guide my sleigh tonight

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee (Hey Rudolph)
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history

(Then one foggy Christmas eve)
Santa came to say

(Hey Rudolph)
You, with your nose so bright
Come on, come on, come on, come on and guide my sleigh tonight

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee (Hey Rudolph)
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history

Ooo, Rudolph, come on and guide my sleigh
Ooo, Rudolph, come on and guide my sleigh
Hey, hey, hey, Rudolph, come on and guide my sleigh tonight
Hey, hey, hey, Rudolph, with your nose so bright

[Spoken Intro: Mayte]
The year is 2020
And in the club - Love4OneAnother
Students dance to the heartbeat of the drum

[Verse: Prince]
Three thousand or more
Dance on the dance floor
Synesthetics every one
Taste the color, smell the fun

[Chorus]
The force of nature is what brought us here
The walls between us soon all disappear
The year is 2020 and there's no more fear

[Outro: Prince and Mayte]
Can you see this?
Mm-hmm
Peace and happy people

Ah.....
Ev'ry day's Saturday, feeling in steadily
Laughing at people with stars in their eyes
Vicar Hays approaching town, preaching in the underground
Talking with the lambs who came out of the sky
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world

Dinner time, anytime, see a crown, should be mine
Ev'ryone's grabbing but no one will get
Sunny day, should I care, taking in the garden air
Ev'ryone's happy though no one can see
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world

Ah...

You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world

Ev'ry day's Saturday, feeling in steadily

[KRS-One]
Yo, where's my people at?
We be where the elite be at
We really never need the gat, we comin with a sneak attack
In fact, best believe we back
What we rap it heats the track
Kenny Parker sees to that, my job is to teach these cats
Present the clear speech they lack
And show 'em how to eat from rap

[April S. Williams]
We keep it tight.. we keep it right.. (that's right)
We're comin strong.. (uh-huh, yeah) we're movin on.. (tell 'em again!)

[KRS-One]
You know why the devil can't get with me?
Cause he's a liar, I've got victory
You can stick with me, my click is free
Negativity, that doesn't live with me
These rappers on one, I've skipped to three
These rappers on A, I've skipped to C
My image, heads ain't quick to be
So I thank you for pickin me
I know why people got to know, these wack rappers got to go
Let a MC rock the show
I'll show 'em how it 'posed to go
We forgot simply what we supposed to know
We still must defeat the foe
So what you got the dough? Your words don't make us glow
In fact they make us slow
How long this gonna take to know you ain't gotta be a hoe?

[April S. Williams]
We keep it tight.. we keep it right.. (yeah)
We're comin strong.. (yeah, yeah) we're movin on.. (uh-huh)

[KRS-One]
Look at the teacher, I stay attuned
People are blessed when I walk in the room
Snakes(?) don't stop me, and if they did
They'd be askin for a tag 'fore they kids
Medical students lose it when I enter any hospital
Doctors wanna talk music and whatever's topical
It's all logical, I perform the impossible
Through words I put hip-hop in you; listen
Here's what we got to do, unify
Defeat the flesh, defeat the beast in you and I
Win or lose I never shout, believe in yourself and never doubt
Discipline is simply a better route

[April S. Williams]
We keep it tight - we keep it tight
We keep it right - we keep it right
We're comin strong - comin strong
We're movin on - movin on!
It's time to rise - it's time to rise

Well, every time that I come home nobody wants to let me be
It seems that all the friends I've got, just got to come, interrogate me
Well, I appreciate your feelings and I don't want to pass you by
But I don't ask you about your business, don't ask me about mine

Well, its true I love the money and I love my brand new car
I like drinkin' the best of whiskey and playin' in a honky tonk bar
But when I come off the road, well, I just got to have my time
'Cause I got to find a break in this action, else I'm gonna lose my mind

So, don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So, don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye

That's right

Well, "What's your favorite color and do you dig the brothers"
Is drivin' me up a wall
And every time I think I can sleep, some fool has got to call
Well, don't you think that when I come home
I just want a little peace of mind
And if you want to talk about the business buddy, you just are wastin' time
So, don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So, don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye

I said, don't ask no stupid questions
And I won't send you away
If you want to talk fishin'
Well, I guess that'll be okay

[Intro: Ronald Isley]
Hello, ladies (Hello)
How are y'all doin' tonight? (Fine)
Can I keep it real? (Yes)
And say what's on my mind (Yes)

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
There you are in that chair
Waiting for me to take you there
To break it down and sing to you
And make you feel these words are true
Who's gonna be the lucky one?
Who spend some money on 'em and have some fun? Tell me
I choose you

[Chorus: R. Kelly & (Ronald Isley)]
(What would you do) What would you do if I said all of these words were true?
(What would you) What would you do if I came down here and sat with you?
(What would you do) What would you do if I told the band to break it down?
(Ooh) What would you do if I said I wanna lay you down?
(What) What would you do if I put this money in your hand?
(Would you do) What would you do if I said I'd like to be your man?
(What would you do, baby?) What would you do if I brought you up here on this stage?
What would you do? (Tell me) What would you do?

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]
The lights are down (Yeah), the mood is set (Yeah)
The sound is right, I'm heated
Look to my left and check my crowd
Look to my right (Yeah) to see if they are ready now
Tell me who out there feels lucky
Wants me to take 'em shopping and buy 'em everything
Hmm, I choose you

[Chorus: R. Kelly & (Ronald Isley)]
(Now what would you do, yeah) What would you do if I said all of these words were true?
(What would you do) What would you do if I came down here and sat with you?
(What, what) What would you do if I told the band to break it down?
(Break it down) What would you do if I said I wanna lay you down?
(Ow) What would you do if I put this money in your hand?
(Out this money on your hand, baby) What would you do if I said I'd like to be your man?
(Be your man) What would you do if I brought you up here on this stage?
(Right up here) What would you do? What would you do?

[Bridge: R. Kelly & (Ronald Isley)]
(What if I got your) Hair done (Yeah), nails done (Yes, I will)
Toes done (And) bank account (I'll even take you)
Shopping (Girl, I will) if you be good (You'll have)
Your own car (And the) platinum credit cards

[Chorus: R. Kelly & (Ronald Isley)]
(What would you do, baby?) What would you do if I said all of these words were true?
(What would you do?) What would you do if I came down here and sat with you?
(What would you do, girl?) What would you do if I told the band to break it down?
What would you do if I said I wanna lay you down?
(Said I gotta know, I've gotta know, ow)
What would you do if I put this money in your hand?
(Right in your hand) What would you do if I said I'd like to be your man?
(Girl, what would you do? Ow) What would you do if I brought you up here on this stage?
(On this stage) What would you do? (What) What would you do?
(Ladies, it's showtime) What would you do if I said all of these words were true?
(Sit back and unwind) What would you do if I came down here and sat with you?
(I'm 'bout to make you mine) What would you do if I told the band to break it down?
(Ow) What would you do if I said I wanna lay you down?

[Outro: Ronald Isley]
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
What would you do? What would you do? What would you do? What would you do?
What would you do? What would you do?
So you're feelin' lonely
Like love has gone away at night
You're brokenhearted cause your man ain't never done you right
You feel discouraged, feel like love ain't nothing but a lie
You're brokenhearted
Taking all the teardrops from your eyes, I'm telling you

No woman don't cry
Promise I will be by your side
I want you to know that love is alive (Yes it is)
And love don't want no woman to cry

I can hear you thunder
I can feel the pain in your eyes
I can smell the flowers that he never gave on Valentine's

Don't be discouraged cause he wasn't right
I know your heart is broken
But I promise you that you are gon' survive and I'm tellin you

No woman don't cry
Promise I will be by your side
I want you to know that love is alive
And love don't want no woman to cry
You gave him your love
You gave him your soul
You gave him your money
You gave him a home
Well all he ever gave you
Was a broken heart
Well girl I'm right here standing with love

No woman don't cry
Promise I will be by your side
I want you to know that love is alive
And love don't want no woman to cry

Oh... no
Is it my imagination
Or are U with the boys again?
U used 2 take me with U
I used 2 be your best friend
When U finally come home
Your car ain't got no gasoline
That's OK, baby
Cuz my new love treats me like a queen
Eat your heart out

CHORUS:
Vibrator makes me feel so good
Vibrator - don't U wish U could?
Vibrator - his patience can't be beat
Vibrator - I guess U could say that U're obsolete
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
It must be my imagination
Cuz I know I didn't hear U laugh
U'd be surprised what I do when U're through
Taking your macho bath
Uncharted waters sailed with ease
Land is always in sight
But with U it's always abandon ship (abandon ship)
And we didn't even get away from the dock 2night
Eat your heart out
CHORUS
Is it my imagination
Are U with the boys again?
U used 2 take me with U
I used 2 be your best friend
But now I'm just a plaything
Your ego-feeding female sex machine
Well U can take a hike, mister
Cuz U're the poorest excuse 4 a man I've ever seen!
Eat your heart out, sucker!
CHORUS
Vibrator makes me feel so good
Vibrator makes me feel so good
Uh oh, oh no!
Please don't die on me no
(Vibrator) {repeat in BG}
May I help U?
Yes, I was wondering if U had batteries 4 my bo...
Oh my God!
Look at the size of that thing!
Where did U get this?
Look, U got batteries or not?
Oh sure, we have batteries
They're in the storage room
Tell U what
I'll just take this downstairs and put them in myself
No, I'll tell U what, U and your rubber glove can go downstairs
And I'll take my business elsewheres
Now gimme this! Jeez!
Well, what do U want?
Goodness!
Goodness, nothing!
Baby, I'm busy
What do U want?!!
Do have any batteries that will fit my body massager?
Body massager? Please!
Right, U see my back's been acting up lately and...
Yeah, my back's been acting up 2
In fact, it acts up every time my boyfriend leaves
No, really, my back...
Save it honey, put it in the bank

Yeah, yeah, that'll work
Thank U!

(Vibrator) {repeats in BG}
G-spot, g-spot, where, oh where..

Ready or not, here I come
Oh yeah
Oh, here I come
Oh yeah
Here I.. here I.. here I come!

Michelle, little girl I need you baby
More than the air I breathe
My love for you grows stronger babe
My words you must believe

Well I need to see you laugh again
And I want to see you smile
Michelle, little girl I love you baby
You're my only child

Michelle, little girl the pain for you
Is hurting me inside
At night I think of you sometimes
I lean my head and cry

I need to see you laugh again
And I wanna see you smile
Michelle, little girl I love you baby
You're my only child

Michelle, little girl I need you baby
More than the air I breathe
My love for you grows stronger babe
My words you must believe
I need to see you laugh again
And I wanna see you smile
Michelle, little girl I love you baby
You're my only child

Michelle, little girl I need you baby
More than the air I breathe
My love for you grows stronger babe
I have been a rover I have walked alone
Hiked a hundred highways never found a home
Still in all I'm happy the reason is you see
Once in a while along the way love's been good to me

There was a girl in Denver before the summer storm
Oh, her eyes were tender, oh, her arms were warm
And she could smile away that thunder, kiss away the rain
Even though she's gone away you won't hear me complain

I have been a rover I have walked alone
Hiked a hundred highways never found a home
Still in all I'm happy the reason is you see
Once in a while along the way love's been good to me

There was a girl in Portland before the winter chill
We used to go out courtin' along October Hill
And she could laugh away the dark clouds, cry away the snow
It seems like only yesterday as down the road I go

I've been a rover I have walked alone
Hiked a hundred highways never found a home
Still in all I'm happy the reason is you see
Once in a while along the way love's been good to me
Well she's little and she's low, right down on the ground
Well the way she acts makes a rabbit huddle 'round
She's mine, well she's mine little and low crippled and she's blind
Everybody's laughin' where I go 'cause I'm leading my old lady
Down the road, but she's mine
Well she's mine little and low poor child crippled and blind
She's my baby crippled and blind
She's still my girl, she's mine
Here comes the doo doo, flying up the street
Running like the fire burning on his feet
Casting his eye left to the right
Looking for a place he can duck out of sight

Here come the goomba goomba, rumbling up the road
Looking for somebody to fill up the load
A big fat cat he had, get off the bag
Scooping up the striker, lest given him a whack

Come on boy, jump inside
Come on, boy, we gonna take you for a ride
It's an excursion, where you don't have to pay

Better make sure that you stay outta sight
For the Chakalas when he got a big appetite

Come on boy, jump inside

[Chorus: Afroman]
Po bitch po bitch
Mad cuz hes broke and im rich
Po bitch po bitch
Cryin on the internet little snitch
Po bitch po bitch
Mad cuz hes broke and im rich
Po bitch po bitch
Cryin on the internet little snitch

[Verse 1: Afroman]

I meet different people in the streets
I can sing, I can rap, I can do beats
Back when I was a K-I-D
Rappers were assholes to me
I don't wanna be like the bad rapper
I wanna be the good rap the love for the hood rap
So I listen to the circumstances
And if I can I give people chances
Nobody gave shit to me but should I be like them
You sink I swim
No I shouldn't so I should help people out if I could
What about people like po bitch
Jealous of me and he wanna get rich
Don't wanna crawl before he walk
Hateful ungrateful talking that talk

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Afroman]

I don't wanna come off like a jerk
But everybody in the world has to work
Everyday I spend money, lend money
Without bringing in money, its not funny
Gotta make a profit I can't be broke
Like po bitch is with no crack to smoke
I make money off everything
Like a flat broke crack smoke human being
Named po bitch, internet snitch
Dissing me making me rich
Drunk n high, whack fro20
Po lil bitch gets no money
But you can get the fuck out my face
And cry to the world on myspace
A snitch is something I must destroy
Never sell drugs with po boy

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Afroman]

We live around the corner why you on the internet
You say you gonna sue me but the letter hasn't came yet
I gave you a place to stay
You stole my equipment n bought some yay
You can loose some real-estate but gain possession
You won't teach me a painful lesson I'm teach you one
Pack up you done, stay on the run with your crack baby son
Barny, cookie monster with laringitas
Your flat ass bitch got aids and hepatitis
I love big women, yeah thats true
Thats the reason I fucked you
Bent you over, stuck my dick in
You'll be ready when you go to the pen
Snitch in there like you do out here
You won't be around next year

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Afroman]

You made a song calling me a bitch nigga
But I'm a pimp and your beats made me rich nigga
I made fat dough out of fresh dough
Paid you good you big fat crack hoe
Asshole, you a sad soul, sore loser, out in the cold
You say I'm washed up but you never washed in
I bet you wash everybody's drawers in the pen
Come to my house and pull the trigger
Get off the internet snitch ass nigga
Fuck all this drama
You got your ass kicked by your baby momma
So pack your pistols and your rifles
Watch them black gangster cisciples
Barking like big dog internet poodles
I'm eating steak while you fools eat noodles

[Chorus]

Ey huss up its the hungry hustla the american dream the successful failure
The acceptable reject Afro-motherfucking-m-a-n from pimpdale Pimpafornia you know what I'm saying
You know bitches get outta line but they get checked you know what I'm saying
You know Grass grow then it get cut you know what I'm saying
And pretty soon you gotta cut it again you know
Its just life inhale exhale eastside palmdale
It won't stop, it don't move out, it won't stop...

Something is boiling, boiling in me
Someone is toying, toying with me
It won't get out, it won't stop
It don't move out, it won't leave
It won't get out, it won't stop
It don't move out

Someone's ignoring, ignoring defeat
But the taste of your poison
Your poison is sweet, so sweet

He won't give up, but I won't up and go
I don't know how
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
He's had enough, I won't leave
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
I don't know how
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
He's had enough
Took my heart and kept it
Now my wounds are septic
There's no choice but to lose
I've become so reckless
All my love's infected
With the remnants of you

Took my heart and kept it
Now my wounds are septic
There's no choice but to lose
I've become so reckless
All my love's infected
With the remnants of you
This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be a-okay
All my bills have all gone pink
I shit the bed
I broke the bed

This coulda been a slow song
A laundry list of all the wrongs
But end of the day
This is my beautiful disaster-piece I've made
And it goes and I quote "it will never be like this"

This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be A-Okay
This will all make perfect sense someday
There's got to be a reason for the rain

I don't understand the numbers
But my faith is in the math
That the odds are all this pain will leave and I will live and
And we'll look back and laugh
And to all the hearts I've broken
And the ones that once broke mine
I've got suspicions, all will be forgiven in time
All you gotta do is call them up and say that now

This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be A-Okay
This will all make perfect sense someday
There's got to be a reason for the rain

And if it ever gets bad
I mean really bad
I'll move to Nova Scotia
Forget the life I had
I'll be up at 9 each morning
Down by the shore
Collecting things that fell off boats in storms
Well ok so I might never
But it's nice to know the option's there

This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be A-Okay
This will all make perfect sense someday
There's got to be a reason for the rain
A reason for the rain (x3)
And it doesn't help
That I keep biting my lip in the same place
This moment, this minute
And each second in it
Will leave a glow upon the sky
And as time goes by, it will never die

This will be my shining hour
Calm and happy and bright
And in my dreams, your face will flower
Through the darkness of the night

Like the lights of home before me
Or an angel who's watching o'er me
This will be my shining hour
'Til I'm with you again

Like the lights of home before me
Or an angel watching o'er me
This will be my shining hour
'Til I'm with you again

[Verse 1]
We put the F U back in fun, serve it up with a smile
You ain't heard this type of stuff in a while
I want your ears right now, ante up, buck stops here
Put your hands up like you plan to volunteer
Ollie ollie Oxy Free, fresh outta detox
Can't afford the doctor's fee so floor it towards the weed spot
A whole city waitin' for me to fall
Because I made a pretty penny outta nothin' at all
It's that circle, circle, dot, dot, Cootie shot shit, you know
Everybody lovin' it, but ain't nobody touchin' it, yeah
Decaydance takin' over this year
I feel like dancin' baby, hold my fears (So sexy)

[Chorus]
And it's ok to get a little risky
(Ahh, the good times)
Forget work it's all play at the end of the day
(Ahh, the good times)
Just be sure to send the females my way
(Ahh, the good times)
Oh look at how cute, we made a mess on the dance floor
So let me get a soul clap, that's what we got hands for
(Clapping)

Exactly what I've been trying to tell you, Pete, look at 'em
I know you seen 'em as soon as we came in
Pick your jaw up man, it's alright we havin' a good time
Ha, stupid...

[Verse 2]
Mission accomplished, operation spike punch successful
Now back to tellin' girls I'm only nineteen, wowzers
Bob's parents ain't back for another six hours
So it's just enough time to kill the keg that's in the shower
Curse you aqua scum, follow the leader
Made today's big fish outta yesterday's bottom feeders
Until I'm belly up, it's all good times from here on out
From the beginning 'til we clear on out
It's like this year, my year, you here, who cares?
Focus you can't handle it, we kill 'em like Crush Management, please
I got no time to player hate
I'm the type to crash your party with Teddy Ruxpin and a Slayer tape

[Chorus]
And it's ok to get a little risky
(Ahh, the good times)
Forget work it's all play at the end of the day
(Ahh, the good times)
Just be sure to send the females my way
(Ahh, the good times)
Oh look at how cute, we made a mess on the dance floor
So let me get a soul clap, that's what we got hands for
(Clapping)

[Bridge]
Seriously, for one if I gave a fuck my eyes would be locked onto yours
And not to nothin' that's goin' on behind your back, homey
For two, I'm sorry, I forgot, what were you sayin' again? Exactly
Ignorance is bliss homey, you my dear make it fact
I'm just curious as to why you take yourself so serious
You missed the joke a year back, man
The punchline just hit you in the mouth

[Chorus]
And it's ok to get a little risky
(Ahh, the good times)
Forget work it's all play at the end of the day
(Ahh, the good times)
Just be sure to send the females my way
(Ahh, the good times)
(Ahh, the good times)
And it's ok to get a little risky
(Ahh, the good times)
Forget work it's all play at the end of the day
(Ahh, the good times)
Just be sure to send the females my way
(Ahh, the good times)
Everybody wants to know
Why I sing the blues
Yes, I say everybody wanna know
Why I sing the blues
Well, I've been around a long time
I really have paid my dues

When I first got the blues
They brought me over on a ship
Men were standing over me
And a lot more with a whip
And everybody wanna know
Why I sing the blues
Well, I've been around a long time
Mm, I've really paid my dues

I've laid in a ghetto flat
Cold and numb
I heard the rats tell the bedbugs
To give the roaches some
Everybody wanna know
Why I'm singing the blues
Yes, I've been around a long time
People, I've paid my dues
I stood in line
Down at the County Hall
I heard a man say, "We're gonna build
Some new apartments for y'all"
And everybody wanna know
Yes, they wanna know
Why I'm singing the blues
Yes, I've been around a long, long time
Yes, I've really, really paid my dues

Now I'm gonna play Lucille

My kid's gonna grow up
Gonna grow up to be a fool
Cause they ain't got no more room
No more room for him in school
And everybody wanna know
Everybody wanna know
Why I'm singing the blues
I say I've been around a long time
Yes, I've really paid some dues

Yeah, you know the company told me
Guess you're born to lose
Everybody around me, people
It seems like everybody got the blues
But I had 'em a long time
I've really, really paid my dues
You know I ain't ashamed of it, people
I just love to sing my blues
I walk through the cities, people
On my bare feet
I had a fill of catfish and chitterlings
Up in Downbill Street
You know I'm singing the blues
Yes, I really
I just have to sing my blues
I've been around a long time
People, I've really, really paid my dues

Now Father Time is catching up with me
Gone is my youth
I look in the mirror everyday
And let it tell me the truth
I'm singing the blues
Mm, I just have to sing the blues
I've been around a long time
Yes, yes, I've really paid some dues

Yeah, they told me everything
Would be better out in the country
Everything was fine
I caught me a bus uptown, baby
And every people, all the people
Got the same trouble as mine
I got the blues, huh huh
I say I've been around a long time
I've really paid some dues
One more time, fellows!

Blind man on the corner
Begging for a dime
The rollers come and caught him
And throw him in the jail for a crime
I got the blues
Mm, I'm singing my blues
I've been around a long time
Mm, I've really paid some dues

Can we do just one more?

Oh I thought I'd go down to the welfare
To get myself some grits and stuff
But a lady stand up and she said
"You haven't been around long enough"
That's why I got the blues
Mm, the blues
I say, I've been around a long time
I've really, really paid my dues

Fellows, tell them one more time

Ha, ha, ha. That's all right, fellows
Yeah!
We live in a binary reality. We do
It's a world of black and white
There's only two types of people in this world:
Those who can finish lists

What is art? You know. What is art?
Is art something gay people do to get back at their fathers? .... Could be

What is an artist?
What makes a great artist? You know. .... Great artists, like myself
Like the great director Michael Bay
Like the great Irish actor Shaquille O'Neal?

We ask questions
You know, questions nobody else dares to ask
Questions like
Where are all the Sour Patch Parents?
Questions like if Mickey's a mouse, and Minnie's a mouse, and Donald's a duck, and Daisy and Goofy, if they're all animals and they can talk
Why is Pluto just a fucking dog?
Did they just forget to anthropomorphize him or, worse, is Mickey keeping a mentally handicapped dude as a pet?
I'm not, how does that fit in to that universe, that paradigm
Goofy's a dog, he's talking
This one, crawling around
Guys, you got tight, I would never bash Disney
Never
Ever
I think Disney teaches girls
Young girls such important lessons that princess fairy tales, you know like
Cinderella: It doesn't matter where you come from or how poor you are, you know, as long as you're incredibly hot
Snow White: Which encourages children to
You know, give midgets nicknames
Sleeping Beauty: You know, which encourages, um
Date rape, maybe not
Maybe not that one
I was doing a show recently on the border of, uh, Hannah Montana and South Dakota Fanning
And after the show
After the show, a guy came up to me
And said, "Bo, why don't you ever tell stories on-stage about people coming up to you after the shows?"
And I said, "Cause they're never funny"

I've always wanted a black girlfriend
Not as, you know, cause like
I don't know, h-how, how do I put this?
When we 69, I can call it "yin-yanging"
Um
It's not a, it's not racist
Guys, it's 21st Century racism
It's racism in light of itself
The only reason I'm saying these things
Is because the stigmas about race are already there
And I'm just playing off of that
And they understand that
So, if, after the show
You see like a black guy beating me up
He's doing it ironically, okay?
Get your story straight
Single girl, oh, single girl
She's gone anywhere she please
Oh, gone anywhere she please
Married girl, oh, married girl
Got a baby on her knees
Oh, got a baby on her knees

Single girl, oh, single girl
She's going dressed up so fine
Oh, going dressed up so fine
Married girl, oh, married girl
She wears any kind
Oh, she wears any kind

Single girl, oh, single girl
She goes to the store and buys
Oh, goes to the store and buys
Married girl, oh, married girl
She rocks the cradle and cries
Oh, rocks the cradle and cries
Single girl, oh, single girl
She lays in bed 'til one
Oh, lays in bed 'til one
Married girl, oh, married girl
She's up before the sun
Oh, up before the sun

Single girl, oh, single girl
She's looking for a man
Oh, looking for a man
Married girl, oh, married girl
She's got her wedding band
Oh, got her wedding band
Stars in the sky were dancing
One night perfect for romancing
The night a sinner kissed an angel
He wanted thrills, she wanted love
Oh but his sighs were tender
As he begged her to surrender
The night a sinner kissed an angel
And she believed that it was love
How was she to know that every lovely vow
Was part of the game he was playing
But to his surprise he realized
Somehow he meant every word he was saying
Yes, miracles can happen
I know 'cause I saw what happened
That night a sinner kissed an angel
That was the night I fell in love
You know what i mean, it's like walking in the heat all day with no water
It's like waiting for a friend watching everybody else meet theirs on that corner
Or losing in an argument although you're right can't get your thoughts in order

Bridge:
Still I refrain, from talking at you, talking on, you know me well, I don't explain
But what the hell

Chorus:
Why do you think i come round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time
Oh the truth spills out, Ooh all I've told you now
You know what I mean
Although i try my best I still let down the team
You're everything i want
Why should i resist when you are there for me?
Bridge
Chorus
I've told you now x 3
Bridge
Chorus
Here goes - baby here goes
Every worry, every fear goes
Every dull day in the year goes
I'm about to fall in love

Here goes - yes sir, here goes
Every sky that isn't clear goes
Every sigh that's insincere goes
Because it's you I'm dreaming of

Looks like I've been sold out
Can't fight off the charms
I just couldn't hold out
It's cold out of your arms

Here goes - get the rice out
Get the trip to - paradise out
Sweep that stairway - through the airway up above

Here goes - here goes
Someone ready for love
Here goes - brush that grin off
Brush that endless - bobby pin off
And the biscuits - that chagrin off
I'm about to fall in love

Here goes - get the fights out
And the quarrels - over nights out
And the patch up - when the lights out
That is all I'm dreaming of

Looks like I've been taken
Shaken off the tree
Looks like you'll be making
The bacon just for me

Here goes - get the rice out
Get the trip to - paradise out
Sweep that stairway - through the airway up above

Here goes - here goes
Here goes someone - someone who's really in love
Keep on curbing, my desire of deciding, there was a time
Having had a full taste of the joys of freedom

I'm not ready to let go of
Having had a full taste of the joys of freedom

The pure joys of freedom
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Head's all empty and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seein' double
Pays my ticket when I speed

She come skimming through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you

She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive
Sugar magnolia
Ringin' that blue bell
Golder than sunlight
Go on out singing
I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on honey, come along with me

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines in the summer night moonlight
Crazy in the sunlight, yes indeed

Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander 'round
I wander 'round

Sunshine daydream
Walkin' in the tall trees
Goin' where the wind blows
Bloomin' like a red rose
Breathin' more freely
Light out singing, I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream
Sunshine daydream
Walk you in the sunshine
Why is my heart dancing? Imagine dancing!
You look at me, and suddenly it's spring
Why do I keep sighing? not sad, just sighing
I'm young and free, and suddenly it's spring
High on a hilltop, love is calling
Someone should wish me happy falling
No more being lonely, can I be lonely?
You look at me and suddenly it's spring
(musical interlude)
High on a hilltop, love is calling
Someone should wish me happy falling
No more being lonely, can I be lonely?
You look at me, I look at you
We're young and free, and suddenly it's spring
Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't wanna see my Mumma cry
Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't wanna see my Mumma cry

Just last year when I was only seven
And now I'm almost eight as you can see
You came home at a quarter past eleven
Fell down underneath our Christmas tree

Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't wanna see my Mumma cry
Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't wanna see my Mumma cry

Mumma smiled and looked outside the window
She told me son, you better go upstairs
Then you laughed and hollered Merry Christmas
I turned around and saw my Mumma's tears

Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't wanna see my Mumma cry
Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't wanna see my Mumma cry
No, I don't wanna see my Mumma cry

[Verse 1]
There was a moon and a street lamp
I didn't know I drank such a lot
'Till I pissed a tequila-anaconda
The full length of the parking lot!
Oh, I talk too loose
Again I talk too open and free
I pay a high price for my open talking
Like you do for your silent mystery

[Chorus 1]
Come and talk to me
Please talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Mr. Mystery

[Verse 2]
We could talk about Martha
We could talk about landscapes
I'm not above gossip
But I'll sit on a secret where honor is at stake!
Or we could talk about power
About Jesus and Hitler and Howard Hughes
Or Charlie Chaplin's movies
Or Bergman's Nordic blues

[Chorus 2]
Please just talk to me
Any old theme you choose
Just come and talk to me
Mr. Mystery, talk to me

[Verse 3]
You could talk like a fool, I'd listen
You could talk like a sage
Anyway the best of my mind
All goes down on the strings and the page
That mind picks up all these pictures
It still gets my feet up to dance
Even though it's covered with keyloids
From the "slings and arrows of outrageous romance"

[Bridge]
I stole that from Willy the Shake
You know, "Neither a borrower nor a lender be"
Romeo, Romeo talk to me

[Verse 4]
Is your silence that golden?
Are you comfortable in it?
Is it the key to your freedom
Or is it the bars on your prison?
Are you gagged by your ribbons?
Are you really exclusive or just miserly?
You spend every sentence as if it was marked currency!

[Chorus 3]
Come and spend some on me
Shut me up and talk to me
I'm always talking
Chicken squawking
Please talk to me

[Verse 1]
We strolled the lane together
Laughed at the rain together
Sang love's refrain together
And we'd both pretend it would never end

[Verse 2]
One day we cried together
Cast love aside together
You're gone from me but in my memory
We always will be together

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
One day we cried together
Cast love aside together
You're gone from me but in my memory
We always will be together
It's a long way from L.A. to Denver
It's a long time to hang in the sky
It's a long way home to Starwood in Aspen
My sweet Rocky Mountain paradise
Oh my sweet Rocky Mountain paradise

Springtime is rollin' round slowly
Gray skies are bringin' me down
I can't remember when I've ever been so lonely
I forgot what it's like to be home
Can't remember what it's like to be home

I think on my lady's sweet memories
I think on my children sweet smiles
I think on my home in Starwood in Aspen
All my friends and the snow covered hills
Oh my friends are the snow covered hills

Can I tell you I'm happy to be here
To share and consider this time
For I see here the shadows of changes
And a feeling of new friends to find
And I see here some new friends to find
It's a long way from this place to Denver
It's a long time to hang in the sky
It's a long way home to Starwood in Aspen
A sweet Rocky Mountain paradise
Oh my sweet Rocky Mountain paradise
And the planets of the universe go their way
Not astounded by the sun or the moon, or by the day
You and I will simply disappear out of sight
But I'm afraid soon there'll be no light

I will never love again the way I loved you
You will never rule again the way you've ruled
We will never change again the way we are changing
Oh, you'll forget the chill of love but not the strain
Oh, you'll forget the chill of love but not the strain

You will remember but I will die slowly
It's only an overture to something that was best
And don't, don't condescend me
Take your leave
Take your leave
Take your leave of me now
Disappear through the year
I wish you gone and I don't care

Now I know
Well, I was wrong
To live for a dream
If I had my life to live over
I would never dream
Oh, I would never dream
Month one Mary grows a mustache
In the second she grows a beard
In the third month her breasts fall off
The fourth month testicles appear
The fifth her penis shows its face
In the sixth month grows a foreskin
It took nine months made evident
Experience, she gave it hands
In the seventh month, Christ's sandals grow on her
In the eighth month, her chest becomes transparent
In the ninth wounds appear as Christ is apparent
And then she was Christ
And Mary disappeared

[Chorus]
I'm gonna build a big tall wall
Stone circle so you can't get out
Big tall wall
True love is what it's all about

[Verse 1]
When I see you walking down the street
My heart does a double beat
I wanna rap but I can't find the line
That a groovin' and you're so divine
When you look at me I drippity drip
All my cool goes slippity slip
I keep trippin' on the thought of you
When I get you what I'm going to do

[Chorus]
I'm gonna build a big tall wall
Stone circle so you can't get out
Big tall wall, baby
True love is what it's all about

[Verse 2]
If I see you in a restaurant
I can't eat, ooh, baby, you're all I want
You make me sweat, girl, you drunk all my cool
I feel like a kid in nursery school
All the others claim ecstasy
All I know is what you do to me
You got me feelin' like a heavy spell
Come on baby hit me, I don't care

[Chorus]
'Cause I got a big tall wall, baby
Stone circle so you can't get out
Big tall wall, baby
True love is what it's all about
Baby, huh
Baby, huh
Big tall wall, big tall wall
Let me put you behind a big tall wall
Baby, stone circle so you can't get out
Big tall wall
Baby, huh
Ooh pretty mama you can scream and shout

[Breakdown]
If I see you walkin' down the street
(See you walkin' down the street)
My heart does a double beat (My heart does a double beat)
Big tall wall
True love is what it's all about
True love is what it's all about
True love is what it's all about
All about, all about

[Refrain]
Big tall wall, big tall wall, big tall wall
Let me put you behind my big tall wall
Big tall wall, big tall wall, big tall wall
Let me put you behind my big tall wall

Yeah
Come on y'all

[Refrain]
Big tall wall, big tall wall, big tall wall
Let me put you behind my big tall wall

[Chorus]
Big tall wall, huh
Big tall wall
Baby
Big tall wall, baby
Stone circle so you can't get out, alright
Big tall wall
Baby
True live is, true love, true love, true love is what it's all about

[Outro]
Big ol', big ol' tall wall
Well, yeah yeah
Oh
Come on y'all
Big ol' tall wall
Tall wall, big ol' tall wall
Come on y'all
Big ol' tall wall
It starts with one thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down 'til the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Verse 1]
If the fish swam out of the ocean
And grew legs and they started walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking
And the stars fell out of the sky
And my tears rolled into the ocean
And now I'm looking for a reason why
You even set my world into motion

[Chorus]
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold

[Verse 2]
I look up into the night sky
I see a thousand eyes staring back
And all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black
I feel the weight of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation
Then most of my life isn't real

[Verse 2]
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold

[Interlude]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-ooh-oh, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-oh

[Outro]
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
Take me in your arms and hold me
Give me just a minute more
To help me over all the days that I'll be blue
Take my lips and kiss me gently
'Cause I know that like before
When you leave me all alone I'll cry for you

I haven't got the right to ask for love or sympathy
After I did all the things I shouldn't do
But all I'm asking for is just a little memory
'Cause I know that when you go I'll cry for you

I'll sit and watch the window and I'll pray that you will come
But at the end of every day I'll still be blue
I'll think of all the chances that I had to keep you mine
And like I've done a million times I'll cry for you

Memories that come and linger make me wish we'd never met
Because it seems they're gonna break my heart in two
Either give me love forevermore or help me to forget
'Cause when you're gone far away I'll cry for you
I'll sit and watch the window and I'll pray that you will come
But at the end of every day I'll still be blue
I'll think of all the chances that I had to keep you mine
And like I've done a million times I'll cry for you
I begged her, I pleaded, I told her: Baby, come out of your shell
I told her: Maybe, you'll find that it's swell
I argued, I threatened, I said: You can't send me home
Not like this, then I finally got my kiss

I begged her, I pleaded, I told her: Baby, come out of your shell
And I told her: Maybe, you'll find that it's swell
She argued, then I threatened: You can't send me home
Not like this, then I finally got my kiss
Well now baby used to stay all night long, made me cry, Lord she done me wrong
Hurt my eyes open, and that's no lie, tables turnin', now it's her turn to cry
Cuz I used to love her, but it's all over now
Well I used to wake up in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I got worried, you know she eased my achin' head
But now she's here and there with every man in town'
Still tryin' to take for that same old clown
Cuz I used to love her, but it's all over now
Well she used to run around with every man in town
Spend all my money, Lord I better pass "go"
Put me out, it was a pity how I cried, table's turnin', now it's her turn to cry
Cuz I used to love her, but it's all over now
Yes and I used to love her, but it's all over now

Shiny toys (right on time)
Shiny toys (right on time)
Shiny toys

[Verse 1]
I'm reading people rags in the checkout lane
Look, here's a hunk, here's a honey
Celebrated people and their claims to fame
Here's a boy and his money
And pictures of the winners in the latest rate poll games

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whatever makes you "Yahoo!"
Whatever makes your time feel satisfying
Whatever makes you ("oh, I'm so excited")
Whatever makes you feel like you're right on time

[Chorus]
Party night, good bands all over town (good, good, good)
Mega lights and supersonic sounds (good, good, good)
Flashy boys and girls that really play (good, good, good)
Shiny toys, when it's over don't you hate to have to put your toys away?

[Bridge]
Shiny toys ("I love my Porsche")
Shiny toys ("I love my Porsche")
Shiny toys
Simple joys

[Verse 2]
Walking on the beach at the end of the day
Between the sand and the seagulls
Watching the glorious sun setting on the bay
Here comes a boy and his beagle
Walking with a man in a toupee
And a man with his head shaved

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Whatever makes you ("mmm, mmm!")
Whatever makes your time feel satisfying
Whatever makes you ("mmmm, mmmmm!")
Whatever makes you feel like you're right on time

[Chorus]
Party night, super bands all over town (good, good, good)
Super lights and supersonic sounds (good, good, good)
Flashy boys and girls that really play (good, good, good)

Now, New York City on a Friday night
A lot of things happenin', a lot of bright lights
Saw a pretty woman all dressed in red
She turned to me and this is what she said
She said, Honey I got the blues
I got the blues from ridin' all night in these high heel shoes

Well, she took me to the corner that she called her home
Turned around and we were all alone
Come on in, she said with a smile
Come on in and we can rest a while
Well, Honey I got the blues
I got the blues from ridin' all night in these high heel shoes

I said, Listen here, honey, I been around
You ain't foolin' me, 'cause I know what you've found
She bent kinda low and then she tickled my lips
She said, Listen here, son. I'm gonna give you a tip
Honey I got the blues
I got the blues from ridin' all night in these high heel shoes

[Verse 1]
Your turn to drive
Thick as a line, out of your mind
You need the time
You're sweet and you're tired, watching the line
Watching the line
You're making my songs, you're making my heart
Your turn to drive
It's all in the songs, it's all in your mind
Your turn to drive
Drive
Turn tonight
So
Turn tonight
You gotta
Turn to...
You gotta turn tonight
Turn tonight
Turn tonight

[Verse 2]
Your turn to drive
You're making my songs, you're making my heart

[Intro]
Really? This is what you guys been doing?
Searching

[Hook 1]
Before the break there were none
And as it broke there was one
From moon to sun, it goes on and on
The winter battle was won, the summer children were born
And so the story goes on and on
Come on woman in your left beats
Those in bed with the house keys
So fair weather feels heartbreak from here to eternity
Come on woman in your own time
Far far far from the virgin pine
Rise on now from the dead leaves
Come back to me
Oh, she sings her favorite song
Left to her tears and dreams, it goes on

[Verse 1]
Standing in line for the new one
Not the black, but the blue one
And I don't even know what it do, son
Steve Jobs said that it's too fun
Fun in a bun is what I need
It's cold out here, put my arms in the sleeves
I'll probably lose my place if I leave
But I really need to pee
If I do it right here they'll see
Makes you wonder, how do snipers
Marathon bikers
Next time: diapers
They say it has all new features
Faster processors and much better speakers
Great for kids, a necessity for teachers
For work or home, a revolutionary way of being alone
I mean, should we really get a loan?
Hey what's the matter, just tell it to your phone
Cupertino heart with Chinese parts
Built by the poor, but designed by the smart
They open the door so you go
On your mark, get ready, set, buy
Imagine a world where everything starts with an I
But it still ends with a die
Probably got an app for that, you could try
Above the iClouds, right into the great wifi
Siri, can iGod really hear me?
"Does not compute -- can you repeat more clearly?"
"Woaaaaah"

[Hook 2]
A vessel in the bloodline
A thirteenth Zodiac sign
A stitch in time, it goes on and on

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Standing in line for some new Ones
Had a bunch of blessings but I blew them
Asked Google how to use them
Sent me to a section about used guns
New runs, nuns'll scream, moms with jeans
Match their teens' jeans and genies who try to chew gum
Aw man, it's so confusing
Confusion in the bun is what I have
Good thing that God accepts cash
Maybe buy my way out his wrath
Sceptically, why am I way off this path?
Atheism's cheaper, and accepts Visa
My thoughts as I'm queing up for sneakers
Won't discriminate, getting all eight
In every color that they make
Beaverton hearts with Chinese parts
Built by the poor and designed by the smart
On your mark, get set, cop em!
Imagine a life that revolves around shopping
Conspicuous consumption
That means it serves no other function
But to show off to someone
Others who only try to show off to you -- look at your fellow loyal customers
Isn't harmony great?
Look at all these friends that marketing makes
How many fries can these arteries take?
I'll give McDonald's a little help here
I think they should expand into health care
And then you'll have all ends covered
Even make caskets, have it all umbrella'd
Can you make a corporation fear me?
"Couldn't hear your order, can you speak less clearly?"

[Hook 3]
That witch was burning the ground
Will someday come back around
From dust from to dust it goes on and on
Before daybreak there were none
And as it broke there was one
And still the story goes on and on
I don't know what you want, I don't hear what you said
Truth behind the lies
'Cause I can't see what's in your head
And spread your wings and fly, out in a brave new world
Let this be my prayer, to keep you safe when I'm not there
Can we love and live apart, I don't know,no, I don't know
How can we divide the heart, I don't know, no, I don't know

And when the night falls, and when the sky falls
I long for your embrace
And in the cold night, under the street light
I long for your embrace
Living separate lives, I have faith in you, away from you
Like a lonely child, I will hang on every word
Embrace

Through the mists of time, lovers can be friends
The power of the human heart
The secrets in the souls of men
All my blessings in disguise
I don't know, no, I don't know
Reunited we will rise
I don't know, no, I don't know
And when the night falls, and when the sky falls
I long for your embrace
And in the cold night, under the street light
I long for your embrace
Living separate lives, I have faith in you, away from you
Like a lonely child, I will hang on every word

And when the night falls, and when the sky falls
I long for your embrace
Another daybreak, another heartache
I long for your embrace

Living separate lives
Away from you
Embrace, embrace
The lonely, lonely life
Lonely days and nights
We can live our life
Embrace, embrace
With our separate lives
Embrace, embrace
The lonely, lonely lives
Lonely days and nights
I will never send away
Embrace, embrace
The lonely, lonely lives
Embrace the child inside
The lonely, lonely lives
Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers
And you know the next day
They're fighting one another

They'll work it out between them two
They'll kiss and make up
Oh, you know lovers always do now

They're in a problem they can't solve now
Oh. don't you get yourself involved, baby
They may argue with each other now
Oh, but 

[Incomprehensible]

You know they'll work it out now
Between them two
They'll kiss and make up
I know 'cos lovers all always do

Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers
And you know the next day
They're fighting one another
They'll work it out between them two
They'll kiss and make up
Lovers always do

Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers
Kanye West on Why He Doesn't Care About His LegacyEvery time I crashed the internet, it's like, this little drop of truth. Every time I say something that’s extremely truthful out loud, it literally breaks the internet. So what are we getting all of the rest of the time?

I don't care about having a legacy, I don't care about being remembered. The most important thing to me is like while I'm here, while we're having fun, while we're going to sleep, in breathing oxygen and living life and falling in love and having pain and having joy is like what can I do, what can I do with my voice, what can we do for each other to make life easier, to make life doper for our kids, you know, as they grow. You know, we were born into a broken world, we're like the cleanup crew, you know

My mother made me believe in me. When I was growing up I wanted make video games. My mom got this Amiga computer when I was in seventh grade and it had 4,096 colors. I found myself running home to use this sound program that allowed me to place in notes, it would stay, place another note. It would stay, place another note, and it's how I learned how to produce. In seventh grade I was just really making music to make video games. They just let me dream, they supported me, they pushed me, they didn't set me up to be inside of a box. Weston main thing that makes magic magic - the fact that no one believes it's possible

When I entered the fashion world and I encountered a lot of elitism and all that it just made me happy. It was something fun, we had the entire world against us. It was like absolutely no allies. Whatsoever, you know what I mean, it was like the world was against us, the pressure of that was like crazy, was like a Super Bowl. I remembered sitting there with my fashion publicist Debra and we're supposed to do the resee, these is the thing with the editors after the show so they come back to see it and see if they like the collection, and we had like two or three people that came to see it and take picture with Kanye and bla bla etc. I say "Do we have more editors coming", and Debra just look and says "No, no one else is coming", and I looked at her and said "This is great. Remember this moment cause it won't always be like this, embrace this moment when no one came to see the collection". I take things that people look as a negative as an inspiration to do something better

I think there are school teachers that are at the exact same mission as as me. I think there's police officers with the exact same mission as me. It's just help, it's just do everything you got, give everything you got, and, you know, our focus needs to be less about what our legacy is gonna be or how we're gonna control each other but more how can we can give to each otherKanye West on Being The Robin Hood of Fashion*Somebody please transcribe these*Kanye West on Why He's Not in a Competition With AnyoneI'm not in competition with anyone. None of us will be remembered. You know, our existence as a race, humanity in period is a blip, another second of our life in the entire scope of the universe. All these walls to keep us from loving each other as like one family, as one race, you know, racism, religion, you know, where we grew up, whatever it is, class, social network, economics, you know, all this. What makes it be so selfish, prideful, all mixes now want to help the next man, what makes us, you know, be so focus on a personal legacy as opposed to an entire legacy of a race, you know like, the dinosaurs are remembered from much more than their bones, you know. So for humanity's gone what do we give to even this little planet, you know, now wrong, and what can we do collectively, like removing the pride

*Somebody please transcribe the rest*
About a million stars in that desert sky
So high and lonesome it can make you want to cry
Or drive your young blood wild

And a burning glow above that northern ridge
Three day ride will get you straight down to old Juarez
A fool's El Dorado

He got a taste for Mescal and sweet perfume
Didn't take long to get him in the back room

All of sixteen and first taste of the border

There's a pile of bones out on the desert floor
All that's left of el Conquistador.. the conqueror

Well I rode that beast down into the ground
Through every draw and every border town
That devil carried me

You watch a few go down to the fire or the rope
You leave little to chance and nothing to hope
An old 24 and nothing could hold me down

(Ain't gonna ride no more)

Ain't gonna ride no more

Well you cross it once you're gonna cross it again
Something keeps you coming back to that shadowland

And so I did for the mysteries

To hear that old soul stirrer slamming through the night
Tombstone train cuts its own daylight

Ain't gonna ride no more

Though my leathers worn and my cuffs in tatters
My hearts on straight and that's all that matters
If I lose a few moves it ain't no loss
Cause there's only one border left for me to cross

(Ain't gonna ride no more)

I'll take my sweet time on that one

Ain't gonna ride no more
(Ain't gonna ride no more)

Oh I ain't gonna ride no more

They call me King Of El Paso and my advice
Learn that road between here and paradise

(Ain't gonna ride no more)

Ain't gonna ride no more

(Ain't gonna ride no more)
If you've never fed the hungry, or given clothes to the poor
If you've never helped the stranger who came knocking on your door
If you forgot to send some flowers to sick and shut-in friend
Well if you ain't helping none of these, then you ain't helping Him
If you've ever seen some children, playing ball behind a school
If you've ever watched an old man, plowing ground behind mule
If you've ever stopped and listened, when you could not hear a sound
Then brother you have met Him, because Jesus gets around
Would you recognise Jesus if you met Him face to face?
Or would you wonder if He's just another one you could not place?
You may not find Him coming in a chariot of the Lord, Jesus could be riding in a "49 Ford
You can find Him in your Momma's eyes, or in your Daddy's face
You can find He's always there to help you win the human race
You can find Him in the mountains, downtown, or by the sea
And brother, here's hoping someone can find him, and you and me
Would you recognise Jesus if you met Him face to face?
Or would you wonder if He's just another one you could not place?
You may not find Him coming in a chariot of the Lord, Jesus could be riding in a "49 Ford
Would you recognise Jesus if you met Him face to face?
Or would you wonder if He's just another one you could not place?
You may not find Him coming in a chariot of the Lord, Jesus could be riding in a "49 Ford
Wasn't really thinking, wasn't looking, wasn't searching for an answer
In the moonlight
When I saw your face
Saw you looking at me, saw you peaking out from under moon beams
Through the palm trees
Swaying in the breeze
I know I'm feeling so much more than ever before
And so I'm giving more to you than I though I could do
Don't know how it happened, don't know why, but you don't really need a reason
When the stars shine
Just to fall in love

Made to love each other, made to be together for a life time
In the sunshine
Flying in the sky
I know I'm feeling so much more than ever before
And so I'm giving more to you than I though I could do
Now I know love is real
So when sky high, as the angels dry
Letting you and I, fly love
Whilst flying through an azure cloud
A crystal girl i'd spy
She kissed the blue bird's honey tongue
And stuttered as she sighed
I wish to sing the chicken song
Ching-a-ling song is fine
I'd give my jewels and caviar
To make this daydream mine

Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling
Doo dah doo doo dah dah, doo dah dah dah dah dah dah dah

While stepping through a heaven's eye
Two lover souls we spied
They wished the cloud boys sang to me
A cheerful happy cry
We love to play our love-strong hearts
No better do we know
No gifts of money do we give
For love is all we own
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling
This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby

Yeah, it really sucks, but ever since I've been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way we fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life was good, but me and you, we a catastrophe

If I was a success, oh, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic, girl, I'm feelin' paralyzed
If I could choose, you would always be a friend of me
The more money I made, you actin' like my enemy
It's crazy, I can't help it if you feelin' change
Thought the pressure would turn you to my diamond babe
How could somethin' so familiar be so strange?
Closest friends gettin' strange when your status change

Why is it my mistake that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that have my back?
We were the perfect pair, and now it seem that we don't match
Is it the money? Want me to give it back?

This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby

Uh, I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I moved out my momma's basement
To a condo downtown cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley

How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit

Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
Cause what's a star when its most important fan is missing?

This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
(Lover, lover)

Hey! jealous lover
You're acting so strange
Hey! jealous lover
What is making you change?

Hey! jealous lover
How wrong can you be?
I'm yours ever faithful
Just be faithful to me

I am just as steady as that clock on the shelf
Maybe you're accusing me of what you're doing yourself

Hey! jealous lover
I'm telling you true
I know that you're jealous
But there's no one but you

Could have cheated lots of times but just couldn't do
I was much too busy, baby, being faithful to you
Hey! jealous lover
I'm telling you true
I know that you're jealous
But there's no one but you

There's no one for me
Jealous lover, but you
World firstly subjected, phenomenal
Retrieve the road that leads to these far-away goals
Facing the disturbing riches of life, forges an obstruction
Magic value of protection, echoes, chaotic change leading experience

Gets lost (gets lost) in it (in it)
Gets lost in it, becomes itself an obstruction
Posing (posing) itself (itself) to become an object

World firstly subjected, phenomenal
Retrieve the road that leads to these far-away goals
Facing the disturbing riches of life, forges an obstruction
Magic value of protection, echoes, chaotic change leading experience

To become an object the world has daytime coming from the soul
We can be makers of such information
She belongs there, left with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She laughs and stays in the
Won- won- wonderful

She knew how to gather the forest when
God reached softly and moved her body
One golden locket quite young
And loving her mother and father

Farther down the path was a mystery
Through the recess the chalk and numbers
A boy bumped into her
Won- won- won- wonderful

She'll return in love with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She'll smile and thank God
For one won- won- wonderful

Who you been lovin' since I've been gone?
A long, tall man with a red coat on
Good for nothin', baby, you doin' me wrong
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?

Who's been playin' around with you?
A real cool cat with eyes of blue
Triflin', baby, are you bein' true?
Who's been foolin' around with you?
Who's been foolin' around with you?

Somebody saw you at the break of day
Dinin' and dancin' on the cabaret
He was long and tall, he had plenty of cash
He had a red Cadillac and a black mustache

He held your hand and he sang you a song
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?
Who's been playin' around with you?
A real cool cat with eyes of blue
Triflin', baby, are you bein' true?
Who's been foolin' around with you?
Who's been foolin' around with you?

Ah, somebody saw you at the break of day
Dinin' and dancin' on the cabaret
He was long and tall, he had plenty of cash
He had a red Cadillac and a black mustache

He held your hand and he sang you a song
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?
What's wrong with you? I wish I knew
You say time will tell, I hope that's true
There's more to life than blues and reds
I say, I know how you feel, now your friends are dead
Dead on your feet, you won't get far
If you keep on sticking your hand in the medicine jar
Now don't give up whatever you do
You say time will tell, I hope that's true
If you go down and lose your head
I say, I know how you feel, now your friends are dead
What can I do? I can't let go
You say time will heal but very slow
So don't forget the things you said
I say I know how you feel now your friends are dead
Written by Danny Kirwan

You're gonna change your mind
You're not the loving kind
Cause everywhere I go
Seems that you never show
All you do is keep on
To talk and try to all night

I'm gonna change my mind
I'm just the loving kind
Cause everywhere I go
Feels that you never show
All you do is keep on
To talk and try to all night

Gonna change your mind
You're not the loving kind
Cause everywhere I go
Feels that you never show
Only to keep on
To talk and try to all night
All you do is keep on
To talk and try to all night

[Verse 1: Yolanda Adams]
I know it's been a while now
Since you last heard from me
Or talked with me
It's been kind of hard lately
I've had a lot on my mind
It's been so long
I'm afraid that the words may not come out right
But, tonight I'll try
Tonight, mmm
Tonight I'll try
Tonight

[Verse 2: Yolanda Adams]
I know that prayin' ain't always easy
It's hard sometimes to express what you feel inside
Especially when you don't think God is listening
It's been raining now for some time
But instead of what I see
You want me to trust You working it out for me
So, tonight I will try
Tonight
Oh, oh, oh
Tonight I'll try
Tonight, yeah

[Bridge: Yolanda Adams, Choir]
Whoever told you living in this world would be easy
Baby, they lied
And, whoever said lovin' folk
That don't love you back ain't really hard
Then they ain't really tried it
Telling you what I'm going through
Sometimes it's harder than I realize
(Harder than I realize)
But tonight I'll try
Tonight
(Try tonight, I'll try)
Tonight I'll try
(Tonight) Tonight

[Verse 3: Yolanda Adams]
So, tonight when you get home
You oughta unplug the phone
And get alone
Tell your Father how you truly feel
Even if your words don't come out right
For no matter how far you've gone
God's love can find you and bring you back home
So tonight you oughta try
Tonight, oh, oh, oh
So tonight you oughta try
Tonight, oh, oh, oh, whoever

[Bridge: Yolanda Adams, Choir]
Whoever told you living in this world would be easy
Baby, they lied
(Baby, baby, baby, they lied)
And, whoever said lovin' folk
That don't love you back ain't really hard
Then they ain't really tried it
(They ain't even tried)
Telling you what I'm going through (Oh, oh)
Sometimes it's harder than I realize
(Harder than I realize)
But tonight I'll try
Tonight
(I'll try tonight, oh, oh)
Tonight I'll try
Tonight
(Say it, Kirk)

[Interlude: Kirk Franklin, Yolanda Adams]
Check this out, y'all
This song is dedicated to everybody that feel like they've gone too far
(You haven't gone too far)
To where God can't hear your prayer
There's no mistake you can ever make my brother and sister, that God won't be able to hear you when you call
The Son has opened up the door so that you can talk to the Father
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
So wherever you are, whatever you're doing
Tonight, when you get home, I want you to do this right here

[Outro: Yolanda Adams, Choir]
(Tonight) Take away my pain
(Tonight) Take away my strains
(Tonight) And let me live
(Tonight) All over again
(Tonight) Tonight I'm gonna throw my hands up
(Tonight) Tonight I'm gonna give it all up
(Tonight) Tonight I wanna turn it all around
(Tonight) Put my feet on solid ground
(Tonight) Won't you take me where you need to take me
(Tonight) Won't you do with me what you wanna do with me
(Tonight) Tonight
(Tonight) This night
(Tonight) I'm yours, I'm yours
(Tonight) I'm yours, I'm yours
(Tonight) I'm yours, I'm yours
(Tonight) Tonight
(Tonight) Won't You take them tonight
(Tonight) Won't You take them tonight
(Tonight) Won't You take them all tonight
(Tonight)

Yesterday we were gay
I was high on a rainbow, but now there's no rainbow
You've gone, and so a lover is blue
Life was sweet, so complete
Now I've suddenly waken to find I'm forsaken
Alone, and so a lover is blue
Do you still remember our love affair
Does it matter to you
But I'll have to go through our door to care
Here and there everywhere
Every scene just reminds me
Of something that binds me
To you, and so a lover is blue

A little dream castle
With every dream gone
Is lonely and silent
The shades are all drawn
And my heart is heavy
As I gaze upon
A cottage for sale
The lawn we were proud of
Is waving in hay
A beautiful garden
Has withered away
Where you planted roses
The weeds seem to say

A cottage for sale
From every single window
I see your face
But when I reach the window
There's empty space
The key's in the mailbox
The same as before
But no one is waiting
For me anymore
The end of our story
Is there on the door
A cottage for sale
There's a garden, what a garden
Only happy faces bloom there
And there's never any room there
For a worry or a gloom there

Oh there's music and there's dancing
And a lot of sweet romancing
When they play the polka
They all get in the swing

Every time they hear that oom-pa-pa
Everybody feels so tra-la-la
They want to throw their cares away
They all go lah-de-ah-de-ay

Then they hear a rumble on the floor, the floor
It's the big surprise they're waiting for
And all the couples form a ring
For miles around you'll hear them sing

Roll out the barrel, we'll have a barrel of fun
Roll out the barrel, we've got the blues on the run
Zing boom tararrel, ring out a song of good cheer
Now's the time to roll the barrel, for the gang's all here
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Then they hear a rumble on the floor-or-or-or
It's the big surprise they're waiting for
And all the couples they form a ring
For miles around you'll hear them sing

Drree mopado theedo da-da-da-da

Roll it out, roll it out, roll out the barrel
Da-da-da da-da da-da da-da-da-da-da
Sing a song of good cheer
Cause the whole gang is here
Roll it out, roll it out
Let's do the beer barrel polka

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh yeah, alright
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

The rebirth of the flesh is at your door (Let it in, y'all)

But all you do is steal, motherfucker (Motherfucker)

Jingle jangle, my love wears silvery bangles
She likes to wander and that's why I'm under
The spell of her jingle jangle

We used to cry on each others shoulder
Now that I'm older, she wanders ahead
Now that she's found love, I still hear the sound of
Silvery bangles, remain in my head

Jingle jangle, my love wears silvery bangles
She used to wander and that's why I'm under
The spell of her jingle jangle

Mmm...
Hey, hey
This ones for the mothers whove lost a child
This ones for the gypsies who left their hearts behind
This is for the strangers sleeping in my heart
Take what they want and leave while its still dark
No one is glamorously lonely
All by themselves, all by themselves
This is a song for the unloved
This is the music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will
Help me leave the past behind
Its a song for the unloved, the unloved
This ones for the bridesmaid, never the bride
And this ones for the dreamers who locked their faith inside
And this is for the widows who think theres only one
Of the dying fathers who never told their sons
No one is glamorously lonely
Follow your heart
Follow your heart
This is a song for the unloved
This is the music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will
Help me leave the past behind
Its a song for the unloved, the unloved
Oh, tomorrow the sun will shine
And dry the tears in your eyes
Suddenly love comes alive
Suddenly love comes alive
For one last cry
Just one last cry
Oh, yeah
This is a song for the unloved
This is the music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will
Help me leave the past behind
This is a song for the unloved
This is the music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will
Help me leave the past behind
This is, this is a song for the unloved
This is the music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will
Help me leave the past behind
Its a song for the unloved
Song for the unloved
In this world of ordinary people
Extraordinary people
I'm glad there is you
In this world of over-rated pleasures
Of under-rated treasures
I'm so glad there is you
I live to love, I love to live with you beside me
This role so new, I'll muddle through with you to guide me
In this world where many, many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you

In this world where many, many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you
More than ever, I'm glad there is you

There are stars
In the Southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight
And moss in the trees
Down the Seven Bridges Road

Now I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild

Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars
Down the Seven Bridges Road

There are stars in the Southern sky
And if ever you decide
You should go
There is a taste of time sweetened honey
Down the Seven Bridges Road
Gone with the wind
Just like a leaf that has blown away
Gone with the wind
My romance has flown away

Yesterday's kisses are still on my lips
I had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips

But now all is gone
Gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart
Gone with the wind
The gladness that filled my heart

Just like a flame
Love burned brightly, then became
An empty smoke dream that has gone
Gone with the wind

But now all is gone
Gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart
Gone with the wind
The gladness that filled my heart
Just like a flame
Love burned brightly, then became
An empty smoke dream that has gone
Gone with the wind
Gone with the wind
Gone with the wind

[Verse 1]
All my life I've kept my feelings deep inside
Never was a reason to let somebody know
"Lover here, lover there" - Who cried? Who cared? Foolish pride
"Never was a good seat at any of this man's shows"

[Chorus 1]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus 2]
But now I've got to let it go
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go
Lay back and let my feelings show
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel

[Verse 2]
All my life this heart's been under lock and key
My curtains were drawn, there wasn't nobody home
Trigger here, Trigger there - everybody's high except for me
Better off dead if I couldn't be alone

[Chorus 1]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus 2]
But now I've got to let it go
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go
Lay back and let my feelings show
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel

[Verse 3]
Fourteen years and tears I've longed to sing my song
But a horse couldn't drag your ass to put me on
But now I've got an army and we're three million strong
This song will ring in your ears when we are gone

[Chorus 1]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus 2]
But now I've got to let it go
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go
Lay back and let my feelings show
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel

[Outro]
I am ready for the real (Come a little closer)

(let it go)
(Lay back an' let the vibe just flow)
As we stroll along together
Holding hands, walking all alone
So in love are we two
That we don't know what to do
So in love
In a world of our own

As we stroll by the sea together
Under stars twinkling high above
So in love are we two
No one else but me and you
So in love
So much in love
So in love
So much in love

We stroll along together
I tell you I need you oh so much
I love, love you my darling
Can you tell it in my touch
When we walk down the aisle together
We will vow to be together 'til we die
So much love have we two
Just can't wait to say "I do"
So in love
Are you and I
So in love
Are you and I
Bluebirds, flowers
Sunshine and showers
Sunsets and rainbows
On skies of red and blue
Badges, whistles
Rockets and missiles
Puppies, kittens
And penny candy too
You make me feel so new
Like carnivals and carousels
Popsicles and wishing wells
And I am so in love with you
I can't believe it's true
We're gonna make it all the way home

Magic potions
Incense and lotions
Bells, books and candles
Can make a witches' brew
But I don't need witches
Love spells or riches
You are my treasure
My fairy tale come true
With you is where I'll stay
All the time, anywhere
Turn around, and I'll be there
It was I, now it's we
And I know it will be
You and me, all the way home
Me and you, all the way home
Oh sinning is a gentilized journey, take Jesus as your daily guide
Though you may feel pure and saintly without Him walking by your side
And when you come to make your crossing at the end of the pilgrim's way
If you ever will meet your savior, you will surely meet him on that day

Now look at that cold Jordan, look at its deep water
Look at that wide river Oh heavy mighty billows roll
You better take Jesus with you, he's a true companion
Oh I'm sure without him that you never will make it home

That awful day of judgment is coming in the by and by
We'll see our Lord descending in the glory from on high
Oh, let us get in touch with Jesus and in the special love of God
And maybe ever get ready when he comes on Jordan's tide
Now look at that cold Jordan, look at its deep water
Look at that wide river Oh heavy mighty billows roll
You better take Jesus with you, he's a true companion
Oh I'm sure without him that you never will make it home

Now what you gonna do, Oh what you gonna say
Oh how you gonna feel when you come to the end of the way?
Old pirates, yes, they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ship
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit

But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
Cause all I ever had
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fullfil the book

So won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
Cause all I ever had
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

Old pirates, yes, they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit

How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Yes, some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book

So won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
Cause all I ever had
Redemption songs
All I ever had
Redemption songs
These songs of freedom
Songs of freedom
Ow ow ow ow ow

He had a problem with gambling
He liked AA, he was a real big fan
But that didn't help and he just kept rambling

He has the black jack blues
He's the number one fan
Ow ow ow whoo hoo

Those black jack blues were killing him more and more

And Hot Atlanta y'all is one of the best

And it sucks that we didn't keep in touch I'm sorry

Y'all my, ladies and I can't (I can't) let you (let you)
Be with, no one, but me, baby
Only one to a customer, only one
One crack at paradise, next to none
Here am I riding high on a miracle come full blown
Hold him tight through a night like I've never known
Because there's only one kind of wonderful
I still try it, you and that smile I see in your eyes
You'll never know the feeling until you spent your life in line
Only one to your customer, and this time, I got mine

Only one to a customer, rarely two
But when you got that dream, one will do
Why despair at the fair possibility luck has flown
Stick around, fend your ground, till the cards are shown
Because there's only one way they won't come up all aces high
That's it, you've let the deal pass you by
Somebody up there bottle the thrill, and like the rarest wine
If it's one to a customer, I say, just fine
Only one to a customer, and this one, this little bird is mine

It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill
It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill

When you got your baby and a whole lotta time to kill
Did you ever get a feelin' that your feet had turned to stones
Do you ever get a feelin' that your feet had turned to stones
Do you get a funny feelin' running up and down your bones
That's arthritis

It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill
It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill

When you got your baby and a whole lotta time to kill
Did you ever feel lucky and wake up cold in hand
Did you ever feel lucky and wake up cold in hand
Find you ain't got a nickel and your woman got another man
Bad deal
Light a candle in the chapel
At the closing of each day
Keep it burning while you're yearning
For the one who went away

Say a pray'r and ask the angel
To guide and to watch from above
Light a candle in the chapel
For the one you love

Say a pray'r and ask the angel
To guide and to watch from above
Light a candle in the chapel
For the one you love

[Verse 1]
Venus, stop the train
For the brakeman lost his place
Satellites were spinning in outer space
They televised her feelings, while the light
The light struck terror

[Chorus]
I kept my distance because she fell in love with everyone
Smoking grass and taking Christmas trees
She fell in love with me
I was polite to her
A soft sadness had her much more than her loneliness

[Verse 2]
Her father warmed the benches
Vice president of southern branches
He reached out to her when her mother slept
He would never forget the light
The light, the light striking terror

[Chorus]
I kept my distance because she fell in love with everyone
Smoking grass and taking Christmas trees
She fell in love with me
I was polite to her
A soft sadness had her much more than her loneliness

[Bridge]
Satellites spinning
Satellites spin
Well, the light
The light, the light
The light, the light
The light strikes terror
The light strikes terror

[Chorus]
I keep my distance because she falls in love with everyone
Smoking grass and taking Christmas trees
She falls in love with me
I'm polite to her
A soft sadness had her much more than her ugliness

[Chorus]
I keep my distance because she falls in love with everyone
Smoking grass and taking Christmas trees
She falls in love with me
I'm polite to her
I reach my soft hand out to her
I've known her for a very, very long time

And your sexy man bits too
Even you must be in to you ooo ooo
B+J: All the ladies in the world
I wanna get next to you

In a world of peace and harmony
Where every lady gets a little piece of Bret-y

Time, there was a time
You could talk to me without speaking
You would look at me and I'd know
All there was to know

Days, I think of you
And remember the lies we told
In the night, the love we knew
The things we shared when our hearts were beating together

Days, that were so few
Full of love and you
Gone, the days are gone now
Days, that seem so wrong now

Life, won't be the same
Without you to hold again in my arms
To ease the pain and remember
When our love was a reason for living

Days, that were so few
Full of love and you
The game is over
Backstreet Boys
Never Gone
Incomplete (Album Version)
Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you, within me I can't find no rest
Where I’m going is anybody's guess

Chorus:
I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I’m going to be is... Incomplete
Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby, it’s written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

Chorus:
I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I’m going to be is... Incomplete
I don't mean to drag it on
But I can't seem to let you go
I don't wanna make you face this world alone
I wanna let you go
Chorus:
I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I’m going to be is... Incomplete
.......... Incomplete
Well, at birth mom and papa called their little boy Ned
Raised him on the banks of a river bed
On a houseboat tied to a big tall tree
A home for my papa and my mama and me

The clock strikes three and papa jumps to his feet
Already mama's cooking papa something to eat
At half past, papa he's ready to go
He jumps in his pirogue headed down the bayou

He's got fishing lines strung across the Louisiana Rivers
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
He's setting traps in the swamp catching anything he can
He's gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man

My Muskrat hides hanging by the dozens
Even got a lady mink, a muskrat's cousin

Got 'em out drying in the hot, hot sun
Tomorrow papa's gonna turn 'em into money
Well, they call mama Rita and my daddy Jack
Little baby brother on the floor that's Mack
Bren and Lin are the family twins
And big brother Ed's on the bayou fishing
On the river floats papa's great big boat
And that's how my papa goes into town
Takes him every bit of a night and a day
To even reach a place where the people stay

And I can hardly wait until tomorrow comes around
That's the day my papa takes his furs to town
Papa promised me that I could go
He'd even let me see a cowboy show

I saw the cowboys and Indians for the first time then
Itold my pop I've gotta go again
Well, Papa said, "Son we've got lines to run
We'll come back again but first there's work to be done"

He's got fishing lines strung across the Louisiana Rivers
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat

He's setting traps in the swamp catching anything he can
Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man

Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
...
Hoo...yeah...

[Chorus]
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing (no no)
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

Oh honey...

[Verse 1: Patti Labelle + Wanya Morris]
I got your picture hangin' on the wall
It can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame

I read your letters when you're not near
But they don't move me
And they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear
Don't you know...

[Chorus]
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

[Verse 2: Patti Labelle + Wanya Morris]
I play the game, a fantasy
I pretend but I'm not in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do me as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you phone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of your being there

[Chorus]
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing (Talk to me)
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
(Nothing like the real thing, darling)
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
(I've been searching, but I never found)
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
(Sing, Boyz II Men)
Ain't nothing like the real thing
To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere
Written by Peter Green

Well, I feel so bad - I wonder what's wrong with me
Well, I feel so bad - I wonder what's wrong with me
I think I'll call my baby, find out just what the matter can be

Last night I dreamed about my baby
I woke up and the tears were runnin' all down my face
Now, when I woke up - early this morning
The tears were runnin' all down my face
You know I was dreamin', that some other man was takin' my place

I said, I dreamed about you baby
I dreamed you didn't want me 'round no more
I said, I dreamed about you baby
You know I dreamed you didn't want me round no more
Now, That's the reason I'm callin' you this evening
Baby, tell me, 'cause I've just got to know

Break:
I've been worried all day long
I just don't know what to do
I've been worried all day long
You know, I just don't know what to do
You know it may sound silly to you woman
But tell me that dream was not true
Jacob Green got busted for possession
Next morning early he appeared in court
But he was sent to jail to wait to be trialed at some later date
Next morning early, there came a sad report

At the jail they took away his clothes to shame him
And to make sure Jacob Green had no pride left
They cut of all his hair today they found him hanging there
Afraid to face the day he killed himself

It happened yesterday and if you turn your head away
Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun
Not only Jacob Green, but many more you've never seen

It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done

Jacob's father hired a team of lawyers
Inspections and long inquiries were held
The sheriff then retired and the papers said two guards were fired
They put a brand new coat of paint on Jacob's cell
But like a tomb that looks so white and shiny
Inside you'll find corruption never seen
And somewhere out there tonight in a dirty cell without a light
There will be locked up another Jacob Green

It happened yesterday and if you turn your head away
Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun
Not only Jacob Green, but many more you've never seen

It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done

[Verse 1]
Lying in my room quite late one night
Something I could see made me check my sight
Something very strange made me walk outside
So I walked outside like this real fool
Nothing to lose and I knew I should
Ever since she told me that I was no good
It was no good, I knew it would be...

[Chorus]
Only a shadow, only a shadow
Only a shadow but she looks like you
Only a shadow, only a shadow
Only a shadow but she looks like you
She looks like you

[Verse 2]
It's the time of year when the flower dies
It's the kind of night when the ghost will rise
Searching for a girl with the dancing eyes
Who could stay all day but leave next night
Instinct should have told me it'll work out right
Now I'm very nervous, I leave on my light
But I walk outside, I walk outside, but it's...

[Chorus]
Only a shadow, only a shadow
Only a shadow but she looks like you
Only a shadow, only a shadow
Only a shadow but she looks like you
Only a shadow, only a shadow
Only a shadow but she looks like you
Only a shadow, only a shadow
Only a shadow but she looks like you
She looks like you

[Verse 3]
Listen to her voice going 'round my head
Comes to me at night when I'm in my bed
Could be going crazy, it's what they said
And what they said is I'm no good
Told me to leave, you really think I should
Haunted by your face everywhere I look
But I walk outside and I walk to find it's...

[Chorus]
Only a shadow, only a shadow
Only a shadow but she looks like you
Only a shadow, only a shadow
Only a shadow but she looks like you
Only a shadow, only a shadow
Only a shadow but she looks like you

[Outro]
Shadow
Only a shadow
Only a shadow
Only a shadow
Watch out for me, woman
And don't mind nobody else
Watch out for me, woman
And don't mind nobody else
Ain't got no crystal ball
But the future ain't hard to tell

I love the woman
I just can't stand to leave her be
I love the woman
I just can't stand to leave her be
Now we got to get married
An' might even raise a whole family

Watch out for me, woman, an'
And don't mind nobody else
Watch out for me, woman
And don't mind nobody else
Ain't got no crystal ball
But the future - ain't hard to tell
Way down among Brazilians
Coffee beans grow by the billions
So they've got to find those extra cups to fill
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil

You can't get cherry soda
Cause they've got to fill that quota
And the way things are I'll bet they never will
They've got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil

No tea or tomato juice
You'll see no potato juice
The planters down in Santos all say no no no

The politician's daughter
Was accused of drinking water
And was fined a great big fifty dollar bill
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil

You date a girl and find out later
She smells just like a percolator
Her perfume was made right on the grill
Why they could percolate the ocean in Brazil
And when their ham and eggs need savor
Coffee ketchup gives 'em flavor
Coffee pickles way outsell the dill
Why they put coffee in the coffee in Brazil

No tea or tomato juice
You'll see no potato juice
The planters down in Santos all say no no no

So your lead to the local color
Serving coffee with a cruller
Dunking doesn't take a lot of skill
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil
It's dark and hell is hot
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play
"Who turned out the lights?"
Is what niggas be sayin'
Now you don't wanna fight
But ya niggas be playin'
Thinkin' it's alright keep playin' with that road
And you gonna know the night
When you layin' in that cold
Dirt gettin' tossed in your grave
Now it's all over
Preacher said you was brave
But now it's all over
You just one of the many, plenty I done gave it to
Ain't no savin' you
No matter how many tears your mom's cried
Ain't gon bring your ass back, plus in hell, you gon fry
Why? But now the only 2 relative questions is
Do we bury him or burn? Any suggestions?
Either way, you up out of here for good
Now when niggas mention you name
They knockin' on wood, did I get my point across?
Another body on the shotte, another joint I toss
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play
There ain't no sunshine
When the Dark Man comes out
And I want mine so I plan to keep my gun out
We got four 9's so niggas run in and run out
But I bust mine 'cause I'd like to hear some shots
Get at me dog, niggas know how it's goin' dizzy
When it comes to that flow, I gets busy
Who is he? Dark Man of the unknown
One dog, one bone
Now who ain't goin' home? Looks like you
You hear strike 1, talkin' shit, strike 2
Won't be a strike 3 'cause I don't play fair
I'ma look you in your eye while he hit you from the rear
Be like, yeah, holdin' you up 'cause you fallin'
The Lord ain't comin' till niggas stop callin'
You was ballin' a minute ago in it for dough
Till it was, â€½Yo, I swear to God, I didn't knowâ€
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Whatchu think you gon get?
Fuck around with my dough
Just so it ain't no mistakes, this is my show
One
(One)
Two
(Two)
Three
(Three)
Here I go
Your shit is quick and your shit is sleek
But this shit is thick and when you hear this shit
Damn right I can finish shit
If you caught that verse without a rewind you can see mine
But you be blind, I'll do it 360, come up from behind
Tap you on the shoulder, have you turnin' around
Hit you with somethin' that I'll have you burin' the ground
Be like, "Damn, ain't nothin' left of money but a pile of ash"
Life is good so please enjoy it while it lasts
'Cause you know ain't got much longer to go
The quicker you go depends the stronger the flow
When niggas know I don't give a fuck, right or wrong
There ain't no sunshine when it's on

[Verse 1: Both, Marvin Gaye, & Tammi Terrell]
Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
Oh, darlin', that's the kind you offer me
It's just the love to be found
'Cause we're workin' on a buildin' nobody can tear down
Look what we've got, ho-ho-ho-honey

[Verse 2: Both, Marvin Gaye, & Tammi Terrell]
Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy, darlin'
Good lovin' ain't easy to come by, oh no no
I've tried the good life and I know
It's a playground where no one cares
But at last you'll find out that don't compare
To what we've got, ho-ho-ho-honey

[Verse 3: Both, Marvin Gaye, & Tammi Terrell]
It takes more than just a song and dance
You've got to work and fight to give it a chance
If the rain comes down on us
And there ain't no place to run
We'll just cover ourselves with a blanket of love
And wait till the mornin' comes
Oh baby, let's do it today
Inflection
Give us protection

[Verse 4: Both, Marvin Gaye, & Tammi Terrell]
Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
Some think it's a plaything
You can toss away when it's old
But when love's valued in pieces
It's worth more than gold
That's what we've got
Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
Oh, oh, it ain't easy
I tried
Tried to impress you
My love
I gave it all
Each hour ever at your beck and call
I tried
Tried to caress you
My soul
Filled with desire
Two arms craving the one I admire
Your charm was so appealing
I loved you from the start
There's still that same old feeling
Concealed here in my heart
I tried making you love me
And you couldn't decide
But I'll never regret that I tried
And tried and tried
I know how it feels to be head over heels
To be lost in true love and the light of the moon
When everything seems to be coming up roses
And every word seems to be rhyming with June
Suddenly, all of your dreams have come true
Happiness lives in your heart
Then out of nowhere, one becomes two
And everything seems to be falling apart

Is it love? When your heart, feels like it's broken
Is it love? And you just can't take anymore
Is it love? When there's nothing left to be spoken
Is it love? And there's nothing worth listening for
Is it love? ooh ooh

I know what it means to get caught up in dreams
And in prayers that are answered with each passing day
When loving and laughter are birds of a feather
And sharing and caring is one simple way
You know you'll never be alone
That someone will always be near
Then you turn around when your best friend is gone
Oh, where do they go? When they just disappear?
Is it love? When your heart, feels like it's broken
Is it love? And you just can't take anymore
Is it love? When the good times have all been forgotten
Is it love? And you fear there won't be anymore
Is it love? ooh ooh

There's no answer, there seems to be nothing to say
In your anger would you even hear anyway
It was magic but somehow you've broken the spell
It was heaven and somehow it's turned into hell

Is it love? When you know that your heart has been broken
Is it love? And you just can't take it anymore
Is it love? When you feel more than you could imagine
Is it love? Now there's nothing that's worth living for
Is it love? ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
Falling in love again, for the love we share
As you hear me say, "I adore you"
I'm falling in love again, oh, my darling, it seems
Oh, my darling, it seems I love you

[Refrain]
All our romances would never go astray
My love is your love, forever and a day

[Verse 2]
Falling in love again, paradise, right here
I love that you're my dear, I love you

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Falling in love again, for the love we share
As you hear me say, "I adore you"
I'm falling in love again, paradise, right here
I love that you're my dear, I love you
First the tide rushes in
Plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea
And the sea is very still once more

So I rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide
With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide

At last, we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell, I can feel
You are love, you are real
Really mine

In the rain, in the dark, in the sun

Like the tide at its ebb
I'm at peace in the web
Of your arms

Slow and easy, babe, that's how I like my love
Nice and pleasin', oh, it's really wonderful
Movin' gently, hey, it's so good to me, yes, it is
Move in simply and then let it build up gradually, baby
Takin' time with love just makes it better
So let's relax and reach our ecstasy together
But let's do it slow and easy, baby
Keep it like that, baby, that's how I like my love

I like it slow and pleasin', oh, it's really, really, really good to me
Hurried love is like a good meal down the way
It's up and gone before you really get to taste
Let's do it slow and easy babe, that's how I like my love
Slow and easy, now

No need to rush our love 'coz it ain't goin' nowhere
So let's enjoy this time, the time we both have to share
We've got to take it slow and easy, baby, that's how I like my love
I like it when you're movin' simply, oh, that's how I like my love

I like it slow and easy, baby, take your time, baby
Slow and easy now, no need to rush, baby
I like it slow, slow and easy, I said I like it slow and easy, baby
Take your time, baby, there's no need to rush, baby
Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields where we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle, Jingle ...

[Chorus]
There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow

[Verse 1]
They say that anger is just love disappointed
They say that love is just a state of mind
But all this fighting over who is anointed
Oh how can people be so blind?

[Chorus]
There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Oh they tell me there's a place over yonder
Cool water running through the burning sand
Until we we learn to love one another
We will never reach the promised land

[Chorus]
There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
(They say that anger is just love disappointed)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
(They say that love is just a state of mind)
There's a hole in the world tonight
(But all this fighting over who will be anointed)
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow
(Oh how can people be so blind?)
There's a hole in the world tonight (Hole in the world)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow (Fear and sorrow)
There's a hole in the world tonight (Mmm)
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight (There's a hole in the world)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow (A cloud of fear and sorrow)
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow
(Don't let there be a hole in the world, mmm)
There's a hole in the world tonight (Mmm yeah)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
(Oh there's a cloud of fear and sorrow)
There's a hole in the world tonight
(There's a hole in the world tonight)
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow (Mmm)
There's a hole in the world tonight (Mmm)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow (A cloud of fear and sorrow)
There's a hole in the world tonight (Great big hole in the world)
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow
(Don't let there be a hole in the world)
There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow
The wheels go down
I'm back in town
Three months full of summer
And nothing to do
It's been a strain at the reins
But the picture remains
Southwind's blowin' my love to you
Southwind's blowin' my love

For sixty-one days
I got caught in the maze
Twenty thousand watching
The songs go by
The lights go down
In an east Texas town
Southwind's blowin' my love to you
Southwind's blowin' my love

I couldn't wait until
Till I got back home to you
Oh to get my fill
Of those California summer nights
It's good to be home
My how the children have grown
Screen door's barking out
That old familiar tune
Games at the park
But honey wait until dark
Southwind's blowin' my love to you
Southwind's blowin' my love

I couldn't wait until
Till I got back home to you
Oh to get my fill
Of those California summer nights

The wheels go down
I'm back in town
Three months full of summer
And nothing to do
It's been a strain at the reins
But the picture remains
Southwind's blowin' my love to you
Southwind's blowin' my love

[Verse 1]
Answer me, oh my love
Just what sin have I been guilty of?
Tell me how I came to lose your love
Please answer me, sweetheart

[Verse 2]
You were mine yesterday
I believed that love was here to stay
Won't you tell me how I've gone astray?
Please answer me, my love

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're happier without me
I'll try not to care
But if you still think about me
Please listen to my prayer

[Chorus]
You must know that I've been true
Won't you say that we can start anew?
In my sorrow, now I turn to you
Please answer me, my love

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're happier without me
I'll try not to care
But if you still think about me
Please listen to my prayer

[Chorus]
You must know that I've been true
Won't you say that we can start anew?
In my sorrow, now I turn to you
Please answer me, my love

[Outro]
Answer me my love
I find
If it's not the world, its the people
And if it's not the people, then maybe it's you
If it's not you, then maybe it's me
But if it's not me, then it's the music
Oh, when the saints, go marching in
Yes when the saints go marching in
Oh Lord I want to be in that ever lovin' number
When the saints go marching in

Oh, when the saints, go marching in
Yes when the saints go marching in
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

Oh yes, I had a dear old mother
And if you should see her before I do
Won't you tell her that you saw me coming
I was struttin' straight on through
Oh, when the saints, go marching in
Yes when the saints go marching in
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
One hand will take, one hand will give
That's all we know and that is how we live
One day hello, next day goodbye
And everyone just stay high
Same old story, same old song
Goes all right till it goes all wrong
Now you're going, then you're gone
Same old story, same old song
One builds you up, one tears you down
To some you're a saint, to others you're a clown
What can you do, just see it through
And hold on to what is left to you
Same old story, same old song
Goes all right till it goes all wrong
Now you're going, then you're gone
Same old story, same old song
Skeletal city highs
Crazies with dumb replies
Nobody's eyes anymore

Frown on your beggar's face
Walking this lunarscape
Nothing in my lackaday

We'll all be right
We'll all be right
We'll all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes

Somebody's space to rent
Somebody's soul to dent
Dog is in every word

Hiding the flames of power
Hiding us home by home
Nearly got out yesterday
We'll all be right
We'll all be right
We'll all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes

Trouble it travels on the wing
Doorway to door
Open your eyes
Nothing remains
A secret love between us

Nothing can hide for long
We are the morning song
Holding my breath anyway

We'll all be right
We'll all be right
We'll all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes

We'll all be right
We'll all be right
We'll all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes
Through it sometimes
(We all go through)
Through it sometime
(We all go through)
(We all go through)
(We all go through)

[Verse 1]
When that midnight hour went chiming
I was in my room alone
Yes, when that midnight hour went chiming
I was in my room alone
Yes, and when I came home this evening
I found my baby gone

[Verse 2]
Oh, I laid my head on my pillow
I gazed up at the stars up above
Yes, I laid my head on my pillow
Yes, lookin' up at the stars above

[Bridge]
I tell you it's a miserable feeling
Oh, when you lose the one you love

[Chorus]
Oh, I get the blues at midnight
Oh there's one thing I can't describe
Oh, I get the blues at midnight
Oh there's one thing I can't describe Yes
And when you look at your baby's picture
Oh, tears will come from your eyes
Oh lordie lord
Oh lordie lord
It hurts me so bad for us to part
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

So many nights since you've been gone
I've had to worry and grieve my life alone
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

So many days since you went away
I've had to worry night and day
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

Yoo're on my mind every place I go
How much I love you nobody knows
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
So that's my story
This is all I got to say to you
Goodbye baby I don't care what you do
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

Oh lordie lord
Oh lordie lord
It hurts me so bad for us to part
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
You got me looking at that heaven in your eyes
I was chasing your direction, I was telling you no lies
And I was loving you
When the words are said, baby, I lose my head

And in a world of people, there's only you and I
There ain't nothing come between us in the end
How can I hold you when you ain't even mine?
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you

Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right, uh-huh
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more

All that I need is just one moment in your arms
I was chasing your affection, I was doing you no harm
And I was loving you
Make it shine, make it rain, baby I know my way
I need that sweet sensation of living in your love
I can't breath when you're away, it pulls me down
You are the question and the answer am I
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you

Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more

And in this world of people, there's only you and I
There ain't nothing come between us in the end
How can I hold you when you ain't even mine?
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you, oh

Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more

Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more
Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more

Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Oh, honey though our friendship ceases, from now on;
And, listen, if you can't say anything real nice
It's better not to talk at all, is my advice

We're parting, you go your way I'll go mine
It's best that we do;
Here's a kiss! I hope that this brings lots of luck to you

Makes no difference how I carry on
Remember, please don't talk about me when I'm gone
There's a place I know where the train goes slow
Where the sinner can be washed in the blood of the lamb
There's a river by the trestle down by sinner's grove
Down where the willow and the dogwood grow

You can hear the whistle, you can hear the bell
From the halls of heaven to the gates of hell
And there's room for the forsaken if you're there on time
You'll be washed of all your sins and all of your crimes

If you're down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train goes slow

There's a golden moon that shines up through the mist
And I know that your name can be on that list
There's no eye for an eye, there's no tooth for a tooth
I saw Judas Iscariot carrying John Wilkes Booth
He was down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
He was down there where the train goes slow

If you've lost all your hope, if you've lost all your faith
I know you can be cared for and I know you can be safe
And all the shamefuls and all of the whores
And even the soldier who pierced the side of the Lord Is down there by the train

Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train goes slow

Well, I've never asked forgiveness and I've never said a prayer
Never given of myself, never truly cared
I've left the ones who loved me and I'm still raising
Cain I've taken the low road and if you've done the same
Meet me down there by the train

Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train goes slow
Meet me down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train goes slow

I really feel I'll always be your girl

[Chorus]
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)

The one who's true to you and down for ya
The one who makes you smile and laughs with ya (Your girl)
The one who holds you down, I'm there for ya
The one, the one, the one (I just wanna be)
The one who's true to you and down for ya
The one who makes you smile and laughs with ya (I just wanna be)
The one who holds you down, I'm there for you
The one, the one, the one (Your girl)

[Chorus]
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
Oh, you are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
Oh, you are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you
I'll always be your girl
You, you, you
Your girl

I can be anything you need
I can be anything you need
I can be anything you need
I can be anything you need
I can be anything you need
I can be anything you need
I can be anything you need
I can be anything you need

[Verse 1]
Every time I'm away from Liza
Water come to me eye
Every time I'm away from Liza
Water come to me eye

[Chorus]
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye

[Verse 2]
I remember when love was new
Water come to me eye
There was one, but now there's two
Water come to me eye

[Chorus]
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye

[Verse 3]
When the evening starts to fall
Water come to me eye
I need to hear my Liza's call
Water come to me eye

[Chorus]
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye

[Verse 4]
Standing there in the marketplace
Water come to me eye
Soon I'll feel her warm embrace
Water come to me eye

[Chorus]
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye

[Verse 5]
In the shadow I stand a while
Water come to me eye
Soon I'll see my Liza's smile
Water come to me eye

[Chorus]
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye

[Verse 6]
Every time I'm away from Liza
Water come to me eye
Every time I'm away from Liza
Water come to me eye

[Chorus]
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye
Come back Liza, come back, girl
Wipe the tear from me eye

[Intro]
What's up, baby
I know what you're thinking
What did I call you over here for
I wanna take you somewhere

[Chorus]
Tempo slow, lights down low
Let me take you to a place
Where only love grooves go

[Verse 1]
Step into my territory and let the vibes begin
Don't be afraid, just let this love groove in
Let the passion lead you to a place beyond
Exploring my bedroom, having freaky fun

[Chorus]
Tempo slow, lights down low
Let me take you to a place
Where only love grooves go
All the players go
All the gangstas go
Tempo slow, lights down low
Let me take you to a place
Where only love grooves go

[Verse 2]
Rules they are so simple, so very simple
As our bodies connect and those juices start to flow
Makin' sweet love 'til the morning light
And satisfying love's appetite

[Chorus]
Tempo slow, lights down low
Let me take you to a place
Where only love grooves go
Tempo slow, lights down low
Let me take you to a place
Where only love grooves go

[Bridge]
Baby tell Daddy what it is you want
Come on and unravel those little secrets unknown
Time to taste what love has in store for me
So let's take a sip of this love groove chemistry

[Chorus]
Tempo slow, lights down low
Let me take you to a place
Where only love grooves go
Tempo slow, lights down low
Let me take you to a place
Where only love grooves go
Tempo slow, lights down low
Let me take you to a place
Where only love grooves go
If I could live my life again
I'd never do you wrong
You better know, oh

If I just had a chance again
To spend my life with you
You know, it's in my soul, oh

I'd be standin' by your side
Not to ever let you go

If I only had a chance to live a life that we belong
Would I be strong?
If I didn't take the time and never try to understand
Ooh, my love, where it's gone

In the sadness that our love is left behind
I'm standing all alone

If I could stand to love again
Plant another seed
You know, would it grow, oh
If I could share my life again
With all the love I have for you, my love
Would it grow? Where would it go?

Ooh, my love
Now it's gone
In the sadness that I love is left behind
I'm standing all alone

All alone
It's looking better
More and more every day
Anything's better
Than the reason I've moved away

If those days can look brighter
Means everything is possible
For so long on my own
Had some time on my hands

The colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
Means I need you more and more

The colder are my nights
Means I can't do without you too long
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Uh, uh, uh
Uh
You made the difference
And what a difference it is
You made me realize
What is life without you

Since those days when nothing goes right
Things get almost but not quiet
They get so sore, they come close
They get so sore, uh, uh

Colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
Means I need you more and more

Colder are my nights
Means I can't do without you too long
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
Means I need you more and more

The colder are my nights
Means I can't do without you too long
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, ha
Well
Ooh
Mmm, mmm

The colder are my nights, ooh
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
Means I need you more and more

The colder are my nights
Means I can't do without you too long
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights
Means I need you more and more
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights
Means I can't do without you too long
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Hoo
Hoo
Yeah, yeah

It's so cold, yeah
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights, ooh

So cold

Colder are my nights

It's so cold, well

Colder are my nights, yeah

Really so cold
Well, well, well

Hurt me no more, no more
No more, yeah
Whoa, oh, yeah

Time is gettin' harder and harder
More and more each day, yeah
Still I am determined that I'm never gonna change my way
Thinking 'bout love the way it should be
You gotta open your eyes and you will see
About love the way it should be
You gotta make up your minds and you'll advance humanity
Humanity, humanity, humanity, whoa

What happened to the love
That they are all talking about?
It's nothing but useless words
Coming from out of their mouths
Talking 'bout love the way it should be
We gotta open our eyes and we will see
About love the way it should be
We gotta make up our minds and we'll advance humanity
Humanity, humanity, humanity, whoa
Whoa, yes, yeah!

What happened to the love
That they are all talking about?

We gotta make up our minds and we'll advance humanity
Humanity, humanity, humanity, whoa

Listen, people listen
You got the notion (I hope so)
Listen what I'm saying to you
You got the notion (I hope so)
A little bit of justice and peace
You got the notion (I hope so)
Bring a little love for everyone
You got the notion (our hope's on)
You got the notion
You got the notion

Now then tell me, sugar mama
Now, where in the world did you get your sugar from?
Was it back in Philadelphia, woman?
Back from the place where you come from

You know, they're braggin' about your sugar
Yes, I said they're braggin' about it all over town
Yes, I said they're braggin' about your sugar
Whoa, I said they're braggin' about it all over town
Every place I go
Sugar mama, sure can hear your name

[Verse 3]
I like my coffee sweet in the morning, baby
Yes, you know I'm crazy about my tea at night
Yes, I said I like my coffee sweet in the morning
Baby, you know I'm just crazy about my tea at night
Don't get my sugar three times a day
Baby, you know you and me just can't get along right
The sea will wash against the rock
The rock stands strong, the rock is strong
The sea will wash against the rock
But before too long the rock is gone

The wind will blow against the stone
The stone stands strong, the stone is strong
The wind will blow against the stone
But before too long the stone is gone

Patience gentlemen, we move closer every day
Patience gentlemen, the stone will soon give way

We are the wave
We are the flow
We are the wind
And soon the rock must go

We are the wave
We are the flow
We are the wind
And soon the rock must go
You cannot hold back the tide
The tide must rise the tide must rise
Its the law of earth and skies
The tide will rise, the tide will rise

Its as natural as day to night
As day to night, day to night
As natural as black and white
Black and white, black and white

Patience gentlemen, the flower can grow up through the stone
Patience gentlemen, it's a truth that we have always known

We are the wave
We are the flow
We are the wind
And soon the rock must go

We are the force
We are the fire
We are the move
Moving higher and higher

We are the force
We are the fire
We are the move
Moving higher and higher
We are the wave
We are the flow
We are the wind
And soon the rock must go

We are the wave
We are the flow
We are the wind
We are the flow

We are the wave
We are the flow
We are the wind
And soon the rock must go

We are the wave
We are the flow
We are the wind
We are the flow
You let me violate you
You let me desecrate you
You let me complicate you
You let me penetrate you

(Ohhhhhhho)

Help me, I torn apart my insides
Help me, got no soul to sell
Help me, the only thing that works for me
Help me, get away from myself

I wanna fuck you like an animal
I wanna feel you from the inside

And I wanna fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You bring me closer to God

You can't help my isolation, you can't help the hate it brings
You can't help my absent of faith
You can't help my everything

Help me, turn on my reason
Help me, s** I can smell
Help me, you make me perfect shape
Help me, think I'm somebody else

I wanna fuck you like an animal
I wanna feel you from the inside
I wanna fuck you like an animal

My whole existence is flawed, you bring me closer to God

[Verse 1]
Here we go again, back to the start
I am not the one that breaks your heart
Always try to hold but now I'm tired

[Chorus]
Here I go, the endless shore
Couldn't say if I was wrong

[Verse 2]
Here I go again, back to my silence
I was such a fool to think you'd follow

[Chorus]
Here I go, the endless shore
Couldn't say if I was wrong

[Bridge]
Dear, it's my final word
Is it insane, this soul?
He was the honest one
I couldn’t give him hope
He was the silent soul
He was the honest one
Can we rewind this?

[Chorus]
Here I go again, this time, another cycle
Couldn't tell that you were ready for it
My baby's gone and left me - crying by myself
My baby's gone and left me - crying by myself
I loved another woman - I lost my best gal

She was a real good woman - she didn't me no harm
She was a real good woman - she wouldn't do me no harm
But I loved another woman - now she's up and she's gone

Well, come back baby - I know I treated you wrong
Well, come back baby - I know I treated you wrong
I loved another woman - now, I won't do that no more
You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along

Moonlight becomes you - it goes with your hair
You certainly know the right thing to wear

Moonlight becomes you - I'm thrilled at the sight
And I could get so romantic tonight

You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't you tell me I'm wrong
What a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along

And if I say: "I love you" - I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight - although
Moonlight becomes you so
We got something to say
Ya know
It's one of those joints here

Yolanda
Umm, Hmm...
Check this out
Ya know
It's time to change
Yolanda
It's been too long it's time to change
Can't get away with every thing
Please tell me why you wait
Gotta answer for yourself someday

A man that I know from the neighborhood
Whenever I see him he's up to no good
Taking from others to get what he wants
And he thinks that there's no way he'll ever get caught

It's been too long it's time to change
Can't get away with every thing
Please tell me why you wait
Gotta answer for yourself someday
Husband and wife a baby girl, there happy
But then there's a woman from down the street
Writing letters and
Sending pictures and
Doing all that she can
Trying hard to gain
The attention of a married man (girl ya wrong now)

Ya, story is
I'm just a kid, and it's all in fun
Ya never stop
To realize ya hurting someone
How would you feel if everything was turned around
And everyday somebody was putting you down (ohh... too long)

It's been too long it's time to change
Can't get away with every thing
Please tell me why you wait
Gotta answer for yourself someday

It's been too long it's time to change
Can't get away with every thing
Please tell me why you wait
Gotta answer for yourself someday
Never flirt with a gal named Tess, down old Texas way
'Cause if you do, I'm telling you this is what you'll have to say
"Lay that pistol down, babe, lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama, lay that pistol down"

I was singing songs in a cabaret and I was having fun
Until one night I didn't sing right and now I'm on the run
Why don't you lay that pistol down, babe, lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama, lay that pistol down

Listen to the story of a red haired jack name Fake
She shot her pistol in the air and she hit me in the leg
Lay that pistol down, babe, put that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama, please lay that pistol down

[Intro]
Woah-ho ooh

[Chorus]
I know that you treat me right
But still I think I gotta make you my next ex
I'm on to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else I like
And I think I gotta make you my next ex
I'm onto the next (oh oh)

[Verse 1]
Today when I wake up
You didn't look the same as last night
And it just don't feel right anymore
I think that we should break up
There's no reason to make up
I won't fight
I'm just tired and I need a change

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sorry, boy
But you got me bored
And something's catching my eye
I was only satisfied for a little while
I gotta
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out (woah oh ho-ooh ooh)

[Chorus]
I know that you treat me right
But still I think I gotta make you my next ex
I'm on to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else I like
And I think I gotta make you my next ex
I'm onto the next (oh oh)

[Verse 2]
You call me too frequently
I thought it was so sweet in the beginning
But now you're too clingy for me
You don't put the seat down
You don't clean the house how I like it (trifling)
That's risen enough
You're time's expired

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Sorry, boy
But you got me bored
I gotta move around
If I ain't got a ring by now
That means I'm not tied down
I gotta
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out

[Chorus]
I know that you treat me right
But still I think I gotta make you my next ex (my next ex)
I'm on to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else that I like
I really think I gotta make you my next ex
I'm onto the next (oh oh)

[Break]
Woah oh
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah oh oh oh oh
Woah-ho oh
Woah oh
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah oh oh oh
I gotta
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out

[Chorus]
I know that you treat me right
But still I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next
And I think you're nice
But then I seen something else that I like
I really think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next (oh oh)

[Verse 1: Shawn Stockman]
Wake up
Couldn't wait until the morning
'Cause at night I was dreamin' of you
So I opened up my eyes
Just to see if you were still there
Watch you sleep for a moment
Then I touched your thighs
You smiled as you opened up your eyes
'Cause you know it's time

[Pre-Chorus: Boyz II Men, Shawn Stockman]
For the whole day to start out right
Nothing can compare to this
Sexin' you while the sun rise
(While the sun rise)
Gives your body a kiss
(You're givin' me)
You're givin' me love signs (So much, mmm, mmm)
That you want it just as much as I do want you, baby
Come on, no more hesitating (Good morning)

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Shawn Stockman]
Wake up, time to rise
Give me some of that morning sunshine
You're just so damn fine (Fine)
Makes me want it all the time
(Makes me want it all the time)
Girl you keep me satisfied
That's why everything's gon' be alright
(Everything, you're everything, yeah)
I waited all night 'cause I know (I know)
There's nothing like that morning love

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris, Boyz II Men]
It feels like just like you're raining
So I'll stay in, and get wetter than I have ever been
Forget the morning imperfections (They don't matter now)
Now that it's going down
I know it makes your sunrise feel so good
And I wouldn't change positions if I could
Oh, I do want you, baby
(Come on, no more hesitating) No

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
Wake up, time to rise
Give me some of that morning sunshine
(Give me some of that sunshine)
You're just so damn fine
Makes me want it all the time
Girl, you keep me satisfied
That's why everything's gon' be alright (Alright)
I waited all night 'cause I know (I know)
There's nothing like that morning love (Oh no)

[Bridge: Boyz II Men]
Wake up
Oh, nothing like that AM love
Wake up
Oh, nothing like that love

[Pre-Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
For the whole day to start out right
Nothing can compare to this
Sexin' you while the sun rise
Gives your body a kiss
You're givin' me love signs
That you want it just as much as I do want you, baby
Come on, no more hesitating (No more hesitating)

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
Wake up, time to rise
(Oh, wake up, wake up, wake up)
Give me some of that morning sunshine
(I want it all)
You're just so damn fine (So fine)
Makes me want it all the time (Ooh, ooh)
Girl, you keep me satisfied
(Girl, you keep me satisfied, yeah)
That's why everything's gon' be alright
(Everything, oh oh)
I waited all night 'cause I know ('Cause I know)
There's nothing like that morning love

[Outro: Boyz II Men]
Wake up
There's nothing like that morning love

[Verse]
Now when I first saw you
I could tell you was the one
That I've been searchin' for
I needed somethin' that was like the Sun
Now all my flowers grow
Right now my life, it blooms, baby
You're my favorite color, my favorite color
My favorite color's you
It's like the endless summer, endless summer
It never ends with you
Cause you're my yellow, yellow, yellow
Cause you're my yellow, yellow, yellow
Eleven times I been busted, eleven times I been to jail
Some of the times I been there nobody could go my bail
Well it seems to me, Lord that this ol' boy just don't fit
Well I can jump in a rosebush and come out smelling like sh...

Those misters dressed in blue never done so right by me
Some of the times I was innocent but the judge said guilty
I'm not one to complain now son I tell you true
When the black cat cross your trail, Lord
It comes in misery times two

(Chorus)
Double trouble--that's what my friends all call me
(Double trouble)
I said, double trouble
T-R-O-U-B-L-E

Well I was born down in the gutter
With a temper as hot as fire
Spent ninety days on a peat farm just doin' the county's time
Well now, even mama said Son you're bad news
And it won't be too long before someone puts one through you
(Chorus)

(Chorus)
Remember me, I'm the one who had your babies, ahh
Remember me, I'm the one who had your babies, ahh
Remember me, I'm the one who had your babies, ahh
Remember me, I'm the one who had your babies, ahh
Remember me, I'm the one who had your babies, ahh
Remember me, I'm the one who had your babies, ahh

Remember me, I'm the one who had your babies, ahh
Remember me, I'm the one who had your babies, ahh
Remember me, I'm the one who had your babies, ahh
Remember me, I'm the one who had your babies, ahh
Remember me, I'm the one who had your babies, ahh

Oh I knew a man, Bojangles and he danced for you
In worn out shoes
With silver hair and ragged shirt and baggy pants
The old soft shoe
He jumped so high, he jumped so high
Then he?d lightly touch down

Mr. Bojangles, Mr Bojangles
Mr Bojangles dance

I met him in a cell in New Orleans
I was down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life
He laughed slapped his leg a step

Mr Bojangles, Mr Bojangles
Mr Bojangles dance

He spoke the name's Bojangles then he danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants, a better stance
Oh he jumped so high, he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, He let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of fifteen years how his dog and him
Traveled about
His dog up and died, His dog up and died
After 20 years he still grieves

He said I dance now at every chance in Honky tonks
For drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
Cause I drinks a bit
He shook his head
And as he shook his head
I heard someone ask please
Mr Bojangles, Mr Bojangles
Mr Bojangles oh dance

[Chorus]
She didn't have a house, a house up in the hills
I never heard her ask for some car with the chromed out wheels
But all she wanted was some love and affection
But all I did all the time was neglect
The fact that she was lonely, I used to be her homey
I used to talk about how I was gonna get us out of the hood
But as long as we're together as a family, then it's all good

[Chorus]
Because any man can make a baby
But it takes a real man to be a father
Talking about a family, the kid, you and me
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality
You see love is wrong and love is right
But if love is strong then love is tight
Talking about a chemistry like a bride-to-be
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality

[Verse 2]
Be careful were the words the last time we had our talk
And your truth sound absurd so my pride just let you walk
When all the time knowing that I didn't mean
To holler out and call you bitch and tell you leave
I admit it, I was wrong but now it's overcome on home
I can't take it here is where you belong
Even out the window looking for the mailman
I hope he's got a letter says, I'm missing you, in the mail
And then I saw you with another, made it hard for me to breathe
But when I played the game forgives
I should've played the game for keeps

[Chorus]
Because any man can make a baby
But it takes a real man to be a father
Talking about a family, the kid, you and me
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality
You see love is wrong and love is right
But if love is strong then love is tight
Talking about a chemistry like a bride-to-be
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality

[Bridge]
Now I wore the shoes that you talked about in your song
But it's been a change I've got a new pair on, yes
Now every night and day I still await
At the lonely spot in the hills
And think about how you set the record straight
Any man can

[Chorus]
Because any man can make a baby
But it takes a real man to be a father
Talking about a family, the kid, you and me
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality
You see love is wrong and love is right
But if love is strong then love is tight
Talking about a chemistry like a bride-to-be
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality
Because any man can make a baby
But it takes a real man to be a father
Talking about a family, the kid, you and me
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality
You see love is wrong and love is right
But if love is strong then love is tight
Talking about a chemistry like a bride-to-be
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality
I'vee been down hearted
Ever since the day we met
Baby I've been down hearted
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues
Baby, how blue can you get?

My love burned like a fire
Your love burned like a cigarette
Yes my love burned like a fire
Your love burned like a cigarette
Yes I've seen you put it down and crush it
Baby, how blue can you get?

Oh you're evil when I'm with you, baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
Yes you're evil when I'm with you, baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
How blue can you get baby
The answer's right here in my heart
I gave you a brand new Ford
But you said: I want a Cadillac
I bought you a ten dollar dinner
And you said: thanks for the snack
I let you live in my pent house
You said it just a shack

I gave you seven children
And now you wanna give them back
I said I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues
Tell me how blue can you get?
I've been thinking 'bout us
And the things we've been thru
It's time we got serious
You know I would like to
But we need to work out these issues
Before they get out of hand
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I know we've been for sin and arguin'
But the fact is
Unity is a good thing
It took a while for me, but now I see
Though some will love you
That same will hate you
Sometimes they'll scream and curse you out
Just try to chill and ride it out
But it's official, when I'm against you (I'm in love)
And I feel it's wrong, more in spite
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
I've been looking at our history
Things ain't changin' but they need to be
Where do we start?
Seems like it's gone too far
Can't we just try to work it out
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I know we've been for sin and arguin'
But the truth is
Unity is a good thing
It took some time for me, but now I see
Though some will love you
That same will hate you
Sometimes they'll scream and curse you out
Just try to chill and ride it out
But it's official, when I'm against you (I'm in love)
And I feel it's wrong, more in spite
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
I'm so sorry I treated you so bad
But I didn't realize what a friend I had
I regret the things I did and you can believe that
I apologize, wish I could take it back
Sometimes I loved you
That same will hate you
Sometimes they'll scream and curse you out
Just try to child and ride it out
But it's official, when I'm against you (I'm in love)
And I feel it's wrong, more in spite
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side

[Hook]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say:
"We don't care what people say"

[Kanye's cousin Kim]
"Hey Kanye, this is your cousin Kim
I just wanted to call ya and congratulate you on this CD, it's hot!
Especially that song “Drug Dealer”
You know, I've been a social worker for 10 years
I've been paying people's lights, rents, mortgage
You talkin' 'bout people paying shine on $6.55 an hour;
People can't pay their rent for $6.55 an hour
So, it just... It's just really difficult to truly understand what these people are going through
You know, and people are human
They wanna look good, they wanna take pride at how they look, they wanna take pride at what they do
The other part that really hit home for me is that people borrow other people's kids and put it on their income tax
A lot of times, what they're doing with that money is finding another place to live because the place that they live in
The toilet's overflowing or the roof is caving in and the landlord doesn't care- Landlord doesn't care enough to come in and fix those things and make sure that the people have a safe environment to live in
So, they borrow somebody else's kid, so that maybe they can get a car so they can get back and forth to work, 'cause you know, in the hood, the best paying job ain't always next to yo house, it's not within walking distance. ('til it get sky high)
So you have to take 20 buses to get back and forth;
You have to spend a lot more money than what you have just on transportation, then you get paid on the job
So, maybe they might buy a car,  maybe they might buy shoes for their kids.... You know, and the drug dealing is just supplementary of all of that, I mean like I said, I don't condone it, but I definitely got hugs for my thugs, you know
Tryna' get out there makin' and the only thing that I can ask is once they stack the money 'til it get sky high is that they try to do something positive with it...
That they try to send their kids to school...
That they try to make a difference."

Devoted to you

This song was first released on the John Denver Album. It is the only album it has been released on

Joseph & Joe
The priest and the cowboy
The places they've been to
The places they're in
For a time between storms
On the side of a mountain
With another man's family
A family of friends

Joseph can give you
The keys to the kingdom
He'll put you in touch with
The spirit of man
Joe love the desert
But lives in the mountains
His closest companion
A left-handed man

Where do you go
If you've got no way to get there
Where do you go
How do you know
If you've never ever been there
How do you know
Tell me how do you know
Joseph I lost you
In some other city
Our paths and our crossing
Were way out of time
Joe how the seasons
Have drifted between us
Or is it your vision
Much greater then mine

Take head of the darkness
Which gathers around us
A fire that consumes us
Forever to burn
Then look to the surf
For our father is with us
Our mother will teach us
What we need to learn

Where do you go
If you've got no way to get there
Where do you go
How do you know
If you've never ever been there
How do you know
Tell me how do you know
Tell me where do you go
If you've got no way to get there
Where do you go
How do you know
If you've never ever been there
How do you know
Tell me how do you know

Still we're together again (we're together again)

I didn't want ever want you to go
Darlin' I can't help but let the whole world know
That we're together again (we're together again)

I didn't mean to ever leave you alone
I didn't mean to ever do you wrong
Now that you're back where you belong
I'm gonna love you all night long

We're together again (oh darlin')

'Bout the most beautiful thing I've seen in Idlewild. But then, you're not from Idlewild

[Verse 1: Wanya Morris]
Since I met you, I've begun to feel so strange
Every time I speak your name
(That's funny)
You say that you are so helpless too
That you don't know what to do, ooh

Each night I pray there will never come a day
When you up and take your love away
Say you feel the same way too and I wonder what
It is I feel for you, ooh

[Chorus]
Could it be I'm falling in love
(Wit'cha baby)
Could it be I'm falling in love
Could it be I'm falling in love
(With you, with you, with you)
With you

[Verse 2: Nathan Morris]
I don't need all those things that used to bring me joy
You made me such a happy boy
And honey you'll always be the only one for me
Meeting you was my destiny
You can be sure I will never let you down
When you need me I'll be around
And darling you'll always be the only one for me
Heaven made you specially

[Chorus]
Could it be I'm falling in love
(Wit'cha baby)
Could it be I'm falling in love
Could it be I'm falling in love
(With you, with you, with you)
With you

And darling you will always be the only one for me
Heaven made you specially

[Chorus]
Could it be I'm falling in love
(Wit'cha baby)
Could it be I'm falling in love
(With you)
Could it be I'm falling in love
(With you, with you, with you)
With you

Could it be I'm falling in love
(Hey, said I'm walking around with my heart in my hands)
Could it be I'm falling in love
(Trying to love you as hard as i can, yeah yeah yeah)
Could it be I'm falling in love
And I don't think you understand
That I'm falling in love with you

Could it be I'm falling in love
Could it be I'm falling in love...

Lightning hits the house of wax
Poets spill out on the street
To set alight the incomplete
Remainders of the future

Hidden in the yard. Hidden in the yard

Thunder drowns the trumpets blast
Poets scatter through the night
But they can only dream of flight
Away from their confusion

Hidden in the yard. Underneath the wall
Buried deep below a thousand layers lay the answer to it all

Lightning hits the house of wax
Women scream and run around
To dance upon the battleground
Like wild demented horses

Hidden in the yard. Underneath the wall
Buried deep below a thousand layers lay the answer to it all
Hidden in the yard. Underneath the wall
Buried deep below a thousand layers lay the answer to it all
I know perfectly well
I'm not where I should be
I've been very aware
You've been patient with me

Every time we break up
You bring back your love to me
And after all I've done to you
How can it be

You still believe in me

I try hard to be more
What you want me to be
But I can't help how I act
When you're not here with me

I try hard to be strong
But sometimes I fail myself
And after all I've promised you
So faithfully
You still believe in me

I wanna cry...
I never knew the charm of spring
I never met it face to face
I never new my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace

Till April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom
Holiday tables under the trees
April in Paris, this is a feeling
That no one can ever reprise

I never knew the charm of spring
I never met it face to face
And I never new my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace

Till April in Paris
Whom can I run to?
What have you done to my heart?
I close my eyes and just see pretty colors
They're dancing just for me, pretty colors (pretty colors)
Locked in my mind they'll always be
You'll never give your love to me
So I'll just close my eyes and just see pretty colors (pretty colors)
Locked in my mind they'll always be
You'll never give your love to me
So I'll just close my eyes and just see pretty colors (pretty colors)
Pretty colors (pretty colors), pretty colors
Hey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you babe
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about her
Don't want to talk about her
I'm just so sick about her
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about her
Feeling the blues about her
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find...
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now
And maybe I should do the same
Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, babe
And now, it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about her
Don't want to talk about her
I'm just so sick about her
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about her
Feeling the blues about her
I just can't do without ya
Can you tell me is this fair?
Is this the way its really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around (should've known better that you were gonna make me cry)
That you were going to make me cry
Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around comes around
Yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that
What goes around comes around
Yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that
Don't want to think about it (no)
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it (yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair?
Is this the way things are going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around (should've known better that you were gonna make me cry)
That you were going to make me cry
Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay baby 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

[Comes Around interlude:]
Let me paint this picture for you, baby
You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes
When You cheated girl
My heart bleeded girl
So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case
A scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved
And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right
But girl I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy
You'll see
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
See?
You should've listened to me, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Because
(What goes around comes back around)
I was alone and sickly
It was a quarter of a moonlit night
I heard him cry through my window shade
And it filled me so full of fright
But I could not turn my back on him
I put on the back porch light
"Can I help you" said the Good Samaritan
"Can I help you" said the Good Samaritan

I brought him bread and a blanket
But I told him "You can't come in"
You can sleep outside in the tool shed
Though a little rain comes in
Oh, I don't know you, you're a stranger
I don't know where you've been
"You can't come in here" said the keeper of the inn
"I don't want you in here," said the keeper of the inn

But I couldn't sleep for the thinking
You know my night got so insane
I thought, maybe he was an angel
And I left him out in the rain
And what if he was the devil
He'd be coming after me again
But when I woke in the weary morning he was gone
When I woke in the weary morning he was gone
I thought maybe he was an angel
And I left him out in the rain
And what if he was the devil
He'd be coming after me again
When I woke in the weary morning he was gone
When I woke in the weary morning, Lord, he was gone

[Verse 1]
Making your way through the neighborhood
Looking for some good boys, toys
Bobbin' your tail to another one of Prince's jams
Trying to look real coy
When they pull up right beside you
And ask if they can ride you
Where the party at?
The horn goes beep
The music in the jeep goes

Every now and then, you're havin' one of them days
People gettin' on your last nerve, ooh
No matter how you cut it, nothing seems to go your way

The door goes slam

You don't need nobody, Prince gon' get you high
Ooh yeah, I'll get you high

Farewell, farewell to love
She's gone and I'm through with love
My schemes, my dreams of heaven are gone since she went away
Her lips, her eyes
Her touch are the things that I'll miss so much
Her style, her smile so thrilling
Are joys of a sweeter day
Sun is shining so lovely
Days as bright as can be
Sun keeps shining so lovely
But that sun ain't shining for me
So farewell, farewell to love
She's gone, there's no sun above
I've news of blues that got me
I've lost, that's the cost of love
(musical interlude)
Farewell, farewell to love
She's gone and I'm through with love
My schemes, my dreams of heaven are gone since she went away
Sun is shining so lovely
Days as bright as can be
Sun keeps shining so lovely
But that sun ain't shining for me
So farewell, farewell to love
She's gone, there's no sun above
I've got news of blues that got me
I'm oh so sad, I feel so bad
I've lost, that's the cost of love
Have mercy baby
On a poor girl like me
You know I'm falling falling
Falling at your feet

I'm tingling right
From my head to my toes
So help me help me
Help me make the feeling grow

'Cause when the loving starts and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Have pity, baby, just
When I thought it was over
And now you got me runnin', runnin'
Runnin' for cover

I'm begging you for, a bit of
Sympathy
If you use me again
It'll be the end of me
'Cause when the lovin' starts and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Baby, baby hope
You're gonna stay away
'Cause I'm getting weaker
Weaker every day

I guess I'm not as strong
As I used to be
If you use me again
It'll be the end of me

'Cause when the lovin' starts and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

'Cause when the lovin' starts and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Say that you love me
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
Fallin' fallin' fallin'
Fallin' fallin' fallin'
Fallin' fallin' fallin'
Fallin' fallin' fallin'
I'll hear heavenly music
I'll hear bells start to chime
I'll hear thunder, and I'll be struck with wonder
But I won't have to look a second time

If her voice is a song, and her walk is a dance
And if her laugh is warm and free
If I suddenly seem to be seeing a dream
She's the right girl for me

If the glow in her eyes and the light in her smile
Could charm a bird right off a tree
I'll be charmed as a bird, and I'll know in a word
She's the right girl for me

She'll have a simple sweet appeal
That wins my affection
She'll be the kind who'll make me feel
She needs my protection
If the sight of her face and the touch of her hand
Can make me happy as can be
If my heart says, "Come in,"
Darling where have you been?"
She's the right girl for me
She's the right girl for me
Woman, I have to leave you
I can't stay where there is no pay
And I really don't care where I'm going to
Its been so long since I've been gone
Lord, I'm tired and I want to go home
My throat is raw from singing the blues
Need all my friends to talk to
Now yes I do need all my friends to talk to

Gonna search around til I find a friend
Who believes in me for what I am
Sing my song til it hurts
Play my music til I hit pay dirt
Now I got to sing my song
I got to play my music, do the things I love

Its been so long since I've been gone
Lord, I'm tired and I want to go home
My throat is raw from singing the blues
Need all my friends to talk to
Now yes I do need all my friends to talk to
I don't want you to cook my bread
I don't want you to make my bed
I don't want your money too
I just wanna make love to you
Love to you baby, love to you
Love to you baby, love to you
I don't want you to be my slave
I don't want you to work all day
I don't want you sad woman,blue
I just wanna make love to you
I don't want you to wash my clothes
I don't want you to keep my home
I don't want you to be sad and blue
I just wanna make love to you
Love to you baby, love to you
Love to you baby, love to you
I can tell by the way you talk
I can see by the way you walk
I can tell that I'm your man
I could love you, it's a cryin' shame
I don't want you to cook my bread
I don't want you to make my bed
I don't want your money too
I just wanna make love to you
Love to you baby, love to you
Love to you baby, love to you
I can tell by the way you talk
I can see by the way you walk
I can tell that I'm your man
I could love you, it's a cryin' shame
I don't want you to wash my clothes
I don't want you to keep my home
I don't want you to be sad woman, blue
I just wanna make love
Love to you baby, love to you
Love to you baby, love to you
Love to you baby, love to you
Love to you baby, love to you
Love to you baby, love to you

What she trying 2 show me, is not from the Golden Rule

This here funk, y'all, listen 2 me, U can't learn it
In school

(Chorus:)
Let's get funky, yeah!
Get it on, right on!
Everyday!

Morris on the organ, a-gettin' real funky
Tommy on piano, gettin' funky 2
Michael B. on the drum uh, gettin' real funky
I got something that I wanna shake 4 U
(Chorus)
People in the front row, U know U get funky
People upstairs, U know U're real funky 2
NPG, we know we're funky
Cuz we do everything and anything we want 2

(Chorus)
Yeah!
Is it funky? (x2)
Alright! This is alright!

Funky, yeah!

[Chorus: The Temptations]
If you're living in a glasshouse (Watch out, watch out)
Don't throw no stones
If you're living in a glasshouse (Watch out, watch out)
Don't throw no stones

[Verse 1]
We're all made with feet of clay and some grease
We're born alone and we die alone
Why can't we live in-between?
I don't care what goes on in your house when you close your door
If you stop lookin' in my bedroom window, I'll stop lookin' in yours

[Verse 2]
My girl came home and she caught me with Alice
And she threw me out the door, nah, nah, nah
But the real reason that she was so mad
Is that she was with Alice before (Say what?!)
(See there? People always doin' that)

[Chorus: The Temptations]
If you're living in a glasshouse (Yeah, y'all)
Don'tcha throw no stones (It's a shame)
If you're living in a glasshouse (Whoa, whoa)
Don'tcha throw no stones

[Bridge: The Temptations]
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Woo, ooh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Woo, ooh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, I ain't no fool

Sweet-talkin', bar-hoppin', pill-poppin', wife-swappin'
Swappin', swappin', swappin'
Sweet-talkin', bar-hoppin', pill-poppin', wife-swappin'
Swappin', swappin', swappin'

[Chorus: The Temptations]
If you're living in a glasshouse
Don't throw no stones
If you're living in a glasshouse
Don't throw no stones
If you're living in a glasshouse
Don't throw no stones

[Outro: The Temptations]
Sweet-talkin', bar-hoppin', pill-poppin', wife-swappin'
Swappin', swappin', swappin'
Sweet-talkin', bar-hoppin', pill-poppin', wife-swappin'
Swappin', swappin', swappin'
Hey, hey...I gotta say it again, I gotta say it again
If you're living in a glasshouse
Well I've been ridin' a winning horse for a long, long time
Sometimes I wonder is this the end of the line
No one should take advantage of who they are
No man has got it made
If he thinks he does, he's wrong

Every mother's son better hear what I say
Every mother's son will rise and fall someday

I've seen it happen so many times, so many times before
Some man got so much money he doesn't worry no more
Or he's got such a pretty woman that'll treat him fine
Well my friend has been a fool
It happens everytime

Every mother's son better hear what I say
Every mother's son will rise and fall someday

I'm not tryin' to preach to no one, to no one at all
I've seen so many of my good friends just rise to fall
'Cause they got so much money or a woman so fine
Well my friends have all been fools, it happens every time
Every mother's son better hear what I say
Every mother's son will rise and fall someday

What I say

Every mother's son better hear what I say
Every mother's son will rise and fall someday

What I say
Oh, every mother's son will rise and fall someday
Oh, Bess, oh, where's my Bess?
Won't somebody tell me where?
I ain't care what she say, I ain't care what she done
Won't somebody tell me where's my Bess? Bess

My Bess, I want her now
Without her I can't go on
I counted the days that I was gone
Till I got home to see her face

Won't somebody tell me where's my Bess?
I want her so, my gal, my Bess
Where is she?

Oh, Lord, in your big heaven
Please show me where I must go
Oh, give me the strength, show me the way

Tell me the truth, where is she?
Where is my gal?
Where's my Bess?
Let my inspiration flow
In token lines suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
Till my tale is told and done
It's automatic
There's too much static
Ooh your signal's fading
Down goes my rating
Ooh your signal's fading

Remote - remote
Romance - romance

Rush-button passion
I won't repeat it
I won't repeat it
I won't repeat (ha ha ha)

Wait a minute
Wait a minute but...

It's just a sequence
It makes no real sense
It's just a sequence
It makes no real sense
It's automatic
There's too much statix
Can't get no feed-back
I'm on the wrong track

Wait a minute
It don't make a lot of sense
Just a sequence
It makes no real sense

[Verse 1]
No, you couldn't call Jesse a babe in the woods
He's just weak in self-defense
'Cause he's so thin skinned
He can't take a joke at his expense
"You're a push button window," says Rowdy Yates
"I can run you up and down
Anytime I want, I can make you my dancin'
My dancin' clown!"

[Chorus]
You're my dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin', my dancin' clown
Dancin'
You're my dancin' clown
Dancin', dancin', dancin'
My dancin' clown

[Verse 2]
Rowdy Yates is as bold as Jove
He's all chide and snide and bluff
Stuck in the romantic tradition
Of acting rough and tough
"You're always charging through," says Jesse
Nervous, lookin' all around
To see who's seein' him bein' a dancin'
A dancin' clown

[Chorus]
He's a dancin' clown
Dancin', dancin', ddancin' clown
Dancin'
He's a dancin' clown
Dancin', dancin', dancin'
A dancin' clown

[Bridge]
Cherchez la femme
Whenever love comes around, someone's a dancin' clown
Cherchez la femme
Whenever hearts start to pound, someone's a dancin' clown

[Verse 3]
Down the street comes last-word Suzie
She's high yellow, lookin' top nice
You hear the swoosh of jungle blades
And the crackle of northern ice
"Hot damn!" says Rowdy, lookin' up
"Yum!" says Jesse, lookin' down
"How would you like to be her dancin'
Her dancin' clown?"

[Chorus]
Be her dancin' clown
Dancin', dancin', her dancin' clown
Dancin'
Be her dancin' clown
Dancin', dancin', dancin'
Her dancin' clown

[Bridge]
Cherchez la femme
Whenever love comes to town, someone's a dancin' clown
Cherchez la femme
Wherever hearts start to pound, someone's a dancin' clown

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah nigga, I'm still fuckin' wit ya
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg & D.R.E
'99 nigga

[Dr. Dre:]
Guess who's back?

[Snoop Dogg:]
Still, still doin' that shit, huh Dre?

[Dr. Dre:]
Oh for show

[Snoop Dogg:]
Yeah

[Dr. Dre:]
Check me out

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown alot, can't keep it home alot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was The Chronic
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

[Snoop Dogg:]
If you ain't up on things

[Dr. Dre:]
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my gang
Still puffin' my leafs
Still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police

[Snoop Dogg:]
Uh uh

[Dr. Dre:]
Still rock my khakis with a cuff & a crease

[Snoop Dogg:]
For show

[Dr. Dre:]
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213

[Snoop Dogg:]
For life

[Dr. Dre:]
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thing
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

(Chorus - twice)

[Snoop Dogg:]
I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl

[Dr. Dre:]
Still takin' my time to perfect a beat
& I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

[2nd Verse: Dr. Dre]
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me & Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
& even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed, I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the AM compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til your soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, After-mathematics
In the home of drive-by's & Akmatics
Swap meets, sticky green & bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D.R.E
(Chorus - twice)

[Snoop Dogg:]
I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl

[Dr. Dre:]
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
& I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It ain't nothin' but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether your coolin' on a corner wit your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangsta's all across the world
Still...

[Snoop Dogg:]
Hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl

[Dr. Dre:]
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back

[Snoop Dogg:]
So if you ain't up on things

[Dr. Dre:]
Dr. Dre be the name still runnin' the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin' love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they mom's out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard
Barbecue's every day, drivin' fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

(Chorus - 3 times)

[Snoop Dogg:]
I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl

[Dr. Dre:]
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
& I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Right back up in your muthafuckin' ass
'95 plus 4 pennies!
Add that shit up, D.R.E. right back up on top of things
Smoke somethin' wit your dog
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky-icky-icky
Oooh wee! Put it in the air
Oh you's a fool D.R

[laugh]
Oh, the lights of magdala flicker dimly on the shore
Holy sailor sailing on the sea
Patiently waiting she was quietly to the door
Another lonely night in galilee

Magdalene, don't wrap your dreams in sorrow
Save them for morrow if it comes
When we'll meet within the circle round the sun
If heaven were a lady don't you know you have been the one

To the streets of jerusalem you followed him once more
Your holy sailor's come home from the sea
The somewhere someone's calling you to a distant golden shore
Far from the lonely nights in galilee

Magdalene, don't wrap your dreams in sorrow
Save them for morrow if it comes
When we'll meet within circle round the sun
If heaven were a lady I know you'd been the one

[Intro]
In that soulful ol' man sunshine
(Ba-baduh-ba-ba-do-do-do)
(Da-da-da, ba-du-duh-duh)

[Verse 1]
She looks so fresh and sweet, keeps herself soft and tender
No wonder that I can sing a song about my baby
She looks so healthy, I feel so doggone wealthy
No wonder that I can sing a song about my baby

[Hook]
So happy, together love is better
In that soulful ol' man sunshine
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do do

[Verse 2]
She wakes up singing songs, of happy ever afters
Well, let me just tell you 'bout my ever-lovin' lady
One bright September, I can remember
The morning we walked together laughin' in the sunshine

[Hook]
So happy, together love is better
In that soulful ol' man sunshine

[Bridge]
Hey, old man shine your love on me
Hey, old man shine your love on me
Soulful old man sunshine shine your light divine on me
Hey ol' man shine your love on me
Then suddenly the light shines through and I see you there standing before me
Today the world is new
I feel so high and so far within you, yeah

[Outro]
Morning and evening, my love is weaving
A magical thread of joy that joins our hearts together
La-la-la-la-la, lala-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah, uhuh-oh-oh-lala
La-la-la-la-la, lala-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah, uhuh-oh-oh-lala
La-la-la-la-la, lala-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah, uhuh-oh-oh-lala
La-la-la-la-la, lala-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah, uhuh-oh-oh-lala
I'll make you a deal like any other candidate
We'll pretend were walking home cause your future's at stake
My set is amazing, it even smells like the street
There is a bar at the end where I could meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall "I smell the blood of les tricoteuses"
Who wrote up scandals in other bars

I am having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces Charles Manson, Cassius Clay
If you want it, boys get it here thing

So you scream out of line
"I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Anytime?
Tres butch little numberwang "Hey girlie, I want you
When it's good it's really good and when it's bad I go to pieces"
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar
Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying til we break up our minds
'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding hands
When I grow up to be a man

Will I dig the same things that turn me on as a kid?
Will I look back and say that I wish I hadn't done what I did?
Will I joke around and still dig those sounds
When I grow up to be a man?

Will I look for the same things in a woman that I dig in a girl?
(14, 15)
Will I settle down fast or will I first want to travel the world?
(16, 17)
Well, I'm young and free, but how will it be
When I grow up to be a man?

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Will my kids be proud or think their old man's really a square?
(18, 19)
When they're out having fun, yeah, will I still wanna have my share?
(20, 21)
Will I love my wife for the rest of my life
When I grow up to be a man?
What will I be when I grow up to be a man?
(22, 23)
Won't last forever
(24, 25)
It's kind of sad
(26, 27)
Won't last forever
(28, 29)
It's kind of sad
(30, 31)
Won't last forever
It's a lonesome old town when you're not around
I'm lonely as I can be
I never knew how much I missed you
But now I can plainly see
It's a lonesome old town when you're not around
How I wish you'd come back to me

I never knew how much I missed you
But now I can plainly see
It's a lonesome old town when you're not around
How I wish you'd come back to me
How I wish you'd come back to me

[Refrain]
Ooh baby mm
When you hold me
Oh Oh
When you hold me the sound

[Verse 1]
Is it possible I could feel this good
I could really love you the way I do
Is it possible I would feel this good
I could really love you the way I do

[Chorus]
See me (within the light)
Flowing (take me to you)
Like the river to the sea
You come down (I'm in the light)
You cover (pull me to you)
And the waves rush over me

[Verse 2]
I feel a love light rush over me
I feel the love turn to me
And then your love just creeps over me
Over me

[Chorus]
See me (within the light)
Flowing (take me to you)
Like the river to the sea
You come down (I'm in the light)
You cover (pull me to you)
The waves rush over me

[Refrain]
Ooh baby mm
When you hold me
Oh oh
When you hold me closer

[Interlude]
And I won't let you go
I won't let you go
And I won't let you go
I won't let you go

[Bridge]
Take up your love
Take up your love
Take up your love
And come to me
This love's not a liar
To cold it's a fire
I'm on the run
And it's a comfort to me
I won't let it go
Take up your love
Take up your love
Take up your love
And come to me
This love's not a liar
To cold it's a fire
I'm on the run
And it's a comfort to me

[Outro]
And I won't let you go
I won't let you go
And I won't let you go
I won't let you go

[Intro]
I like the sound of funky music
Let me hear you sing it (I like the sound of funky music)
I like it
'Cause funky music sho nuff turns me on
I like the sound of funky music

[Verse 1]
Bless my soul, I can't control
The feeling I get when I hear the funky music
People, it does something to my brain
What it is I can't explain
Keep it right there
I don't want to lose it

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on people now
Express yourself
Come on come on come on people now
I like the sound of funky music

[Verse 2]
My mind is singing
Everybody sing it sing it
I like it
'Cause funky music sho nuff turn me on
Music's got my soul on fire
I can feel the blood boiling in my veins
People I get a feeling deep down inside
Something like a rollercoaster ride
And I ain't ashamed to say that I feel alright
Funky now

[Chorus]
Come on come on come on people and express yourself

[Verse 3]
Don't it make you feel alright
All you crazy people from the big city
Get on down to the nitty gritty
I like the sound of funky music
Everybody sing it with me (I like the sound of funky music)
'Cause funky music sho nuff turn me on

[Outro]
Boom boom boom
Like a river turns me
Boom boom boom
Gimme more, uh, uhh
C'mon feel the noise, don't stop the boys
They get wild wild wild, wild wild wild
Step it up, let your neck snap back
Uh, saddle up baby-girl put your hair back
Hurry up, barkeep, keep the brew comin'
Tryin' to drank 'till my back start slumpin'
Like old man, live by the old rules
Fought all the steps infront of the old fools
Got me nowhere, nigga, it's a different time
F*ck '08, niggas thinkin' '09
I take a look behind
Niggas can't form a line
Like Kindergarten waitin' for the water fountain
Standin' up, said, arms crossed, poutin'
Scott Mescudi, boys they was doubtin' him
'Till they Googled me and found that Imeem
They love a dooder, they love me I mean
I can't believe how I had a dream of Martin King
But they ain't takin' me out on no balcony
(Feel the noise, don't stop the boys
They battle-ow-ow, wow-wow-wow)
Stand up, put your arms to the cieling man
Show skin, baby-girl, yeah, I'm a fan
Won't do you wrong, like a pushover
See Cudi ridin' through, better pull over
Like I got blue, red lights shinin' 'round
But if I see the man, slowly put the club down
"How you doin' Officer? Nice moustache"
Dunkin Donut eatin' muthaf*ckas hatin', damn
,
I get my speed-racer on
Playin' ray-cash, get my Cleveland city on
Brooklyn to Cali, jet-lagged and all
There's still enough time to hit the mall
Shit, one wish when I'm deceased
Bury me in 501 and 10 deep
And please keep the bapes on the feet
So I can watch the devil ice-grill me
Haha, yeah, how you like a nigga now?
I'm it like the clown
And Cudi get (Wild wild wild)

Back, back up in the mix like that
How y'all feel?

The boogie banger twisted off the lime green

King of my city, ask my cousin Smitty, yo
Got to get the dough, got to blow the spot
Diggity Das KRS East coast on lock
Verse Two: Das-EFX, KRS

[Drayz]
To corny niggas y'all get ate, my shit'll make you faint

Now look we comin back and runnin shit like fuckin Michael Jordan

Yo you a, corny nigga so we gots ta do ya

[Books]
This for my niggas on the block, handlin rock like Kenny Anderson
I'm brandishin, stiggedy styles to keep MC's vanishing
Scattering, fuck it, styles don't be mattering
My pattern's amazing son Blazing like a Saddle and
Battling's a no-no, got more Fame than Coco

So take your, style and Go-Go like D.C. niggas
Y'all know the haps we movin strapped on the East nigga

For classes, yo KRS come get up in they asses

[KRS]
What... I say, follow me follow me
With my syllable syllable lyrical criminal
MC threats are minimal to my phsyical they just
Whittle and whittle away, with little and little to say
As they piddle and paddle away, they say OK
But I chop that ass up anyway
What's your handle I got mad MC heads upon a mantle
I got genuine MC skin sandals
I light the mic up like a candle, watch it melt
Cause when I felt lyrics you both are screamin for help
When you hear it, you can't bear it, you can't even wear it
You oughts to just cheer it, go get it spirit!!
As I fa-la-la-la-la, I'm comin with that rara
Rockin mics when you was googoo gaga to your momma
You wanted to battle KRS when you was young you told your poppa
He slapped you in your head and said UHH-UHH
But you didn't heed the warning
Now I'm in the place, now I'm your face
Lookin at your crew but they all broke out
Because they nothin but lace
KRS is like mace, in your motherfuckin face
Yo DJ Dice, tear down the place!!
I'm not a savior, and I'm not a saint
The man with the answers I certainly ain't
I wouldn't tell you what's right or what's wrong
I'm just a singer of songs

But I can take you for a walk along a little country stream
I can make you see through lovers' eyes and understand their dreams
I can help you hear a baby's laugh and feel the joy it brings
Yes, I can do it with the songs I sing
I'm not a prophet, and I'm not a priest
I'm not a wise man who's come from the East
I wouldn't tell you what's right or what's wrong
I'm just a singer of songs

But I can take you to a city where a man was crucified
I can tell you how He lived, and I can tell you why He died
I can help proclaim the glory of this mighty king of kings
Yes, I can do it with the songs I sing
I'm not a great man. I don't claim to be
But when I meet my Maker and He questions me
I won't hang my head. I'll stand proud and strong
And say, "I was a singer. Lord, I was a singer
Yes, I was a singer of songs."
Just one look and I felt so wild
Felt so wild in love with you
I found out how good it feels
Just how good to have your love

Say you will, you will be mine
You'll be mine forever and always
Just one look and I knew
That you were my only one

I thought I was dreaming
But I was so wrong
But I'm gonna keep on scheming
Till I can make you all of my own

So you see I really care
Without you I'm nothing
Just one look and I know
I'll get you someday
Just one look
That's all it took
I told you baby
Long time ago
I don't want no woman
Baby, mess around my door
I gotta move
Baby, baby, baby, I got to move
I don't want you messin' woman
I don't want your foolin' round with me
Hey
I told you baby
Once upon a time
You would be my woman
Said oh, you'll be mine
But that is alright
That's alright, alright
Whoa that is alright baby
Treat me wrong tonight
Whoa, don't want you baby
Always foolin' round with me
Oh no no no no
I don't want my baby
Always foolin' round with me
She tries to make me leave her
Always get away from me
(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a) flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)
Winkin eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt)
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low (I'm a flirt)
And when she's wit her man looking at me, damn right (I'm a flirt)
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause (I'm a flirt)
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause (I'm a flirt)
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me 'cause (I'm a flirt)

Now swear to tell the truth
And the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to
Rolling like I supposed to
Shining like I supposed to
In the club, f***ing with honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand it when a n**** bring his girlfriend to club
Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club
And wondering why all these players trying to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, n**** I'm gonna holla at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall
If I could man I probably would flirt with all of you
Yeah, yeah homie you say she's your girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'm gonna be like, "cousin"
Believe me man, this is how them players do it in the chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the chi
Now the moral of the story is cuff your b****
'cause hey I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and (I'm a flirt)
(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a)

Hey homie, if you ain't getting no money
You better keep her away from me your dig

Well if you love you girl
And wanna keep you girl
Don't be walking up and asking me to meet you girl
Because I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to girl
She winked her eyes on the slide
I've seen you girl
Better treat your girl right
'cause another man will
Better eat you girl like another man will
'cause you leave your wife
And I see you wife
That be for real
How long you think that's finna be you wife
Well I'm living the life
You just getting it right
Your old lady look at me
'cause you ain't hitting it right
She probably used to like you
'cause you're the bitter type
That's until I came along
And put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that a** looking thick in the light
I noticed she was checking me
And digging the ice
And if I get that tonight
Better hit that twice
I can even make her mine
If I hit that price
You know smack that thing
Sit that right
Up on that dresser
Yeah that's right
Pulling on her hair
Like we getting in a fight
Yeah I know it's kinda tight
But it'll suit 'er just right
So if yo girl sexy
And she test me
Don't be upset g
'cause you might catch me
Trying to catch a glance up her skirt
The McLaren in reverse
Then if I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt
Let's go y'all
(when I, when I, when I, when I) pull up to club
All the shawties be like (damn twenty-eight,eights)
Then I be like girl you know just who I am (don't hate, hate)
Say I done fell in love wit a stripper you all
All I do is flirt with her, and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pact
Teddy paine was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'm flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me teddy bend her a** down

Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low (I'm a flirt)
And when she's wit her man looking at me, damn right (I'm a flirt)
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause (I'm a flirt)

Well, she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
And I saw her standing there

Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
And I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another
Since I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another
Since I saw her standing there

[Spoken Intro]
This song is dedicated to all the ladies, from all of the men
You know what I mean
Simply because y'all go through so much
And we want y'all to know that we recognize that

[Verse 1]
There are so many answers to the question what y'all do for us
And so many reasons for the word why we love on y'all
For instance, how ya' just take us and lift us up
And give us chance after chance and we still find a way to F' things up
And sometimes y'all go and blame yourselves for things we do
'Cause you love us so much our lies become the truth
Y'all try so so hard to make things work
Finding a way to smile just to keep from showing you're hurtin'

[Pre-Chorus]
(It's) Your mind versus
(It's) Your hearts versus
(It's) Your soul versus
(Your) Your body versus our bullshit
(And) our egos (and) our pride

[Chorus]
(That's why) That's why I love the word "woman" (Oh, I love, I love)
Y'all are so tough, y'all put up with so much
That's why I love the word "woman", uh-huh (Oh, I love, I love)
And y'all so full of trust, and besides y'all know us
That's why I love the word "woman"
Time and time again y'all let's us back in
Man, I love y'all so much, I gotta spell it out
W-O-M-A-N, that's what's it's all about, yeah

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think that we're the reason why y'all be stressing out and smoking cigarettes
Mmm, yes I do
And sometimes I think we're the reasons y'all be snapping off on your kids and having fits Somebody feel me
Ladies, when it's that time of the month and y'all really don't feel like being bothered
And sometimes we take y'all hearts for granted
I know y'all got to ask y'allself sometimes
"Why do I even put up with it?"

[Pre-Chorus]
(It's) Your mind versus
(It's your) Your hearts versus
(It's your) Your soul versus
(It's your) Your body versus our bullshit
(And) our egos (and) our pride

[Chorus]
(That's why) That's why I love the word "woman"
Said I love the word, yeah (Oh, I love, I love)
'Cause y'all are so so tough, and you put up with so so much
That's why I love the word "woman" (Oh, I love, I love)
Mmm, mmm, mmm, and y'all are so full of trust, and besides, y'all know us
That's why I love the word "woman"
Time and time and time again y'all let us back in
And I love you so much, I've got to spell it out, W-O-M-A-N

[Bridge]
Fellas, just swallow your pride for a minute
And grab your lady by the hand and sing:
Baby, I'm sorry for the drama that I caused you
Y'all are the backbone of every family, this much is true, sing it
I recognize being a woman, the things y'all go through
And I appreciate every single one of you, yes I do
Baby, I promise from this day I will show respect
I promise to love y'all, yeah, with all of my might, yeah
I'll even burn a candlelight
Because we are here cause y'all paid a price

[Chorus]
That's why I love the word "woman" (Oh, I love, I love)
Oh, y'all put up with so much yeah
That's why I love the word "woman" (Oh, I love, I love)
And you're so so full of trust, and y'all know us, yes sir
That's why I love the word "woman" (Oh, I love, I love)
You're soul survivors, yeah, all the love battles, oh oh
That's why I love the word "woman" (Oh, I love, I love)
Sistas, y'all cook our meals, y'all wash our clothes
Hey, y'all are the love seeds planted in our souls, hey hey
That's why I love the word "woman" (Oh, I love, I love)
When I think about the woman, I just get joyful inside
Where I just want to break down and cry
That's why I love the word "woman" (Oh, I love, I love)

[Outro]
Listen, ladies, like a sister, lover, cousin, mother, auntie, friend
My joy within, my reason seasons, you're so pleasing
You're the lock and we're the keys, created by the Almighty
Forever as the birds and bees, we love y'all until we stop breathing
That's why I love the word "woman" (Oh, I love, I love)
I dedicate this to every woman around the world
Love y'all
Well the woman I hate, I see her everyday
The woman I love she's so far away

If you don't think I love you, look what a fool I've been
If you don't think I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in
I'm stealin', I'm stealin', pretty mama don't you tell on me
Well I'm stealin' back to my good old used to be

Well the woman I love she's about my size
She's a married woman, come to see me sometime

If you don't think I love you, look what a fool I've been
If you don't think I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in
I'm stealin', stealin', pretty mama won't you tell on me
I'm stealin' back to my good old used to be

Well put your arms around me like a circle in the sun
Stay with me baby like my easy rider done

If you don't think I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in
If you don't think I love you, look what a fool I've been
I'm stealin', stealin', pretty mama won't you tell on me
Well I'm stealin' back to my good old used to be
Well I'm stealin', stealin', pretty mama won't you tell on me
Well I'm stealin' back to my good old used to be

I'm stealin', stealin', pretty mama won't you tell on me
Well I'm stealin' back to my good old used to be

When the saints go marching in
Oh, when the saints, go marching in

I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
I said I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues, woman
Baby, how blue can you get?

You're evil when I'm with you, baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
I said You're evil when I'm with you, baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
How blue can you get baby
The answer is right here in my heart

I gave you a brand new Ford
But you said: I want a Cadillac
I bought you a ten dollar dinner
And you said: thanks for the snack
I let you live in my pent house
You said it just a shack
I gave seven children
And now you wanna give them back
I said I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues
Baby, how blue can you get?

[Verse 1]
Listen everybody, especially you girls
Is it right to be left alone
When the one you love is never home?
And I love too hard, my friends sometimes say
But I believe, I believe
That a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside
To see y'all treat me so unkind
Somebody, somewhere, tell her it ain't fair

[Chorus]
Can I get a witness?
(Can I get a witness?)
Can I get a witness?
(Can I get a witness?)
Somebody, somebody
(Can I get a witness?)

[Post-Chorus]
Is it right to be treated so bad
When you've given everything you had?
Even tossin' in my sleep
'Cause I haven't seen my baby all week
Now, you chicks do agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Then emme hear, lemme hear you say, "Yeah, hey"

[Verse 2]
Up early in the mornin'
With her on my mind
Just to find out all night that I've been cryin'
'Cause I believe (I believe) a woman is a man's best friend
I'm gonna stick by her right here, right now
'Til the very end
But she caused me so much misery
That I forget how love's supposed to be
Lemme hear you, lemme hear you say, "Hey, hey"

[Chorus]
I want a witness
(I want a witness)
Can I get a witness?
(Witness, witness)
I want a witness
(I want a witness)
Can I get a witness?
(Witness, witness)

[Post-Chorus]
Everybody knows, especially you girls
That love can be sad
But I have a love that's twice as bad
All you chicks agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Lemme hear you, lemme hear you say, "Yeah, hey"

[Outro]
(I want a witness, can I get a witness?)
Can I get a witness? (I want a witness)
Somebody (Can I get a witness?)
In the mornin' (I want a witness)
I need a witness (Can I get a witness?)
Around about noon (I want a witness)
I want a witness (Can I get a witness?)
In the evenin' (I want a witness)

I was standin' by my window yesterday morning
Without a thought of worry or regret
When I saw the postman comin' down the pathway
He was bringin' me a letter edged in black

Well, he rang the bell and whistled as he waited
Then he said; "Good mornin' to ya, Jack"
But he never knew the sorrow that he brought me
When he handed me that letter edged in black

With trembling hand I took the letter from him
I broke the seal and this is what it said:
"Come home my boy, your dear old father wants you
Come home my boy, your dear old mother's dead."
The last words that your mother ever uttered was:
"Tell my boy I want him to come back
My eyes are dim, my poor old heart is breaking
And, I'm writing you this letter edged in black."

I bowed my head in sorrow and in silence
The sunshine of my life, it all has fled
Since the postman brought that letter yesterday morning saying "come home my boy, your poor old mother's dead."
"Those angry words I wish I'd never spoken
You know I never meant them, don't you, Jack?
May the angels bear me witness, I am asking
Your forgiveness in this letter edged in black."
Whalebones and crosses
Stand against the Arctic sky
The wind blows through the graveyard
Where our fallen fathers lie
Eternal snow that covers them
The shadows of the sun
The mighty struggle on the seas
A way of life is run

I'll sing for you my father
For the ancient sacred ways
How the hunter loved the hunted
How the night becomes the day
The circle of the mighty spirit
Keeps us in its fold
The warmth of understanding
Like a light shot through the cold

Then bring to me my people
Touch them with your loving hands
Lead them from confusion
Lead them back unto the land
For a sickness seems to block their path
It clouds my peoples' eyes
The promise that an idle truth
Will reap a golden lie
Whalebones and crosses
Stand against the Arctic sky
The wind blows through the graveyard
Where our fallen fathers lie
The timeless hunt a journey back
To what we once came from
Compassion and nobility
Beneath the midnight sun
The mighty struggle of the seas
A way of life is run

[Intro]
Love sign
Love sign
Get up
Love sign
Get up
Pop, pop, pop go the pistol
Bang, bang, bang go the gun
Get up

[Chorus]
If you're sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and forevermore
Two signs of the time
If you'd rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun
Time is passing, passing the time

[Verse 1]
In a chariot of red and gold
The cool, fuzzy voice said "Come save your soul"
Before the fear of rejection reared its head
He stood before the masses and calmly said

[Chorus]
If you're sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and forevermore
Two signs of the time
If you'd rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun
Time is passing, passing the time

[Verse 2]
In the day of where and why we all belong
Don't nobody want to hear a silly love song
And if they did then we would sing it on the news
While you're aiming your gun at me and I'm aiming back at you

[Chorus]
If you're sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and forevermore
Two signs of the time
If you'd rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun
Time is passing, passing the time

[Refrain]
Pop, pop, pop go the pistol
Bang, bang, bang go the gun
Pop, pop, pop go the pistol
Bang, bang, bang go the gun
Get up

[Verse 3]
If you only had one year left to live
What good is the time you spend if you got no love to give?
Let's all get up off the front and find a cause to back
Then we could teach the babies replications of the act, of the act

[Chorus]
If you're sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and forevermore
Two signs of the time
If you'd rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun
Time is passing, passing the time

[Chorus]
If you're sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and forevermore
Two signs of the time
If you'd rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun
Time is passing, passing the time

[Refrain]
Pop, pop, pop go the pistol
Bang, bang, bang go the gun
Pop, pop, pop go the pistol
Bang, bang, bang go the gun
Pop, pop, pop go the pistol
Bang, bang, bang go the gun
Pop, pop, pop go the pistol
Bang, bang, bang go the gun

[Outro]
Show us the love sign, we want the love sign
Show us the love sign
Show us the love sign we want the love sign
Show us the love sign
Love sign
Pop, pop, pop go the pistol
Bang, bang, bang go the gun
We want the love sign
Love sign
Pop, pop, pop go the pistol
Bang, bang, bang go the gun
Love sign
Pop, pop, pop go the pistol
Bang, bang, bang go the gun
We want the love sign
Love sign
Pop, pop, pop go the pistol
Bang, bang, bang go the gun

[Spoken Intro: Prince]
Here we are folks
The dream we all dream of
Boy versus girl in the World Series of love
Tell me, have you got the look

You walked in, I woke up

Look so tough, baby

Color you peach and black
Color me taken' aback
Crucial, I think I wantcha

[Chorus: Sheena Easton and Prince]
You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book

If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look

[Ad lib: Prince]
Look here

[Verse 2: Prince]
You got the look
You got the look
You must'a took
You must'a took
A whole hour just to make up your face, baby
Closin' time, ugly lights, everybody's inspected
Everybody's inspected
But you are a natural beauty unaffected
Unaffected
Did I say an hour?
My face is red, I stand corrected
I stand corrected

[Chorus: Sheena Easton and Prince]
You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look

[Spoken Interlude: Prince with Sheena Easton]
There's no girl to do
Well here we are
Ladies and gentlemen
The dream we all dream of
Oh, please!
Boy versus girl in the world series of love
Slammin'!

[Verse 3: Prince and Sheena Easton]
You walked in
I walked in
I woke up
You woke up
I never seen such a pretty girl look so tough, baby
Baby

Yes you do, yes you do
Color you peach and black
Color me taken aback
Baby
Crucial, I think I wantcha

[Chorus: Sheena Easton and Prince]
You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book

If your love is good, let's get to rammin' now
You got the look, you got the look

[Outro: Prince with Sheena Easton]
Here we are folks!
The dream we all dream of!
You got the look
You got the look
You got the look
You got the look
You got the look

[Verse 1]
I was the one
I who could
Pull in all the stars above
Lay them on your feet
And I gave you my love
You are the one that got me started
You could have let me
Love anyone but I only wanted you
So why did you make me cry
Why didn't you come get me one last time

[Chorus]
You'll always know the reason why
We could've had the moon and the sky
You'll always know the reason why this love
Reason why this love
Ain't gonna let you go

[Verse 2]
You lay me down and left me for the lions
A long, long time ago
You left me there dying
But you'll never let me go

[Chorus]
You'll always know the reason why
We could've had the moon and the sky
You'll always know the reason why this love
Reason why this love
Ain't gonna let you go

[Bridge]
You'll always know the reason why
The song you heard
Will stay on your mind
It ain't gonna let you go, no
'Cos you were the moon
And I the endless sky

[Chorus]
You'll always know the reason why
We could've had the moon and the sky
You'll always know the reason why this love
Reason why this love
Ain't gonna let you go
Ain't gonna let you go

[Outro]
You had the keys to the car
You had every star
Every one of them twinkling
Baby what were you thinking
We had the moon and the sky above
And I gave you my love
And now the sun has broken through
It looks like it will stay
Just can't have you comin' home
On such a rainy day
The train is leaving Ellensville
Unless my watch is fast
The kids are comin' home from school
Must be quarter past
So many changes since you've been away
And there're​ so many things to say
This time around you'll want to stay
Cause I've had so many nights to find the way
Even bought that summer cottage yesterday
Pretty soon I'll be close to you
And it will be so good
We'll talk about the part of you
I never understood
And I will take good care of you
And never let you cry
We will look so much in love
To people passing by
So many changes since you've been away
And there're so many things to say
I wrote so many times and more
But the letters still are lying in my drawer
Cause the morning mail had left some time before
All the passengers for Allentown wait closer to the track
It's hard for me to realize you're really coming back
The crossing gate is coming down I think I see the train
The sun has gone and now my face is wet with heavy rain
The passengers for Allentown are gone
The train is slowly moving on
But I can't see you any place
And I know for sure I'd recognize your face
And I know for sure I'd recognize your face
You know what I want want
I know what you want want
Tell me what I want want
I'll tell you what you want want

You know what I want want
I know what you want want
Tell me what I want want
I'll tell you what you want want

So many ladies in the room (in the room)
All that I can see is you (see is you)
This dime piece is in this place (place)
But you came through and took the cake (whoooh)

It's five o'clock this morning and the sun is on the rise
There's frosting on the window pane, and sorrow in your eyes
The stars are fading quietly, the night is nearly gone
And so you turn away from me, and tears begin to come

And it's goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leavin' you
Goodbye again, as if you didn't know, it's goodbye again
And I wish you could tell me, why do we always fight when I have to go

It seems a shame to leave you now
The days are soft and warm
I long to lay me down again, and hold you in my arms
I long to kiss the tears away, give you back the smile
Other voices beckon me, to go a little while

And it's goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leavin' you
Goodbye again, as if you didn't know, it's goodbye again
And I wish you could tell me, why do we always fight when I have to go

I have to go and see some friends of mine
Some that I don't know
Some who aren't familiar with my name
It's something that's inside of me, not hard to understand
It's anyone who listens to me sing
And if you hours are empty now
Who am I to blame
You think if I were always here, our love would be the same
As it is the time we have, is worth the time alone
And lying by your side, the greatest peace I've ever known

But it's goodbye again
And I'm sorry to be leavin' you, goodbye again
As if you didn't know, it's goodbye again
And I wish you could tell me
Why do we always fight when I have to go
(laughter)

First time we met
What a thrill
Moved me then
Always will
Changed my life for the better
From day to day
You've made me so happy
I'm gonna stay.. for good
You're so good mamma

Dream maker come by here
Says he's got a fast trick
I said oh man go on by here
I'm gonna stick
'Cause you're good
Ooohee you're so good

Oh the river roars
Outside my door
Midnight Special calls my name
Was a time that I had to go
Oh but not anymore
Seems like nothing feels the same
Since you called my name
Oooh
You're so good hmmmmm
Oh sweetie you've made me
A satisfied man
Nothin' on my mind
Money in my hand
Hard times and worry
Don't matter much to me
Long as we're together
Oooh I'll let it be
'Cause you're good
Oooh you're so good

I can hear the rivers roar
Outside my door
Midnight Special calls my name
Was a time I had to go
Oh but not anymore
Seems like nothin' feels the same
Since you called my name
Oooh.. so good

Mmmmm ma ma ma ma mamma
Oooh so good.. so good
Oooh you're so good.. so good

Mmmmm oooh
Oooh you're so good
So so so good

[Verse 1]
I was only 16 and her name was Carrie
She was the number one little girl I wanted to marry me
She was only 14, but she had the major body
Yeah, this girl was mean

[Verse 2]
Me and Ace picked Carrie up from school one day
We took her for a ride in Ace's car, the music started to play
We sat real close, both nervous
Lookin' at each other not knowin' what to say

[Verse 3]
Carrie was a sister
But her eyes kinda made her look Japanese
Her short cut afro, shiny and soft
Her clothes fit to please
Ace was a real fast driver
With every turn, Carrie fell in my lap
He asked us where we wanted to go
I said "Yeah right, like you need a map!"

[Hook]
The schoolyard, the schoolyard
Gettin' it on in the schoolyard

[Interlude]
With a wink and a nod we were off to Ace's pod
Like peas who's hangin' for a knife

[Hook]
The schoolyard, the schoolyard
Gettin' it on in the schoolyard

[Interlude]
We never want it for the children of our own
We all pray better seeds we have sown
But one story that is most commonly known
Is gettin' it on in the schoolyard

(Schoolyard)

[Verse 4]
Ace's girl showed up, that's when the party started jumpin'
Tower Of Power's "Squib Cakes" steady humpin'
I said "Carrie, hmm, do you wanna dance?"
She said "Uh hmm, yeah, like later man, first let me smoke this weed"
I said "Damn, my cologne ain't sayin' shit if this is what she needs"

[Spoken Interlude]
Yeah, before I knew it, Carrie was seein' double
That's when me and her got into trouble
So much for the dance
I started takin' off Carrie's pants

[Hook]
The schoolyard, the schoolyard
Gettin' it on in the schoolyard

(Hey hey.. hey!)

[Verse 5]
And now boys and girls for the graphic part
Close your ears if you ain't got a nasty heart
(The schoolyard, the schoolyard)
Here we go
Now take a glove, fill it with hot baby lotion and slip it on (Well)
Pull it tight, that's what Carrie was like
One stroke and I was gone
Gone I was, it's true

[Hook]
The schoolyard, the schoolyard

[Interlude]
When your schoolyard baby comes home
And it's all that's on their mind
Try to remember how you felt your very first time, oh!

[Hook]
The schoolyard, the schoolyard
Gettin' it on in the schoolyard (Gettin' it on)

[Bridge]
We never want it for the children of our own
We all pray better seeds we have sown
But one story that is most commonly known
Is gettin' it on in the schoolyard (Gettin' it on, oh)
(Well, gettin' it on.. heh, heh)

[Hook]
The schoolyard (Schoolyard), the schoolyard (Schoolyard)
Gettin' it on in the schoolyard (Boy, you're gettin', yeah)
The schoolyard, the schoolyard (Schoolyard)
Gettin' it on in the schoolyard (Gettin' it on, get.. get.. gettin' it on, yeah)
(Hey!)
Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down
In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughin' little girl that he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singin'
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed thru the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down

[Verse 1: David Ruffin]
Now I'm a guy who's fond of sweet things
Sweet things I adore
In coffee, most take one or two lumps
But I use three or four
But since I kissed your sweet, sweet lips
Sugar ain't sweet no more
Your kiss was sweeter than any cup of coffee
I ever made before

[Chorus: David Ruffin + The Temptations]
You know you're Little Miss Sweetness, Little Miss Sweetness
Sweetest girl in the world
Sweetest girl in the world now

[Verse 2: David Ruffin]
If ever a man had a sweet tooth, I have one indeed
I order cookies and cakes, and malts and shakes
From the menus that I read
But all the cakes and shakes and malts I've bought, together don't exceed
The sweetness in just one of your kisses
Baby, you're the one I need

[Chorus: David Ruffin + The Temptations]
You know you're Little Miss Sweetness
Tryna tell ya, you're Little Miss Sweetness
The sweetest girl in the world, and that's the truth, baby
Sweetest girl in the world now
Ah yeah...
Alright

[Verse 3: David Ruffin]
Now listen to me you sweet thing, hear what I have to say
If ever you need somebody, send for me without delay
But do one thing for me, don't go out on a rainy day
'Cause if it's true that rain melts sugar, you would surely melt away

[Chorus: David Ruffin + The Temptations]
You know you're Little Miss Sweetness
Ah, you're Little Miss Sweetness
Tryna tell you, you're Little Miss Sweetness
Ooh-hoo, you're Little Miss Sweetness
Ah yeah, sweetest girl in the world
Sweetest girl in the world now
The sweetest girl in the world

[Verse 1]
When am I gonna make a living?
Ooh, it's gonna take a while before I give in
See the people fussing and thieving
While the sharks are wheeling and dealing
Gotta wake up and tell yourself
There's no end to what you can do (What you do is up to you)
They'll waste your body and soul if you allow them to
This is the time (Ah)
To start believing in yourself (Ooh, ooh)
Put the blame on no one else

[Verse 2]
When am I gonna make a living, living?
Ooh, it's gonna take a while before I give in
See the people fussing and stealing
Too many lies, no one is achieving
Haven't I told you before?
We're hungry for a life we can't afford
There's no end (No end) to what you can do (Ooh, ooh)
If you give yourself a chance to prove

[Chorus]
We are hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
We're hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in

[Verse 3]
Oh, there's no end to what you can do
They'll waste your body and soul if you allow them to
Oh, start believing in yourself
Put the blame on no one else

[Chorus]
Not gonna give in
Hungry but we won't give in

[Verse 4]
When am I gonna make a living?
Ooh, it's gonna take a while before I give in, yes it is
I'm sick and tired of scratching a living
I am hungry but I'm not gonna give in, no

[Outro]
Hungry but we won't give in (Not gonna give in)
Hungry but we won't give in (Ooh, ooh)
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we're gonna win
Hungry but we won't give in (Not gonna give in)
Hungry but we won't give in (Ooh, ooh)
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we're gonna win
Born with insight and a raised fist
A witness to the slit wrist, that's with
As we move into '92
Still in a room without a view
You got to know, you got to know that when I
Amp up and amplify defy I'm a brother with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in
Something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mike, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Fist in ya face, in the place
And I'll drop the style clearly
Know your enemy, know your enemy
Come on
Word is born fight the war
Now I've got no patience
So sick of complacence
D the E F the I A the N and C the E
Mind of a revolutionary so clear the lane
The finger to the land of the chains
What, the land of the free?
Whoever told you that is your enemy?
Now something must be done about vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mike, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Now action must be taken
We don't need the key we'll break in
I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
And I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of you
Time has come to pay
Come on
Come on
Yes I know my enemies
They're the teachers who taught me to fight me
Yeah compromise, conformity, assimilation
Submission, hypocrisy, brutality, the elite
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
Need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins, whoa, I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad
I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up - to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low - and it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad
So why don't you give it up, baby and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, woman - so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me - and stop drivin' me mad
Whoa, because I - I need your love so bad
Need a soft voice - just to talk to me at night
Don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, come on bring it to me
'Cause I need - your love so bad
Baby, I need, I need - woman, I need your love so bad
When I woke up this morning, my milk cow was gone
If you see my milk cow, Lord send her home
Halla please, please don't do me wrong
Don't do me wrong

I ain't had no milk and butter since my cow been gone
Well I looked for my milk cow, looked high and low
Somebody told me she was walkin' the down the road
Halla please, please don't do me wrong
Don't do me wrong

If you see my milk cow, Lord Lord send her home

Well ma, your calf is hungry, I believe she needs a suck
But your milk is turning blue, I believe she's out of luck
Halla please, please don't do me wrong
Don't do me wrong

I ain't had no milk and butter since my cow been gone
Since my cow been gone
Well I woke up this morning, looked around my bed
Looked for my milk cow, got butter instead
Halla please, please don't do me wrong
Don't do me wrong

If you see my milk cow, please drive her home
Drive her home
I came home, like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun

And I'll kneel down, wait for now
And I'll kneel down, wait for now

So break my step, and relent
You forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way shake the excess

And I'll kneel down, wait for now
I'll kneel down, know my ground

Now I'll be bold
As well as strong
Use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind, free from the lies
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
I'll kneel down, know my ground
I'll kneel down, wait for now

Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

[Chorus 2x]
"You gotta make the money first"
"Then when you get the money, you get the power"
"Then when you get the power, Then you get the woman"

[Ice-T]
The problem is you broke, You ain't got no car or job
You slow with youer hustle, You dress like a slob
Ladies ain't looking for no brothers like this
They want the dub-twisting ballers with the ice on their wrist
You gotta get your cash right to get in the game
Might have to pull a pistol, Flip some caine
Get out in them streets and hustle hard in the rain
Take your come up and reinvest to the game
"You gotta make the money first"
You need a lot to go far
What you think is rich, I just spent on a car
What you think is paid, I just blew on a watch
What you think is wealthy, I just dropped on a yacht
Flip the street cash and try to pick some stocks
Kick back in your pad and watch it roll like crops
But it really ain't that easy, Or we all would be rich
One mistake, You're broke, The come up's a bitch
Make the right moves and forget about sleep
Concentrate on the paper chase, Join the elite
Few dun got mad cash and money to spend
Money to straight blow and money to lend
And only then, You made it past stage one, My friend

[Chorus 2x]

[Ice-T]
Now you got the money and the cash flow thick
But you really ain't nothing but a richer trick
Just because you're paid, you can still get thick
By your low life homies or skanless bitch
You gotta move it around, put it in the right hands
Maybe a judge, Make a PA your friend
Understand what really moves the world
Recognize what really moves these girls
Juice is more important than cash for real
Money you spend, But true power you feel
It ain't that easy to reach
Respect is about the hardest damn thing in the streets to get
Make your moves correct, Watch your crew
Watch your back, They watching you
Anybody round you has gotta be true
Or you never make it past stage two
Listen, when you get the real true power, You know
People will feel you, Wherever you go
And when you really max this game
You'll never have to say your name

[Chorus]

[Ice-T]
Now you got the power, It's on, My friend
Cuz the one thing women love is powerful men
The one thing women hate are brothers that bend
They act like they like 'em, But they only pretend
They wanna be with that man in the V.I
They don't wanna stand in line
You outta your mind?
That other player's got cash, But no juice
Cuz the powerful men get to choose
From a multitude of women that be steppin in crews
Willing to do much more than before
Give you quick brains, It's insane
Just what the woman'll do just for you
Cuz if you got the power, Then they gets it too
If you rollin benz, Then they rollin too
If you livin phat, Then they ballin too
That sounds stupid to you, Not to me
They winning one move when it takes us three
Cars, Big houses, And shopping sprees
While most of us see the penitentiary

[Chorus 2x]
Oobey shoo doo loo be doo
Loo fly me shoo koo doo ooh

Hey yeah!

Every time I turn around
There's another war tryin' 2 bring me down
Nobody ever told me what I'm fightin' 4
They just tell me get in line
Change my clothes, change my mind
It's 110 and I'm just gettin' bored

Maybe we should be dancin' {x2}

U make me say oobey doop be shoo ooh
Doo fly me shoo doo koo ooh
U make say oobey doop be shoo ooh
Doo fly me shoo doo koo ooh

I don't mean no disrespect
But the way I see it, this is a mess
It's got your butt in a sho'nuff dirty jam
If I could just make believe
Make U holler on your knees
Praying 4 somethin' 2 make U understand
Maybe we should be dancin' {x2}

CHORUS:
I can't help but say oobey doop be shoo ooh
Doo fly me shoo doo koo ooh
I can't help but say oobey doop be shoo ooh
Doo fly me shoo doo koo ooh

Maybe we should be dancin'

(Oobey doop be doop be shoo)
Sooner or later, your ways will tumble
Just might take an all night rumble
Might take a piece of New Power cake
But if U cut away the war, hearts will break
Hearts will break

Maybe we should be dancin'
Dance (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh)

Every time I turn around
There's another war tryin' 2 bring me down
Nobody ever told me what I'm fightin' 4

CHORUS
Maybe we should be dancin'

{Parts of CHORUS repeat}
Baby, baby
Maybe we should be dancin'
U make me say...
Maybe we should be dancin'

Oobey doop be shoo ooh
Doo fly me shoo doo koo ooh
I can't help but say oobey doop be shoo ooh
Doo fly me shoo doo koo ooh

Maybe we should be dancin'
(What can I say?)
(What can I do?)

3 AM, it's me again, wouldn't you know?
Things would have to end this way
I did my best the perfect guest knew when to go
Perfect you knew when to stay

Come on, tell me that you love me, dear
I've been feeling down some too
After all, it's time I made it clear
I've been waiting just for you

(What can I say?) Oh, you make me know, baby
(What can I do?) To show you that I care
(What can I say?) Got to have your number, baby
(What can I do?)

Dodododo....

Can't you see the people who stop and stare
Don't it make you wonder why?
I just happened to be standing there
Can't you see it in my eye?
(What can I say?) You got me acting like a fool, girl
(What can I do?) Stop making like a little school, girl
(What can I say?) Could be your lucky day, baby
(What can I do?)

Ooooh, it's hot
Ooohooo, it's hot, little girl

Ooooooo talking girl

(What can I say?) Oh, you make me know, baby
(What can I do?) To show you that I care
(What can I say?) Oh, I got down on my knees
(What can I do?)

Please, please, what can I say?
(What can I do?)
(What can I do?) Oooh, what can I do
(What can I say?) What can I say, baby?
(What can I say?)
Some couples go for a buggy ride
When they start caring a lot
Others will bicycle side by side
Out to some romantic spot
But when you haven't a sou
There's only one thing to do
Let's take an old-fashioned walk
I'm just bursting with talk
What a tale could be told
If we went for an old-fashioned walk
Let's take a stroll through the park
Down a lane where it's dark
And a heart that's controlled may relax
On an old-fashioned walk
I know for a couple who seem
To be miles apart
There's nothing like walking
And having a heart to heart
I know a girl who declined
Couldn't make up her mind
She was wrapped up and sold
Coming home from an old-fashioned walk
I used to dream of a millionaire
Handsome and rich from the States
Taking me out for a breath of air
Saying, "The carriage awaits"
But since you haven't a sou
And I have nothing to do
Let's take an old-fashioned walk
I'm just bursting with talk
What a tale could be told
If we went for an old-fashioned walk
Let's take a stroll through the park
Down a lane where it's dark
And a heart that's controlled may relax
On an old-fashioned walk
I know for a couple who seem
To be miles apart
There's nothing like walking
And having a heart to heart
I know a girl who declined
Couldn't make up her mind
She was wrapped up and sold
Coming home from an old-fashioned walk
More than the greatest love the world has known
This is the love I give to you alone
More than the simple words I try to say
I only live to love you more each day
More than you'll ever know, my arms long to hold you so
My life will be in your keeping, waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping
Longer than always is a long long time, but far beyond forever you're gonna be mine
I know I've never lived before and my heart is very sure
No one else could love you more
(musical interlude)
More than you'll ever know , my arms they long to hold you so
My life will be in your keeping, waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping
Longer than always is a long long time, but far beyond forever you'll be mine
I know that I've never lived before and my heart is very sure
No one else could love you more, no one else could love you more
Ladies and gentlemen you are on Cloud 9 Airways. Please buckle your seatbelts and stay seated. Our departure will be around 4:20. Clear skies, sunny days. We are ready for takeoff. We have a go

Wasn't much to do, I dipped outta school
Had to play it cool, I lit up that blue
And then I flew away, in the middle of the day
Man I gotta leave, I gotta escape
I can't stick around, gotta fly away
In the middle of the day, in the middle of the day

Look
Brain's at my window pane, it feels like I'm livin in a video game
But ain't nothing changed, cause it's the middle of the day
Look
I said I'm puffin with my kin folk, gone off that endo
Just doin that same old thing, with the same old gang
So can't nothin change

Look
Every day the time goes by, passin me by
Paranoia on my mind, but I don't know why
Somethin bout the times when I'm at the bank standin in line
Don't say much, keep a straight face
If I say somethin I'm crazy
I think the government's onto me, onto me
Wasn't much to do, I dipped outta school
Had to play it cool, I lit up that blue
And then I flew away, in the middle of the day
Man I gotta leave, I gotta escape
I can't stick around, gotta fly away
In the middle of the day, in the middle of the day

Well I done sacrificed a lot
Just to get this rappin life to pop
Meditatin on that after life
And if a tragic happens then I pass my life to stop
Cause a brand new life's beginning
But I ain't intending for it to be tremendous like this
The old one I had is ending, so so long I'm finished

Face to the floor getting so frustrated
Tryin to figure out the right words to say
It's me and the clock I feel like I'm racin
Nobody knows the trouble I'm facin
Man I'm sick of waitin, gettin impatient
Watchin my life unfold the pages
Ain't nothin much I can do to stop it
That's why I'm blazin

Every day the time goes by, passin me by
Paranoia on my mind, but I don't know why
Somethin bout the times when I'm at the bank standin in line
Don't say much, keep a straight face
If I say somethin I'm crazy
I think the government's onto me, onto me
Wasn't much to do, I dipped outta school
Had to play it cool, I lit up that blue
And then I flew away, in the middle of the day
Man I gotta leave, I gotta escape
I can't stick around, gotta fly away
In the middle of the day, in the middle of the day

This is your captain speaking for Cloud 9 Airways. We are now approaching our initial decent. We'd like to ask all our passengers to remain seated and buckled tightly. All those passengers who wish to continue flight for infinity, please report to first class for your frequent flyer miles

Wasn't much to do, I dipped outta school
Had to play it cool, I lit up that blue
And then I flew away, in the middle of the day
Man I gotta leave, I gotta escape
I can't stick around, gotta fly away
In the middle of the day, in the middle of the day

[Verse 1]
Once she had drowned and started her slow descent
Down the streams to where the great rivers broaden
Oh, the open sky shone most magnificent
As if it was acting as her body's guardian
Wreck and duck weed slowly increased her weight
By clasping her in their slimy grip
Through her limbs, the cold blooded fishes played
Creatures and plant life kept on, thus obstructing her last trip

[Verse 2]
And the sky that same evening grew dark as smoke
And its stars through the night kept the brightness still soaring
But it quickly grew clear when dawn now broke
To see that she got one further morning
Once her pallid trunk had rotted beyond repair
It happened quite slowly that she gently slipped from God's thoughts
First with her face, then her hands, right at the last with her hair
Leaving those corpse-choked rivers just one more corpse
Comment (If All Men Are Truly Brothers)
Originally by Charles Wright
Watch out for your friends
Well they may lose in the end
Sometimes their child can make you sin
What is a man without a friend?
We all live within a game
The word 'excuse' has many names
Where true friends really come
You can't afford to lose one
If all men were truly brothers
Why then do we hurt one another?
Love and peace from ocean to ocean
Somebody please second my emotion!
All men were born to be free, yeah
What about you? And what about me?
This world is filled with hate!
There's nothing left
If you enslave me, you'll never rescue yourself
Well jealousy, as I recall
Has always been man's hardest fall
To conquer fear, well that's quite a quest
Until we do never rest
A child was born yesterday
Nothing but an innocent babe
Someone sowed a bitter seed
How could it grow but a bitter weed?
Society, how can you teach
If you don't practice what you preach?
If all men were truly brothers
Why then, can't we love one another?
Love and peace from ocean to ocean
Somebody please second my emotion!
All men were born to be free, yeah
What about you? What about me?
This world is filled with hate!
There's nothing left
If you enslave me, you'll only hurt yourself
Hey you! Over there!
I want to know why you left
With all your riches and your fancy things
Can you tell me how many friends can you truly say you have?
The wind is the whisper of our mother the Earth
The wind is the hand of our father the sky
The wind watches over our struggles and pleasures
The wind is the goddess who first learned to fly

The wind is the bearer of bad and good tidings
Weaver of darkness, bringer of dawn
The wind gives the rain (yes), and builds us a rainbow
The wind is the singer who sang the first song
The wind is a twister of anger and warning

The wind brings the fragrence of freshly mown hay
The wind is the racer and the white stallion running
And the sweet taste of love on a slow summer's day
The wind knows the songs of cities and canyons

Thunder of mountains, the roar of the sea
The wind is the taker and giver of mornings
The wind is the symbol of all that is free
So welcome the wind and the wisdom she offers
Follow her summons when she calls again
In your heart and your spirit let the breezes surround you
Lift up your voice then and sing with the wind
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

(One)
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late
(Huh, huh, huh, huh)

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah
Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah ah

I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on
Empty pages before my eyes, you not deny or criticize
Empty bedrooms where I paid my dues
Watching the ceiling instead of you
Can you tell me where you're goin', can't hold on to hear my song
I've got some songs I'd love to sing
Always bring down some other thing
Where can I go my hands are broken
It seems like your love is just a token, why won't you stay with me?
Up in the morning and out the door
She won't come in I gotta live alone
Back in the evening with the darn poor fool out
I got on mind just this gal, just this gal
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams will take you very far
But, when you wish upon a dream
Life ain't always what it seems
What'd you see on night so clear
In the sky so very dear

You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be

You can be what you wanna be
Do what you wanna do
As long as you know there's a star in you

Believe in yourself

Shining star come in to view
Shine its watchful light on you
Gives you strength to carry on
Makes your body big and strong
On an adventure of the Son (that's S-o-n)
Thought my work had just begun
Found out, found out
Thought I had to stir the mood
I can do all things through You

So, if you find yourself in need
Why don't you listen to these words of heed
Be a child that's free of sin
These are words of wisdom
"Yes I can, yes I can," because
Oh no matter what you say baby
No matter what you do
The way you've been treating me woman
Is coming back home to you
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you baby
Oh, crying won't help you woman
'Cause you've been so mean to me

Oh, you must remember baby
No matter where you go
Watch those seeds just scatter woman
Because you're gonna reap just what you sow
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you now
Oh, crying won't help you baby
'Cause you been so mean to me

Oh, the way you've been treating me woman
Just can't understand
Oh, I'm gonna leave you woman
Let you do the best you can
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you now
Oh, crying won't help you woman
'Cause you been so mean to me
Look out!
Oh, just before I leave you woman
Just before I shake your hand
I'm gonna get me a woman baby
Not to get your mad
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you now
Oh, crying won't help you baby
'Cause you been so mean to me
No, Rock and Roll, this is how you do rock n' roll
Rockin' Ruby
Here's how you sing it

Well now I gotta girl now and Ruby is her name

Ruby Ruby Ruby Baby
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Forgot it
What are you gonna do now?

Aba zaba aba zaba zaba doo
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Baby
You always forget the words, every time

[Verse]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Bridge]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Chorus]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Though, it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

[Piano Solo: Diana Krall]

[Guitar Solo: John Pizzarelli]

[Chorus]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Though, it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you
The world is full of indisputables (with whom all of us share reality)
The world is in fact just that (a long indisputable and rich tradition)
The world I know of I'm extrusive (to be jealous is to conform)
Not the only one, a nominal thing, the law of division
Jealousy will make you suffer (from being excluded from the universal)
Jealousy will make you suffer (from being crazy from being a woman)
Not the only one, a nominal thing
The law of division, not the only one

The world is full of indisputables (with whom all of us share reality)
The world is in fact just that (a long indisputable and rich tradition)
Not the only one, a nominal thing, the law of division
Jealousy will make you suffer (from being excluded from the universal)
Jealousy will make you suffer (from being crazy from being a woman)
Not the only one, a nominal thing
The law of division, not the only one, the only one
I need your love so badly
I love you oh so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
I thought at last I found you
But other loves surround you
And I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you

If you'd surrender
Just for a tender
Kiss or two
You might discover
That I'm the lover
Meant for you
And I'd be true

But what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming
For I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
What's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming
'cause I don't stand
A ghost of a chance
With you

[Intro: Adam Levine]
Yeah, yeah
Oh

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
Oh, I've been there before
But that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Some people search for a fountain
Promises forever young, wait
Some people need three dozen roses
Uh, and that's the only way to prove you love them, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be? Oh
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you

[Outro: Adam Levine]
If I ain't got you with me, baby
'Cause there ain't nothing in this whole wide world
Doesn't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby, yeah
Yeah! We love you, Alicia Keys
Oh, oh. op-bo, bo, bo-bo-bo!
Oh, oh. op-bo, bo, bo-bo-bo!
Yes, me friend, me friend

But through the powers of the Most-'Igh
They've got to turn me loose...Mm!

(Dem set me free again.)
Oo-oo-ooh, yea-eah. Mm-mm
Bars could not hold me
I get so weary every time the sun goes down
I get so weary in the evening when the sun goes down
I get so lonesome when my baby's not around

When I go to bed at night, and the birds began to call
When I go to bed at night, and the birds began to call
I am here so sad and lonely for my baby
And that ain't all

When I get up in the morning just before the break of day
Oh, I get up in the morning just before the break of day
Thinking about my baby
But I know she's on her way
Oh no matter what you say baby
No matter what you do
The way you've been treating me woman
Is coming back home to you
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you baby
Oh, crying won't help you woman
'Cause you've been so mean to me

Oh, you must remember baby
No matter where you go
Watch those seeds just scatter woman
Because you're gonna reap just what you sow
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you now
Oh, crying won't help you baby
'Cause you been so mean to me

Oh, the way you've been treating me woman
Just can't understand
Oh, I'm gonna leave you woman
Let you do the best you can
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you now
Oh, crying won't help you woman
'Cause you been so mean to me
Look out!
Oh, just before I leave you woman
Just before I shake your hand
I'm gonna get me a woman baby
Not to get your mad
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you now
Oh, crying won't help you baby
'Cause you been so mean to me

[Verse 1]
As the bitter tears fall from your eyes
Oh, a thousand times you ask yourself why
The one guy you loved has departed
And you're left alone and brokenhearted
Girl, love just comes and it goes
How long it's gonna last, nobody knows

[Chorus]
Girl, that's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, That's the way love is)

[Verse 2]
I know you're walkin' down a lonesome road
And your heart is carryin' a heavy load
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend
Oh, and your whole world's cavin' in
But now, it's time to be strong
You've gotta forget him now that's he's gone

[Chorus]
And just remember, that's the way, love is (that's the way love is)

[Verse 3]
Love can be a hurting thing
Or it can be warm as warm as a breath of spring
When love is present everything's alright
But when it's gone, you toss and turn all night
Now, listen girl
Oh, I know love gets rough sometimes
But don't let it get the best of you
Girl, I've been hurt by love, yeah, yes I have
So I know just what you're goin' through
Oh, you wish that you were never born
Oh You'll forget him one that he's gone

[Chorus]
And just remember
That's the way love is
That's the way (That's the way love is)
Oh, that's the way love is, honey
(That's the way love is)

[Outro]
Love is here today and gone tomorrow
All your joy turns to sorrow
One day gladness - the next day sadness
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
When you squeeze me baby
You make me hollar whoa whoa whoa
When you squeeze me baby
You make me hollar whoa whoa whoa
That get my mind
Now what are you doin' to me

You a good lookin' woman
Just as sweet as you can be
You a good lookin' woman
Just as sweet as you can be
That get my mind
Now what are you doin' to me

Now when you squeeze me baby
You make me hollar whoa whoa whoa
When you squeeze me baby
You make me hollar whoa whoa whoa
That get my mind
Now what are you tryin' to do to me
I said you a good lookin' woman
Just as sweet as you can be
You a good lookin' woman
Just as sweet as you can be
That get my mind
Now what are you tryin' to do to me
Baby lights her cigarette
And takes a look around
She says that morning sun
Sure does get her down
Nothing else to see
Just to help her lose
Those happy birthday blues

Grandpa takes a drink of wine
And tells it like it was
Tells me all he wants to do
Is what everybody does
Say he'd give the world
For a little girl
Just to help him lose
Those happy birthday blues

Happy birthday blues
Happy birthday blues
Got to pay your dues
Those happy birthday blues
In and out and on and on
Everybody goes
And where the fun with finally stops
Everybody knows
Girls it's me and you
Doing what we do
Just one way to lose
Those happy birthday blues

[Hook]
I got a iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
I scratch off on a bitch it's nothing to me
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
I scratch off on a bitch it's nothing to me

[Verse 1]
I got a iced out bart where my heart at
Got multi colored diamond clothing
Shorty it's all that
New pinky ring
Zay, What do you call dat?
I call it Smurfette
Papa Smurf is the bracelet
VVS very very slight flawsless
$20, 000 just to get every stone set
Call my ex girl and she ain't hung that phone yet
I hit her best friend now she screaming she upset
Better watch out cause your girlfriend Nicole next
See I got a iced out bart where my heart at
She started it
Bitch did'nt know how hard the kid did what he did just to feed this damn bitch (It's Gucci)

[Hook]
I got a iced out bart where my heart used to be

A iced out bart where my heart used to be
I scratch off on a bitch it's nothing to me
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
I scratch off on a bitch it's nothing to me

[Verse 2]
I put a diamond in the place of my heart, Zay
Even Jay-Z fell in love with Beyonce'
So, Niggas like me will fuck a hoe on the first date
Then scratch couple hundreds... It's nothing
I keep a bank roll ask your friend am I bluffin'
She den turn you on to the dick cause she cuffin'
She blushin'... Cause she know It's Gucci LaFlare
And when you got something good you wanna keep it to yourself (It's Gucci)

[Hook]

A iced out bart where my heart used to be
I scratch off on a bitch it's nothing to me
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
I scratch off on a bitch it's nothing to me
Look at me
I don't know what I'm doing
Ever since I looked at you
How did I get this crazy feeling?
Could it be I'm in love with you?

Ever since I saw you in the moonlight
I've had this feeling through and through
Since that time, I haven't done a thing right
Could it be I'm in love with you?

Oh golly gee
I don't know where I'm going
I'm trying to make you see
Oh boy, I got to make her fall in love with me

Oh, night after night, I'm always dreaming
Why don't you make those dreams come true?
Can't you see how much I really love you?
Why don't you learn to love me too?
Oh golly gee
I don't know where I'm going
I'm trying to make you see
Oh boy, I got to make her fall in love with me

Oh, night after night, I'm always dreaming
Why don't you make those dreams come true?
Can't you see how much I really love you?
Why don't you learn to love me too?
Love me too
Love me too

[Verse 1]
Street cars always get in the way
Daylight interrupts our starry gaze
She goes seems we ran out of time
But the memory left a picture on the canvas of my mind

[Chorus]
So I'll wrap myself in the thought of her smell
Wish of our lips
Locked in a kiss
She floats in to my bedroom every night
Close my eyes
She's alive
Here comes the morning but I'm all alone
Dreams of a love I'll call my own
Dreams of a love I've never known

[Verse 2]
New day, same hot sun on the street
And I say I wonder if we'll ever meet
There she goes
Taxi steals her way
I keep tellin myself I'll find her love
I come back everyday

[Chorus]
I still wrap myself in the thought of her smell
Wish of our lips
Locked in a kiss
She floats in to my bedroom every night
I close my eyes
She's alive
Here comes the morning but I'm all alone
Dreams of a love I'll call my own
Dreams of a love I've never known

[Verse 3]
Dreams of her love
Will they ever come true?
Am I a fool to dream of you?
You float in to my bedroom every night
I close my eyes and your alive
Here comes the morning and I'm still alone
Dreams of her love I'll call my own
Dreams of her love I've never known
Dreams of her love I'll call my own
Dreams of her love I've never known
SNIPPET:

[Intro: will.i.am]
This is awesome (4x)
Yeah, you know it
It's the boss
I know you know it
So sing a chorus

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Baby (7x)
This is Awesome
And you know it
This is Awesome
And you know it
This is Awesome
And you know it
This is Awesome
Baby

[Verse ?: will.i.am]
I'm ballin', baby baby i'm ballin'
Got phone on my wrist when i'm rockin' like this
I can see who callin'
And you know it
I don't be stallin
I be installin
I'm being stolen
I feel like Jordan takin' flight
I'm boardin' (And you know it)
Can't touch me now (Can't touch me now)
Can't stop me now (Can't stop me now)
I go all in
I go to her like oh my god
Oh my lordy, Oh my goodness
Lordy, mercy, You just watch me
Watch me like a movie
I'm too Gucci - Awesome!

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Baby (7x)
This is Awesome
And you know it

[Verse 1]
Never been a woman
But I know the pain
The pain of labor
And the warpath of age
Been with so many
Yet none have seen through
Despite their intuition
The extent of the ruse
Oh, yeah, I've never been a woman

[Verse 2]
Why must I befriend each
And every girl?
I meet in the lively lit bars of
This dying dark world
I'm doped up on laughter
They always oblige
This emptiness in me
With wet, glassy eyes
Oh, yeah, I've never been a woman
But they've given me my life

[Verse 3]
True love bears nothing
In common with this
This constant amusement
Some ceaseless caress
Yet I accept nothing
No price could be paid
For the occasional miracle
With Marissa or Jane
Oh, now, I've never been a woman

[Verse 4]
My time here is so brief
And I cannot pretend
That I can sustain you
Like this 'til the end
Don't lie to the ladies
It does not take words
All it takes is an inkling
That you, they can cure
Oh, now, I've never been a woman
That much is sure

[Verse 5]
Wandering hunger
Old and corrupt
Lays waiting each moment
While you tend, while you selflessly touch
Satisfy and sate her
The only one in the room I can see
Who's really being pleasured
Is me, is me, is me
Oh, now, I've never been a woman
But I have known pain

[Verse 1]
Oh, honeybear, honeybear, honeybear
Mascara, blood, ash and cum
On the Rorschach sheets where we make love
Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear
You fuck the world damn straight malaise
It may be just us who feel this way
But don't ever doubt this, my steadfast conviction
My love, you're the one I want to watch the ship go down with
The future can't be real, I barely know how long a moment is
Unless we're naked, getting high on the mattress
While the global market crashes
As death fills the streets we're garden-variety oblivious
You grab my hand and say in an "I told you so" voice:
"It’s just how we expected"

[Chorus]
Everything is doomed
And nothing will be spared
But I love you, honeybear
Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear

[Verse 2]
You're bent over the altar
And the neighbors are complaining
That the misanthropes next door
Are probably conceiving a Damien
Don't they see the darkness rising?
Good luck fingering oblivion
We're getting out now while we can
You're welcome boys, have the last of the smokes and chicken
Just one Cadillac will do to get us out to where we're going
I've brought my mother's depression
You've got your father's scorn and a wayward aunt's schizophrenia

[Chorus]
But everything is fine
Don't give into despair
Cause I love you, honeybear
Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear

[Verse 1]
You're being took for a ride
Pulling all the lazies

[Chorus]
Please keep moving
Better keep moving

[Verse 2]
Don't fall asleep at the wheel
I waited for you but you never came
(Can't you stop the children screaming)

[Chorus]
Please keep moving
Better keep moving

[Outro]
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Please keep moving
Better keep moving
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic

[Verse 1]
Over and over and over again
The tide carries
I give up my water and watch you sink in
Oh, the levy

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the coastline
Breaks
You hide in the fallen
Waves

[Chorus]
On the rise and the sights of typhoon (Red and blue)
Washing by
And the rise falling in too (We fall through)
Holding tight

And the dull effects of your suitcase
Are casting again...

[Verse 2]
Over and over and over again
(Oh the sun, oh the sun)
I give her my water and watch you sink in
(Oh mama, oh mama)

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the coastline
Breaks
You hide in the fallen
Waves

[Chorus]
On the rise and the sights of typhoon (Red and blue)
Washing by
And the rise falling in too (We fall through)
Holding tight

And the dull effects of your suitcase
Are casting again...

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
On the rise and the sights of typhoon...

[Chorus]
On the rise and the sights of typhoon (Red and blue)
Washing by
And the rise falling in too (We fall through)
Holding tight

And the dull effects of your suitcase
Are casting again...

[Verse 1: Rihanna with Chris Brown]
Baby, you don't need to be scared of me, I guarantee that I'm not a mistake
I'ma give you all of my love and I hope that you won't misplace it
You created this shit, going insane with all this fear
Can't turn my back on it, I'm in love, I gotta face it

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You're the only one I wanna stay on the phone with
Ooh, the late night Skype sex, on that young shit
Girl, you keep it one hunnid, always gon' hold me down
You know you're the number one, girl, I'ma work you out

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown with Rihanna]
Ain't got much to say, I ain't about to make you wait
I'm just gon' take you from here, girl, let's ride away (Away)
Let's elevate, just elevate
Yeah, girl, let me take you for a ride

[Chorus: Chris Brown with Rihanna]
Baby, let me change your life, promise it will be alright
Baby, take my hand tonight, let me set you free now
Sweating like a waterbed on me, keep putting that thang on me
Like you never did before, I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, right there, right there, right there
Put it up right there, I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, put it up right there, I love, I love you
I'm gon' explore all of your body (Girl, I'ma do it all for you)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown with Rihanna]
I'ma write my name with my tongue on your back, baby
Come on, just let me, I know you're ready
And even if there is a crowd, let 'em see it
I'ma give you some more
Just let 'em all just say what they wanna say, that's how I feel, 'cause I'm in love
And the temperature just heats up when I'm with you
Don't be scared, when I start to go down and I lick you
Rubbing and kissing and licking on your body when I go down and oh, I'm gon' miss you
And I need your body right now 'cause I know it's an issue
And I'm hyperventilating right now, I can't breathe if I ain't with you
I need your body like right now, I need your body like right now
Lay your head, on my bed, baby, tell me if you want the lights down
Your property, treat me like I'm your property
Do what you wanna, take command, I'm about to be your biggest fan
Your property, treat me like I'm your property
Do what you wanna, take command, I'm about to be your biggest fan (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown with Rihanna]
Baby, let me change your life, promise it will be alright
Baby, take my hand tonight, let me set you free now
Sweating like a waterbed on me, keep putting that thang on me
Like you never did before, I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, right there (Oh girl, oh girl), right there, right there (Oh girl, oh girl)
Put it up right there, I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there (There), put it up right there (Right there), I love, I love you (I love, I love you)
I'm gon' explore all of your body (Girl, I'ma do it all for you)

[Bridge: Rihanna & Chris Brown]
Looking for too many places
Searching high and low for you, I'm stronger when I'm close to you
I'm seeing all familiar faces
Girl, it's all about you, only you in my life
And I say, "You like playing with my heart?"
Baby, please don't do this to me
'Cause I'm in love, can I get a little bit?
One more kiss? Yeah, 'cause I don't wanna miss it

[Chorus: Chris Brown with Rihanna]
Baby, let me change your life, promise it will be alright
Baby, take my hand tonight, let me set you free now
Sweating like a waterbed on me, keep putting that thang on me
Like you never did before, I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, right there, right there, right there
Put it up right there, I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, put it up right there, I love, I love you
I'm gon' explore all of your body (Girl, I'ma do it all for you)

[Verse 1]
Nobody move, there's blood on the floor
And I can't find my heart
Where did it go? Did I leave it in the cold?
So please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take
It must've fell when I lost my mind
Deep in the cut, drowning it in pain
Somebody help 'cause I can't find my way
Nobody move, nobody move

[Interlude]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ahh-ahh

[Verse 2]
Somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real (Ain't real)
Why in the world would I give my heart to you?
Just to watch you throw it in the trash
I've been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on
Where were you when I needed you the most?
Now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest
A heartless, broken mess

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
La-la-la, la-la
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Boyz II Men]
Come they told me, pa rum pum pum pum
A new born King to see, pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the King, pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, mmm
So, to honor Him, pa rum pum pum pum
When we come

[Verse 2: Boyz II Men]
Little Baby, pa rum pum pum pum
I am a poor boy, too, pa rum pum pum pum
I have no gift to bring, pa rum pum pum pum
That's fit to give our King, pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
Shall I play for you, pa rum pum pum pum
On my drum?

[Interlude: Wanya Morris]
Now, when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea
In the days of Herod the king
Behold, there came Wise Men from the east in Jerusalem
Saying, "Where is he that is born king of Jews?
We have seen his star in the east and have come to worship Him"

[Verse 3: Boyz II Men]
Mary nodded, pa rum pum pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pum pum pum
I played my drum for Him, pa rum pum pum pum
I played my best for Him, pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
Then He smiled at me, pa rum pum pum pum
Me and my drum

[Outro: Nathan Morris]
And when they were coming to the house
They saw the young child with Mary, His mother
And fell down and worshipped Him
And when they had opened their treasures
They presented to Him gifts: gold, and frankinscence, and myrrh
All good things to come, all good things to come, will come, welcome
All good things to come, all good things to come
All good things to come, will come, welcome
All good things to come, will come, welcome
All good things to come, all good things to come
All good things to come, will come, welcome
All good things to come, all good things to come
All good things to come, will come, welcome
All good things to come, will come, welcome, all good things to come

I love the looks of you, the lure of you
The sweet of you, and the pure of you
The eyes, the arms, and the mouth of you
The east, west, north, and (the / that) south of you

I'd love to gain complete control of you
(And) Handle even the heart and soul of you
Love at least a small percent of me, do
Because I love all of you

I'd love to gain complete control of you
(And) Handle even the heart and soul of you
Love at least a small percent of me, do
Because I love all of you

Rosaleem of the Damascene
Yes, she had eyes like the moon
Would have been on the silver screen
But for the missile monsoon
She went, woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
Indigo up in heaven today
Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom
Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Baba would go where the flowers grow
Almond and peach trees in bloom
And he would know just when and what to sow
So golden and opportune
He went, woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
Tulips the colour of honey today
It's true true, woo woo oo-oo-oo
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom
He say

Boom boom ka, buba de ka

Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June
We stood beneath an amber moon
And softly murmured "Someday soon"
We kissed and clung together

Then, tomorrow was another day
The morning found me miles away
With still a million things to say
Now, when twilight dims the skies above
Recalling thrills of our love
There's one thing I'm certain of
Return, I will, to old Brazil

Then, tomorrow was another day
The morning found me miles away
With still a million things to say
Now, when twilight dims the sky above
Recalling thrills of our love
There's one thing that I'm certain of
Return, I will, to old Brazil
That old Brazil
Man, it's old in Brazil
Brazil, Brazil
Why can't you behave? Oh, why can't you behave?
After all the things you told me, and those promises that you gave
Oh, why can't you behave?
Why can't you be good? And do just as you should?
Won't you turn that new leaf over, so your baby can be your slave?
Oh, why can't you behave?
There's a farm I know near my old home town
Where we two can go and try settling down
There I'll care for you forever, 'cause you're all in the world I crave
But baby, why can't you behave?
I said I'll care for you forever, 'cause you're all in the world I crave
But why, why can't you behave?
Baby, I'm all confused
A child
That hides behind a chair
Almost afraid to grow
Without you there
Whisper words that make you see
What you've come to mean to me

A voice
That rises from the heart
The hunger that seizes me
And tears my soul apart
And serving only to renew
How I came to feel for you

Through your love I'd seen
Forever
We became as one
I never saw you turn away
My love was blind
You call me when your storm is over
Crying over love that I can give you
When the night is the colder
Holding on to me
Cos it's so hard letting go
And it's so hard not to cry
With your face that lies
You memorize
The reason why
And when love is gone
Then one of us will know
It's so hard letting go

Foolish that I still believe
That love should never die
It makes me cry to witness
Where the story ends
All the lovers in the world wil
Echo all the words that I will leave you
When the night is lonely
Only goes to show

That it's so hard letting go
And it's so hard not to cry
And I kneel for yesterday
When you were mine
And when the love is gone
Then one of us will know
It's so hard letting go...
I've been gathering flowers from the hillside
To wreath around your brow
But you've kept me a-waitin' so long, dear
The flowers have all withered now

I know that you have seen trouble
But never hang down your head
Your love for me is like the flowers
Your love for me is dead

It was on one bright June morning
The roses were in bloom
I shot and killed my darling
And what will be my doom?

Closed eyes cannot see these roses
Closed hands cannot hold them, you know
And these lips that still cannot kiss me
Has gone from me forever more
It's funny how you loved me
Then forgot so suddenly
It's funny to everyone but me
(It's the talk of the town)

They told me this would happen
Now they're laughing secretly
It's funny to everyone but me
(Got me crying again)

I should shrug my shoulders and say
Good riddance to a bad affair
But how can I do what my head tells me to
When my heart tells me how much I care

It's so funny, I still love you
It's the joke of the century
It's funny to everyone but me
(I got a right to sing the blues)

It's so funny, I still love you
It's the joke of the century
Ah, but it's funny to everyone but me

[Intro]
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six
Five, four, three, two, one
(Injection Fellas)

[Chorus]
Uh (Uh), ah (Ah)
Uh, ah (I understand what you feel)
Uh, ah
Uh, ah
(Mike?) Yes?

[Verse 1]
The love I have right next to me
Is here and always will be
I'm caressing your body emotionally
As you can feel and will see
Why can't we go all the way to the top?
The fullest extreme
The sounds I hear when you're with me
Express the way that you feel, girl (As you say)

[Chorus]
Uh, ah
Uh, ah (Oh, that's it)
Uh, ah
Uh, ah (Oh, don't stop)
(Oh)

[Verse 2]
In a passionate sense, we move in close
The love that we share is the same
I can tell when I reach down deep inside
You show it when you call out my name
Squeezing you tight and holding you close
Is all I feel inside
Although I try to hold in my love
It's something that I just can't hide

[Chorus]
Uh, ah
Uh, ah
Uh, ah (Yeah)
Uh, ah (Uh, uh, oh)
Uh, ah (Uh, uh)
Uh, ah (Oh-oh)
Uh, ah (Uh, hey)
Uh, ah
(Ooh)

[Bridge]
The music is low, the lights are dim, there we lie
Passion overflows with every look in your eyes
Infatuation, lust, and a lot of love
Sweet caresses, yes, it's good to be as you want
And clench my back, ecstasy fills the air
As you kiss on my neck and stroke the back of my hair
To hold you tonight, I feel this is my duty
To grasp, to hold, to rock that p—

[Chorus]
Uh, ah (Ooh, ah)
Uh, ah (Give it to me, baby, I'll rub your back)
Uh, ah (As you lay here with me, yeah)
Uh, ah (Oh)
Uh, ah (I want you and I need you)
Uh, ah (Hold on to me, yeah)
Uh, ah (Oh)
Uh, ah (Right now, baby)
Uh, ah (Oh, oh)
Uh, ah (Don't go away, please baby, stay with me)
Uh, ah (Oh, I can do it to you)
Uh, ah (The way that nobody else can, babe)
I've travelled all over this world
And now to another I go
And I know I should find good quarters
To wait and welcome Le Beau
Welcome Ol' Roison Le Beau
To welcome Ol' Roison Le Beau
I know how good quarters are waitin'
For to welcome Ol' Roison Le Beau

When I'm dead and laid out on the counter
A voice you will hear from below
Sayin', "Send out a hogshead of whiskey
To drink with Ol' Roison Le Beau"
To drink with Ol' Roison Le Beau
To drink with Ol' Roison Le Beau
Sayin', "Send out a hogshead of whiskey
To drink with Ol' Roison Le Beau"

Then get you half a dozen smart fellows
Let them all stagger an' go
And dig a great hole in the meadow
And in it put Roison Le Beau
And in it put Roison Le Beau
And in it put Roison Le Beau
Go dig you a hole in the meadow
And in it put Roison Le Beau
And get you a half dozen barrels
Put water at me head and me toes
With a diamond ring scratch in upon it
With the name of Ol' Roison Le Beau
With the name of Ol' Roison Le Beau
With the name of Ol' Roison Le Beau
With a diamond ring scratch in upon it
With the name of Ol' Roison Le Beau

I hear that old tyrant approachin'
That cruel remorseless foe
And I lift up me glass in his honor
Take a drink with Ol' Roison Le Beau
Take a drink with Ol' Roison Le Beau
Take a drink with Ol' Roison Le Beau
And I lift up my glass in his honor
Take a drink with Ol' Roison Le Beau
Well Billy Joe told me, said everything's lookin' fine
He's got the place all secured, got the icebox full of wine
He said hurry on over and don't be late
He got three lovely ladies who just won't wait
Do some down south jukin'
And lookin' for a peace of mind

Now put your Sunday pants on, lets get out on on the road
We been workin' all week, and thinkin' its time we let go
I got three fine mamas sittin all alone, gonna sip my wine and get it on
And do some down south jukin'
Lookin' for a peace of mind

Now come Monday morn we'll be headin' out to the field
And we'll be doin our thing for Papa and ol' Uncle Bill
Lord, but come Friday night we'll be headin to town
Tryin' to pick up any woman hanging around
And do some down south jukin'
Lookin' for a peace of mind
My heart belongs to only you
I've never loved as I love you
You set a flame within me burning
A flame to stay within me years

It's just for you I want to live
It's just to you my heart I give
I'll always be your slave, my darling
Through the coming years

There was sometime when I was doubtful
Of this new love affair
But now my mind is no more doubtful
I found my heaven with the help of a prayer

You are the song within my soul
A melody that can grow
I've known for long my heart belongs to
Only you

There was sometime when I was doubtful
Of this new love affair
But now my mind is no more doubtful
I found my heaven with the help of a prayer
You are the song within my soul
A melody that can grow
I've known for long my heart belongs to
Only you

[Verse 1]
Teacher, teacher
I'm really not lovin' you
But you're the teacher
I try to do what you want me to
I know you get lonely
But you gotta know
It wasn't love
Let me tell you honey
I'm just a young boy
Don't think I know it enough

[Chorus]
Teacher, teacher
I don't wanna get an A
Teacher, teacher
There's gotta be a better way

[Verse 2]
I'm sick and tired of makin' plans
Without makin' up my mind
(Make up your mind)
Teacher, teacher
Can't you see I just need a little time
I know you've been cryin'
'Cause you spent the night alone
Well you can cry me a river
Well I don't deliver
We have to do it on the phone

[Chorus]
Teacher, teacher
I don't wanna get an A
Teacher, teacher
There's gotta be a better way

[Break]
(Woohoo, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Teacher, teacher
I'm not really tryin' to get you down
But why should you get used to somebody
Who won't be around
I know you get discouraged
'Cause you wanna get it all the time
But honey I can't let you use my body
The same way you use my mind

[Chorus]
Teacher, teacher
I don't wanna get an A
Teacher, teacher
There's gotta be a better way
Teacher, teacher
I don't wanna get an A
Teacher, teacher
There's gotta be a better way
In this mess
Precious dust
Gather strength, softness
Guard the gods
Guard the judges
Din of geometric chaos
The chaos

What a mess
The precious dust
Gather strength and softness
Guard the gods
Guard the judges
And contort the geometric
The chaos

What a mess
The precious dust
Gather strength, the softness
Guard the gods
The judges
Contort the geometric chaos
The joy to love
To know to learn
Are the essence
Of existence
And so couldn't they
Govern it too?
To open up
(??face to a work??)
The joy to love
To know to learn
Are the essence
Of existence
And so couldn't they
Govern it too?
The joy to love
To open up
My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
"Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may"

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on
Why shouldn't I take a chance when romance passes by?
Why shouldn't I know of love?
Why wait around when each age has a sage who has sung
That upon this earth love is all that is really worth thinking of?

It must be fun, lots of fun
To be sure when day is done
That the hour is coming when you'll be kissed
And then you'll be kissed again

All debutantes say it's good
And every star out in far Hollywood
Seems to give it a try
So why shouldn't I?

All debutantes say it's good
And every star out in far Hollywood
Seems to give it a try
So why shouldn't I?
You said you was hurtin', almost lost your mind
'Cause the man you love, hurts you all the time
But when things go wrong, wrong with you, it hurts me too

You love him a little more, when you ought to love him less
Why pick up behind him and take his best?
'Cause when things go wrong, wrong with you, it hurts me too

You love another man, Oh, but I love you
But you love him darlin', stick to him just about like glue
But when things go wrong, wrong with you, it hurts me too

Well, he better leave you, or you best put him down
Cause you know, I just can't stand to see, see you pushed around
Cause when things go wrong, wrong with you, it hurts me too
I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?

I've been put down
I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved?

When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time

I've been made blue
I've been lied to
When will I be loved?

When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time
Oh, I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?
When will I be loved?
Tell me, when will I be loved?

[Verse 1]
The man oppressed will seem to do the worst
But with all he possesses self preservation comes first
His damnation comes not from burning free
As destruction of the poor is their poverty, is their poverty

[Verse 2]
While oppression is the poor man's choice
Ah, but in this he does rejoice
His burdens, though heavy, he somehow bears
As for his seed, there's only one who cares
There's only one who cares

[Verse 3]
Though his prilgrimage extends, his progresses ascend
But as the prudent one exalts, he is gonna find his faults
But as the wise man sees, he knows, he knows
There's no rest in the west, so to the east he goes
To the east he goes (To the east he goes)
Where he can find peace of mind, oh

[Chorus]
Take me to the subway
Ooh, take me to the subway

[Verse 1]
It ain't far away, but the night is mine
Like it fine, gonna stay
See you in the morning
Gotta rush, get a bus, make a fuss
Gimme some loving in the morning

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, she makes me feel so good
Instant reaction and ready for love
I got no work, no sweat, no strain
I got to make it to the midnight train

[Chorus]
So, take me to the subway, ah
Ooh, take me to the subway

[Verse 2]
Ooh, city-life is bittersweet
I don't care, take me there on the street
Freedom in the city
Gotta ride, going down underground
Watch me slide, loving in the city

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, she makes me so complete
Heavy in love and light on my feet
I got no work, no sweat, no strain
I got to make it to the midnight train

[Chorus]
Take me to the subway, ah-ah
Ooh, take me to the subway
Ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
Ooh, it ain't far away, but the night is mine
Like it fine, gonna stay
See you in the morning
Gotta rush, get a bus, make a fuss
Gimme some loving in the morning

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, she makes me feel so good
Instant reaction and ready for love
I got no work, no sweat, no strain
I got to make it to the midnight train

[Chorus]
So, take me to the subway, ah-ah
Ooh, take me to the subway, ah-ah

[Outro]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)
Hey, hey, hey, hey (Hey)
Hey
My young love said to me:
'My father won't mind
And my mother won't cite you
For your lack of kind.'
Then she drew closer to me
And this she did say:
'It will not be long, long, love
'till our wedding day.'

She stepped away from me
And She Moved Through the Fair
And fondly I watched her
Move here and move there
And then she went homeward
With one star awake
As the swan in the evening, the evening
Moves over the lake

Last night she came to me
She came softly in
So softly she came
That her feet made no din
And she laid her hand on me
And this she did say'
'It will not be long, long, love
'till our wedding day.'
I pray for better days to come
I pray that I would see the sun
Cuz life is so burdensome
When everyday's a rainy one

But suddenly there's no more clouds
I believe without a doubt
That heaven sent an angel down
And then she turned my life around

You know and I know
Friends come and friends go
Storms rise and winds blow
But one thing I know for sure

When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry cuz
I'm so warm inside
You give me peace
When the storm's outside
Cuz we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright it's alright
Oooh...

Now peace is so hard to find
We're terrorized and victimized
But that's when I close my eyes
And think of you to ease my mind
You take me to another place
There's no more war (no more war)
Just love and grace
Baby you restore my faith
I know the struggle's not in vain
You know and I know
Through all the battles
Baghdad to Israel
There's one thing I know for sure

When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry cuz
I'm so warm inside
You give me peace
When the storm's outside
Cuz we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright it's alright

Alright it's alright
Alright it's alright
Alright it's alright
Oh...
When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry cuz
I'm so warm inside
You give me peace
When the storm's outside
Cuz we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright it's alright

Oh it's gonna be alright
Ooh...

Cuz you give me peace
In the middle of the storm
When it's cold you're keeping me warm
It's alright
It's alright
I'm never gonna leave
You give me what I need
It's alright, alright
I was up this mornin', ah, blues walkin' like a man
I was up this mornin', ah, blues walkin' like a man
Worried blues, give me your right hand
And the blues fell mama's child, tore me all upside down
Blues fell mama's child, and it tore me all upside down
Travel on, poor Bob, just can't turn you 'round
The blues, is a low-down shakin' chill, yes, preach 'em now
Is a low-down shakin' chill
You ain't never had 'em I, hope you never will
Well, the blues, is a achin' old heart disease
Do it now, you gon' do it? Tell me all about it
The blues, is a low-down achin' heart disease
Like consumption, killing me by degrees
I can study rain, oh oh drive, oh oh drive my blues
I been studyin' the rain, I'm 'on drive my blues away
Goin' to the 'stil'ry, stay out there all day
M: Keep on lovin' me honey, keep on lovin' me true
T: Baby, I'm gonna love you no matter what you do
M: Just so long as I can have it all, nothin' but you
BOTH: So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
T: 'Cause I would stop right where I stand
M: I'd just be afraid of a man
BOTH: Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe

M: Keep on lovin' me honey, don't you go nowhere
T: Don't you know I'm satisfied with your tender care?
M: And I get my inspiration, darlin', just knowin' you're there
BOTH: So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
T: 'Cause like a leaf out on a tree
M: You've become a part of me
BOTH: Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe

BOTH: Would you take the heavens out of the sky
Imagine what the world would be like if the rivers ran dry
M: Oh Tammi
T: What good am I without you
M: I can't do without you, darlin'
BOTH: Like a sea wihout a shore
Kicking forever more
M: Keep on lovin' me honey, don't you change your mind
T: Sugar, I can't bear the thought of ever leavin' you behind
M: No matter what I do, another you I'll never find
BOTH: So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
T: 'Cause I would stop right where I stand
M: I'd just be afraid of a man
BOTH: Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe
If you leave you might as well take the air I breathe
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause I need your love, I need you so desperately
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
Let me take my time with this one
My baby

Verse 1:
I don't know why the sun shines so brightly when I’m with you
I can’t explain the joy you bring my heart
Every moment I
I spend with you
But at times I’m not for sure on just exactly how you feel
I need an indication to show that love’s for real

Chorus:
Light a candle in the window if you care for me
Burn an everlasting light to prove your love
And if you believe for eternity that we’ll never be apart
Light a candle in the window
Just a sign to show that you’re in love

Verse 2:
Deep in my heart there a grows a love so special, a love deep
While I’m not for sure I should but it feel so good
To have your body right
Right next to me
And I’m not afraid of the choice I’ve made
I made up in my mind
You and me forever until the end of time
Chorus:
Light a candle in the window if you care for me
Burn an everlasting light to prove your love

Bridge:
And I’m not of afraid of the choice I’ve made
I made up in my mind
Light a candle in the window
Light a candle in the window
Just a sign so show that you’re in love
Shine a light down on me
Shine a light down on me
Shine on
Shine on
Light a candle in the window for my love
Light a candle in the window for my love
One night farmer Brown was takin' the air
Locked up the barnyard with the greatest of care
Down in the hen house something stirred
When he shouted, "Who's there?"
This is what he heard
There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So calm yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
We chickens tryin' to sleep and you butt in
And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble, with your chin
There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
You're stompin' around and shakin' the ground
Kicking up an awful dust
We chickens tryin' to sleep and you butt in
And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble, it's a sin

Tomorrow is a busy day
We got things to do, we got eggs to lay
We got ground to dig and worms to scratch
It takes a lot of sittin', gettin' chicks to hatch
Oh, there ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So quiet yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
Kindly point the gun the other way
And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble off and hit the hay
Tomorrow is a busy day
We got things to do, we got eggs to lay
We got ground to dig and worms to scratch
It takes a lot of sittin', gettin' chicks to hatch
Oh, there ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So quiet yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
Kindly point the gun the other way
And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble off and hit the hay

Hey, hey boss man, what do you say?
It's easy, pickins, there ain't nobody here but us chickens
I was on my way to you and I was worried
I was all torn up and nervous cause I knew that you'd be gone
I knocked and crossed my fingers while I waited
And I couldn't hold the teardrops when I walked away alone

It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed it's all over
Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed it's all over
Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go

I'd been runnin' 'round in circles like a baby
I was in a daze because I loved you so, I couldn't see
I was broken in a million little pieces
When I saw enough to realize, you didn't care for me

It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed
Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
It's all over, it's all over, so forget her
Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go, let her go, boy
Let her go

[Verse 1]
From the sky would fall an incessant rain of bombs
We had nowhere to go but retrieve underground
All the ground had been peppered with a load of mines
Growing our own food was a risk at any time
The sudden brutality we had to confront
Forced us many years to a life into the ground
When
I came out
After having hidden
For so long under

[Verse 2]
I found I was missing all sensation of sight
It was so dark underground we had seen no light for days
What was visible how there was the enemy
The fact that they were fighting against their better nature
Our voices had been buried to breathe arise
For we had not to speak a word for days on end
But
What we learned
Was so strong
They could never win
They're wrong

[Chorus]
Scared of Adolf
The right to kill
They went nowhere
Had no wisdom
Humiliation
Came back flying
Into their face
They lost themselves
The right to kill
Scared of Adolf
Right to be blind
Nothing but trust

[Outro]
Scared of Adolf
The right to kill
They went nowhere
Had no wisdom
Humiliation
Came back flying
Into their face
They lost themselves
The right to kill
Scared of Adolf
Right to be blind
To be nothing
It rained all the way to Cincinnati
With our mattress on top of the car
Us kids were eatin' crackers and baloney
And papa kept on driving never stopped once at a bar
Then mama started talking about Jesus
And how our lives could be from now on
While papa bought a used tire in Columbus
Mama rocked the baby till all her tears were gone

She said your papa is a good man and don't you kids forget it
The whiskey's tryin' to ruin him but I know the Lord won't let it
Then we sang Amazing Grace and Bringing In The Sheaves
Rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me

I remember when papa finally gave up drinking
I think mama was the only one on earth that really thought he could
I remember all the times we'd packed everything we owned
Into some old car and started out for some new town
And through it all mama's faith was the one thing
That was strong enough to finally do the some good
She said your papa is a good man and don't you kids forget it
The whiskey's tryin' to ruin him but I know the Lord won't let it
Then we sang Amazing Grace and Bringing In The Sheaves
Rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me
How glad the many millions of Annabelles and Lillians
Would be to capture me
But you had such persistence, you wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell

I'm your big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never never know
It's not that I’m attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and night-time hear me sigh
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush on you
Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage
That we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you
So far this love is delightful
The face of seduction was you
But I listened for each and every footstep
In this Real Cool World

Questioning saintlike and fantastic heroes
Feeling like lost little children in fabled lands
So I listen for each and every friendship
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Starry-eyed life but somehow believing in nothing
You whisper sweet nothing but reading between your lines
I listen color me doubtful
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World
You came from nowhere
You came from nowhere
You held me you shook me
Hey

It's a Cool World
It's a Cool World

It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Mmmm
Real Cool World

[Verse 1]
We've got nothing left to lose but limousines and attitudes
Yeah, we're banking on us
Oh, baby, it's crazy
We've got nothing left to make but icing on this little cake
Fashion sense and vanity consume us, 'cause we...

[Chorus]
We want that Kandy Life
For me, I'd like that Kandy Life
Could we get a taste of that Kandy Life?
I know our style might be abridged
But we are the ones, bitch

[Verse 2]
We got sour grapes to fry to limit this credit card life
We're banking on hits
Oh, baby, it's crazy
We've got nothing left to lose but reservations and good booze
Copy me, celebrities consume us, 'cause we...

[Chorus]
We want that Kandy Life
For me, I'd like that Kandy Life
Could we get a taste of that Kandy Life?
I know our style might be abridged
But we are the ones, bitch

[Bridge]
I say change your pants
And meet me in the bathroom for a private tour and dance
We'll share our candy
I'm not your buddy, baby
Vanity's for me
Copy me, 'cause we...

[Chorus]
We want that Kandy Life
For me, I'd like that Kandy Life
Could we get a taste of that Kandy Life?
I know our style might be abridged
But we are the ones, bitch
As I was slowly passing
An orphan's home one day
I stopped for just a little while
To watch the children play
Alone a boy was standing
And when I asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see
And he began to cry

I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
Just like the flowers
I'm growing wild
I got no mummy's kisses
I got no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's child

No mummy's arms to hold me
Or sue me when I cry
'cos sometimes I feel so lonesome
I wish that I could die
I'll walk the streets of heaven
Where all blinds can see
And just like for the other kids
It will be a home for me

I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
Just like the flowers
I'm growing wild
I got no mummy's kisses
I got no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's child

[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Into my life you brought a glowin' love
Like a ray of sunshine from up above, ha!
One day out of the clear blue sky
You darkened my world with the words good-bye
That's the day you left me for a stranger, yeah, baby, baby
When you left my life you've gone and you changed, ah
Baby, I'm-a tellin' you it
Ain't no sun since you been gone, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Theres a big black cloud hanging over my head
It's a cloud of loneliness and I feel like I'm dead, ha
Ain't no flowers bloomin' down at the shore
Since you chose to love me no more
I guess you know you took my sunshine away from me, baby, ya did
Girl, you took the light from my world, crushed my dreams and I don't mean maybe, yeah

[Refrain]
And I'm-a tellin' you there
Ain't no sun since you been gone gone gone gone gone

[Bridge]
My future, my future was as bright as the sun, yes it was, baby, oh yeah
I ain't got no future now that you're gone, gone, gone, gone

[Chorus]
Ahh, I guess you know you took my sunshine away from me, baby
(Took away my sunshine)
Girl, you took the light from my world, crushed my dreams and I don't mean maybe
(Took away my sunshine)

[Verse 3]
Aww baby it seems like night in the middle of the day
Everything around me is faded and grey
Cold are the days, dark creeps the night
Never bringing you back into my life
And there ain't no sun since you been gone, gone, gone, gone

[Outro]
(Ain't no sun since you been gone)
Ain't no sun, ain't no sun
Its just a dark, lonely world without you girl
It's so dark
Ain't no sun, I can't see it shining, baby
It's just a dark lonely world without you
Got to, got to have that sun, baby
And you say that the battle is over
And you say that the war is all done
Go tell it to those
With the wind in their nose
Who run from the sound of the gun

And write it on the sides
Of the great whaling ships
Or on ice floes where conscience is tossed
With the wind in their eyes
It is they who must die
And it's we who must measure the loss

And you say that the battle is over
And finally the world is at peace
You mean no one is dying
And mothers don't weep
Or it's not in the papers at least

There are those who would deal
In the darkness of life
There are those who would tear down the sun
And most men are ruthless
But some will still weep
When the gifts we were given are gone
Now the blame cannot fall
On the heads of a few
It's become such a part of the race
It's eternally tragic
That that which is magic
Be killed at the end of the glorious chase

From young seals to great whales
From waters to wood
They will fall just like weeds in the wind
With fur coats and perfumes
And trophies on walls
What a hell of a race to call men

And you say that the battle is over
And you say that the war is all done
Go tell it to those
With the wind in their nose
Who run from the sound of the gun

And write it on the sides
Of the great whaling ships
Or on ice floes where conscience is tossed
With the wind in their eyes
It is they who must die
And it's we who must measure the loss
With the wind in their eyes
It is they who must die
And it's we who must measure the cost
Hey gypsy boy
Where do you come from
From the land of the new rising sun
Hey gypsy boy
Where do you plan to go to
I’m gonna spread a lot of love
And my piece of my mind too
One day I’ll come along
I’ll come along
Many lovers has come, and
Many lovers have gone
Similar to an old fashion song
(A thousand years from now we'll be still putting it down my baby)
You can change the frame
But the picture remains the same
Similar to the sun after the rain
(A thousand years from now we'll be still putting it down my baby)
Baby girl in other words for ever more

Step in the name of love, step in the name of love (step from side to side)
Groove in the name of love, groove in the name of love (Groove and it's alright)
Some believes in love
And some people don't
Similar to a story, when it's told
(A thousand years from now we'll be still putting it down my baby)
Some have crossed the finish line and some gave up
It's like moving a mountain
Love can be just that tough yeah
(A thousand years from now we'll be still putting it down my baby)
Baby girl in other words for ever more
I'll be here (I'll be here)
Cause, my whole life's been full of joy every since
You came here, girl
My whole world goes around
Because you spin me yeah (spin me)
And every time we're done making love girl
You makes me wanna
Snap in the name of love, snap in the name of love (snap my fingers)
Clap in the name of love, clap in the name of love (clap both my hands)
Step in the name of love, step from side to side (step in the name of love)
Groove in the name of love, groove in the name of love (groove and it's alright)

(Clap in the name of love) (Clap my hands)
(Clap in the name of love) (oh)
(Step in the name of love) (Step step step)
(Step in the name of love) (uh-huh, you got it)

Gucci bags, Louie bags

No amount of money in this world is too much
Thanking cupid for introducing the two of us
This must a match made in heaven
Feels like dice when I roll a seven

I would give it all up just to be your man
In the summertime, we'll build the castle in the sand
And the winter time we make us a snowman
Baby let's do something romantic
Make love under the moonlight and planets
And the stars how they shine, but not nearly as bright as you and I
God's missing an angel cause you're right here
Beautiful skin and body and some nice hair
Girl don't you ever walk out of my life, my life

Now you've all heard foolish questions and no doubt you've wondered why
Some person will ask a foolish question and expect a sensible reply
Like when you take your girl some candy, say maybe just after tea
You notice how she'll grab it and then she'll say, "Is this for me?"

Foolish Questions! You can answer when you can
"No I bought this candy for your Ma or Pa, or for John the hired hand
"I just thought you'd like to see it. Now I'm gonna take it away"
Now wasn't that a foolish question? You'll hear 'em ev'ry day

And then most every morning, there is someone 'round the place
Who sees you take the shaving brush and lather up your face
And as you give the razor a preliminary wave
This fool will walk up and ask you, "Are you gonna take a shave?"

Foolish questions! Your answer is, I hope
"No! I ain't prepared for shavin', I just like the taste of soap!
I kinda like to take the shaving brush and paint myself this way"
Now wasn't that a foolish question? You'll hear 'em ev'ry day!

Now then there's this fella who meets you on your way
And asks you why your all dressed up and listens while you say
That you just been returning from the funeral of poor old Uncle Ned
As soon as you have told him, he will say, "Is Ned dead?"
Foolish questions! You might as well reply
"No, he thought he'd have the funeral now. Then later on he'd die
You know Ned was always so original, he wanted it that way"
Now wasn't that a Foolish Question? You'll hear 'em ev'ry day!

Now suppose the elevator guy should forget to close the door
And you should tumble down, oh say forty-seven floors
And when you reach the bottom and you're lying there inert
Some fool will stick his head down the shaft and holler, "Are you hurt?"

Foolish Questions! Your dying words are
"No! I was in an awful hurry and that elevator's just too slow
Usually saves a lot of time, you know, comin' down this way"
Now wasn't that a Foolish Question? You'll hear 'em ev'ry day!

That was a Foolish Question! You'll hear 'em ev'ry day!

[Verse 1]
It's a long, long way from Canada
A long way from snow chains
Donkey vendors slicing coconut
No parkas to their name
Black babies covered in baking flour
The cook's got a carnival song
We're going to lay down someplace shady
With dreamland coming on

[Chorus]
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

[Verse 2]
Walter Raleigh and Chris Columbus
Come a-marching out of the waves
And claim the beach and all concessions
In the name of the suntan slave
I wrapped that flag around me
Like a Dorothy Lamour sarong
And I lay down thinking national
With dreamland coming on

[Chorus]
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

[Verse 3]
Goodtime Mary and a fortune hunter
All dressed up to follow the drums
Mary in a feather hula-hoop
Miss Fortune with a rose on her big game gun
All saints, all sinners shining
Heed those trumpets all night long
Propped up on a samba beat
With dreamland coming on

[Chorus]
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

[Verse 4]
Tar baby and the Great White Wonder
Talking over a glass of rum
Burning on the inside
With the knowledge of things to come
There's gambling out on the terrace
And midnight ramblin' on the lawn
As they lead toward temptation
With dreamland coming on

[Chorus]
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

[Verse 5]
In a plane flying back to winter
In shoes full of tropic sand
A lady in a foreign flag
On the arm of her Marlboro Man
The hawk howls in New York City
Six foot drifts on Myrtle's lawn
As they push the recline buttons down
With dreamland coming on

[Chorus]
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

[Bridge]
La, la, la la
Da, da, da, da
African sand on the trade winds
And the sun on the Amazon
As they push the recline buttons down
With dreamland coming on

[Chorus]
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland
Well, it's been building up inside of me
For, oh, I don't know how long
I don't know why but I keep thinking
Something's bound to go wrong

But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize
When she says (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out alright (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)

I guess I should've kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back down now because
I pushed the other guys too far

She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive
When she says (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out alright (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
She told me, Baby, when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you, baby
Nothing could go wrong with you

Oh, what she does to me
When she makes love to me
And she says (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out alright (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out alright (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
...
I've traveled for miles around
Seems like everybody wanna put me down
Because I'm a bluesman
But I'm a good man, understand

I went down to the bus station
Look upon the wall
My money is to light people
Couldn't go no where at all
I'm a bluesman

But I'm a good man, understand

The burden that I carry, oh is so heavy
It seems like ain't nobody in this great big world
That would wanna, wanna help old B
Hey, but I'll, I would be all right people
Just give me a break, good things come
The those wait, and I've waited a long time
I'm a bluesman
But I'm a good man, understand
Once a wiseman said to me
This advice I give you free
A woman is made of fantasy so fan the flame
Always keep her hopes up high
Make her laugh don't make her cry and don't let her love die, so fan the flame

A woman needs love and affection and little things mean alot (little things mean alot)
And when she has an emotional baby
That's why you got to fan the flame to keep it burning hot

Make her feel she ten feet tall, even though she short and small
So fan the flame
Her love is your reality let her go and you will see just how lonely life can be
So fan the falme

A woman needs love and praising so give her them each day
Tell her you love her, its added protection
That's why you got to fan the falme to keep it burning hot

Once a wiseman said to me
This advice I give you free
A woman is made of fantasy so fan the flame
How long, how long, has that evenin' train been gone?
How long, how long, baby how long
Heard the whistle blowin', couldn't see the train
Way down in my heart I had an achin' pain
How long, how long, how long
If I could holler like a mountain jack
I'd go up on the mountain and call my baby back
I went up on the mountain, looked as far as I could see
The man had my woman and the blues had poor me
I can see the green grass growin' on the hill
But I ain't seen the green grass on a dollar bill
I'm goin' down to Georgia, been up in Tennessee
So look me over baby, last you'll see of me
The brook runs into the river, river runs into the sea
If I don't run into my baby, a train is goin' to run into me
What is America to me
A name, a map, or a flag I see
A certain word, democracy
What is America to me

The house I live in
A plot of earth, the street
The grocer and the butcher
Or the people that I meet
The children in the playground
The faces that I see
All races and religions
That's America to me

The place I work in
The worker by my side
The little town the city
Where my people lived and died
The howdy and the handshake
The air a feeling free
And the right to speak your mind out
That's America to me
The things I see about me
The big things and the small
That little corner newsstand
Or the house a mile tall
The wedding and the churchyard
The laughter and the tears
The dream that's been a growing
For more than two hundred years

The town I live in
The street, the house, the room
The pavement of the city
Or a garden all in bloom
The church the school the clubhouse
The millions lights I see
Especially the people
That's America to me
Wake in a sweat again
Another day's been laid to waste
In my disgrace
Stuck in my head again
Feels like I'll never leave this place
There's no escape

I'm my own worst enemy

I've given up
I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away
I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

I don't know what to take
Thought I was focused, but I'm scared
I'm not prepared
I hyperventilate
Looking for help, somehow, somewhere
And no one cares
I'm my own worst enemy

I've given up
I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away
I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

God!

Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my...
Put me out of my fucking misery!

I've given up
I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away
I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
Ain't another woman that can take your spot my...

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me, what would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular, tell me, would you?

Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you, say "I do"

Yeah, because
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

Oh, girl
My love
My love

Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote, what would you do?
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team, tell me, would you?

See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure, that baby, it's you
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for, just say "I do"

Yeah, because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

Oh, girl
My love
My love

[Rap by T.I.:]
Alright, it's time to get it JT
I don't know why she hesitates for a man
Shorty, cool as a fan on the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin with your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can

'Cause the girl's real wild, throw their hands up high
When they wanna come kick it with a standup guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen wit' a man so fly
Baby, friend so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle mine
T.I. they call me candle guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire

I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die

Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Well baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy

I ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same bark, same bullet, anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me any pair, I will

I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

(Love) My love
(Love) My love
(Love) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

(Love) My love
(Love) My love
(Love) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

Oh, girl
My love
My love
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight, I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by, I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye, my heart stood still

Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
Then I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old, that old feeling is still in my heart

There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old old feeling is still in my heart
All it took was a special look
And I felt I knew you before
I didn't mean to love you
Didn't think it would work out
But I knew we would be together
And I couldn't wait for more
What can they say it's not against the law

I don't hold you down, and maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love, think about me

I believe that you really want me
But it's not easy just to give in
So let yourself go and let love begin

I don't hold you down, and maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love, think about me

I don't hold you down, and maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love, think about me
Baby once in a while, think about me
Baby once in a while, think about me
Crazy preachers of our doom
Telling us there is no room
Not enough for all mankind
And the seas of time are all running dry
Don't they know it's a lie...

Man is born with the will to survive
He'll not take no for an answer
He will get by, somehow he'll try
He won't take no, never let go, no...

I hear them talk about Kingdom Come
I hear them discuss Armageddon...
They say the hour is getting late
But I can still hear someone say
That is not the way...

Man is born with the will to survive
He'll not take no for an answer
He will get by, somehow he'll try
He won't take no, never let go, no...
Call me irresponsible - call me unreliable
Throw in undependable too
Do my foolish alibis bore you
Well I'm not too clever - I just adore you

Call me unpredictable - tell me I'm impractical
Rainbows I'm inclined to pursue
Call me irresponsible - yes I'm unreliable
But it's undeniably true - I'm irresponsibly mad for you

Call me irresponsible - yes I'm unreliable
But it's undeniably true - I'm irresponsibly mad for you
When I was hoppin' freights and makin' payments on the farm
Here between the angels and the deep blue sea
You were runnin', laughin', growin' sheltered from the storm
Dreamin' of the day the moon would set you free
Yeah, to sing your siren song so sweet and warm
River run deep
River run slow
Get a little restless
Wanna see some whales blow
River run cold
River run clear
That feeling always gets to me
'Round about this time of year
Scoutin' unknown borders under multi-colored moons
In the wildest flights of cosmic mystery
Rang a single soarin' tone that strung the sky in tune
As the silence in my heart rose from the sea
Aaah, to greet you in the dawn with a pale harpoon
River run restless
River run high
Runnin' thru a hailstorm
Try to catch a star on the fly
River run muddy
River flow like tears
Cocoon of life surroundin' us
Holdin' all our hopes and fears
Reach behind the wind
Search beyond the stars
We're the life on Mars
When the day grows dark and scary scatterin' the light
All the colors run away and hide behind your knees
The same sweet thunder tumbles rollin' down the night
Like a mothership that calls for you and me
Come on, and drift along that sky river bright
River run swiftly
River run wide
Feel like sailin'
On the morning tide
River run golden
River run true
Set a course and follow
Ooooh, the star that leads to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Its 3 am, I can’t sleep
Too late to call this is not like me
But I’m still lifted from the tattoo on the small of your back
The able of your chew when you were looking back

See, god you’re beautiful and I’m still coming down
I’d like a one-night stand, but you had to stick around
But I’m still floating on the perfume you left on my sheets
I haven’t changed a thing since you abandoned me

Tonight I stare out the window…
Knowing I’ll never again be alone

Last night you changed my life
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Saved my life
Last night you saved my life
Your fingernails running down my spine
All day I hear your voice like velvet in my mind
It’s like I knew you all my life even though we just met
My children in your eyes, something you don’t expect

I had to stop myself from calling all day long
I’m glad you called me first, I wanted to be strong
But you were laughing because I answered after just one ring
I tried to play it off
But you knew everything

Last night you changed my life
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you saved my life with your love

Last night you saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you saved my life

Ohh yeah

I stare at the sky looking for the morning sun
Can’t wait to tell you you’re the only one
Last night you saved my life
And I was stuck in the moment you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you changed my life
Don't care when you go
How long you stay
But good kind treatments
Will bring you back someday
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

Aw, but one thing
Really give me the blues
When I wore a hole
In my last pair of shoes
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

Just keep on a-bettin'
About the...
You're gonna leave here runnin'
Almost too fast
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
Don't like everybody
In my neighborhood
I got a no-good woman
She don't mean me no good
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
I heard
Church bells ringing
I heard
A choir singing
I saw my love
Walk down
The aisle
On her finger
He placed a ring

Oooh, oh

I saw them
Holding hands
She was
Standing there
Wwith my man
I heard
Them promise
Til death do
Us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was
Losing the man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry

And now
The wedding
Is over
The rice, rice
Has been
Thrown over
Their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending

Ooh
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1 - B.B. King]
You act like you don't want to listen
When I'm talking to you
You think you outta do baby
Anything you wanna do
You must be crazy baby
You just gotta be outta your mind
As long as I'm payin' the bills woman
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss

[Verse 2  -B.B. King]
I'll drink if I want to
And play a little poker too
Don't you say nothing to me
As long as I'm taking care of you
As long as I'm workin baby
And payin' all the bills
I don't want no mouth from you
About the way I'm supposed to live
You must be crazy woman
Just gotta be outta your mind
As long as I foot the bills
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss

[Verse 3 - B.B. King]
Now that you got me
You act like you ashamed
You don't act like my woman
You just usin' my name
I tell you I'm gonna have all the money
And I don't want no back-talk
Cause if you don't like the way I'm doin'
Just pick up your things and walk
You gotta be crazy baby
You must be outta your mind
As long as I'm payin' the bills woman
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss

[Intro]
Ahh!

[Chorus]
I shake, I move, the girl get hot
I shake, I move, and the girl get hot
I shake, I move, and the girl get hot
I shake, I move, I shake, I move, and girl get hot

[Verse 1]
Walk in the club, with that attitude
That I’m in love, girl I’m in love with you
I’m on the floor and I bust my moves
You getting horny, you cannot control you
Hey girly, girl
Give me your bootay
Let me slap it
Like I was your daddy
She, she wants me badly
'Cause I’m what they not

[Pre-Chorus]
I shake, I move
I shake, I move
And then the girl get hot

[Chorus]
Okay, lets play a game to see who can do it
Move like a maniac mane, off the fluid
Attitude, lose it, this ain’t a scene
It’s a dance floor, baby it’s a dance floor
I'm on the dance floor, light it up like a candle (What?)
(He on the dance floor light it up like a candle)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ya bitch, even though I’m rich, I ain’t afraid to act like a fool
Like a motherfuckin kid, there it is

[Chorus]
I shake, I move, and the girl get hot
I shake, I move, and the girl get hot

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Alright
Ohh
Alright
Ohh
Alright
Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, "My God, they've killed them all!"
Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
"I didn't do it," he says, and he throws up his hands
"I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand
I saw them leavin'," he says, and he stops
"One of us had better call up the cops."
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night

Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, "I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead"
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men

Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
Says, "Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!"
Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame
"Remember that murder that happened in a bar?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
You think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?
Don't forget that you are white."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
Cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
You'll be doin' society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim."

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jail house
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse

All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed
Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
Yes, that's the story of the Hurricane
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
Well, way up north where the air gets cold
You'll find the Saint Nick
And the tale about Christmas that you've all been told
About the Saint Nick

He's a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year workin' out on his sled
The little Saint Nick
The little Saint Nick

Just a little bobsled, we call it little Saint Nick
The little Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick
The little Saint Nick

She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel
The little Saint Nick
The little Saint Nick

It's got the naugahyde bucket seats with chrome on the rail
And the deers honkin' on and really make Santa sail
And cuties, don't you worry, he's a real cool head
And I've been told that he
Don't miss no one
Haulin' through the snow at a frightening speed
The little Saint Nick
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead
The little Saint Nick

He's gotta wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies
And he's cruisin' every pad with a little surprise
The little Saint Nick
The little Saint Nick

The little Saint Nick
The little Saint Nick
The little Saint Nick
The little Saint Nick

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Just you, just me
Let's find a cozy spot to cuddle and coo
Just us, just me
I've miss an awful lot, my trouble is you

Oh gee, what are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination

Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot 'round wonderful you

Oh gee, what are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination

Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot 'round wonderful you

Just us
Hey there, Mr. Lonely Heart, if you could find the time
I would like to sit and talk, to see if we could find
The answer to the mystery of love's most precious seed
Is it in a touch or in a kiss or simply in the need

Or is it really love itself that always wants to give
The heart and soul of all of us and everything that lives

Hey there, Mr. Cold, Cold Heart, I know I could be wrong
To think that life could be so sweet and love could be so strong
As to gather everyone of us, like one big family
To share with one another all we have and all we see

It's true the deepest part of us is everywhere the same
And that the only differences are really just the names

We can join the children's song and show them that we care
Let them know we're on their side, no matter when or where
We can free their hearts from fear and hunger reconcile
We can give a child a chance and give a child a smile
True love is still the answer, and we are still the way
The gift is in the giving, and in living what we say

And if you have a lonely heart, this song is just for you
To ask for all that you can give and all that you can do
Remember that the mystery of love's most precious seed

Is in the heart of all of us, true love is all we need
It's in the heart of all of us, true love is all we need
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need

Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need
Listen, baby, baby

If I don't love you this way
Why do I say what I say?
If I don't need you this much
Baby, why do I ache for your touch?

With you it seems I can reach the stars
With reckless hopes and dreams
But you, it seems still don't believe
How valuable you are

I really love you, baby
I'm not pretending to

If I don't love you this strong
Why do I beg to belong?
How can you doubt that I care, baby
When I'm with you everywhere?

With you I find I can close my eyes
To the world surrounding me
And you create the sweetest days
That I could ever be
I really, really, really love you, baby
I'm not pretending to

If I don't love you this way
Why do I say what I say?
If I don't need you this much
Baby, why do I ache for your touch, touch?

You just have to smile
To make my life worthwhile
Doesn't that explain
That I'm playing no games

If I don't love you this way
Why do I say what I say?
If I don't need you this much
Baby, why do I ache for your touch, touch?

If I don't love you this strong
Why do I beg to belong?
How can you doubt that I care, baby
When I'm with you everywhere?
If I don't love you this way
You vowed your love
From here to eternity
A love so true
It never would die

You gave your lips
Gave them so willingly
How could I know
Your kiss meant goodbye?

Now I'm alone
With only a memory
My empty arms
Will never know why

Though you are gone
This love that you left with me
Will live from here to eternity

Now I'm alone
With only a memory
My empty arms
Will never know why
Though you are gone
This love that you left with me
This endless desire will live
From here to eternity
I took a tour to Texas
And from Waco I called you
But day by day no answer
And I'm Big Bluebonnet blue

I'm singing and they're dancing
But I'm feeling Big D bad
I'm Sweetwater beat
And I'm Texas City sad

The rhythm keeps me living
But have you heard the news
There's a sad song singer coming
With the rockabilly blues

It's hard to keep on singing
When you're lonesome to the bon
10,000 happy people but I'm San Antone alone
One night stands and the man demands

That I get up and go
I'm Odessa desperate
And San Angelo low
The rhythm keeps me living
But have you heard the news
There's a sad song singer coming
With the rockabilly blues

It's the same old tune in Temple
About the loving I ain't had
I'm getting Beaumont bitter
And Amarillo mad

I'm giving up on calling you
'Cause you're evading me
I'm coming home and if you're gone
I'm gonna be Tennessee free

The rhythm keeps me living
And have you heard the news
There's a sad song singer coming
With the rockabilly blues
Uh, uh, uh, uh

This is ours and we don't share, we right here

Let 'em know it ain't a sweet walk
This gone be the only joint made this year that'll knock 'til 2003
And y'all gone see that the hottest nigga out there

Was, is, and will be me, just like that I can go away for a minute
Do some other shit, but bounce right back
And when it's on I'm comin' strapped, with some shit

'Cuz we don't play and the silencer will silence any cocksucker
With somethin' to say, dog for life
Whether I'm on or off the leash I bite, streets are my life
Click, click, boom, another life taken too soon
Another mother had a funeral, still waters run deep
And the pain is forever alive inside, makes it hard to sleep

But I keep goin', goin', shit, I'm always careful when I walk
I'm always seein', knowin', the dog gone live, stay walkin' the wire
Over the fire, when I can I give the dog is good and how it's stayin'
Dog gone fuck with the hood, the dog fuck with the wood

Bring it! What? We right here

This is ours and we don't share, we right here

[Chorus]
I'm gonna catch the first train home
I don't know what I come here for
Yeah, first train home
I don't know what I come here for
'Cause for nine long years I couldn't even walk out of my door
Here's what I say

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm gonna catch the first train home
I don't know what I come here for
Yeah, first train home
I don't know what I come here for
'Cause for nine long years I couldn't even walk out of my door

[Verse 1]
Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why you ramble, no one knows
Wild and wind-blown, that's how you've grown
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?

[Verse 2]
Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
When your ramblin' days are gone
Who will love you with a love so true
When your ramblin' days are gone?
Everybody sing

[Verse 3]
Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why, why I want you, no, no one knows
Though I love you with a love so true
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?

[Outro]
Oh, ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why I want you, only heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?
Ramblin', ramblin' rose
Framkie and Johnny were sweethearts
Lordy how they did love
They swore to be true to each other
As true as the stars above
He was her man
He wouldn't do her wrong

Franke went down to the corner
Just t get a bucket of beer
She said "Mr. Bartender
Has my lovin' Johnny been here?
He's my man, he wouldn't do me wrong"

I ain't gonna tell you no story
I ain't gonna tell you no lie
Johnny left here 'bout an hour ago
With a gal named Nellie Bly
If he's your man, he's doin' you wrong

Frankie looked over the transom
And much to her surprise
There on a cot sat Johnny
Making love to Nellie Bly
She said "He's my man
But he's doin' me wrong"
Roll out your rubber tired buggy
Roll out your rubber tired hack
She's taking her man to the graveyard
But she ain't gonna bring him back
She shot her man
Because he was doin' her wrong

This story has no moral
This story has no end
This story goes to show
That you can't put your trust in men
She shot her man
Because he was doin' her wrong
When did you love me
I want to know the truth
It's never hard to get it up for you
Why did you have it and is it all the same
Oh my sweet darling did you forget your name
Oh you call it a thrill
I never knew, and then you never will
Oh one big mistake now I see
I started off thinking that you belonged to me
Cold blooded lovers waiting for the night
Exploring my treasure, got me so uptight
Your fault that I'm
Feeling all insane
Once we were happy
And then the devil came
Oh baby, oh baby
First you make believe your mine
Oh babe, oh baby
Then you make me feel like dying. Ooh ooh
Once upon a time you said I set your soul on fire
I called you my honey
You were my one desire
I let you nestle too deep within my soul
I can't believe I let you take control
Oh my sweet baby don't wait too late
Tell me you love me and cure my heart ache
I never thought I'd be put in this squeeze
Your trying to bring me to my bended knee
Don't start buggin'
Don't criticize
Folks that love you
Right before your eyes
You stopped me
Got to let you go
Got to be heard
Got to love you so
Got to give you some
Just before you leave
Got to feed my fire
Uh ah, uh ah
Ok let me hear that back
C'mon ya'll lets go
Come on sweet darlin' you say you don't care
Dance all your heart aches far away from here
You used to be so real
Ah I used to be your only thrill baby
Ah it used to be so real
You never loved me and you never will
But I'll always love you cause that's the way I feel
And we just can't help it cause that's the way it is
So let's be happy
Fly 'n be happy
Love 'n be happy
Dance, whooooo
Oh let's be happy
Let's laugh 'n be happy
Let's live 'n be happy
Dance, whoooo
For life is happy
And love is happy
To sing is happy
Dance, whoooo
Let's be happy
Let's laugh 'n be happy
Let's love 'n be happy
Dance, whoooo
Keep on rising higher baby and you'll stay happy
Gotta stay happy
Happy

Got to pray and meditate
Got to pray and meditate
Havin' a love party
Got to pray and meditate
Havin' a love party

Oh Life is happy
And love is happy
Live 'n be happy

00:05:21	Oh, go! Go on!

00:05:27	For goodness' sake, stop sitting down!
00:05:30	All right, all right, what's your hurry?
00:05:32	But no -- on and on they go.
00:05:36	"Good morning," said Richard.
00:05:38	"Good afternoon, sir," said the courier.
00:05:41	They were late.
00:05:41	JESSICA: 'Allo, Flo, you all right, girl?
00:05:42	I'll sit 'ere.

00:05:52	Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.
00:05:55	Welcome to Magical Mystery Tours!
00:06:00	I am your courier, Jolly Jimmy Johnson!
00:06:03	All my friends call me Jolly Jimmy -- and you are all my friends!
00:06:07	Over here is your hostess -- that lovely, delightful, delectable... Wendy Winters!
00:06:12	Lovely girl, lovely!
00:06:13	And over here, our driver for the trip, that wonderful driver, we hope...
00:06:18	Ha ha ha!
00:06:19	Alf! Off you go, Alf!
00:06:21	Here we go now. Splendid!
00:06:22	Fasten your safety belts, please.
00:06:25	Away-way-way we go!
00:06:28	Away we go, Alf, splendid!
00:06:31	Very comfy in the back there, is it? Lovely.
00:06:33	I say it's lovely. Get your popcorn out!
00:06:37	Ha ha!
00:06:38	Right hand down. There we are, splendid.
00:06:41	And away we go.
00:06:42	Anyway, I'll tell you something, you ain't coming away with me anymore.
00:06:46	Who bought the tickets for this trip? I did!
00:06:48	Yeah, with my money. I gave you the money.
00:06:50	I'm taking you out. You're not taking me anywhere.
00:06:52	I gave you the money, darling. Remember that.
00:06:55	And you've done nothing but eye all the fellas on the coach since we got here.
00:06:59	Shut your cakehole!
00:06:59	I dunno, since Uncle Jack died, you've never been the same.
00:07:03	Of course, 'cause I ain't got Uncle Jack, have I?
00:07:06	I remember him. I remember him.
00:07:07	If I ain't got him, I've got to get somebody else.
00:07:10	You should know, you're old enough at 21!
00:07:13	You should do a bit of knitting, do you good.
00:07:15	Who for? You?
00:07:17	Should I knit for you?
00:07:19	No, don't knit for me.
00:07:23	

[Car horn blares] Who is that man?
00:07:31	Oh, that's Mr Bloodvessel.
00:07:33	He's quite harmless. He comes on all the trips.
00:07:36	He thinks he's a courier.
00:07:38	Last trip, he thought he was the driver.
00:07:42	PAUL: Well, you know, when I saw your first film, I really thought you had something, but it was -- WOMAN: I was only about 6, then.
00:07:50	PAUL: Wasn't it "Blue Lady"? "Lady in Blue"?
00:07:53	Something like that.
00:07:55	WOMAN: How old are you?
00:07:56	PAUL: I myself am 30...
00:07:57	but I look a little younger due to the Fair Isle sweater.
00:08:01	Excuse me, sir.
00:08:02	I'd like to take a photograph of the young lady, do you mind?
00:08:05	I don't mind if Miss Gabriella doesn't.
00:08:08	Well, Miss Gabriella doesn't mind.
00:08:10	Thank you, bye-bye.
00:08:12	See you later, maybe.
00:08:13	Or we won't see him later. Can I have you out there?

I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
And my number one occupation is stealing women from their men

Well I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would

Yes and the doctor call me crazy, some says I am some says I ain't

The preacher man call me a sinner, but his little girl call me a saint

Well a couple of shots of whiskey, women round here start lookin' good
Well a couple of shots of whiskey, women round here start lookin' good
Couple more shots of whiskey, I'm goin' back to Minglewood

[Rodney Burke] That was a, a Little Richard number that the boys rather like and hope you liked it, "Ooh! My Soul." And, ooh, my arms! We've, we've just flown in to Manchester here from London to record this show. Ha, ha. Well, it's, ha, ha, it's good to see you again, fellers, in these, er, foreign parts. How are you?

[George] Very well, thank you

[John] Oh, great!

[Ringo] Oh, great, yeah, it's just fine

[Paul] Yeah

[Rodney] Well, what are you doing at the moment, by the way?

[George] Ah, we're playing in Liverpool at the moment and we've never been there months, you see, so it's--

[Ringo] It's good to be back

[Paul] Yeah, it's great!

[Rodney] Anybody over there like a request that you can do right now?

[George] Well, we'll do a request for everybody

[Paul] Yeah

[Rodney] Good, what do you suggest?

[George] Er, "Don't Ever Change," one of the oldies
Motorcars, handlebars, bicycles for two
Brokenhearted jubilee

Parachutes, army boots, sleeping bags for two
Sentimental jamboree

Why, why says the junk in the yard
Ya da da da da La da da da

Buy, Buy says the sign in the shop window
Why, why says the junk in the yard
Ya da da da da da da la la la la la

Candlesticks, building bricks
Something old and new
Memories for you and me
Come back to me, baby
I feel so all alone
It rained last night
And things ain't right
Without my baby home

Every time it rains
I think of you
And that's the time
I feel so blue
When the rain starts falling
My love comes tumbling down
And it's raining
Teardrops from my eyes

If you see clouds
Here in my eyes
It's just because
You said good-bye
Although the sun is shining
There's no more summer skies
'Cause it's raining
Teardrops from my eyes
Remember the night you told me
Our love would always be
I wouldn't be blue and lonely
If you'd come back to me
Every single cloud
Would disappear
I'd wear a smile
If you were here
So baby, won't you hurry
Because I miss you so
And it's raining
Teardrops from my eyes

Remember the night you told me
Our love would always be
I wouldn't be blue and lonely
If you'd come back to me
Every single cloud
Would disappear
I'd wear a smile
If you were here
So baby, won't you hurry
Because I miss you so
And it's raining
Teardrops from my eyes
The bells are golden chimes
The sun is going to shine
Before this heart of mine

Baby ain't that fine
Baby ain't that fine
Baby ain't that fine
Baby ain't that fine

Hey, la la la
Baby ain't that fine
Baby ain't that fine

I get a little bit tingle up and down my spine
I (??) every time you say you're mine

You're gonna be my baby
I'm a-gonna be your guy
We're gonna cook some lovin'
It's a-gonna sizzle and fry
Baby ain't that fine
Baby ain't that fine
Baby ain't that fine
Baby ain't that fine
It is confused, indiscernible
Confused, virtuously by nature, obscurity
Undetermined, it's shape so distant
In it there are beings what abyss, on a order

He wanted an illusion (leading a move at life-force)
Order he insisted, troubled vision (created in the darkness)

Order he insisted, troubled vision (created in the darkness)
I'm dead , my life's been sold
All my years are cold
No trees to hide my head
All my roads are red

And in the easter
I will see that same old sun , that shone
And in the winter
I shall stand in seas of snow , alone

I will wait for you , yeah
Your eyes will shine like new , yeah
I close my eyes and you're nowhere
And i'll wait for you for one million years

My face has long been wet
Ever since we met
We wed , i knew she's stay
Then i passed away

And in the easter
I will see that same old sun that shone
And in the winter
I shall stand in seas of snow , alone
I will wait for you
Just like you want me to
I close my eyes and you're nowhere
And i'll wait for you for one million years
And i'll wait for you for one million years

[Intro]
All my dreams
All my dreams, all my dreams

[Verse 1]
I'll see you tonight in all my dreams
All my dreams
My spirit's in flight in all my dreams
All my dreams
A submarine valiantly conquers a virgin sea
A child is born, a child is born, will you marry me?

[Verse 2]
I'll teach you tonight (tonight, tonight) in all my dreams
All my dreams
You'll be so surprised (surprised, surprised) at things you'll see
All my dreams
Africa, Captain Crunch, Norma Jean, sex, and Cheerios
Play my record double speed, feel the climax fit for a king
Just fun, nothing ethereal

[Spoken]
Here ye, here ye, one and all
That the double speed playhouse is making a call
Welcome, this is where I live
This is where I dream my dreams
Tonight we'll make love until the world stops turning
You're small but very strong
You move like a cat: quickly but gentle
So insane
He caressed her in her eyes and licked her abdomen
She shivered with delight
Over and over she nibbled his ear
You'd think it was wrong to have so much fun
He held her tightly until it almost hurt
But his hips, they moved so slowly
She wanted to stop breathing
You can feel every curve of her womanhood
You can see every thought in his brain
A submarine slowly moves through the virgin sea
Oh so slowly, she wants to stop breathing
You, you can feel every curve
Lisa, I'm gonna give you the brush and you're gonna paint the side of the train
She squeezes tighter as the submarine goes deeper in depth
Into the unnavigated territory
A smile, ever so slight, appears on his face as she starts to cry
Until they come, together, slowly
They wish for somethin', as if they could see a parallel future in the sea
They do not speak
They only stare out the moment in time
Marry me today and tonight we'll make love until the world stops turning
(I'm dreaming of a world)
(Wherein there shines the sun)
(Wherein there lay the stars)
(Wherein there lie the stones)
Gentle, but quickly

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
We'll travel tonight in all my dreams
All my dreams

[Outro]
All my dreams, all my dreams
Goodness will guide us if love is inside us
The colors are brighter, the bond is much tighter
You know no child's a failure
Until the blue sailboat sails him away from his dreams
Don't ever lose, don't ever lose
Don't ever lose your dreams
Yeah!
Lost in day to day
Turn another way
With a laugh
A kind hello
Some small talk
With those I know
I forget
That I'm not over you
For a while
A wave an easy grin
A smile to put them in
With other lives
To listen to
And some work
I've got to do
I forget
That I'm not over you
For a while
Days go by
With no empty feeling
Until I
Remember you're gone
People say to me
You need company
When you have
Some time to spend
Drop around
And meet a friend
They forget
That I'm not over you
For a while
They forget
That I'm not over you
For a while...
A day in the life of a fool
A sad and a long lonely day
I walk the avenue
And hope I'll run into
The welcome sight of you
Coming my way

I stop just across from your door
But you're never home anymore
So back to my room
And there in the gloom I cry
Tears of goodbye

Till you come back to me
That's the way it will be
Every day in the life of a fool
You and the night and the music fill me with flaming desire
Setting my being completely on fire!
You and the night and the music thrill me but will we be one
After the night and the music are done?
Until the pale light of dawning and daylight our hearts will be throbbing guitars
Morning may come without warning and take away the stars
If we must live for the moment, love till the moment is through!
After the night and the music die, will I have you?
Life is just too short for some folks
For other folks it just drags on
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey
Others figure tea's too strong

Well, I'm the type of guy who wants to ride the middle
I don't like all this bouncing back and forth
Me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie
And my head in the cool blue north

In a small suburban garden
Not a single neighbour knows our name
I know the woman wishes we would move some place
Where the houses aren't all the same

Jesse, I wish you would take me where the grass is greener
I couldn't really say where it may be
Oh, some place high on a mountain top
Or down by the deep blue sea

And there we'll do just as we please
It ain't nothing but a breeze
One day I'll be old gray Grandpa
All the pretty girls will call me "Sir"
Now where they're asking me how things are
Soon they'll ask me how things are

Well, I don't mind being an old gray Grandpa
As long as you'll be my gray Grandma
But I wish we would move with our tea and cookies
To the shade of the old pawpaw

There we'll do just as we please
It ain't nothing but a breeze

Life is just too short for some folks
For other folks it just drags on
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey
Others figure tea's too strong

Well, I'm the type of guy who wants to ride in the middle
I don't like all this bouncing back and forth
Me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie
And my head in the cool blue north
I have a few more
Tears to shed
I have a few more
Burdens to bear
I have a few more
Times to give up the right
For the wrong
But I'm gonna keep on
Pressing on the word
Till my battle if fought
My victory is won
But if u make it in Glory
Be for I do
Save a seat for me

Tell my mother to save
(Save a seat for me)
Save a seat for me
(Save a seat for me)
I'm on my way home
(Save a seat for me)
Save a seat for me
(Save a seat for me)
I want you to save
(Save a seat for me)
Save a seat for me
(Save a seat for me)
I just want you to save
(Save a seat for me)
Save a seat for me
(Save a seat for me)
Sometimes I've been up
Sometimes I've been down
Sometimes I've been leveled
I've been leveled down to the ground
But if you make it in glory
Be for I do
Save a seat for me

[Verse:]
And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?

[Hook:]
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around

[Bridge:]
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around

[Outro:]
Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so, mmm
Cold iron shackles, ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evenin' train
You know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee Jed

Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Well, do you know it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee Jed

Tennessee, Tennessee, there ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby won't you carry me back to Tennessee

Drink all day and rock all night
The law come to get you if you don't walk right
Got a letter this morning, baby all it read
You better head back to Tennessee Jed

I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Catch a few winks, baby, under the bed
Then you head back to Tennessee Jed
Tennessee, Tennessee, there ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby won't you carry me back to Tennessee

I run into Charlie Fog
Blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My doggie turned to me and he said
Let's head back to Tennessee Jed
I woke up a felin' mean
Went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around, and the letters read
You better head back to Tennessee Jed

Afraid to hold on
Afraid to let go
Afraid to find out
But afraid not to know
Afraid of what's broken
But still doesn't show
These are dangerous times to love

Afraid of the sky
Afraid of the light
Afraid of the wind
That will carry the night
Afraid of bad news from the satellite
These are dangerous times to love

We do not stand up together
We can't find no solid ground
All of our songs are forever
Not having empty sound

Afraid to hope
Afraid to bleed
Afraid of too much
But afraid of the need
Afraid of the poisons we might seed
These are dangerous times to love
Afraid to be foolish
Afraid to be old
Afraid of the stories
That are recklessly told
Afraid we must sell what's already been sold
These are dangerous times to love
These are dangerous times to love
Rhayader ferries many stranded soldiers to safety
Until at last he is hit, and the Snow Goose is seen
Circling low over the spot where the little boat has
Gone down
The First Noel, the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
They looked above and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
All day, all night
You feel as if the earth could fly
Three more all for fine Indian gin and whisky dry
Fine Indian gin and whisky dry
Small town, closed down, there's nowhere else around to try
Disturbingly a voice would cry
"Go home, no loan, you'll have you gin and whisky dry
You'll have your gin and whisky dry"
Four, ten, four men, lining up for their handy brandy
All's gone, you're none, came the bartender's reply
But I've tried and I'm tied
To Indian gin and whisky dry
To Indian gin and whisky dry
To Indian gin and whisky dry
...

Recently when we were out on tour
We felt that it's okay singing
Beatles songs and stuff but it's nice to leave 'em
With a bit of a message and the world being

In a kind of state as it is these days
We choose as one of our messages ecology
Because man, if we don't sort it out, not one will
So, that's gonna be the theme of today's show

Oobu joobu, ecology
Alright, let's go straight to the sound check
And this time it's in Las Vegas

[1st Verse]
First off let me clear my chest
Started off on baby steps
We get right to the moment where babys come next
Grab tight holdin our self to whats nothin left
Two choices Im ya boyfriend or lets just forget
After dat you plead like I can't believe what we did
So only option was to agree and keep it secret
Or ya friends will make ya think that ya just another cheerleader
On his team, Tyga man a playa
See but, don't believe what ears can hear and eyes can not see
You seeing me on a daily baby
Wheres my time for another lady?
Get over it, trust me, faithfully, i can be all that you need

[Chorus]
Say you want to let me go and
Thats gonna have to end
You can Go and getta new boyfriend
But you'll never getta better boyfriend
Love just ain't our way but
You know i don't pretend
Imma go and getta new girlfriend
Imma get myself a better girlfriend

[2nd Verse]

[Girl Talks on Answering Machine]

Dear Ma
Misses She left ya guard down
For girbuads and riches
So we tore the mall down
And therefore fullfilled your little wishes
No more penny, pigeon, chowing at places
Dinner to reservations
I'm so on to this lifestyle
I put you on to it baby, Tyga Style
Just don't run from it cuz theres carpets every where we roam now
Profits for party poppin wit popular crowds
Getty images flickering, Perez Hilton
Liker her dress was ridiculous, complements of Tygas dispense
I come at dem like Pete Wentz
Don't worry its all coming back in the end

[Chorus]
Say you want to let me go and
Thats gonna have to end
You can Go and getta new boyfriend
But you'll never getta better boyfriend
Love just ain't our way but
You know i don't pretend
Imma go and getta new girlfriend
Imma get myself a better girlfriend

[3rd Verse]
Wait, so this is how we plan it
Benifit friends and relationships don't mix
But don't trip, cuz you i'm far over with
Long John Silver sick
And this boat no longer floats for you goldfish
Go dig another ditch cuz im dead done wit dis
Im hangin up now, My new girl shes in the front now
I know that gotta hurt
Time to answer her
Well i guess its true
Stick to the player rules

[Chorus] (2x)
Say you want to let me go and
Thats gonna have to end
You can Go and getta new boyfriend
But you'll never getta better boyfriend
Love just ain't our way but
You know i don't pretend
Imma go and getta new girlfriend
Imma get myself a better girlfriend
Doubt will kill you
Youth passed away
Amongst controls of resignation

Unmistakable
Appeal of the marvelous

Doubt will kill you
Youth passed away
Amongst controls of resignation

Unmistakable
Appeal of the marvelous

Is it enough to show
How the nightmare works
So the people will
Wake up, is it enough
You think you're so way out
And you got all the action
Still you can't find no satisfaction
Baby - try me, and I'll make you see

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
Ah ah, at all

You like to kiss and run
And that's where it is
'Cause somebody told you
Love was heartaches and tears
Baby, although you're free
I'll make you see

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Oh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
You ain't livin' at all
To be in love, I know it's not your ambition
But before you go, think about my proposition
You may conquer the world and be king on a throne
But you still ain't nobody, baby
When you're sittin' all alone

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
We use to say our love will stay until the cows come home
And then the cows came home, do you know why?
We use to say we'll love this way, till Hades freezes over
And then it just froze over, do you know why?
We thought we had a future dancing a jig for us
Do you suppose our little dream got too big for us
We use to say our love will stay
Forever and a night, and now forever's gone
Darling, do you know why? Neither do I
Ay Jim you know them old suga daddy's they be trickin they tell them girl's*
(I said you could have whatever youu like) 

[3x (fade)]
Yeahh

[Chorus:]
Stacks on deck
Patron on ice
And we could pop bottles all night
Baby you could have whatever you like (you like)
I said youu could have whatever youu like (you like)
Yeahh
Late night sex
So wet it's so tight
I'd gas up the jet for youu tonight
And baby youu could go wherever you (you like)
I said youu could go wherever you like (you like)
Yeahh

[Verse 1:]
Anytime you want to
Pick up the telephone you

Want it youu could get it my dear

[Hook:]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Shawty you the hottest
Love the way you drop it
Brain so good (good)
Coulda sworn you went to college
Hundred cake deposits
And vacations in the tropics
Errbody know it ain't trickin if youu got it
And you ain't neve eva gotta go in yo wallet
As long as I got rubbaband banks in my pockets
Five six
Rides with rims and noody kits
And you ain't gotta down grade
You can get what I get
My chick can have wha she wants
And go in any store
Buy any bag she want
I know you ain't never had a man like that
To buy you anythin your heart desire like that

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I'm talkin big boy rides
And big boy ice
Let me put this big boy in yo life
The thang get so wet
And hit so right
Let me put this big boy in yo life
That's right

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Jumbo said to say goodnight, see you in the morning
Please don't lose your appetite, he knows who is yawning
Tomorrow you can climb a mountain
Sail a sailboat through a fountain
Jumbo said to say goodnight, he's a friend of yours

Play no games he'd say to me when the light is gone
He is right he'd say to me, we know who is wrong
So please don't make no hesitation
There will be no recreation
Jumbo said to say goodnight, he's a friend of yours

Listen, you can chew it if it's loud enough you hear it
'Cos it's narrow as a sparrow and it shoots a bow and arrow
Thro' a top that's made with powder with a gun it's even louder
And it's shattering to hear you mustn't listen with your ear
But it gets to you

Yes, yes, yes, it gets to you
Yes, yes, yes, you
Yes, yes, yes, you
Yes, yes, yes, you
Yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes

[Intro]
Yeah, like I was saying
I ain't, ya know what
I'm not trying to say things to hurt you
You know what I'm saying
I don't wanna hurt you, baby
Just sometimes you do things
That push me to say things I don't wanna say
You know what I'm saying?
You know I love you
You know I care about you
This time, you just brought it on yourself
Yo, check it out

[Verse 1]
Now I shoulda been more man
About the way things went down
Especially since we been dealing
For like seven years now
I've been slowly, slowly bringing you down
No conversation, no good sex in a while
But still you search and find a way
To love me somehow
Even though I ride, you still trust me somehow
Got my faces, some ice and a tie
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly going down

[Chorus]
(I don't mean it) when I holla at you
(I don't mean it) when I say that we're through
(I don't mean it) what I'm taking you through
(I don't mean it) baby
(I don't mean it) said I'm sorry
(I don't mean it) can you find a way to forgive me?
(I don't mean it) said I went to church this morning
(I don't mean it) and I don't mean it

[Verse 2]
Running around here talking about
How I'm a big player now
Hidden in corners, blinging out our share
Kelly making hits now
Thinking about this industry
And how I put it out
You were there for me
When I used dish rags for ties
There's times that I didn't hear you
I was talking too loud
When I didn't come home
I was hanging with the crowd
Whenever we fight I try to win every round
Can you find a way to forgive me now?

[Chorus]
(I don't mean it) 'cause I don't mean it
(I don't mean it) when I holla at you
(I don't mean it) whenever I say we're through
(I don't mean it) whoa
(I don't mean it) can you find a way to forgive me?
(I don't mean it) ooh baby, I
(I don't mean it) I went to church this morning
(I don't mean it) ooh I don't mean it

[Verse 3]
Father, can you help me?
What do you need from me?
I broke up with my girl and I'm feeling kinda lonely
I been watching you from Heaven, Kelly
You been so demanding
You need to read my word, son
And get some understanding
But I been busy with my music
Stop making excuses
Recognize the love she gives
And try not to abuse it
Is it too late to get her back?
Not as long as I'm a fact
Well father, show me a sign
That will make her mine

[Chorus]
(I don't mean it) I don't mean it
(I don't mean it) whenever I say we're through
(I don't mean it) or whenever I holla at you
(I don't mean it) ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
(I don't mean it) ooh baby, ooh baby
(I don't mean it) see what was straight is now stone
(I don't mean it) because I took you for granted, oh
(I don't mean it) whoa
(I don't mean it) whoa, you should know I don't mean it
(I don't mean it) I put it on my life
(I don't mean it) believe me I pay the price
(I don't mean it) when I was down and out
(I don't mean it) you reached out your hand
(I don't mean it) I've learned it takes a good woman
(I don't mean it) to raise a man
(I don't mean it) oh, I love you, baby
(I don't mean it) oh, oh, oh, I love you, baby

[Verse 1]
Now I feel that this heart of mine has taken many falls
Still sometimes the rain can turn into a waterfall
The prettiest things can come out of the coldest night, yeah
And even with broken wings, sometimes you find your way to fly

[Chorus 1]
It's time to be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
It's time to be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
It's time to be

[Verse 2]
Now I feel that this soul of mine has had its many tolls, yeah
Still sometimes the pain is what we need for us to grow, yeah
So when it's time for me to look into my deeper side
I will, I will find a way to hold onto the love inside

[Chorus 2]
It's time to be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
Yes, I can be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
Yes, I can be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
Yes, I can be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
Yes, I can be

[Bridge]
See I can be anything I want to be
All I have to do is put my mind to it and I can do it
So what I want you to do is put your fist to the sky
And say it with me:

[Chorus 2]
I can be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
Yes, I can be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
Yes, I can be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
Yes, I can be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
Yes, I can be
I can be
There are times that I should go away
To think of you and I
For it isn't only now, I need your love
All of my life, all of my life

In the night time when I lie awake
And think of you in my heart
For it isn't only now, I need your love
All of my life, all of my life

Oh wouldn't you believe me if I told you
That I love you, and I do
Ev'ryone believes me when I tell them
Why don't you, why don't you

When I think of things that ought to be
And I feel your hand in mine
Yes it isn't only now, I need your love
All of my life, all of my life

La...
All of my life, all of my life
Oh wouldn't you believe if I told you
That I love you, and I do
Ev'ryone believes me when I tell them
Why don't you, why don't you

When I think of things that ought to be
And I feel your hand in mine
Yes it isn't only now, I need your love
All of my life, all of my life
All of my life
All of my life
All of my life

[Verse 1]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark
Finally, I see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, while I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus 1]
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it to the beat

[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
See me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there 'cause mine sure won't be shared

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus 2]
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it to the beat

We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

[Bridge]
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you're looking for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
Pay me back in time and reap just what you sow

[Breakdown]
You're gonna wish you never had met me
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You're gonna wish you...
You could have had it all

[Chorus 1]
You could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat

[Chopped vocals]

But what I hate the most is bitches who are fame hoes

Does everybody want to know
This is the way I lead my life - you know

And a little bit of stealing
You know that's the way I grew up

That's the way my mother taught me
There you go

Stealing
I gave you the key to my home
I left you alone in charge of my heart
Hey stealing
You got me wheeling and dealing
You play with my feelings
Right from the start

Can't afford to pay my rent

To get some money I owe - oho

Make some easy bread
Stealing is the only way that I know
Stealing yeah only way that I know
Yeah I like stealing baby stealing
I gave you both my heart and my home
Left you alone

Now get that key out of my heart
You're in charge of my heart

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
Myself! Myself!

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade, but then
I just end up getting hurt again

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
By myself (Myself), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself
(Myself), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't look around, it's too much to take in
I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I can't slow down, watching everything spin
I can't look back, starting over again

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
If I let them go, I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them, I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
By myself (Myself), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself
(Myself), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't look around, it's too much to take in
I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I can't slow down, watching everything spin
I can't look back, starting over again

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Know! I can't tell you how to make it
Go! No matter what I do, how hard I
Try! I can't seem to convince myself
Why! I'm stuck on the outside, don't you
Know! I can't tell you how to make it
Go! No matter what I do, how hard I
Try! I can't seem to convince myself
Why! I'm stuck on the outside, don't you
Know! I can't tell you how to make it
Go! No matter what I do, how hard I
Try! I can't seem to convince myself
Why! I'm stuck on the outside, don't you
Know! I can't tell you how to make it
Go! No matter what I do, how hard I
Try! I can't seem to convince myself
Why! I'm stuck on the outside, don't you
Know! I can't tell you how to make it
Go! No matter what I do, how hard I
Try! I can't seem to convince myself
Why! I'm stuck on the outside, don't you
Know! I can't tell you how to make it
Go! No matter what I do, how hard I
Try! I can't seem to convince myself
Why! I'm stuck on the outside

[Intro: Otis Williams and (Melvin Franklin)]
By and by, you knew that you'd make me cry (By and by, you knew you'd make me cry)
And my love for you will never die (My love will never, never die)
But I had to find out on my own

[Verse 1: Paul Williams and (The Temptations)]
(Check yourself, check yourself)
Aww, that's what they told me (Check yourself, check yourself)
I paid no mind (Check yourself, check yourself)
I kept on breaking hearts, (Check yourself, check yourself)
All down the line (Check yourself, check yourself)
Sometime, you just got to lose
That's when you pay your dues
I guess I was the fool, I guess I was the fool
To think that you'd stayed so true

[Verse 2: Paul Williams and (The Temptations)]
Aww, I really played in the game (Check yourself, check yourself)
I'd always win (Check yourself, check yourself)
Now the tables turn (Check yourself, check yourself)
And I'm on the losing end (Check yourself, check yourself)
Oh don't, feel sorry
I had it coming, it's true
'Cause I'm losing, yes, I'm losing, I'm losing you

[Bridge: Paul Williams]
Before I go, I'd like for you to know
You've had my heart from the very start
But there's one more thing, before we part
And that's I'm sorry, sorry, sorry to my heart

[Verse 3: Paul Williams and (The Temptations)]
Aww, I'm on my sad way (Check yourself, check yourself)
Because I know I'd lost your love (Check yourself, check yourself)
I'll take it like a man (Check yourself, check yourself)
But I'll be thinking of (Check yourself, check yourself)
The good times (Good times)
The bad times (Bad times)
But, good or bad, happy or sad
Of memories (Memories)
Sweet, sweet memories (Memories)
Aw, memories are all I have

[Outro: Paul Williams and (The Temptations)]
Aww, that's what they told me (Check yourself, check yourself)
That's what they told me (Check yourself, check yourself)
That's what they (Check yourself, check yourself)
What they told me (Check yourself, check yourself)
Hmmm
Love makes us whatever we want to be
You and me the tip of the top of the tree
We can hit the target the others aim for
Be whatever they put your name in the for a fame for
What we are is absolutely unique
Looking at the world from the peak of the peak
We're about to make us some history
So don't quiet it, just forget that wild on the story
Listen to my poor heart imploring
I just need to know you're adoring me
Cause love makes us whatever we want to be
Hail those famous lovers, they've met their match
There in kindergarten just starting from scratch
We're about to solve the great mystery
So don't fight it, only close while heaven's deciding
Watching stars and planets colliding
From this lovely rainbow we're riding free
Love makes us whatever we want to be
Love makes us whatever we want to be
Somewhere in the night
There must be someone for me
Somewhere in the night
Who knows where somewhere may be

Across the way
Or maybe way beyond the distant star
How I wish I knew
Just where and who you are

Somewhere in a dream
I find her here by my side
Then when I awake
My dream drifts out with the tide

My lonely heart keeps saying to me
"No, this doesn't seem right"
There must be someone
Somewhere in the night

Somewhere in a dream
I find her here by my side
Then when I awake
My dream drifts out with the tide
My lonely heart keeps saying to me
"No, this doesn't seem right"
There must be someone
Somewhere in the night

[Verse 1]
Stinky weather, fat shaky hands
Dopey morning Doc, grumpy gnomes

[Refrain]
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

[Verse 2]
Big screen dolls, tits and explosions
Sleepy time, bashful but nude

[Refrain]
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

[Verse 3]
Intergalactic, seeming to be you
It's all in the tablets, sneezy Bhutan

[Refrain]
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

[Verse 4]
Mars happy nation, sit on my karma
Dame meditation, take me away

[Refrain]
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

[Chorus]
Sending me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away

[Refrain]
Little wonder, little wonder you

[Chorus]
Sending me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away

[Outro]
Little wonder, little wonder you
You little wonder you
You little wonder, you little wonder you
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, you little wonder you

[Verse 1]
You could've written me a letter
You could've sang me a sad song
I thought that things were getting better, but no
Baby, I was so wrong
Never thought I could be so better
They say it ain't the same when the love's gone
I tried to force it but there's no moving on

[Pre-Chorus]
They say forgive and forget just to ease my mind
And living with regret is just a waste of time
But this misery is all that I've got

[Chorus]
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb
For thinking you could love me
You're so numb, you're so numb
You can't feel it so it's easy
My love's still here, but you're not there
You broke my heart, you don't care
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb
For thinking you could love me, no

[Verse 2]
Where was the whistle or the buzzer
To let me know that it's over?
Now I can't seem to get through the night
If her mind is over

What happened to the love?
When did I stop being enough?
'Cause damn, I been to every rehab
Nowhere to treat that sickness from your love a drug, woo

[Pre-Chorus]
They say forgive and forget just to ease my mind
And living with regret is just a waste of time
But this misery is all that I've got

[Chorus]
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb
For thinking you could love me
You're so numb, you're so numb
You can't feel it so it's easy
My love's still here, but you're not there
You broke my heart, you don't care
So dumb, I'm so dumb
For thinking you could love me
I, I, I
I'm so dumb, oh

[Bridge]
I had no choice to watch
As you ripped out and stole my heart
Over and over again
You made a fool of me

[Chorus]
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb (I'm so dumb)
For thinking you could love me (for thinking you could love me, yeah)
You're so numb, you're so numb
But you can't feel it so it's easy (but you can't feel it, baby)
My love's still here, but you're not there (no, oh)
You broke my heart, you don't care (you don't care)
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb
For thinking you could love me
Baby, I said baby
I'm gonna leave you baby
I'm gonna leave you baby
I'm gonna tie you up to the railroad tracks

I said baby, I said baby
I'm gonna leave you
I'm gonna leave you baby
I'm gonna tie you up to the railroad tracks

Gonna tie you up to the railroad tracks
I'm gonna tie you up
Leave you down there by the railroad tracks
When the train comes by, it's gonna take you away
Ooh yeah
There's hidden persuasion within your eyes
Your charming indifference is but a disguise
I would be glad to love you if love is in the deal
But I must feel quite certain that the love is so real

Your hidden persuasion seems quite sincere
Perhaps my evasion is meaningless fear
Since every gain requires the element of chance
Here's hoping at least we'll find romance

Instrumental

Your hidden persuasion seems quite sincere
Perhaps my evasion is meaningless fear
Since every gain requires that element of chance
Here's hopin' at least we'll find romance
Here is hoping at least we'll find romance
Gather you all and listen here
I'll tell you a tale if you lend me an ear
I rode a horse through many a town
But the devil rode me down to the ground
I was to marry a very rich girl
I loved her as only I can
But the father was shot and his gold was stoled
And now I'm the devil's man, na na na
And now I sing a tail of woe
Through the bars of the county jail

I walked into the room one night
I found her mother and gun
Well the man was dead and I kneeled and cried
The sheriff ran in and said I'm holding you, son

Through the day I sing and play
For time is on my side
But when the moon and stars come out
I lay me down and cry
For the Saviour mar I lied
Now I will not have a ride
Beside the window the scaffold was made
Virgil Kane is the name
And I served on the Danville train
'Till Stoneman's cavalry came
And tore up the tracks again

In the winter of '65
We were hungry, just barely alive
By May the 10th, Richmond had fell
It's a time I remember, oh so well

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, "Na, na, la, na, na, la"

Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me
"Virgil, quick, come see
There goes Robert E. Lee!"
Now, I don't mind chopping wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
You take what you need
And you leave the rest
But they should never
Have taken the very best

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing
They went, "Na, na, la, na, na, la"

Like my father before me
I will work the land
And like my brother above me
Who took a rebel stand

He was just 18, proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Kane back up
When he's in defeat

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing
They went, "Na, na, la, na, na, la"
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, "Na, na, la, na, na, la"

[Intro - Rick Ross]
Nigga, long as you livin' how you wanna live
Niggas gon' talk about you
And that's completely fine with me (Believe that, nigga)
Niggas only salute niggas that's dead, and niggas in prison (Living legends)
I wanna ball though

[Hook - Rick Ross]
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a yacht, Waikiki or not
Still sippin' that syrup, might front you a block
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a Benz, just bought me a Rolls
I pay for that pussy, I go shopping for hoes

[Verse 1 - Rick Ross]
I got a house on my neck, my Panamera my pet
We bought ringside seats, and got a brick I can pet
Money, power respect, I took your bitch with finesse
Chickens jumping like checkers, but this game is chess
What's at stake is your freedom, niggas paying the price
When the judge drop the mallet, all he said was life
Nigga damn near fainted, barely stare at your wife
Brother took all your clothes, whip, sneakers, and ice
Got me holding my nuts, while I'm rolling the dice
760 new Beamer, got me rolling in white
Very few that you trust, better keep in your sight
Thinking I'm doing wrong, when these niggas ain't right

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Meek Mill]
I just scooped me a BM
And bought me a Rolls
When I pulled up on niggas, I swear they thought I was Hov
All my mixtapes platinum, niggas thought I was gold
I heard them suckas was hatin', I'm fucking all of they hoes
So I don't blame 'em, no I don't knock 'em
But if they play my dogs, we slay 'em, I'm talkin' pop 'em
Want some attention, hall-of-fame 'em, they talkin' bout us
Acting like bitches 'til we spray 'em, get the coffin out ya
We all about it, ahhhhh
I'm ballin' till my very last breath
I hustle like I'm on my last check!
And I ain't even in my bag yet
I wake up in the morning, where the cash at, GO!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Rick Ross]
All I see is this money, never hate with your niggas
Better pray to your maker, before you war with the sinner
Ask forgiveness for mine, so I know that I'm good
All them niggas we robbed, trips T man took
Talkin' panhandle pimpin, niggas Chevy was lemon
Nigga dressing in linen, bases loaded first inning
Taking over the checks, relocating the tenants
Pulling open your vest, motivation is spinach
I gotta handle my business, I pay my mortgages first
When you cross a super-soaker I bet your water get burst
Ain't no love on this side, just jealous niggas who ride
Until the day that you die, just hold your head to the sky

[Verse 4 - Birdman]
Ballin' till my last breath
Uptown, flashy life with my Smith & Wess
Hallways, choppa boys everyday
Spend your bank full of hundred B's in your face
My lil nephew was a born killa
Real nigga on the field, killa kill nigga
'Til I showed him how to cook a bird
Killa nigga nigga only if I finna work
Matches up in every town
Puttin' it down, hold it down for my fuckin' rounds
All day gunplay, everyday rocked out nigga in every way

[Hook]
As I travel down the road and search the empty sky
Waiting for the moment when my eyes will see
Many are the memories the mysteries of time
How they dance around and whisper endlessly

Yes I've travelled down this road before
Where so many men have come and gone
But you know it takes time
(true love takes time)
You know that true love takes time
(true love takes time)
And it's so very hard to find
(true love takes time)
You know that love takes time

It seemed impossible that I could care again
So it seemed I had forgotten how to give
What is this miracle that brings me back my dreams
All at once I can remember how to live

Yes I've travelled down this road before
Where so many men have come and gone
But you know it takes time
(true love takes time)
You know that true love takes time
(true love takes time)
And it's so very hard to find
(true love takes time)
You know that true love takes time

I have been too much alone for oh so many years
Looking for someone to sing with me
Sweet harmony

My heart is open now and tender to the touch
But there is love enough to heal me in your hands
I'll give you all my nights
All my sun and rainy days
I'll give you all the time it takes to understand

We've travelled down this road before
Where so many fools have come and gone
But you know it takes time
(true love takes time)
You know that true love takes time
(true love takes time)
And it's so very hard to find
(true love takes time)
You know that true love takes time

(true love takes time)
(true love takes time)
(true love takes time)
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in h
