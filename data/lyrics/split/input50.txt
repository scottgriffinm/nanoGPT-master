Number Two!

[Verse 2: Jorma, Akiva, both]
Dude quit tripping, you're ruining my high
My loaded gun makes you reach for the sky
There's a knock at the door, who could that be?
Why won't the cops let our party be?
How would you like to be shot?
Me and my friend smoke pot
No jocks, no jerks, just fun with girls
Having fun Guy One?
"The most fun in the world!"

[Chorus: Jorma & Akiva]
We're Just 2 guys and who are having a good time
Having a good time, having a good time
We're Just 2 guys and who are having a good time
Having a good time, having a good time
We're Just 2 guys and who are having a good time
Having a good time, having a good time
We're Just 2 guys and who are having a good time
Having a good time, having a good time

[Outro: Jorma, Akiva, both]
Party over here

Party over here

[Intro: Young Thug]

[Chorus: Young Thug]
The way you doing your thang is because of me
The way you rockin' your chain is because of me
The way you ridin' this thang is because of me
The way I give you propane is because of me
The way I treat you the same is because of me
The way I act like a lame is because of me
The way I act like a lame is because of me
The way I do all my thangs is because of me
The way she ridin' that thang is because of me

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Fucked that bitch on the top shelf
Fucked that bitch on the refrigerator
Fucked that bitch on the kitchen floor
Fucked that bitch good, then I ate her (Woo)
Ate the bitch like a baconator
Dumb for her, Arnold Schwarzenegger
Thousand strokes, Comcast cable
Now she disabled
I won't get caught up in gettin' paper
She divin' on that dick, I'm divin' in that clit
That's it, that's it
Oh that's it, that's it, that's it, baby
Oh that's it, that's it, that's it, baby

[Chorus]
The way I give you propane is because of me

The way she ridin' this thang is because of me

[Verse 2: Birdman]

Never saw the new whip nigga
Never saw a Bugatti nigga
'Til I came up uptown in it
Glady's bar, that's fit nigga
AKs they hit nigga
Third ward high roller, that'll take it off of your shoulders
Filthy 'bout my bricks, bought a mansion with my chips
Bitches know we got it, so they love takin' that trip
Yacht niggas, them hella choppers
Pocket filled we never stop 'em
Blood gang with no rules, nigga
You fuck with us, it's shit poppin' (Let that shit breathe fool)
Every time we leave, nigga
Bitches now we bleed nigga
Third wall, we go eat
Fuck with us, you gon' sleep

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
You're so hood baby

Rock that chain baby
Get in that steering and get in that lane baby
File the complaint baby, baby, baby
You look so fuckable, adorable

Get it baby?
You look so daughter-able
You can have my daughter you can have my daughter
I swear to god I'ma spoil her, you know ain't gon' court her
I'm a baller, she's a playa like a rare disorder
You might catch me cookin' white, now that's that faint odor
(Brrrrr)
(Come here baby)

[Chorus]
The way I give you propane is because of me
The way I treat you the same is because of me
The way I act like a lame is because of me
The way I act like a lame is because of me
The way I do all my thangs is because of me
The way she ridin' this thang is because of me
Mamita why we gotta keep going through this
Talk to her Frankie

(verse 1)
Just Yesterday you said you loved me
That there was nobody else above me
That i was yours and you were mine
That there was no limits to our skies
But then you had to put our love on hold
When it came to making love it wasn't you anymore
And now your telling me to leave
I gotta walk out the door
Can't you see that this is killing me
Its hurting my soul
Oh baby

Frankie J & Ken Y

(Chorus)
How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you goooo
No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let you go
(Nooo)
Can't you see Im slowly dying
But Im gonna keep on trying
Please dont ask of me to let you goooo
Pitbull

(Verse 2)
Let me start
By telling you I love you with all my heart
But i can't understand the reason
When you tell me your leaving
Girl me and you were suppose to be forever and ever
Now instead of being in love
Its like we are use to each other
How could we do this to each other
We use to ride for each other
Die for each other
Cry for each other
Now its like all we wanna do is say is bye to each other
I can't let this happen
I refuse to lose you
I love you baby
Its the truth as usual
I wanna make you happy
Girl it ain't hard to see
You mean the world to me
We had been though it all
Thick or thin right or wrong
I can't let you go 'cause this love is too strong
Frankie J & Ken Y

(Chorus)
How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you go

No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let yo go
(Nooo)
Can't you see Im slowly dying
But Im gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you go

Pitbull

(Verse 3)
Look baby just tell me what you want
Look baby just tell me what you need
Look baby i know im far from perfect
But the game and the money they can take cause its worthless
I know its hard to deal with my life
I know its hard to deal with all the gossip
I done seen em wit this one
I done seen em wit that one
But everything they say is monotonous
Can't you hear it in my voice
Mami you know your my heart my soul my love
And I swear to you baby
I just want to give you my heart my soul my love
I know we can work this out
I know we can
Baby lets try
But one thing I won't do is let this love die
(Is let this love die)
Frankie J & Ken Y

(Chorus)
How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you goooo
No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let you go
(Nooo)
Can't you see Im slowly dying
But Im gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you goooo

Ken Y

(hook)
Believe me, yes Im trying to let you go
But the only thing I get from it is all this crying
Tell me how am I suppose to let you goooo
No no noooo

Frankie J & Ken Y

(Chorus)
How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you go
No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let you go
(Nooo)
Can't you see Im slowly dying
But Im gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you gooo
(no i just can't let you go)

[Intro]
Mic check
We're comin' live and direct from East Point Atlanta
Where OutKast is in the muthafuckin' house
With this funky fresh remix
Y'all know what it is
Cool Breeze in the house...

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Well, it's the M-I-crooked letter coming around the South
Rolling straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch
Please, ain't nothing but incense in my atmosphere
I'm bending corners in my 'Lac, boi
'Cause that's how we be rolling here
Deep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kicking the khakis and Adidas
Packing yo' heaters 'cause you 'sposed to, cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
See, juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning
Now I'm just a player sipping sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee
Niggas who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid 'cause it ain't nothing to see

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No, my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid
Jump and you'll get too sprayed
Who raise yo' block? The one and only OutKast
Many a nigga falling fast and I continue blasting, swiftly
They ain't gon' get me, got something fo' em
The devil up in yo' grill and you still don't even know 'em
Show 'em who's the OK
Like collard greens and Hoecakes, I got soul
That's something that you ain't got
That's why your style is rot–ten
Stop in the land of ATL
Where nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale
Swell, swollen got my pockets, business booming like rockets
Folks try to stop it but they know that it's that

[Chorus: Choir]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We're gonna get cha high, high

[Verse 3: Andre 3000]
Time to drop these 'bows like Dusty Rhodes
Then I yell "ho," and knock 'em up off they feet
Like a Southern hustler supposed to do
I's in the house like... a joint is lit for my kinfolks
And all the niggas that was down since we been broke
Taking 'em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
Look, my crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham
I'm packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong
Word is bond like super glue, it's funky like poopa scoop
And every word I say you can true

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Well, okey dokey, 'Kast out
I swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac
The expialalistic Coupe de Ville, can you handle that, you rat?
I take my time cruising 'round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge, P-U-M-P
You want to do a jack, I heat the barrel 'til it's empty, get me?
See, I ain't Finlay, getting in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the Southernplayalistic shit
So copy my slang and bite my shit but don't try gaffling me
'Cause sleeping you'll get served with some Southern hospitality

[Chorus: Choir]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We're gonna get cha high, high

[Verse 5: Big Boi]
Well, Southernplayalisticadillac music has been laid
I may wait for all day and day, be rolling like that today, hoe
So back up off it, get up on it if you want it, y'all
Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball, yup
So now I step, rather walk with the pimp limp
While my niggas are at East Point with that College Park hemp
Smoked out is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac

[Verse 6: Andre 3000]
Step up in my shoes, you crews sitting on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through
Atlanta skies be blue, the sun is beaming, it's seeming
That I'm glistening, rather gleaming
20/20 got me leaning to the side, full of pride
Now ain't that something?
I'm dipping into your hood, this ain't Braille, but I'm bumping
Thumping out the roaches, Dungeon if y'all missed it
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, PA, OutKast, Southernplayalistic

[Chorus: Choir]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We're gonna get cha high, high

It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music

We're gonna get cha high, high

[Outro]
Ah yeah
East Point, College Park, Decatur, the whole Atlanta...
Everybody gettin' a little piece of this one
In this farewell, there's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret from the truth of a thousand lies

So let mercy come, and wash away what I've done
I'll face myself, to cross out what I've become
Erase myself, and let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate with the hands of uncertainty

So let mercy come, and wash away what I've done
I'll face myself, to cross out what I've become
Erase myself, and let go of what I've done

For what I've done, I'll start again, and whatever pain may come
Today, this ends, and forgiving what I've done
I'll face myself, to cross out what I've become
Erase myself, and let go of what I've done
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
What I've done
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Forgiving what I've done
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na)

[Verse 1]
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies

[Pre-Chorus]
So, let mercy come
And wash away what I've done

[Chorus]
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Verse 2]
Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty

[Pre-Chorus]
So, let mercy come
And wash away what I've done

[Chorus]
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Bridge]
For what I've done, I'll start again
And whatever pain may come
Today, this ends
And forgiving what I've done

[Chorus]
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Outro]
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)
What I've done
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)
Forgiving what I've done
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)
And these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go, go, go

I finally let you go

This time I finally let you

Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?
I've seen that frustration
Been crossed and lost and told "No"
And I've come back unshaken
Let down and lived and let go
So you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone
I can't fall back, I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there saying
And these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you go
Go, go, go

Oh oh oh

This time I
This time I
This time I
This time I
This time I finally let you go

This time I finally let you
Go
(Go)

(Promises, promises)
And these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you go
Go, go, go
Turn It Up

Big wheels keep on turning
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the Southland
I miss ol'Bamee once again
And I think its a sin, yes

Well I heard Mister Young sing about her
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet Home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the governor, booo hooo hooo
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet Home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Here I come, Alabama

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two
(yes they do)
Lord they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue
Now how about you?

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet Home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

Sweet home Alabama
Oh sweet home
Where the skies are so blue
And the governor's true
Sweet Home Alabama
Lordy
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Yeah, yeah
(Ed King, Johnny Van-Zant)

Two young lovers meet and take each others hand
They say I do in the name of the Lord
Livin' as one givin' all they can
Then the pressures come and a child is born
Young girl cradles the child in her arms
The man's home late and his day's too long
They're both unable to spend some time alone
That everybody needs to have
That's the thing that keeps love strong

(chorus)
Love don't always come easy
And sometimes love it can hurt
Words don't always come easy
It's worth a try we're gonna make it work
'Cause love don't always come easy

Without warning many go a different way
And travel that road lookin' for someone
Their lives unravel a little more every day
This ain't no time to turn and run
It's a crime to throw it all away
(repeat chorus)
Yea man, ill smoke wit chu you know what im sayin?

---

[Verse 1]
Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Interlude]
The one, (the one), the one, (the one)
The one, the one, the one, the one, the one

[Bridge]
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away, whoa

[Outro]
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Talking]
I hate gossip… and I don’t walk around
Looking for it ya know
But yesterday it seemed to just wonder
Around until it found me
You know like gossip found me
And why don’t you try it
Huh, you don’t know
Well what you just do is…
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop

[Lil Wayne
Verse1]
Stop, hating on a nigga
Dat is a weak emotion, da lady of a nigga
And you can tipped like ya waitin on a nigga
Putta body bag and a apron on a nigga…
I give my all behind da mic
But you could never see if you sit behind da light
And you don’t have to pick me to win da title fight
But I’mma wear dat champion belt sooo tight
And if I’m wrong there is no right
And if I’m wrong there is snow white
I’m tryna be po-lite but you bitches in my hair
Like da fucking po-lice And my flow is rare
These other rappers nice, these other rappers bark
Some of ‘em even bite
But I’m much more bright I give the game sight
But before you dim the lights you just might, might, wanna

[Singing]
Think it over, think it over (Oooooo)
Think it over, think it over (Baby, baby)

[Lil Wayne
Verse 2]
Stop… analyzin’ critacizin’
You should realize what I am and start epitomizin’
Legitimate, I got the heart of the biggest lion
I’m confident like fuck em all pull out my dick and ride it
My flow sick, so sick, it’s like my shit is dyin’
It rains a lot in my city, cause my city’s cryin’
Because my city’s dyin’
Still I emerge from all of that I am a living pion-eer, near Zion
Fear God, not them
Steer my Robin Coupe through the streets of the boot… and
Soo-woo
And, then I leave blood in the booth, I leave a blood bath
Sorry there’s a tub in the booth, now where the drugs at?
I’m twisted like the string on a shoe
No nigga fuck dat
I’m twisted like the string on a boot, now where New Orleans at?
I feel hip hop stole me like a bus pass
So in your possession, I, I, I must ask…

[Singing]
Hey, haven’t I been good to you? (Think it over)
Tell me; haven’t I been sweet to you?

[Wayne:]
Drag my name through the mud
I come out clean
Cast away stones
I won’t even blink
A gun is not a math problem
I won’t even think
Just leave you dead like the mink under my sink
Don’t believe in me
Don’t believe me
I graduated from hungry
And made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta
Take it and eat it
But I’m gone need cheese if I’m bakin’ lasini
You niggas want beef?
I want a steak and uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where we be
Hard body nigga, just taken it easy
All about my paper, bout my paper like Easy
Why do rappers Why to rappers, lie to fans
Lie to rappers, a lot rappers lie like actors cut the mothafuckin camera
Cut the checks nigga fuck your props
And make it out to Mr. Hip-Hop
Feels like we can kiss the sky
Baby baby we can get so high
So high yeah, so high yeah

[Lauryn Hill]
You so conscious and self aware
I'm next to you, I hold your back
And you express pure ecstasy
It's more than just the sex to me
Cause mentally you take me there
(take me there, take me there, take me there)
Yo, I pretended to be unaffected
You intended to be respected
I commend your focus, you did fear to be rejected
So you approached me while other men remained intimidated
Glad you did cause once you came
You got much more than anticipated
And its true
I got the mind of a genius
And every time we kiss
We feel the magnetic field we got between us
I think it's something to witness your vulnerability
The definition of a real man he can acknowledge how he feels for me
I'm fascinated with your manhood exploration
Your transparent language, how you articulate the situation
And I can see it in your stare, in your air
I love the texture of your hair
Statuesque black and beautiful like classical architecture
Yeah

[Legend]
Baby since the day you came into my life
You made me realize that we were born to fly
You showed me everyday new possibilities
And you proved my fantasies what love could really be
Let's go to a place only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of the cloud we're floating away

Ooh this feels so crazy, oh, this love is blazing
Baby we're so high, walking on cloud 9
You got me up so high
So high
My shoes are scraping the sky
So high
You got me up so high
Oh
My shoes are scraping the sky

Maybe later we can go up to the moon
Or sail among the stars before the night is through
And when morning comes we'll see the sun is not so far
And we can't get much closer to God than where we are
We'll go to a place where only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of the clouds we're floating away
Ooh this feels so crazy, oh this love is blazing
Baby we're so high, walking on cloud 9
You got me up so high
So high
My shoes are scraping the sky
So high
You got me up so high
Oh
My shoes are scraping the sky

Oooh, yeah
Ooooo-ooh oh
Oooh this feels so crazy, how this love is blazing
Baby we're soo high, walking on cloud 9
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
My shoes are scraping the sky
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
My shoes are scraping the sky
Ooooh yeeaah
Mmmhaaaah ay
Yeah...
This is how love suppose to be
This is how, this is how love suppose to be
Let's go to the moon baby,oooh

Welcome to my hood
(Where the hood at)
(Where the hood at)
Welcome to my hood
Everybody know everybody
And if I got it everybody got it
Welcome to my hood
Look at all these old school Chevy’s
24′s so you know we roll heavy
Welcome to my hood
They outside playing hopscotch
And every know this is the hot spot
Welcome to my hood
Them boys will put you down on your knees
(Woop, woop) That’s the sound of the police
In my hood

[Rick Ross]
Audemar on my wrist
Diamond, look like they glowing
50 stacks, all singles, I make it look like its snowing
Black unmarked cars, gotta peep how they playin’
Treat ‘em like jack boys, catch ‘em slippin’ then slay ‘em
Lord forgive me for my sins
That’s my confessions if they put me in this benz
I got possession of a federal offence
I’m talking pressure in my criminal intent
So wear ya vest’s and I’m still gon’ stunt
Like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck ya house note nigga
Blow that bitch on a bottle
The Ferrari just a front, got the Lambo in the back
Tell you “we the best forever” DJ Khaled handle that

[T-Pain - Chorus]

[Plies]
I know some niggas from my hood that would rob Norieaga
I’m talkin’ Norieaga, nigga, the real Norieaga
If you ain't from the hood, bitch, than stop impersonating us
And tell congress when you see ‘em bitch I’m stealin’ cable
And leave the D-Boys alone ’cause they motivate us
And why is the half of my whole hood on papers
Some are on house arrest, some are on child support
Some of ‘em did they bit, the other half waiting to go to court
Mr Landlord we gon bust your ass with an eviction note
Better have the police with you dog, if you came to repo
I’m talking strip clubs, I’m talking liquor stores
We throw our money round here, but y’all can…

[T-Pain - Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Bitch I’m on probation, so my nerves bad
And they say time fly’s, well mine’s first class
I landed in the sky, I fell from the streets
I talk a lot of shit and practice what I preach
Back from hell, cell 23, tell the warden kiss my ass
Pockets on Monique
Bitch I’m from the murder capital
Hoe, I’m far from practical
Shit happens and since I’m the shit, I’m who it happens to
Young Money, Cash Money, blood bitch, I’m red hot
I don’t see nobody, see nobody like a head shot
All that bullshit is for the birds, throw some bread out
Got it sewn up, check the thread count

[T-Pain - Chorus]
John Henry was a little baby
Sitting on his papa's knee
Well he picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel
Says this hammer's going to be the death of me
Hammer's going to be the death of me
Hammer's going to be the death of me
Hammer's going to be the death of me

John Henry said to his captain now a man ain't nothing but a man
Before I let your steel drill bring me down
I will die with that hammer in my ...
I will die with that hammer in my hand
I will die with that hammer in my hand
I'll die with that hammer in my hand

John Henry said to his shaker
Now shaker why don't you sing
I'm shaking twelve pounds from my hip onnnn down
Now don't you hear that cold steel ring
Don't you hear that cold steel ring
Don't you hear that cold steel ring
Don't you hear that cold steel ring
John Henry hammered in the mountain and the mountain it was so high
And the last word that I heard that poor man cry
He says give me a cool drink of water before I die
Give me a cool drink of water before I die
Give me a cool drink of water before I die
Give me a cool drink of water before I die

John Henry went down that railroad track with a twelve pound hammer by his side
Yes he went down the track but he never came back
Because he laid down his hammer and he
He laid down his hammer and he
He laid down his hammer and he died
He laid down his hammer and he died

John Henry had a little woman
And the dress she wore was red
And that last words that I heard that poor girl said
She says I'm going where John Henry fell dead
I'm going where John Henry fell dead
I'm going where John Henry fell dead
I'm going where John Henry fell dead
Mary, you make me wanna eat you
Everytime I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Frangrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see through
Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, perplexin like Acapulco Gold
If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer-load
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit while you would've sold to the highest bidder like
Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight, lettin everybody hit it
I like Ally, sometimes she gets bitter
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her to this day, and never did abuse her
I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably coulda been, if I never meet Eevee
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though
Kept a shorty, can't find 'em much thinnner
If caught I get mad time just for touchin her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds
Little young thing, she likes to do the tounge thing
At times, she would play hard to get, grunting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling
Met her at Central Park this one time
Had the God mentally sparked, reflectin sunshine
She said, you need to stop messin wit that white girl
She fuckin wit ya head and got ya heart in tight curl
We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the dutch price OT
Plus she from Columbia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish
And Miss Hazy, all the women mature black
Everytime she sees me, I end up gettin pulled back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy
Sugar-mommy laced me with the butter navy Avi
Just her way to makeup for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on
WomanChild staggers
A hesitative step
How can they expect a girl to walk in stride
She can’t stand erect without someone beside
WomanChild falters
Clumsy on her feet
Wonderin’ where she’ll go
When her time has come
Good she’ll never know
Until she comes undone
WomanChild staggers

I ate your face off
You niggas sweet as pie like this is a bake off
I love Nicki's curves, swing at the baseball
Errrrrrr!
I beat your brakes off
H-H-Hi, I'm Tune', salt in the wound
I'm up in this bitch, pardon the goons
Throw dirt on the floor and get caught in the broom
I like a big wet pussy with a fork and a spoon
I got money and the power
A woman in the shower
And she don't want nothin' but my johnson, Howard
Sour D's and a swisher sweet, sweet and sour
You scared? Go to church, say your prayers, read a Bible

Huh, I don't know what y'all on
Please, I go in like goin'
Drink drink in my hand with the world in the other
The uzi go brrrrrrr, stutter
Ha, life is a puzzle, jigsaw
All I do is win, my name should be Victor
Old-ass rappers, I'm still the shit, old-ass Pampers
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Foie gras, I hear you ducks is quackin'
I'm just pluckin' my ashes, I'ma puff it and pass it
I'm a f-ckin' assassin, you should jump in a casket
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Okay it's Oh Eight

Life in the fast-lane, little red corvette
Little red handkerchief, hangin out the right side
Back pocket jeans fallin, Couple my evisu signed
Yep we do shine, and they gon hate
But they hated Jesus baby we won't break
So we ride like 4 Pirellis
So secured no security, no protectin no comparing
Lok and heavy, Ocean 11
Aviators, both tickers, so figures
No playas, Im Hollygrove to the heart
Hollygrove from the start
Dont cross Earhardt
Boulevard where the ward I come from
17, one shot, never that (blum blum)
Brrrt Brrrt! Pop Pop! Clap Clap!
What the fuck, Hollygrove stand up Nigga!

[Chorus]
Get em get em Weezy hit em where you kill em easy
Sit em in the river, leave em, they find em tomorrow evening, sinkin
Im probly drinkin that syrup
Thinkin I won't slip, even though Im leanin like a broke hip
He dont know I got the nina wit the full clip
Thats a somersault back spin full flip for ya?
Push this button, I flip out and hit something
Miss nothin i'm just bustin until this scene clean
12 hundred for the jeans stop playin
Hundred dollars for the Glock in my pants
Who the man? I am when I stand with it pointed right at ya face
Knock the brains from the back of ya neck for lack of respect
I- strap a jet black gat til the deck
Tell the mama to bury me with that, No Bullshittin
My hood getting kinda crazy where I be
So Ronie's with me 'cause he's the OG

[Chorus]
Fresh out the back seat of the figgity phantom
The haters I make em mad em when I wave at em like what up?!
If it ain't about money I keep goin
I tryna get that green, niggas tryna mow my lawn
But Fuck, them boys I got the shottie on my arm
If them boys run up I leave their bodies on the lawn
And Duck the fuck out a there, 'cause baby its hot out there
If this was a movie its time to roll the credits, cut!
Its all over, all of ya brains is all over the motherfuckin block!
Im a motherfuckin rock!
Hard body eagle street 17 shots
Night vision double-clip, hot steady beam, glat! Pop!
Drop little man drop
This is not for little bitches you man or a fox
Im layin in the drop, thinking of more money
Cash money, young money
Take money, your money

[Chorus]
It seems like lately time be beatin' my ass
Every step is like a right hook from Iron Mike Tyson in his prime
It's like my mind is on a tredmill
I'm sweatin' bullets
See the plug but I can't pull it
This belt just keeps bringin' me back
And every minute is like a 'tiger uppercut' from Sagat
I'm up against these ropes
And ain't no tellin' if I win or not
These gloves are getting heavy
It's fight or flight you know how that goes
Facin' clocks is chasin'
Got me dodgin' obstacles
And every hour is like a tightrope I walk with greasy shoes
Still yet I got my conscience tellin' me that I can't lose
So every time I start slippin' ego's start trippin'
I focus real hard and levitate just like I'm GOD
And I'm livin' lovely
I'm in the clouds no one above me
With the gift to differentiate snakes from those that love me
There's a thin line between happiness and hopeless
An even thinner line between on point and out of focus
BUT Back to my story about my fall from glory
And how I levitate from the fate time put before me
They say 'Be patient'
But what the fuck is patience when my heart is racin'?
Put yourself in my situation
Try to be humble
You won't refrain from getting' pissed
When you look down to see you're fallin' right through time's abyss
And start to see visions
Memories you really miss, simple things
Like your first birthday wish
Your first girlfriend
Your first love
Your first French kiss
Your first time feeling hate
The first time you got dissed
Your first day of school
Your very first college class
Your first time touchin' titties
First time you got ass
Your first time learnin' wrong from right
First lonely night
The first time you got your ass whooped in
Your first real fight
Your first triple-double dare
Your first pubic hair
Your first time watchin' Jason
Your first nightmare

That's when you realize that time was your worst nightmare
And now you're stuck asking yourself 'Why ain't life fair?'
You get closer to the bottom
See the end of your line
Your first time ever losin' this battle with time
But right before you meet your death
One more memory left
The only one that's obsolete was your first breath
One moon to the next
Clocks switch when you least expect it and make the simplest shit complex
The baby face got the planet fooled
Books get judged by the covers worldwide, coincide with the illest
The real is just fictional dreams
No time to deal with two dimensional fiends, shit hit's the fan with every click of a hand
I'll be a man eventually
When the kid in me is satisfied, but 'til the day arrives all I got is eighty-five

A clock can kill motivation
That's why I'm never rockin' a watch
What's a deadline when you're living on your own time?
I'm livin' slow, Peter Pan style son
You didn't know I never grow up
My mind is set at six years old
As far as I'm concerned this grown-up shit is for the birds
So pass the skittles
JuJu Fruits, the Now N Laters, and Nerds
I'm eatin' sweets until my teeth fall out and I can't see
And I'm deaf in my left ear but my right can hear cause
I'm livin' happily. So why you mad at me?
Cause your frustrations gave you grey hairs
99% of your life's spent chasin'
American nightmares, (GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE)
I'm crazy childish, just check the habits
I play with my food, pick my nose, and eat it damn it
Plus I pick my scabs, I be the first to pop a blister
Cause I'm more immature than that cat from Sister-Sister
If my parents tell me no I'm gonna do it anyway
Experience will make more sense than anything that they could ever say
Forever playin' video games until I'm sleepy
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, please
You'll never beat me
So basically you're better off paying a bill or somethin'
Your mind is elderly, forty over the hill or somethin'
I'm young at heart
I'ma forever be a kid I'm on some Tom Hanks shit
You ever seen the movie big?
My heart is trapped in '85 the coolest place I've ever been in my life
We watchin' Smurfs, eatin' cinnamon LIFE
Never knew a crack rock, cause it was Fraggle
The only pink pussy we knew was Snaggle
Your mind's in the dirt
We playin' Hungry-Hippo's 'til our hands hurt
What do you know about pourin' out a whole box of Trix to get the toy out
(Scared to) go to sleep cause somethin's under your bed
(And all it) took was one look to get them thoughts out your head
(And then ya') fall right to sleep without a worry in mind
(That's why I) Can't understand why cat's be hurryin' time
And I don't wanna grow up I'm a Crab Apple Kid
And I enjoy the company of people I relate wit'
But if it comes down to it
To deal with cat's that I despise
I just close my eyes and drift away to Eighty-Five

One moon to the next
Clocks switch when you least expect it and make the simplest shit complex
The baby face got the planet fooled
Books get judged by the covers worldwide, coincide with the illest
The real is just fictional dreams
No time to deal with two dimensional fiends, shit hit's the fan with every click of a hand
I'll be a man eventually
When the kid in me is satisfied, but 'til the day arrives all I got is eighty-five

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out
What now?
Please tell me
What now?

[Drop: Firebeatz & Rihanna]
What now?

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out
What now?
Please tell me
What now?

[Drop: Firebeatz & Rihanna]
What now?
First off I'm a muthafuckin'

You want this whopper come and get your beef nigga

So everytime you hear mine get your hand to your hairline

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm in this bitch
Sending champagne to my enemy's
Salute or shoot you choose mu'fucka'
Bow down till your head touch your shoes mu'fucka'
Salute me, salute me, salute me, salute me
Salute or shoot you choose mu'fucka'
Bow down till your head touch your shoes mu'fucka'
Salute me
Now just say hello to the Captain
And I stay away from magnets cause that metals what I'm packin'
Bet your brains on your shirt will look like jello on a napkin
And I promise my fellows will put your fellow on a canvas
Call me Wezezy F baby Young Money army, betta' yet Navy
Fab' I got 'em
And watch me get 'em
And I do 'em
How I did 'em
And tool inside my denim
I shoot everything but woman and kids
Bitch niggas stop bitchin' it's just how it is
Now watch me let that sexy Nina kiss you by my ribs
You won't be satisfied till I send a missile by your crib
Shoot you in the stomach now your pissin' out your ears
Hollygrove all day bodies in the hallway
And if you come searchin' then your finding out the hard way (ugh)
No matter where your from you better recognize a real
Nigga when you see one
Salute me

[Chorus]
At second thought I got the heart of a solider
Told ya I ain't gon' play y'all
My mind has gon' awall
Find it I will pay y'all
My money is yay tall okay y'all
A smidget stack is midget mack
That mean it's gon' stay small
Told dem I don't see nobody
I'm a rappin' Ray Charles (I don't see nobody)
I think I need a seein' I dog
Come to being fly dog

Gucci jean suit, keep a couple thousand in 'em
Came up hard, handle food in the refrigerator
Now these haters can't breath need a respirator
Women beep me every time they see me
Sippin' DP on my way to DC

Pretty bitches say I'm crazy out in ACL
Fuck the bullshit baby I'm about mine

Money on my mind, pussy on my radar
Bitch I'm getting paid, I'm on my Bernie Madoff
Money talks, bullshit walks, cut the legs off
Aim at your egg, turn that shit to eggnog
And if I fall, my money is my cushion
Niggas can't see me like they not looking
To the red flag, a pledge of allegiance
Y'all bitches don't want beef like vegans
I don't have a care and if I do I take care of it
Haters dead waiting I ain't with that pall bearer shit
Never played lotto, I don't believe in luck
They tried to send me sugar, wasn't sweet enough
Maino whats poppin? Hustle hard nigga

We getting money like we never heard of the feds
The black Bentley Coupe rollin' like the Batmobile

Push the button in the doors to about face

And I was like goddamn, drop that, pop that
Got the top back, on a drop back, I'm back

A troupe of strolling players are we, not stars like L. B. Mayer's are we
But just a simple band who roams about the land
Dispensing plentyof frivolity
Mere folks who give distraction are we, yes, and give attraction are we, oh shut up, man
But just a crazy group, that never seeks to sosoup
Around a pack of little on a leash
Well,. here we go, back to the home country again
We open in Venice, we next play Verona, then on to Cremona
Lots of laughs in Cremona, eh boys, our next jump in Parma, that dopy mopie menace
And Mantua and Padua, and then we open again. where?
We open in Venice, we next play Verona, then on to Cremona
Lots of bars in Cremona, our next jump is Parma, that tearless fearless menace
And Mantua, and Padua, then we open again. Where?
We open in Venice, we next play Verona, then on to Cremona
Lots of money in Cremona, our next jump in Parma, that's ingie pingie menace
Then Mantua, then Padua, and then we open again, where?
We open in Venice, we next play Verona, then on to Cremona
Lots of players in Cremona, our next jump in Parma, that heartless artless menace
Then Mantua, then Padua, the we open again. Where?
Oh, let me see now, I got a map, let's pick out someplace
Well just don't dicado back on the line now, oh let's take the first canyon out of here
As a matter fact if we hurry we can beat the sack, for the chef's out there waiting for us
Goodbye boys, gida, gida, gida

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money
Maybe we're ragged and funny
But we'll travel along, singin' a song, side by side

Through all kinds of weather, what if the sky should fall?
Just as long as we're together, it really doesn't matter at all

When they've all had their quarrels and parted
We'd be the same as we started
Just trav'lin' along, singin' a song, side by side

Through all kinds of weather, what if the sky should fall?
Just as long as we're together, it really doesn't matter at all

When they've all had their quarrels and parted
We'd be the same as we started
Just trav'lin' along, singin' a song, side by side

They say
Rivers gonna run though, work is gonna save you
Pray and you will pull through, suck a dick'll help you
Don't let 'em get to you, if he's got one you get two
Backstab your crew, sell it I could sell you

We hate to leave
But when they give you leave,you gotta leave
Oh our hearts bleed for all you guys aboard
But right now sympathy is a thing we can't afford
We hate to leave, we hate to leave
Without you guys along, we'll even grieve
But we'll be back, yes, we'll be back
Before we're even missed
And tell you guys about the gals out there that we have kissed
We'll even say, we'll even say
We really hate to leave
(You know, Clarence, I hate the thought of going ashore,)
(And leave these guys here sitting in their undershirts)
(We gotta meet all those beautiful dames in their soft silk dresses,)
(But duty is duty, and an order is an order)
(Now I know some guys get a thrill out of meeting)
(A gorgeous gal every night.)
Oh, we hate to leave, we hate to leave
But when they give you leave, you gotta leave
No more pin-up gals that we so enjoy
Tonight, my boy, we get to meet the real McCoy
We hate to leave, we hate to leave
But we'll be back before the night is here
We want to stay, we want to stay
Our hearts are with the ship
But the Admiral made us take this leave
Or he'll beat us with a whip
We'd rather stay, we'd rather stay
Oh we really hate to leave
The bells, the bells, ringing everywhere for the sound of christmas is in the air
The bells, the bells, from the steeple above, telling us it's the season of love
Ring out, let the tale be told that inspires the dream of the young and old
Love, love, let your hearts unfold, for the bells of christmas are ringing
The bells, the bells, on a wintry night, with the friendly fire burning warm and bright
The bells, the bells, on the steeple above, telling us it's the season of love
Ring out, let the tale be told, that inspires the dream of the young and old

Love, love, let your hearts unfold, for the bells of christmas are ringing
The bells, the bells, they've been here and now, to a world that almost forgotten how
The bells, the bells, from the steeple above, telling us it's the season of love
Ring out, let the tale be told that inspires the dream of the young and old
Love, love, let your hearts unfold, for the bells of christmas are ringing
The bells of christmas are ringing

[Verse 1]
We are a generation twisted by a myth
Confused and ludicrous
Holding on to love
Consumed by all the pleasures in our midst
A life without the lips we've kissed, and losing all control

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna start a resistance
So we want independence
We're gonna give the world some of this

[Chorus]
Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love, solitude, and happiness
Electric kiss

[Verse 2]
Fame is our felony
We're so in love with it
Some superstars and masochists who don't know where to go
But the poets and the fathers of our time
Put down their weapons in their arms, and know what they must do

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna start a resistance
So we want independence
We're gonna give the world some of this

[Chorus]
Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love, solitude, and happiness

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love, solitude, and happiness
Electric kiss

[Intro]
This is a story about a girl named Lucky

[Verse 1]
Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for

[Pre-Chorus]
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

[Chorus]
"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

[Verse 2]
Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops?

[Pre-Chorus]
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

[Chorus]
"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

[Interlude]
"Best actress, and the winner is, Lucky!"
"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News, standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky"
"Oh my God, here she comes!"

[Bridge]
Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there is nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?
And they say

[Chorus]
"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?

Ah ha, ah ha, ah ha, ah ha

[Verse 1]
There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain (And the ones that observe)
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the back seat (Gotta be first, oh-oh)
I'm like the ring leader, I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot, hot, hot, hot
Firecracker, I make it hot, hot, hot, hot
Firecracker, I make it hot, hot, hot, hot
There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain (And the ones that observe)
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the back seat (Gotta be first, oh-oh)
I'm like the ring leader, I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot, hot, hot, hot
The ring leader, I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot, hot, hot, hot

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah ha, ah ha, ah ha, ah ha
Ah ha, ah ha, ah ha, ah ha

[Chorus]
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

[Verse 2]
There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me (And ones that are scared)
So, baby, I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware
I'm like the ring leader, I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot, hot, hot, hot
The ring leader, I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot, hot, hot, hot
There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain (And the ones that observe)
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the back seat (Gotta be first, oh-oh)
I'm like the ring leader, I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot, hot, hot, hot
The ring leader, I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot, hot, hot, hot

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah ha, ah ha, ah ha, ah ha
Ah ha, ah ha, ah ha, ah ha

[Chorus]
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus
After the show it's the after party then
After the party it's the hotel lobby and
After the Belve' then it's probably Cris'
And after the original it's probably this (fiesta)
Yes ma, Bed-Stuy, fiesta
Remix with the homie from the Midwest side
Game recognize game, hoes do too
It's the new 2 Live Crew, I suppose you knew
So thugs, pop yo' toasters, but don't approach us or
Bullets'll chase you like Moet mimosas
Catch us both coasts, racin' twin Porsche's
Boxes with Glocks that'll pop ya to make ya ghost-es
Whoever come closest you've been warned
But niggas don't get the picture 'til the weapons is drawn
Make your way backstage, baby girl it's on
And we'll be drinkin' 'til six in the mornin'
In the back of the club with ma-ma
Poppin' bottles of Cris with ma-ma
Put the bar on the tab for ma-ma
Throwin' hundreds up for grabs for ma-ma
Cause it's about to go down tonight
I'm a be drinkin' 'til the early liz-ight (that's right)
Nigga high like a muh'fuckin ki-zite
Take three honies just to make me feel ri-zight
My, my, my, my
It's what they all say when they see the frozen ice
They say my, my, my, my
Anytime they see them big things only cause I
While y'all gotta club date, I'm fuckin' wit arenas
Gotcha man sayin' "Kelly have you seen her?"
Yeah she wit me on the low
Gettin' high off the 'dro, got her knees on the flo'
Fiesta, fiesta, fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta
Switchin' lanes in my Six, in the 'burbs
I met a broad named Tasha, in the 'burbs
Took the hood then I moved it, to the 'burbs
Now no more sheriffs or polices, in the 'burbs (that's right)
And we about to tear this club up
Don't worry 'bout expenses cause I got that sho' 'nough
Ready to BOO like I'm fresh outta jizzail
I need some WOO from all the honey's on the DL
I said my, my, my, my (yeah)
It's what them thugs yellin' when the strippers on fizzles
They say my, my, my, my (yeah)
Got Kisha yellin' from that up and down sizzle
While y'all gotta club date, I'm fuckin' wit arenas
Gotcha man sayin' "Kelly have you seen her?"
Yeah she wit me on the low
Gettin' high off the 'dro, got her knees on the flo'
I put the big body up, come through in a Rover
Not only Kelly and Gotti, it's Boo and Hova
Pop Cris if you like, my ice glist' in the light
I'm wit Roc-Land right, so I'm rich for life
I'm like Heaven, everybody wanna get to me
How you make it to the gates and forget the key?
I'm the one God chose so you blessed through me
Gotti Floyd getchu higher than that ecstasy
Hey yo I come through stunnin'
Plus I'm gettin' blunted in the new six-hundred with the big rims on it
We rock rocks that'll light ya shoulders
Gotta lotta hot cars but the drops is colder (ah)
You see V-I-P me, Kelly, Gotti, and Hov'
Drinkin' Cris' like its H-2-O
All we do is spend cheese cause we love the dough
Mami roll more trees before it's time to go
If you got cash money then you feel this shit
And if you rollin' on them things then you feel this shit
If you drunk off in the club then you feel this shit
If you'se a motherfuckin' thug then you feel this shit
If you smokin' on some 'dro then you feel this shit
And if you off that ecstasy you got's to feel this shit
If you sippin' on some Cris' you got's to feel this shit
And if you throwin' up and shit, you got's to feel this shit
Fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta
Yeah, yeah that sho' feel good
Hello! I go by the name of simply Cee-Lo Green
How do you do? Welcome
I thought I'd seize this opportunity to tell you
A little more about myself if you don't mind
This is my vision, you know what I'm saying?
Check me out now
I have millenniums of material and rivers of rhythm
An entire ocean of emotion that's enlightening to swim in
Also a forest of feeling, beaten paths of peace
Trapped inside my silhouette, I have to speak to release
Demanding more from the pen than I whore from the pen
The line between playing to win and sin is thin
But I walk it with grace and I talk it with taste
I am that raw, simply put and I rest my case
It's elementary, yet far more than resources to pay the rent for me
Everything that I've done is divine, ask God, he'll tell ya, yeah, he mine
So, you see, you don't need another thug out of me
That is the last thing I plan to be on this LP
But I'ma go slip into something mo' comfortable and continue the lesson
No inconvenience at all, I insist on leaving an impression
So relax and ride out
Relax, okay and ride out
Just relax and ride out
Players, relax and ride out
I also solicit visual verbalism worth a visit
Intensely exquisite artism inquire all, who is it?
It's a deliciously daring delicacy I eat to exist
Oh, he's waving those words, I want seconds and thirds
Oh, hush, that's awful kind of you, you're making me blush
I could use some competition but they not making me much
Man, this beat is like my master, it's making me bust
Hip-hop is suffering, meaning I'm a necessity, if nothing
But you like every other rapper, cornrows and a bandana
But I get a hundred and fifty thousand dollar check
Every three months off Santana
Don't you fuck up, though my family is the whole side of Atlanta
Now how can I say? Okay, let me just put it this way
If anyone ever contests my conquest, my gun best
Yo son, just takes one time to be one less
'Til you run and tell the rest that I'm the best
I sang sweet but brang heat to bang meat
We all on the same street
And it's not that often I verbalize the essential element of surprise
I am not one of these thug rapper guys
But this one will help you realize and use both eyes to recognize
The type of action that this amount of money buys
Now listen son, let me drop some shit on you man
I can just 'do-do-do-do-do-do-do' and put a hit on you, man
With hot heat that will make your heart beat quit on you man
And Mr. Dawson'll find a pretty box to fit all you man
So relax and ride out
Just relax, young man and ride out
Hey, you better relax and ride out
Okay? Just relax and ride out
I could take that shit all day
But if I only had sixteen more bars to live
I'd get high and hopefully O.D. on an alternative
I'd give a dim lit dream, a color scheme
And I'd swim for the sun so far
No matter how impossible that may seem
I'd bury my feet in the foundation of a forest
Becoming one with everything there
I would be long, I would be right and wrong but I'd be rare
And then I would pretend I didn't care
Use my fear and pray that my forever would be fare
And I love you all, unconditional, I get misty already missing y'all
And then I forgive those who rhyme to kill the time
While mine cultivate the consciousness
And chill the spine, heal the mind, yet still sublime
Ride out, relax and ride out
Relax and ride out
Relax and ride out
This is one for the road, yeah
One time for the motherfucking mind
I told how you motherfucking play
D.F. y'all, believe this, yeah
Shouts out to Outkast, Goodie Mob, yeah
Backbone, where you at brother?
Hey, alright
It's been easy now, yeah
Can't nobody stop me now?
No, sir, yeah, I'm gone, y'all
Oh, man, it's lovely, yeah
Somebody better stop me 'cause I'm good, yeah
Alright now, yeah
Alright, we gonna relax 'cause it feels so good
Everybody doing their goddamn thing, yeah
After the show it's the after party then
After the party it's the hotel lobby and
After the Belve' then it's probably Cris'

[Post-Chorus]
Go...
Hold back...
Come on, come on...

[Verse 1]
My friends say you're so into me
And that you need me desperately
They say you say we're so complete
But I need to hear it straight from you
If you want me to believe it's true
I've been waiting for so long it hurts
I want to hear you say the words, please

[Chorus]
Don't, don't let me be the last to know
Don't hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
Oh, if you love me so
Don't let me be the last to know
Ooh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Your body language says so much
Yeah, I feel it in the way you touch
But 'til you say the words it's not enough
Come on and tell me you're in love, please

[Chorus]
Don't, don't let me be the last to know
Don't hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
Oh, if you love me so
Don't let me be the last to know

[Bridge]
Come on, baby, come on darling, ooh yeah
Come on, let me be the one
Come on now, oh yeah
I need to hear you say
You love me all the way
And I don't want to wait another day
I want to feel the way you feel
Oh, come on
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Don't, just let me be the one
Don't hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
So baby, if you love me, let me be the last to know
Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out

Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa
Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out

I've been told do what you do with it
We keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa
I'm looking over the skyline of the city
How loud quiet nights in the mist of crime
How next door to happiness lives sorrow
And signals of solution in the sky

(chorus)
A city of justice, a city of love, a city of peace
For everyone of us
We all need it, can't live without it
A Gotham City (oh yeah)

How sleeping awake because of fear. (ohh yeah)
How children are drowning in their tears
How we need a place where we can go
A land where every one will have a hero (even me)

(chorus 2x)
Yet in the middle of stormy weather
We won't stumble and we won't fall
I know a place where all this shelter..
(repeat chorus until end)
Intro

Like sun shinin' on my wrist ain't it mane

Canary yellow ice came with the chain
Just like money, cars and clothes came with the fame
Just like big pimpin y'all drew all this hoes just like
Thats why im in the club poppin all these bottles tonight

[Syleena (Verse 1)]
Boy, you got that crazy magic formula
And I can't shake it babe
Just wanna drink it babe
And I stay hungry for your love
You keep me wanting "beef"
Wanna eat it up
Tell me what

(That's so addictive) That's so addictive that I
Lose control

Can't seem to let go
Oh, baby your love is so

[Chorus]
Hypnotic, hypnotic, hypnotic, hypnotic, so hypnotic

[Verse 2:]
Can't seem to run, can't seem to hide
Your love keeps finding me
It's that chemistry between us
Oooh, boy you are all I focus on
I'm loving every moment
So why'd you had to go on and blow my mind

[B-section]

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
Young money on the flo'
Connection to the Chi
What it is!
I roll through the block and the roof be low and the 22's couldn't be cleaner
They start yellin' out F-A-B-O
Its the young boy with Syleena
They lookin with a flash light
In the daytime coz the cash right and the words may rhyme
Some say i'm
The real talk of the city of New York
Its the Diddy in the walk and the smooth in my style groove with a smile 'till they prove in the trail
That i move with the cow 40 that is shorty is his when she see's how icy the automo' is the game is
Hypnotic summin' like the blue drink you see me on the hood frontin' with the blue mink stuntin' with the
New link ya like how
I do's what i do's and i have 'em like Wow!

[Bridge]
(You're my medicine) Oh, you take the pain away
And bring me healing, boy
(And you bring me so much joy)
(Feeling)
Whenever you come near me
I just cannot help myself
Because your love is so

[Chorus / Adlib]
Ooooh ooooh ooooh ooooh ooooh
Good morning, little schoolgirl
Can I come home with you?
Tell your mama and your papa
I'm a little schoolboy too
Come on now, pretty baby
I just can't help myself
You're so young and pretty
I don't need nobody else
Good morning, little schoolgirl
Can I come home with you?
Don't you hear me crying?
I'm gonna leave you baby
About the break of day
On account of the way you treat me
I got to stay away
Come on now, pretty baby
Darling, come on home
You know I love you baby
I got to get you all alone
Good morning, little schoolgirl
Can I come home with you?
Can't you hear me crying?
I'm gonna buy me a airplane
Fly all over your town
And tell everybody, baby
Lord, know you're fine
Come on now, pretty baby
Now, I just can't help myself
You're so young and pretty
I don't need nobody else
Good morning, little schoolgirl

Hey, I wanna keep your company

[Verse 1]
They say I'm crazy
I really don't care
That's my prerogative
They say I'm nasty
But I don't give a damn
Getting boys is how I live
Some ask me questions
Why am I so real?
But they don't understand me
I really don't know the deal about my sister
Trying hard to make it right
Not long ago
Before I won this fight

[Verse 2]
Don't get me wrong
I'm really not souped
Ego trips is not my thing
All these strange relationships really gets me down
I see nothing wrong in spreading myself around

[Intro]
Oops, I did it again
Mmm, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh, baby, it might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Ooh, baby, baby

[Chorus]
Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
You see, my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways?

[Pre-Chorus]
But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh, baby, oh

[Chorus]
Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Ooh, baby, oh

[Chorus]
Oops (Oops, I) did it again to your heart
Got lost in the game (In this game, oh, baby)
Oops, you (Oops, you)
Think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

[Chorus]
Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game (yeah)
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above (yeah, yeah)
I'm not that innocent
Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game (In this game, oh, baby)
Oops, you (Oops, you)
You think I'm in love (That I'm sent from above)
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

[Verse 1]
I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
Into the unknown, I will be bold
I'm going to places I can be out of control
(control, control, control, control)

[Chorus]
'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand, touch of my hand
The touch of my hand, touch of my hand

[Verse 2]
The small of my back, the arch of my feet
Lately I've been noticing the beautiful me
I'm all in my skin and I'm not gonna wait
I'm into myself in the most precious way

[Chorus]
'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand
'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

Sitting in the stands of the sports arena
Waiting for the show to begin
Red lights, green lights, strawberry wine
A good friend of mine follows the stars
Venus and Mars are alright tonight

[Verse 1]
What's that man holding in his hand?
He looks a lot like a guy I knew way back when
It's Silly Willy with that Philly band
Could be, ooh-ee

[Verse 2]
Tell me, what's that man movin' cross the stage?
It looks a lot like the one used by Jimmy Page
It's like a relic from a different age
Could be, oo-ee

[Chorus]
If there's a rock show at the Concertgebouw
They've got long hair at Madison Square
You've got rock and roll at the Hollywood Bowl
We'll be there, oh yeah

[Bridge]
The lights go down, they're back in town--O.K
Behind the stacks, you glimpse an axe
The tension mounts you score an ounce--ole!
The temperatures rise as you see the whites of their eyes

[Chorus]
If there's a rock show at the Concertgebouw
You've got long hair at Madison Square
They've got rock and roll at the Hollywood Bowl
We'll be there, oh yeah

[Bridge 2]
In my green metal suit, I'm preparing to shoot up the city
And the ring at the end of my nose makes me look rather pretty
It's a pity there's nobody here to witness the end
Save for my dear old friend and confidante, mademoiselle Kitty

[Verse 3]
What's that man moving to and fro?
That decibel meter doesn't seem to be reading low
But they was louder at the Rainbow
Could be, ooh-ee

[Chorus]
If there's a rock show at the Concertgebouw
They've got long hair at Madison Square
You've got rock and roll at the Hollywood Bowl
We'll be there, oh yeah

[Outro]
If there's a rock show at the Concertgebouw
They've got long hair at Madison Square
You've got rock and roll at the Hollywood Bowl
Rock show
Long hair
Rock and roll

If there's a rock show
If there's a rock show
If there's a rock show
Inspite of all the consequence
Inspite of all my pride
Inspite of little things you said
That hide me deep inside

I believe your love
I breathe your love
Like the air in the morning
I sleep your love
I salute your love
And I can't get away

Baby when the lights go out
I hear you calling (I hear you calling)
Baby when the lights go out
I need you

Baby when the lights go out
I hear you calling (I hear you calling)
Baby when the lights go out
I need you
The lights of all you see
You could have overcome all this
And I still can't get over you
Are you someone I'll forever miss

I believed your love
I can feel your love
And that's all that I wanted
I sleep your love
I salute your love
And I can't get away

Baby when the lights go out
I hear you calling (I hear you calling)
Baby when the lights go out
I need you

Baby when the lights go out
I hear you calling (I hear you calling)
Baby when the lights go out
I need you

And there's the dark, begins to rain
The sound is heavy on me

Baby when the lights go out
I need you
Under the spell I wanna be under your touch
Under the spell I wanna be under the rush

Baby when the lights go out

Baby when the lights go out

Baby when the lights go out
I hear you calling (I hear you calling)
Baby when the lights go out
I need you

Baby when the lights go out
I hear you calling (I hear you calling)
Baby when the lights go out
I need you

You’re the most precious rose Dixie grows
Now some folks don’t think it's right
‘Cause your skin is dark as the night
You know you’ve got a heart and it's pure pure white

I know we all look the same
So don’t hang your head down, not in shame

Girl, you're fine, and that's a fact
'Cause you're Black, don't you be blue
My, my Georgia, Georgia, oh, Georgia Rose
Ah-ha-ha, oh, Georgia Rose

Thank you
We've been doing a lot of laughing, which is good, uh, for a comedy show on a comedy CD, but what we haven't been doing is a lot of thinking, and I'd like to do that now.

I've written some haikus. Haikus are Japanese poems consisting of 17 syllables, three lines - five, seven, five - and I find them to have a certain philosophical construct. There's a certain, uh, soundness in their simplicity, a clearness in their cogency if you will.

So hopefully what we'll do right now is read these haikus, think for a bit, and then when we go back, uh, to the, you know, the jokes and the laughing, they'll have benefited, uh, from the time we took to think. So um, you guys just sit back and indulge me and just think for a bit, and then we'll go back to the jokes. Uh, can I get some blue light to set the mood?

Perfect.

For those of you listening on CD, the lights didn't change which made it funny.

I saw a rainbow
On the day my grandma died
Fuckin' lesbian
(*Ding*)

For fifteen cents a day
You can feed an African
They eat pennies
(*Ding*)

Old peoples' skin sags
Because it's being pulled towards
The underworld
(*Ding*)
"Do unto others
As you would have them do to you"
Said the rapist
(*Ding*)

My aunt used to say
"Slow and steady wins the race"
She died in a fire
(*Ding*)

Even if he is
Your friend, never, ever call
An Asian person
(*Ding*)

And finally:

Bono, if you want
To help poor people, sell your
Tinted shades, you cunt
(*Ding*)

Thank you, this next piece is called "Sonnet 155," or "If Shakespeare Had Written a Porn," and it goes like this:

I saw the morning dew betwixt thine thighs
As I removed my source of Grecian pow'r
As if King Midas dared to touch the skies
Upon thy body fell a golden shower
Thy body's temples: Two church bells had rung
Upon thy chest, a row of pearls bestowed
The sun had set; thy set, with weary, hung
I thought, "How black a night and blue a load"

I said, "What light through yonder beaver breaks?
It is the yeast, and now my belly's yellow"
My pole gives cause to storms and earthy quakes
But 'tis not massive, I am no Othello

And when that final moment came to pass
Like Christ, I came, arriving on an ass

Thank you very much

William Shakespeare, uh...
William Shakespeare was a verbal cunt-ortionist
He could bend his words in the way a contortionist bends his frame without hope that he could with a name like William Shakespeare
William Shakespeare, some, some of you seem lost, look
Say your name was Robert Frost and you couldn't write, that would suck
Well, I guess you could always go as Bobby Frost and own an ice cream truck
He was balanced like a simile and could stack metaphor five, six at a time and rhyme into the very last line of a soliloquy which finally said, outright what the previous 77 were only hinting at
He had puns and quips and tons of trips of sons with ships with nuns with hips and buns and lips, but I had something that Shakespeare never had:
Penicillin
See, it hadn't been invented yet, back then they only had "quill"-icillin
Hey, it's not that hard, bard
I'm sorry, I got a bone to pick with you, William
So if you could just listen up here and listen to this theater queer's theater query here and maybe act like a real artist for once in your life
Say, Van Gogh, and
Lend me your ear
You're not a writer
You're a writer like fucking Hulk Hogan's a street fighter
You write these dramas, you accumulate your wealth
You hold nature as to a mirror of yourself
Just because you're messed up doesn't mean we are too
Just because you want to bang your mom doesn't mean that Danish princes do, what?
Who? Yeah, Hamlet, Shakespeare. That's right, the young prince whose father died at the hands of his uncle with whom his mother lied, sound familiar?
It's the fucking Lion King
You stole from a Disney movie, you androgynous douche! What's next? The story of a French king on a quest to find his lost son, Nemo?
Oh, and by the way, poetic talent is really easy to fake when thy sentences doth no fucking sense make
"To be, or not to be?" That is the question
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And, by opposing, end them? To die, to sleep
No more, and, by a sleep, to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to; 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep
To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub
For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil
Must give us pause."

Pfft! Like, what?

This next song is about quantum mechanics
(Hits random keys on the piano)

This next song...
I was raised very well, like a field of corn
You know, I was also raised very Christian, like the Children of the Corn
And Christians get angry at me 'cause I say things like, "Why the long nose, Pope-nocchio?"
They'll think I'll go to Hell
The truth is, I've been to Christian Hell
And I actually wrote a song about it:

Hitler was there
And so were all the Jews, yeah
So it got a little awkward
Ha ha ha
Ha ha ha

Now that im finally free
Im 'bout to do it again
I take my life with my hands
Cause im a grown ass man (im a grown ass man)
Now that im finally free

I was lost but now im found
I was blind but now i see
Super high can't touch the ground
Life tested me, but god blessed me
Ever since jayvon's testimony
From a jail house, jumped in a Testarrosa
Had to find myself, then remind myself
Fucked up; im grown, i gotta blame myself
Streets taught me everything; i trained myself
Did wrong so long, didn't know nothin' else
Then while i grew up like ---
Think every man's worth is in himself
Glad as well, but im mad as hell
Because my bestfriend probably gonna die in jail
No lie to tell
Probably cry like hell
Like my 2yearold, cause he got eighty years
Im goin hard, you see, i might as well
Cause i got a hard head like my daddy had
And my daddy dad
And my great great great great grandpa had a real crazy swag
So i stand today
Then get down and pray
That the second is now and my mind is made
I got a point to prove
And ima sign a raise
Can't make the same mistakes that my daddy made
Finally free
You'll never take me away
Took everything i had
For me to follow again
Now that im finally free
Im about to do it again
I take my life with my hands
Cause im a grown ass man
Now that im finally free

Squash the beef, im free of that
This crazy song, i ain't feelin that
I guess they wanna see us kill each other
When im dead, who the fuck gon' help my mother?

I struggled and hustled too hard for this
I had to rob, steal, kill; i ain't proud of that
Smoke weed to appeal, so proud of Pat
Im show you to understand, where the cowards at?
Man my homeboy gone, where the flowers at?
All the money in the world can't bring that back
If i had one wish, wish my momma dear could come down now and see me rap
But she see me now, and i believe in that
Off the strength of that, i ain't going back
So i put my whole family on my back
Got so much time, i can't pay that back
I was lost but now im found
I was blind but now i see
Super high can't touch the ground
Life tested me but God blessed me
Ever since jayvon's testimony
From a jail house, jumped in a Testarrosa
Had to find my self, then remind myself
Fucked up; im grown, i gotta blame myself
Finally free
You'll never take me away
Took everything i had
For me to follow again
Now that im finally free
Im about to do it again
I take my life with my hands
Cause im a grown ass man
Now that im finally free

I was lost but now im found
Thought that you couldn't keep me down
Single life, go round and round
I said i straightened up my ass
And i ain't never going back

Now that im finally free (finally free)
You'll never take me away (you'll never take me away)
Took everything i had (everything that i had)
For me to follow again (for me to follow again)
Now that im finally free (ohhhh finally free)
Im about to do it again (do it all again)
I take my life with my hands (i take my life with my hands)
Cause im a grown ass man (im a grown ass man)
Now that im finally free
Im a grown ass man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, shit's all good
The deal got signed, and my split's all good
And these haters pretending that it's all good
Say that shit in person man, I wish y'all would
I'm a motherfuckin' genius, goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you, I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I've changed, then the slightest could have fooled me
Yeah, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname's "Starter Drake"
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen, I could draw attention
But you could tell by my strut
I'm just chillin' in the cut, nigga what, and I'm feelin' like

[Chorus: Drake & Belly]
I get it, I get it, I get it 'til I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin' if you plannin' on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie (Drake)
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie

[Verse 2: Belly]
Here I go, street reaper
Ballin' over here, we need three courts
Violence, you don't wanna resort
The house looks something like a resort
You can't resist bein' rich when you record
When this money runs slower than Eeyore
If your life is a movie, you a extra
I'm so fly, I glide: Clyde Drexler (wooh)
Mister pressure, bitch I'm fresher
They must heard that they'll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
I'm at the plate right now, fuck next up

[Chorus: Drake & Belly]
I get it, I get it, I get it 'til I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin' if you plannin' on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie

My pocket all swoll', my rims all chrome
When I hit the club everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don't really care

'Cause I ride on 'em, plus, I style on 'em
Yes, I lean on 'em, yes, I flash on 'em
Yeah, I know, that's the way you like it, huh?
Yeah, that's the way you love me, hon'

It's alive, it's alive, rounds cured the eyes
I had to bring the bitch back like Frankenstein
I push weight but Gucci don't exercise
I get extra whipped cream for them eskimo pies

I'm in the 'hood like the mayor 'round election time
Here's a suggestion: don't park your car next to mine
I'mma start when the light hit, I 'posed to shine
Your flow is garbage, they let me out just in time

They got a section but none of the ho's are fine
They need to exit, don't let the grind pass you by
I run laps 'round lames with my shoes untied
I jump the line, walk in, and watch the crowd divide
Still stuck outside, that's the ugly side
Looked Medusa in the eye and Medusa died
This is top secret shit, classified
Don't blame me, Swizz was the mastermind

I can't breathe, can't breathe, Toni Braxton time
I got a chain moonwalkin', Michael Jackson time
I keep on buying ice like I lost my mind
This bloodline of mine is supposed to shine

My pocket all swoll', my rims all chrome
When I hit the club everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don't really care

'Cause I ride on 'em, plus, I style on 'em
Yes, I lean on 'em, yes, I flash on 'em
Yeah, I know, that's the way you like it, huh?
Yeah, that's the way you love me, hon'

Hurry up, hurry up Gucci on the news
They say he walked out the jail rockin' stupid jewels
They tryin' to find out what it do, admit it, you confused
Too much cash on me, hundreds fallin' out my trous'

My yellow wrist, bright as piss, bitch, on the shit
Big Gucci called Swizz, let's make a hit
Two thing in this world I ain't ever seen
Are you a foreigner, nigga? I need to help me get mimi
I hope you suffocate, me told her, baby, let me breathe
'Cause I don't chase nothin' but paper, bitch, you're chasin' me
Excuse my French, but this is Gucci, I'm so fucking gutter
It don't make no sense to switch for any of these motherfuckers

My pocket all swoll', my rims all chrome
When I hit the club everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don't really care

'Cause I ride on 'em, plus, I style on 'em
Yes, I lean on 'em, yes, I flash on 'em
Yeah, I know, that's the way you like it, huh?
Yeah, that's the way you love me, hon'

Somebody said my life is it
I said nah dog, my wife is it
Now I'm back, back on 'em like I never, never left
Plus the boy right here, I'm fresh to death

Woo, Christians on my feet
See, I can't fall for Suzuki jeeps
Now I'm jumpin' off decks
Don't worry about the haters, they gonna be upset

And the Black Card in my back pocket
The Conaseg lookin' like a speeder rocket
Yeah, I'm zoomin' on the highway
And you should love me, I did it my way
My pocket all swoll', my rims all chrome
When I hit the club everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don't really care

'Cause I ride on 'em, plus, I style on 'em
Yes, I lean on 'em, yes, I flash on 'em
Yeah, I know, that's the way you like it, huh?
Yeah, that's the way you love me, hon'

[Sean Kingston] (Rick Ross) (*The Game)
Yah mon!!! JR!!! Sean Kingston yuh know (Ross!) (*And the doctor's advocate)
Beluga Heights! (*Let's go)

[Chorus: Sean Kingston] (The Game)
Miami have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors (Californ-i-a)
Jamaica have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors (All the way to Dade County)
My jewels have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My people die over colors, colors, colors, colors, colors

[Verse 1: The Game]
Check it! I'm the Bastard Of The Party, s*** start off off coke and bacardi
Bandanas tied around the dubs on the Ferarri
I'm the bloods to what Pac was to thugs
What Snoop is to crips I'm the California king
Let it be known, I reign Supreme like Kenneth McGriff
Reincarnated put me in Queens and give me a strip
A couple red tops while the feds watchin
Infiltrate get a head shot Compton is the city of God
My block originators I said blood one on a Dr. Dre track
Now the world is affiliated
Some authentic some n****s Milli Vanilli bangers
Some get smoked others smoke chronic out of philly papers
Game time is really Jacob watches got them silly faces
Add red rubies to the dial they 'gon really hate us
I inherited gang bangin from my mother
And what I didn't get from her I picked up watchin colors

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
Jamaica have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My jewels have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My people die over colors, colors, colors, colors, colors

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
I'm from a world of different colors different faces
Different slang different races different gangs different places
Air Ones different laces
Different culture different livin different thugs different ages
The sky's blue the money's green the weed is purple
The ice is white you try me I'm a have to hurt you

Kingston boy I rep like no other
Black, yellow and green I bleed the Jamaican colors
The grill is cold the wheels is gold the chrome is silver
Nickel plated if it's blazin than the chrome will kill ya
Certain dudes get one in the head
Certain places you wear certain colors you dead
Fi yuh gang bang yuh diss mi yuh a dead man
Cau gunshot a be like drum pan weh mi come from
And it's the same old story
We don't give a damn about your guts and glory

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Miami have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
Jamaica have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My jewels have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My people die over colors, colors, colors, colors, colors

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Painted the car blue, that's for the sweat and blood
In my red tennis shoes fool cause the pain is love
I'm bout my green (Green) So my sky's blue (Blue)
Purple and the strawberry philly up in my five coupe
Yeah I'm in the yellow boss, they in the white gold
You might fold I'm platinum go ask them white hoes
I got black hoes slammin cadillac do's
Gettin cheese out a rat trap like I'm that close
Whippin keys in the back that's how I stack dough
Waitin on that jack boys get him in his afro
These a**holes must be gone on that crack smoke
Try to cross the boss well let's front 'em what they ask for
Uh! I'm in the thangs, ten tennis chains
That's how I present it to ya you think I got 'em ten a thang
He green as spinach just another lame middle man
Standin in the street wavin my flag in the middle lane

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
Jamaica have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My jewels have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My people die over colors, colors, colors, colors, colors

Big timer on the loose
Got a bitch riding five
And everytime I pull up you know I'm iced up
When I step up in the club I light the bitch up
Back on my saddle throwing purple out the truck
Candy paint rally stripe shining like us
Pearly white maybach, hatchback automatic straps stash spots under the rack
Bitch, ready to spray that
Foreign grinds hard times
Getting mines, you know up town
Big time doing time
You know, Harley Davis baby
Cash money is pay me so you pay me how it weigh
Baby, black, gold
100 mill off the floor
Never told now you know how it go bitch
One hundred, one hundred

[Drake:]
Yeah
Your now fucking with the most requested
The young nigga that everybody is so obsessed with
And balck on black 62 float majestic
Me and stunna in it, boy I'm just so connected
Caught up in a popularity contest
It's about to reach my dreams and I ain't even got my arms stretched
Thank me later first week I'm taking all bets
Because a million copies isn't really far fetched
I keep credit cards in cash knots
I keep my darkest shades on til the flash stops
It's for my LA girls getting them implants
And all my DC girls getting them ass shots
Got em for a reason shortie, go ahead buss it open
I keep a secret baby, nothings heard when nothings spoken
Haters talk it like my buzz isn't enough promotion
And I just lost a Gucci sandal in the fucking ocean
Damn, I guess the problems of a teen star
Are confused all the conversations between y'all
And dog that's funny, pay me what you know nigga
All cash money

[Chorus to fade]
I saved a lot of money my fortune was untold
And like a fool I idealized my silver and my gold
My earthly treasure's mounted but when I counted through
I realized the treasure I had overlooked was you

My treasure unmeasured but forsaken of the treasures that come from above
My treasure unmeasured but it don't hold a heart of the one that I love

If I had my life before me if I could see it all
I'd stake my claim on things that are secured against downfall
I'd work for earthly treasures like any man would do
But I set my sights much higher and I'd be sure that I had you

My treasure unmeasured unmeasured...
Tell that hoe I did that, tell that hoe I did that
Go, go, go, go, go
Tell that hoe I did that, tell that hoe I did that
About another week my wrist call me...
Shout out to my home boy, Chilly chills
Shout out to my home boy Meek Mill
We be celebrating after big deals
And I be with my Philly niggas
Talking bout, we be at the real...
Alright, tell that hoe I did that
Alright, tell that hoe I did that
Go, talk about a big get money
Got a million in each city where you know me
Tell that hoe I did that, tell that hoe I did that
Go, go, go, go, go
Tell that hoe I did that, tell that hoe I did that
I ... coming out that coop, shitting on the like Oops

Tell the bitch treat the dick a ...
Yeah, now tell that hoe I did that
Man ... up in the building, you know where your bitch at
Go, talk about a big get money
Got a million in each city where you know me

Go, go, go, go, go
Tell that hoe I did that, tell that hoe I did that
Tell that hoe I did that, tell that hoe I did that

Go, go, go, go, go
Tell that hoe I did that, tell that hoe I did that
Tell that hoe I did that, tell that hoe I did that
Tell that hoe I did that, tell that hoe I did that
I got the call today, I didn’t wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old, true friend of ours was talkin’ on the phone
She said you’d found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside loves open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?
Im learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew, Im learning again
Ive been tryin to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you dont love me anymore
These times are so uncertain
Theres a yearning undefined
And people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age?
The trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness
Theyre the very things - we kill I guess
Pride and competition
Cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
You know it doesnt keep me warm
Im learning to live without you now
But I miss you, baby
And the more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought Id figured out
I have to learn again
Ive been trying to get down
To the heart of the matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you dont love me anymore
There are people in your life whove come and gone
They let you down you know they hurt your pride
You better put it all behind you baby; life goes on
You keep carryin that anger; itll eat you up inside, baby
Ive been trying to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thought seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you dont love me
Ive been tryin to get down
To the heart of the matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So Im thinkin about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you dont love me
Forgiveness
Forgiveness - baby
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, you dont love me anymore

Swoopin to some Soopafly, gettin my smoke on
Nigga Goldie Loc got the heat on roast it

Thuggin at the house party, fuck goin clubbin
2ND HOOK

Ice skatin over dicthes

I'm tryin to reach my dogg Dirty Red
But this hoe won't let me know, which way to go

HOOK 2X
I see you at the club ooh, shawty
Walkin' past a nigga lookin' all naughty
Then I said, "Baby wassup?"
Reach for that hand shake, got a hug
Bottles of H got me wit' a lil buzz
Up in VIP wit' all my thugs
You leaned over and said you want me
Girl, when the valley pull the Benz up
Off to the crib, where we gon' end up
Sit back, relax, hold up
Baby, won't you sing my song
Girl, let me get you to the crib
Upstairs to the bed
Girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think

Girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think

[Incomprehensible]
Make your love come down if you believe
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna believe I invented sex, girl
You gonna, yeah
MTV, I invented sex
I'm coming round and now my vision is so clear
If I could change my state of mind, then I would disappear
The love I get from you is something I can't chance
And I could let you slip away, without a second glance

Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaaah, Woaaaah!
Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaaah, Woaaaah!

This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory x2

This is like a flashback
Flashback
This is like a flashback
Flashback

Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaaah, Woaaaah!
Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaaah, Woaaaah!
This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory x2

[Verse 1: Elton John]
I hardly think I'm qualified
To come across all sanctified
I just don't cut it with the cherubim
The town's already on its knees
Being worshipped is a breeze
I barely know the words to any hymn

[Verse 2: Randy Newman]
Listen, if we don't comply
With the locals' wishes I
Can see us being sacrificed or stuffed
Let's be gods, the perks are great
El Dorado on a plate
Local feeling should not be rebuffed

[Chorus: Elton John, Elton John & Randy Newman]
It's tough to be a god
Tread where mortals have not trod
Be deified when really you're a sham
Be an object of devotion
Be the subject of psalms
It's a terrifying notion
All those prayers and those salaams
Any normal man would bridle
If he's forced to be an idol
And a normal man's exactly what I am

[Verse 3: Elton John]
All the same, it's pretty clear
The scoundrels don't keep much up here
They must have zillions under lock and key
But gods can force them to unleash
Enough to make us nouveau riche
Beyond our wildest dreams, so follow me!

[Verse 4: Randy Newman]
Can't you see I won't relax
If religious maniacs
Tell me I'm all-powerful and sublime
How can I be their belief
When I'm lying through my teeth?
Why don't we just say, "some other time"?

[Chorus: Elton John, Elton John & Randy Newman]
It's tough to be a god
But if you get the people's nod
Count your blessings, keep them sweet is my advice
Be nirvana, be salvation
Be all things to all men
Butter up your congregation
Every Sunday score a ten
The alternative is dire
Simply frying pan to fire
So sign on two new gods for paradise, paradise
Y'all ready to get dirty?
Do y'all really wanna get X-rated?
He, bottoms up
Just hit me up when you need
Sex, endo and Hennessey
Won't you just put it on me
I just want your company
(Come on baby)
Put it on me
Relax and come chill with me
Kick back, I got what you need
Won't you just put it on me
We back, we mack, stay blunted
Knee pads, yo hoes they wanted
Penthouse two o'clock eleven hundred
It ain't no fun if I can't reroute your hoes in this direction
Swerve in the intersection, I'm done, she restin'
No question, done session
Home wreckin', Doc motherfuckin' Dre, no guessin'
Nothin' less than, I mess when I'm sexin'
Bang on the block
Even Asian bitches like to bang cock
Draws drop, she bunny hops
On it like a pro, she comes out the clothes
But, uh, she flips the dildos
Whether in the Pumps, Nikes or the steel toes
Dre, you can spot it in the Benzos
Squawtin' real low, got me drivin' real slow, she's a real ho
And even though her parents spent the fat chip
On that private school chip
She graduated, got some thug dick and flipped
No more checkered sweater, vest and plaid skirts
She's out here naked more or less and that hurts
But she's in good hands 'cuz Suga Free palmin'
He sent her to the Sheraton with Thomas
If you need 'em they at 310-629-9755
You hit 'em and they let you know when she's arrived
Oh, she okay, she just runnin' an errand
With this Portuguese dime piece named Karen
Bouncin' through the mall, spottin' 'em all
A sucker for a dick sucker ready to fall
For a daughter like yours
Got him pattin' his pocket and comin' out his drawers
Layin' his jacket on puddles, openin' the doors, all for what?
Because I promised her my name
Gave her the game and still ain't fucked
Just hit me up when you need
Sex, endo and Hennessey
Won't you just put it on me
I just want your company
(Come on baby)
Put it on me
Relax and come chill with me
Kick back, I got what you need
Won't you just put it on me
(Come on baby)
Put it on me
Fuck everybody, let's just go
(Come on baby)
We can get drunk, have some fun and blow some smoke
(Come on baby)
My spot is close, c'mon let's roll
(Don't trip)
Now keep it on a low, low
Now we just kickin' back playin' on some PS2
Contemplatin' the game Dre and me best do
If you feelin' froggies then leave when we test you
But I'm guaranteein' you bitches leavin' three less two
Never mind what that love and hate one pairs do
Y'all just snicker at that hooker when we all pass through
Dr. Dre and DJ Quik will probably outlast you
You're like see-through pair of boxers nigga yo ass through
Bitch, you need some good dick, I got that too
Speed bag the clit, leave it black and blue
Time of yo live, I got that boo
Creep late nights up in hotel rooms
We drank, eat shrooms
Kill something, crank the volume
Fuck in every room
You know your home girl want it, Tag team bitch
Why you being dick greedy? Tag team bitch
When she cums, she drips on mattresses
Bedroom time comes I handle shit
Wifey caught up me nigga
That's yo bitch, that's yo biz
That's show biz, that's how hoes is
With or without kids
Long as you keeping it on a hush she ridin' dick
Ain't been satisfied much, she's been fakin'
That's why she callin' me, guess what she's sayin'
Just hit me up when you need
Sex, endo and Hennessey
Won't you just put it on me
I just want your company
(Come on baby)
Put it on me
Relax and come chill with me
Kick back I got what you need
Won't you just put it on me
(Come on baby)
Put it on me
Fuck everybody let's just go
(Come on baby)
We can get drunk, have some fun and blow some smoke
(Come on baby)
My spot is close, c'mon lets roll
(Don't trip)
Now keep it on a low, ahh
Everywhere I Go
When everyone who knows me
Knows that I would stand alone
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game

When you said I could move on and go
You said I'm weak and it shows
I couldn't go on without you
Now you're sitting in your house alone
Wondering why I left home
And I'm hoping that you know

Had to fake it till I made it
And you try to break it
Now you try to take it back
But you know that
I've been doing my thing
I've been running my game
And you know I won't look back
Everywhere I go
When everyone who knows me
Knows that I would stand alone
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game

I'm standing on my toes
To the sky I know
And you know you're the one to think
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game
We all play it the same

As you looked, you saw me walking out
You tried to knock me down
I would go on without you
Now you're sitting in the mess you made
Now you're feeling my pain
And I'm hoping that you know that

I'm stronger cause you made me
You will never faze me
You can never take me down
Cause you know that
I've been doing my thing
I've been running my game
And you know I won't look back
You know that
Everywhere I go
When everyone who knows me
Knows that I would stand alone
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game

I'm standing on my toes
To the sky I know
And you know you're the one to think
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game
We all play it the same
We all play it the same

This suburban or Excursion or whatever I ride
I bet it's chrome on the wire, vogue on the tire
T.I.P. refer to me as your majesty or sire
Higher then the rest, Italian drop dead fresh
So much say what I feel with southern finesse
So debonair if he dare bet he got best dressed
Full length mink, gator belt gator vest including shoes
A ten thousand dollar outfit bitch
Yes, dude he dress to impress
A bitch enough to make her want to give me her dress
Blessed with the gift of gab to get gals
Hot enough to hit they pals so get down
You looking good enough to come give me a kiss now
Get a room at the Swiss big as a beach house

(Hook)
You the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one

Cuz you the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one
(Verse Three: Cee-Lo)
You're lookin nice. Hell, let's toast to the broken ice
We've seen each other once and already we've spoken twice
So stay or at the most a moment longer to hear me say
I really did miss you the last time that you went away
I'm serious, I must have you, I won't waste your time
And have you wishin' that somehow you could replace the time
I don't do any magic tricks to try and make the mind
I just convinced that the reality is that you have to race the time
She said "You a playa ain't you, could have what you want can't you"
I replied that I'm also an artist baby I could paint you
In the frame and I don't try hard to not be the same
So she knew she was gon' come before she came

(Hook)
You the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one

Cuz you the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Raw, Raw, Raw, Raw-hide!(Girl did you know that ahh...)

(Cee-Lo)
It's our privilege, to have had this conversation
It's our privilege, and to have had this relation
It's our privilege, I been searching all evening
For somebody who can and finally sent me the one
It's our privilege, to have made you laugh
It's our privilege, and to have crossed your path
It's our privilege, your the star yes you are
Can have your autograph cuz you lookin like the one
It's our privilege, to have seen your face
It's our privilege, and I bet you taste so good, let's get one thing understood
I'll be good yes I would, especially for the one
It's our privilege, let have a head-on collision
It's our privilege, girl you made the right decision
It's our privilege, (laughing)
It's not time to make a change just relax and take it easy
You're still young that's your fault there's so much you have to know
Find a boy settle down and if you want you can marry
Look at me gettin' old but I'm happy

I was once like you are now and I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you found somethin' going on
But take your time think a lot why think of every thing you've got
For you'll still be here tomorrow but your dreams may not

How can I try to explain cause when I do he turns away again
And it's always been the same same old story
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away

It's not time to make a change just sit down and take it slowly
You're still young that's your fault there's so much you have to go through
Find a boy settle down and if you want you can marry
Look at me gettin' old but I'm happy

All the times that I have cried keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard but it's harder to ignore it (oh stay)
If they were right I'd agree but it's them that know not me
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away I know I have to go away
(Oh please stay please don't go away)

[Verse 1]
When you go please don't leave your love in the sun
My heart would melt away
In the night with your twisted tongue
When you drop the bomb I'm blown away

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cause I refuse to hide in the page of the story
I come out the box I won't say I'm sorry

[Chorus]
We in the nuclear season
In the shelter I survived the storm
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat gone

[Verse 2]
No facing this on my own
Cause you taste the blast and it shook your bones
I worry you're all alone
In the field of lies, I won't go home

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause I didn't burn my skin in the blaze of glory
I come out your hands I won't say I'm sorry

[Chorus]
We in the nuclear season
In the shelter I survived the storm
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat gone

[Post-Chorus]
We survived nuclear seasons
We survived nuclear seasons

[Bridge]
I can feel it, I can feel the fear
I can feel it, inside of her soul
Inside of the soul

[Chorus]
We in the nuclear season
In the shelter I survived the storm
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat gone

[Outro]
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times die slow)
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times die slow)
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times die slow)
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times die slow)
On October 23rd, 1978
I lost a loved one and I confess, I cried
In the joyous celebration of the lady and her music
There were tears in the Holston River
When Maybelle Carter died

Then walking down that river road
I saw crystal tear-shaped droplets
Silver beads of love sparklin' on the river side

And I'll just bet they turn to diamonds
For the love that was behind 'em
There were tears in the Holston River
When Mother Maybelle died

Then on January eighth, nineteen seventy-nine
We lost Sara Carter
And the pain was multiplied

Down below that old Clinch Mountain
We laid her at Mount Vernon
There were tears in the Holston River
When Sara Carter died
Then walking down that river road
I saw crystal tear-shaped droplets
Silver beads of love sparklin' in the riverside

And I'll just bet they turn to diamonds
For the love that was behind 'em
There were tears in the Holston River
When Maybelle and Sara died

There were tears in the Holston River
When Mother Maybelle and Sara Carter died

We're all gonna die
When I was a very young boy, mama told me we all gonna die
Mama said son love can't be trusted, it's just another weakness
We all gonna die
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie
We're all gonna die
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie
We all gonna die
Now I'm grown, seen a lot livin', made a few friends
Gonna get high, hoping I don't take more than I'm given
Judgment day comin', we all gonna die
If my wings should fail me lord, meet me with another pair
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie
We're all gonna die
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie
We all gonna die
Baby getting born, old man die'n
Young lady laughn', old woman cryin'
Leaving like a lamb, comin' back like a lion
Babylon to Zion, we're all gonna die
Praise the most high, we're all gonna die
When I was a very young boy Mama told me, we're all gonna die
Mama said, "Son, love can't be trusted
It's just another weakness, we're all gonna die"
Praise the most high, we're all gonna die
If my wings should fail me Lord, meet me with another pair
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie
We're all gonna die
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie
We all gonna die
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie
We're all gonna die
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie

I believe in magic
Once upon a time
When something had to be special
Couldn't see it online
Was that my business plan?
Well, you lost your biggest fan
Tell me, what's the point in doing
What anybody can?
Now all the rock stars are regular people
And being alive is becoming a bore
'Cause nothing, absolutely nothing, is shocking anymore
Now that reality is a TV show, I wish you liked me a little more
'Cause nothing, absolutely nothing, is shocking anymore
I can't believe it's over
The glory days are gone
I can't hear my heartbeat
With the radio on
Now he's in love with him
And she's the M&M
Well hey, I wish you well
'Cause everything's for sell
Now all the rocks stars are regular people
And being alive is becoming a bore
'Cause nothing, absolutely nothing ,is shocking anymore
Now reality is a TV show I've seen a million times before
'Cause nothing absolutely nothing is shocking anymore
(Instrumental break)
Now all the rocks stars are regular people
And being in love is becoming a bore
'Cause nothing absolutely nothing is shocking anymore
Ain't nothing at all better than a j-o-b, but tell me who you're working for
'Cause nothing, absolutely nothing, is shocking anymore

Let me go away from the Mississippi
Let me go away from the white man boss
Show me that stream called the river Jordan
That's the ol' stream that I long to cross

Ol' Man River, that Ol' Man River
He must know somethin' but don't say nothin'
He just keeps rollin'
He keeps on rollin' along

He don't plant taters, he don't plant cotton
And then that plants them is soon forgotten
But Ol' Man River
He just keeps on rollin' along

You and me, we sweat and strain
Body all achin' and racked with pain
Tote that barge, lift that bale
You get a little drunk and you land in jail

I get weary and sick of tryin'
I'm tired of livin' and scared of dyin'
But Ol' Man River
He just keeps rollin' along
You and me, we sweat and strain
Body all achin' and racked with pain
Tote that barge, lift that bale
You get a little drunk and you land in jail

I get weary and sick of tryin'
I'm tired of livin' and scared of dyin'
But Ol' Man River
He just keeps rollin' along

Chocolate Factory presents...

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
If you had one time to take a trip
One shot at paradise
One chance to spend lots of money
One chance to touch the sky
One time to make sweet love
One shot of being a movie star
A whole day to go on shopping sprees
Ride around in a fancy car

One time to come on the stage
One chance to make a wish
One time to be amazed
One crack at being rich

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
What would you do if you had Mr. Biggs and me
Take you out on a night for wining and dining? (Booyaka!)
We can hit a club first, sipping Crys in VIP
Radio playing the remix in the Hummer V
JS in the back of the club low key
And Black pulls up in a range with about three nice honeys
We all got family here, so put your hands up
To all my thugs in here and put your cups up
We got the industry on swoll, now fire that weed up
The Pied Piper's in control

[Chorus: R. Kelly & (Ronald Isley)]

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

[Verse 2]
I'm such a star
Queen Boulevard
Blaze through the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Bridge]
Get my guitar
Sunglasses on
So light it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Come here and look through the window Marie
Open up the shutters, tell me what you see?
Was that his knock that I heard at the door
Or is it six white horses coming down the road?
Come here and touch me and say that it's alright
You know that to my eyes the days are as the nights
Read again the letter that tells me where he's gone
To hell with the fighting, I want my son home
I taught him to fish and I taught him to be strong
I taught him that killing any man was wrong
But tomorrow in battle I'd run to where he stood
If the help of a blind man would do any good
Last night I went to his room for awhile
I've touched all the things that he used as a child
I rocked the cradle where he used to lay
I found his tin soldiers and threw them away
Come here and look through the window Marie
Open up the shutters, tell me what you see
Was that his knock that I heard at the door
Or is it six white horses coming up the road?
I know I'm stingy with my money and it's hard to get some from me
But you still love me anyway, your mother seems to like me
But your father wants to fight me
But you still love me anyway

And I take you out on dates and I always show up late
But you still love me anyway, there's no one else like this
That would put up with my shit
And still love me anyway

Because no matter what I do, I know I can count on you
'Cause baby you still love me anyway
For worse or for better, you make me better
I know you still love me anyway

Because no matter what I do, I know I can count on you
'Cause baby you still love me anyway
For worse or for better, you make me better
I know you still love me anyway

I only see you every now and then and I'm on the road again
But you still love me anyway and when this relationship's not working
That's when all your friends start flirting
And my eyes may wander but that is not okay
So I make it up to you, with a brand new pair of shoes
If you still love me anyway
And I will surely miss the way you put up with my shit
I'll make it up to you some day

Because no matter what I do, I know I can count on you
'Cause baby you still love me anyway
For worse or for better, you make me better
I know you still love me anyway

You still love me anyway, you still love me any, still love me any
Still love me anyway, you still love me any, still love me any
Still love me anyway, you still love me any, still love me any
Still love me anyway

I said mmm, mmm, no one loves me
Quite like you do girl, it's unconditional, unconditional

Because no matter what I do, I know I can count on you
'Cause baby you still love me anyway
For worse or for better, you make me better
I know you still love me anyway

You still love me anyway, you still love me any, still love me any
Still love me anyway, you still love me any, still love me any, still love me anyway
Oh, girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing everyday
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die
Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine
We can take forever
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
Oooh
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking about those people
Then I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose you I know I would die
Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine
We can take forever
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
Ooooh
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me...

Say it for me once if you know what I mean
I said my man's what a man's supposed to be
The touch of his hand, the sound of his voice
The way that he loves me 'til he knows I feel it
And all through the night, forever rejoice
The angel above me starts to sweetly sing to me
Who loves you baby? I do, I do adore you
I'm the best man for the job
Another man couldn't do nothing for you
'Cause you're spicy just like me
We come together like thunder and lightning
With all of that scratching and biting
So exciting, it's frightening
I'm your do-right man and you're my do right
Not my just for tonight woman
Making me feel just like a baker
Quick to put something in your oven
Not no dumplin's or no stuffin'
But our own lil' flesh and blood
'N' a bouncin' lil', baby something
Pretty girl or handsome son child
I got a man and he's so good to me
I give love and he gives it back to me
Say it for me once if you know what I mean

Well, I wish I was a catfish
Swimmin' in the deep blue sea
I'd have all you women
Fishin' after me
Fishin' after me
Fishin' after me
Well, I'm broke and I'm hungry
Ragged and I'm dirty too
Well, if I clean up, baby, can i
Stay home with you
Stay home with you
Stay home with you
If I can't, can't come in
Let me sit down front of your door
I'll leave so early, your
Mom won't know
Won't never know
Won't never know
Oh, I know, know my baby
Well, she's going to jump and shout
When my train pulls in and i
I come walkin' out
Come walkin' out
Come walkin' out
Yes, I'm goin', babe I'm goin'
And your crying won't make me stay
Oh, the more that you cry, baby

Well now I know, I know you don't want me
Why in the world won't you tell me so?
Then I won't be caught, baby, 'round
Your house no more
Your house no more
Your house no more

[Intro]
You know
I never thought in a million years
Back in the day
That I would be feelin' like
A lady?
Get out of here
But right now

[Chorus]
I feel so lady (I feel so lady)
When I'm with you, when I'm 'round you
I feel so lady (I feel so lady)
When I'm with you, when I'm 'round you
I feel so lady (I feel so lady)
When I'm with you, when I'm 'round you
I feel so lady (I feel so lady)
When I'm with you, when I'm 'round you
I feel so lady

[Verse 1]
I, I never knew I would feel so much like a lady
It's good to have doors opened for me
By a real man who wants to hold my hand
And he's not ashamed to be out in public with me
It's the simple things that really turn me on
(It's the simple things that really turn me on like)
Like being kind, being warm to me
That makes a man look strong and that's why
I don't mind spending all my time with him
I feel so

[Chorus]
I feel so lady
When I'm with you, when I'm 'round you
I feel so lady (I feel so lady)
When I'm with you, when I'm 'round you

[Verse 2]
I, I never was the type
To wear high heels and all that stuff
But now I even wear make-up because you
Make me feel like it's alright with you
So it's alright with me
Boy, you changed my mind about this whole thing
(Boy, you changed my mind about this whole thing)
So I cross my legs and sit up straight
I can't wait for our next date, and I really
Love the new me and it's because of you
She's who I wanna be, I feel

[Chorus]
I feel so lady (I feel so lady)
When I'm with you, when I'm 'round you
I feel so lady (I feel so lady)
When I'm with you, when I'm 'round you

[Bridge]
I didn't know how to be a lady
I didn't know I really had it in me
You showing me the things that God has given
I feel so lady
I didn't know how to be a lady
I didn't know I really had it in me
You showing me the things that God has given
I feel so lady

[Outro]
I feel so lady, lady, lady, lady, lady, lady, lady, lady, lady, lady
I feel so, so lady, so lady, yeah
Didn't know I really had it in me, but I, I feel
Stole a key
And took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free

I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
I saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smashed my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose, come burst in the concrete
Be a cartoon heart

Light a fire, fire the spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart, we'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark

All the boys, all the girls, all that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls, all the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows as the room is spinning
We'll run riot, we'll be glowing in the dark
So, so, reminiscing wild
We'll be glowing in the dark

[Verse 1]
Midnight Sky, the moon is a quarter
Layin' low and south of the border, yeah
I know that when I awaken
I've taken more than moon beams home in a jar
Oh baby, morning and there you are right next to me
Can you feel it?
Break of day and I'm feeling hazy
And she's feeling good
Milky Way is all in my mind, well
I have no sense of direction when loving you
I lose conception of time
Ah honey, under the midnight sky, baby, get next to me
Can you feel it?

[Bridge]
The greatest pleasure, too great no measure
After the day is done
An invitation to find temptation
Under the midnight sun

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Under the midnight sky, baby, get next to me
Under the (Midnight) midnight

My baby moves at midnight
Goes right on till the dawn
My woman takes me higher
My woman keeps me warm

[Chorus]
What you doin' on your back, aah

You should be dancing, yeah

Well I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you
But I've got to think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too
Oh but I
Need some time off
From that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, and that love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showing you the door
Because I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
Baby
I know you're asking me to stay
Sayin' please, please, please, don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues
Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to lover boy rules
Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back
On the floor
Oh, baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more
Yes I've gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
Because I got to have faith
Oh yeah, faith
Got to have faith
Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back
On the floor
Oh, baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more
Because I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
One love, one heart
Let's get together and feel all right
Hear the children crying (One love)
Hear the children crying (One heart)
Sayin', "Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right."
Sayin', "Let's get together and feel all right."
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (One love)
There is one question I'd really love to ask (One heart)
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own?
Believe me

One love, one heart
Let's get together and feel all right
As it was in the beginning (One love)
So shall it be in the end (One heart)
Alright, "Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right."
"Let's get together and feel all right."
One more thing
Let's get together to fight this Holy Armageddon (One love)
So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom (One song)
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
There ain't no hiding place from the Father of Creation

Sayin', "One love, one heart
Let's get together and feel all right."
I'm pleading to mankind (One love)
Oh, Lord (One heart) Whoa

"Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right."
Let's get together and feel all right

[Intro]
Boiii, GOOD
So this is what it feels like to make something outta nothing huh?
For a young nigga to start with nothing and get muthafucking rich on ya dumbass
Finally Famous

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Bitch, my life is nothin' but a G thing
Pick up a 100 G's, take off a G-string
Clique full of G's and some bad-ass bitches
Oh, your ear to the streets? Okay, well, holla if you hear us
I keep it G, I keep it G, I keep it G, I keep it G
I keep it, I keep it, I keep it
I keep it G 

[repeated]

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay, my life is nothin' but a G thang
Pick up 100 G's, take off a G-string
Oh, Jesus, they love me to pieces
Got up in the game cause I was tired of the bleachers
Get rich, repeat it, taste it, I'm delish'
Lookin' so good she put me on her fuck for free list
I turn her on 'fore I go in
I swear that pussy keyless
I might let her ride the mic and let her friend come get the remix
Oh boy you do it
Rollin' rich nigga weed (rich nigga weed)
With a rich nigga bitch (rich nigga bitch)
I'm ridin' 'round the city, in a rich nigga whip
Yea a nigga paid a grip, for all this rich nigga shit
And all these bad hoes, they want a rich nigga's dick
O God, this life is such a blessin'
See I smoke 'til I can't smoke no more and drink is no exception
Man these crazy niggas crazy, nigga when you gon' learn yo lesson
They won't talk shit about you plaques, but they gon' talk when you are restin'
Man, so fuck 'em

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
10 Ben Franklins, nigga, that's a G homie
Flash the pinky ring, baby you can ski on it
Put it in your uterus, U-Haul, I move the shit
Baby I'm a shark and these rappers taste like tuna fish
Look at this, movie with no movie script
I die real, do this shit
Just bought an old-school so that's my newest whip
Cartiers on, I can see all through the shit
I spell southside with an F that stand for foolishness
Fuck that shit, fuck with us, we'll have you in some luxury
I need a stash pot for a couple keys
When I'm in the Gucci store, I spend some G's to wear some G's
If you is a sucker, I'm a charger, where's the sucker fee?
Luckily, smoking on that vote for me, Presidential evidence
Truck so big, I can't park it at my residence
Wallet so big, I can't put it in my back pocket
Soon as her ass dropping, the cash dropping

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I deserve congrats (Why?)
I turned my old car into a new
My basement into a presidential view
One into two, a milli to a few
Niggas want to see me fall off, ah shit
I'll fall off and turn into you
Fuck around, turn this peace sign to a piece
Tool Time: now you learn to muthafuckin screw
I feel like slappin' a ho
Keep a bad bitch at the passenger door
Never ever break these broads off a lil'
Once you give 'em something they be askin' for more
If I run out then I'm snatchin' up yours
Man I remain a quadruple-triple OG, triple OG, triple OG
And that's a sign that I'm a made nigga that's fasho
I do not like Green Eggs and Ham
I do not like them
Sam, I am

I do not like them here or there
I do not like them anywhere
I do not like them in a boat
I would not, could not, with a goat

I will not eat them in the rain
I do not like them on a train
I do not like them in a box
I will not eat them with a fox

I do not like them in a house
I would not, could not, with a mouse
I do not like Green Eggs and Ham
I do not like them
Sam, I am

Green Eggs and Ham
Green Eggs and Ham
Don't like Green Eggs and Ham
Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain, we all have sorrow
But if we are wise we know that there's always tomorrow
Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long 'till I'm gonna need somebody to lean on
Please swallow your pride if I have made you need to borrow
For no one can feel those of your needs that you won't let show
You just call on your brother when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on
Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long 'till I'm gonna need somebody to lean on
You just call on your brother when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on
If, there is a load that you have to bear that you can't carry
I'm right up the road, I'll share your load if you just call me
Call me
Call me
Call me

Me and my man's don't dance, but to feel y'all bump and grind
It won't hurt if you gon' try one time

You rather be on the side of the club
Ballin' out with a niggah like me...

Baby look me in my eyes(1x)

And i couldn't help but stop soon as i roll past yah...
I see your pretty face,you ain't supposed to frown

Chunk your man a deuce tell him that your rollin with blast

Shake 'n Bake, fatter
Shake 'n Bake, fatter
Fatter

Corndogs, pizza, Coca Cola
Yogurt, butterscotch, granola
Look at me, I'm fatter
I'm fatter, I'm fatter

Friends all gather 'round me
My enemies surround me
Yelling "Fatso, fatso, fatso"
I've eaten at every single greasy spoon on Seventh Avenue
That's right, I'm fatter

Don't you know my weight is going up, up, up, up, up
I tell you, this turkey sure is tough
Tough, tough, tough, tough, tough, tough

They got pizza on the west side
French fries up town
Corn dogs deep fried in batter
I'm fatter
Go ahead, bite the big apple
Don't mind the calories
Pile it on my platter
I'm fatter

Pile it up, pile it high up

Like a warrior that fights and wins the battle<br />
I know the taste of victory<br />
Though I went through some nights<br />
<br />
Consumed by the shadows, I was crippled emotionally<br />
Somehow I made it through the heartache, yes, I did, I escaped<br />
I found my way out of the darkness<br />
I kept my faith, kept my faith<br />
(I know you did)<br />
<br />
When the river was deep I didn't falter<br />
When the mountain was high I still believed<br />
When the valley was low it didn't stop me, no no<br />
I knew you were waiting, I knew you were waiting for me<br />
<br />
With an endless desire I kept on searching<br />
Sure in time our eyes would meet<br />
Like the bridge is on fire<br />
<br />
The hurt is over, one touch and you set me free<br />
I don't regret a single moment, no, I don't, looking back<br />
When I think of all those disappointments<br />
I just laugh, I just laugh<br />
(I know you do)<br />
<br />
When the river was deep I didn't fairer<br />
When the mountain was high I still believed<br />
When the valley was low it didn't stop me<br />
I knew you were waiting, I knew you were waiting for me<br />
<br />
So we were drawn together through destiny<br />
I know this love we snared was meant to be<br />
I knew you were waiting, knew you were waiting<br />
I knew you were waiting, knew you were waiting for me

[Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
I just need...

To show you that I am not dead
I just need a little of your time

To say the words I never said, said, said...

[Verse 1]
Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off you go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road

[Verse 2]
Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway, baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go, oh no

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't

[Verse 3]
I'm driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Oh, where you at now?
I feel around
There you are

[Verse 4]
Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you how hot can it get
And as you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly you say "I'm not there yet!"

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't

[Scatting]

[Outro]
I know I don't know you...
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't
(That was dope)
When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
...lovely day, lovely day, lovely day...

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day...
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day...
Yes it's been so long since I've seen my baby's face
Well it's been so long since I've seen my baby's face
I'm tellin' you people, no one else can ever take her place

Yes the doorbell is ringing, I know there must be somethin' wrong
Yes the doorbell is ringing, I know it must be somethin' wrong
Well looka here it's my baby, she's done changed her mind and come home

So hurry baby, come on in and close the door
Yes hurry baby, come on in and close the door
Let me put my arms around you baby, so my nights won't be dark no more
Akon Time Is Money Lyrics

[Intro - Big Meech]
This Big Meech from the richest black muthaf-cking gang in the world
My nigga always say, there's only two things a nigga can do for you
You either got time or money, can't have em both
Nigga with money, dont have no time
Nigga with time, don't have no money
We don't have a lot of time around here cause time is money

[Verse 1 - Akon]
Give me one minute, cause you tripping
Too much time on your hands, you slipping
Why you focused on all this dealing?
When niggas coming in through the back door stealing?
Crib on the hill: now that's good living
Harder to reach when you make your first million
So much money gotta stack to the ceiling
And I'mma keep doing this forever, God-willing
Real niggas like me don't catch feelings
Only broke niggas be out there grilling
Say you getting money but you ain't even tipping
A big-booty girl in front of you dipping
Fronting like you really doing all that shipping
Man you gotta be, gotta be kidding
Don't even try cause my weapon is hidden
My nigga is ready to do some killing

[Hook - Akon]
I'mma tell you just one time: give me what's mine
Cause I don't have time to waste
I'll be on my grind, money on my mind
And I won't stop getting paid
Living this life of mine
I don't know if you really got what it takes
Hustling's in my blood and it just won't go away
Time, money, time, money
Nigga with money, don't have no time
Nigga with time, don't have no money

[Verse 2 - Akon]
'Kon live in one year, made millions
Everybody got money: nigga, we chillin
Ain't got no time: it's some bad feelings
Especially when you want a little sexual healing
Girlfriend's pulling, family's pulling
In every direction, everybody need money
My lifestyle redefine how they all living
If I keep it up I'll be broke in a minute
My kinfolk's on the block and they dealing
All my goons are still out there killing
Man I be running, got no time to be skipping
Trying to hit a home run in the 9th inning
Meech locked up, copped out, for a killing
Taking care of mine, San Quen chilling
That's my homie, you can trust that nigga
Just a matter of time before I get back with him

[Hook - Akon]
I'mma tell you just one time: give me what's mine
Cause I don't have time to waste
I'll be on my grind, money on my mind
And I don't stop getting paid
Living this life of mine
I don't really know if you really got what it takes
Hustling's in my blood and it just won't go away
Time, money, time, money
Nigga with money, don't have no time
Nigga with time, don't have no money

[Verse 3 - Akon]
Gotta look out for haters if you wanna be blockin'
Look out for stick up kids that be robbin'
Look out for ladies with their hands in your pocket
If you don't, you'll be the next hot topic
Don't wanna be the next one dropping
6 feet deep like conans coffin
I'd rather see you out there flossing
Love to see another brother getting it poppin
Chase that paper, don't you wait up
Get your money nigga, fuck them haters
Everybody complain about your time
You ain't got none? Find a way to make it up later
Cause I ain't got time for all that
And you ain't got time for all that
And I don't wanna waste your time
On behalf of BMF bring Meech back!
Time is money, time is money
Time is money, time is money
Time money, time money
Time is money
Time money, time money
Nigga with money, don't have no time
Nigga with time, don't have no money
Nigga with money, don't have no time
Nigga with time, don't have no money
Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father;
There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not;
As Thou hast been, Thou forever will be
Summer and winter and springtime and harvest
Sun, moon and stars in their courses above
Join with all nature in manifold witness
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love
Refrain:
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Morning by morning new mercies I see
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided;
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!
Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth
Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow
Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!
Refrain
Any time, any day
You can hear the people say
That love is blind
Well, I don't know, but I say love is kind

Do do do, do do do do
Do do do, do do do do

Soldier boy kisses girl
Leaves behind a tragic world
But he won't mind
He's in love, and he says love is fine

Do do do, do do do do
Do do do, do do do do

Oh, yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine, for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said?
He said
Oh, take it away

Oh, yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine, for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said?
He said

Oh, yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine, for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said?
He said

The wonder of it all, baby
The wonder of it all, baby
The wonder of it all, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
Spending my day thinkin' 'bout you girl
Being here with you, being near with you
I can't explain myself
Why I feel like I do
Though it hurts me so to let you know that I
Look in your eyes to let me know
How you feel
Let me know that love is really real
And it seems to me
That I'm wrapped up in your love

[Chorus:]
Don't you know that I'm
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey

And I look in your eyes
And all the years I see
Me lovin' you and you lovin' me
Well it seems to me
That I'm wrapped up in your love

[Chorus:]
Don't you know that I'm
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you
Hey, ah-ha, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hey, ah-ha
Don't you know that I'm
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you
Say I try it if you want me to
Ah-ha, ah-ha, aah, ah, ah, ah
(feat. Nas & Ali Vegas)

[Nas (Akon):]
Shakedown (Uh-oh-oh); Akon, Nas, here we go New York
(Uh-oh-oh) Here we go world, here we go y'all
(Uh-oh-oh, 'Cause it's a shakedown, uh-oh-oh)

[Ali Vegas:]
The streets'll do whatever just to see me fail
Mama'll do whatever to keep free from jail
So she tellin' me to get my CDL
But papi said he got some things that we could sell
To turn the corner and to see VVS's
He said you liked girls to get beneath their dresses
You gon' need them SS's, VVS's, BBS's
Here go the keys to the Lexus (Uh-oh-oh)
Now I'm the center of attention like Kareem and them
My squad run around the borough like we Prem' and them
My gang with big truck, wifey's we beamin' them
Let's Esco, that tag team from Queens again
This is Shakedown, here go the breakdown
The big boys are back; 'lil niggas get off the playground
I got up with the homey A now
The kid babies 'bout to make the Earth quake now

[Chorus: Akon (Nas)]
Uh-oh-oh, we back now
A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down (Lay it down)
And give 'em all you got, 'cause it's a shakedown (Shakedown)
Uh-oh-oh, (New York to H-Town)
We back now (Here we go y'all)
A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down
(Uh-oh, Nas and Akon, uh-oh, Nas and Akon)
And give 'em all you got, 'cause it's a shakedown
Uh-oh-oh, (Here we go)

[Nas:]
My man was smart
Robbed the bank, buried the cash
Did ten years, came home and bought him a Jag
Other side of town, stick-up kids ride around
Young niggas not prepared this time around
Walk in the jewelry store yellin', "Get on the floor"
Snatched the sales lady up, hit her with the bulldog
Grabbin' the ice, the heist went fast as the Vice
Had rushed in, bussin', could you imagine this life?
The streets come alive and laugh at your sorrows
Leavin' your soul hollow
That you fill it back up liquor bottles
Black Messiah had the jux, 20 ki's uncooked
Easy to push, some Japanese dealers were crooks
They leave niggas eyes cut out; what it means to us
He seen too much, but we don't give a fuck
Black truck pull up to the door
Infa-green night vision lens we can see through the war
"Get on the floor"

[Chorus: Akon]
We back now
A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down
And give 'em all you got, 'cause it's a shakedown
Uh-oh-oh
Do I make myself clear, uh-oh-oh
(feat. Akon)

Konvict
Akon and Young Jeezy
Tryin' to take it easy
Only way to go
And So... (Lets Get It!)

(Chorus - Akon)
If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block
With my thang cocked possibly sittin' on a drop now
Cause I'm a rida (Yeah)
I'm just a Soul Survivor (Yeah)

Cause er'body know the game don't stop
Tryin' to make it to the top for your ass get popped now
If you a rida (Yeah)
Or just a Soul Survivor (Yeah)

(Verse 1 - Young Jeezy)
(Let's get it) I can't sleep--we livin' in Hell (Yeah)
First they, give us the work then they throw us in jail (Ayy)
Road trip ya--I'm trafficing in the white
Please Lord don't let me go to jail tonight (Yeah)
Who Me?? I'm a Soul Survivor
Ask about 'em in the street, the boy Jeezy a rida (Jeezy a rida)
A hundred grand on my wrist, yeah life sucks (Ha Ha)
Fuck the club, dawg, I rather count a million bucks (Ayy)
(Chorus)

(Verse 2 - Young Jeezy)
Another day, another dolla (dolla)-same block, same nigga, same part, same green
I guess we got the same dreams (Ayy)
Or is it the same nightmares (nightmares)
We let the Thugs do it for us--we don't cry tears (That's right)
Real niggas don't budge
When Mail Man got his time he shot birds at the judge (Yeah)
I'm knee deep in the game
So when it's time to read up, I'm knee deep in the 'caine (Damn)
Real talk, Look, I'm tellin' you mayne (tellin' you mayne)
If you get jammed up don't mention my name
Forgive me Lord--I know I ain't livin' right
Gotta feed the block, niggas starvin', they got appitites (Ayy)
And this is er'day, it never gets old (Old)
Thought I was a juvenile stuck to the G-Code (Yeah)
This ain't a rap song, nigga this is my life (this is my life)
And if the hood was a battlefield then I'd earn stripes (Yeah)

(Chorus)

(Verse 3 - Young Jeezy)
Gotta watch your every move 'cuz them eyes be on you (eyes be on you)
Gotta drive real cool when them pi's be on you (pi's be on you)
Just because we stack paper and we ball outrageous (ball outrageous)
Them alphabet boards gotta us under survalence (Ayy)
Like animals they lock us in cages
The same nigga that's a star when you put 'em on stages
I ain't cheat--played the hand I was dealt
Tried to tax the grand pearl when I got it myself
(Let's Get It) No nuts, no glory (no glory)
My biography, you damn right, the true story (Yeah)
Set the city on fire, and I didn't even try (try)
Run these streets all day, I can sleep when I die (Ayy)
(Bridge - Akon)
Cause if you lookin' for me you you can find me
On the block disobeyin' the law
Real G--thoroughbred from the streets
Pants saggin' with my gun in my draws
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now

(Chorus x2)
Akon]
Dont know about you my nigga but the street's been good to me
Even took a whole lotta bullshit but it made me a stronger G
Dont know nuttin else but the street life when it come to me
I never thought i'd ever think about bitin the hand that fed me
Look at me now
Lookin for a way to get off the block
I said look at me now
This life im livin must stop man
Look at me now
Think about it each and every day
Look at me now
Dont know about you my nigga but the street's been good to me
Even took a whole lotta bullshit but it made me a stronger G
Dont know nuttin else but the street life when it come to me
I never thought i'd ever think about bitin the hand that fed me
Look at me now
Lookin for a way to get off the block
I said look at me now
This life im livin must stop
Man, look at me now
Think about it each and every day
Look at me now
Just look at me now

[Obie Trice]
Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks
I came in the game profane, no image
I came in the game with a name i was given
From a man who didn't give a fuck about his legitamate
I proclaim the name though
Never in vain no
Watch the change grow
A young nigga who didn't gain from fame
Copped a range rov'
Now they want my brains on the main row
But they dont understand what i came for
I came forward, wit a million sold
Who say you can't grow from mildew and mold
Get money like Ross Perrault
Im often told, a coffins the routes i go
Oh thats the road you on, oh no
Im down for the rifle tone of faux faux
They'll never try to send a nigga home, no no
I know you wanna catch me at Sunoco
Show me that your loco, put hoes in my photo, NOPE!
Ope, hold toast no jokes since thugs beat the poli'

[Akon]
Stayin in im just gettin much older
Its time to go start puffin up trees
Hot Glocks just get much colder, dodgin and duckin the police
How much longer must I stand on this corner?
I Gotta get off right away
How much longer must me see sell on this corner before they take my life away?
Dont know about you my nigga but the street's been good to me
Even took a whole lotta bullshit but it made me a stronger G
(fades)
Oy
Oy

Down on the street they got bagels
And there's a sale on cream cheese and lox
Nosh on some blintzes and bratwurst
Not in the mood for Jack-In-The-Box

Oy vey

We gonna schlepp on through to Flatbush Avenue
Kielbasa and chopped liver
We gonna schlepp on through to Flatbush Avenue
Or maybe they'll deliver

[Chorus: Akon]
I Can't Go Know Where
Unless Your By My Side
I Gotta Have You Here
Right Here By My Side
Can't Roam The Town
Unless Your By My Side
Gotta Have You Around
Right Here By My Side

[Verse 1: Trazz]
Ok
See Heres Some Things Im Tryin To Say Dyin To Say
I Keep Real With You Ain't No Crime Today
See I Been Thinkin About It All Day
In Brod Day
How You Stuck With Me And Been By My Side Like An Entray Before Imma Give You Diamonds Like Kanye
Nuttin Less Then 3000 Like Andre
And When I Come Home Sick You Always Stay Up With The Light On For The Kid Like Motel Sex
Never Think About Flowin With This
Callin It Quits
So I Can't Give A Damn About These Hotel Chicks
Comming At Me Like A Linebacker Blitz And That Don't Me Shit But Keep A Close Snitch To Get Hitch Like Will Smith(So Uh)
You Blowin My Ways And All The Things I Hate About You You Would Be Willing To Change We Was In The Right Lane The Way This Smash Was Made So There Ain't A Damn Thing Im Willin To Change This My Stand

[Chorus: Akon]
I Can't Go Know Where

[Verse 2: Trazz]
Yeah

As Long As Your Supporting Your Dream It's Your Team
When Im Done You Be Keeping Me Up Like Caffine
So As Long As Money Is Green Your All I Need
And I Dont Know What Ive Done To Deserve It Cause You Always Keep My Head Above Water Like A Life Preserver
So I Buy You Ruggs And Purses Just To Give Worser
And We Prey For Life Situations Where It Determines
Chicks Holla But They All About The Dollars
I Never Bothered You Were Here When I Started It
And You Been Making It Clear How To Still Support The Kid When You Have Your Own Career When Like Anything
We Been Through Up And Downs Hand And Hand And Can't Imangine Me Going Through What I Did Without You Here(Uh Uh)
So I Promise You Bearts As A Man You Can Have The World When Its In The Palms Of My Hands

[Chorus: Akon]
I Can't Go Know Where
Unless Your By My Side
I Gotta Have You Here
Right Here By My Side
Can't Roam The Town
Unless Your By My Side
Gotta Have You Around

[Verse 3: Trazz]
Yeh

[Chorus: Akon]

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm

Ain't another woman that can take your spot my...

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me, what would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular, tell me, would you?

Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you, say "I do"

Yeah, because
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

Oh, girl
My love
My love

Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote, what would you do?
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team, tell me, would you?

See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure, that baby, it's you
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for, just say "I do"

Yeah, because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

(So don't give away) My love

Alright, it's time to get it JT
I don't know why she hesitates for a man
Shorty, cool as a fan on the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin with your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can

'Cause the girl's real wild, throw their hands up high
When they wanna come kick it with a standup guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen wit' a man so fly
Baby, friend so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle mine
T.I. they call me candle guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire

I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die

Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Well baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy

I ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same bark, same bullet, anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me any pair, I will

I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me

Blues has got me, there is teardrops in my eyes
Yes the blues has got me, there is teardrops in my eyes
Well dark is the night, since my baby said good-bye

Oh how I've suffered since my baby went away
Yes how I've suffered since my baby went away
And I've got that feeling that my baby's gone to stay

Take me back baby, forgive me for the wrong I've done
Yes take me back darling, forgive me for the wrong I've done
Well I know I love you, and you're the only one

Yes talk to me baby, call me on the telephone
Yeah talk to me baby, call me on the telephone
Yes the blues has got me, and I want my baby home

Yes if your baby love you, keep her home and treat her nice
Oh if your baby love you, you better keep her home and treat her nice
Well never mistreat a good woman, this is some doggone good advice
Ain't another woman that can take your spot my...

Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said "Baby, can't you see?
I wanna be famous, a star of the screen
But you can do something in between"

Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

Beep beep-m beep beep, yeah

What You're Doing

[Chorus]
Look, what you're doing
I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
You got me running and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

The Word
It's so fine, it's sunshine

It's the word, love
Beep beep-m beep beep, yeah

Gettin' brain in the library 'cause I love knowledge
When you use your Medulla Oblongata
& give me scoliosis until I comatoses
& do it while I sleep yeah a little osmosis
& that’s my commandment you ain’t gotta ask Moses

She said she want whatever she like
But she gotta bring your friend
& We could have 1 hell of a night, through the day
She blamed it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
She had her hair did, it was bound to fall
Down, down for a damn, Cudi already said it
A pokerface book I already read it
But man, her head was gooder than the music
Electro body known to blow fuses
A stripper from the south lookin' for a payday
Said bitch you should do it for the love like Ray Jay
But they say you be on that conscious tip
Get your hair right & get up on this conscious dick
I embody everything from the Gali to the party
It's the way I was raised on the south side safari, so...

(Can't read my, can't read my
No He can't read my pokerface
She's got me like nobody)

(Can't read my, can't read my
No He can't read my pokerface
She's got me like nobody)
(Spoken by Johnny Cash)
I discovered the Valley of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
While prospecting in a western state
I saw the silent windmills, the crumbling water tanks
The bones of the cattle picked clean by buzzards
Bleached by the desert sun
I stumbled over a crumbling buck board
Nearly covered by the sand
And stopping to rest I heard a tinkling, whispering sound
And suddenly realized that even though the wind was quiet
The sand did not lie still
I seemed to be surrounded be a mystery
So heavy and apperceive I could scarcely breath
For weeks I wondered aimlessly in the valley
Seeking answers to the many questions that raced through my mind
Where was everyone? Why the white bones? The dry wells?
The barren valley where people must have lived and died
I sat down and buried my face in my hands
And resting I learned the secret of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
How I managed to escape from the valley I don't know
But now to pay my debt for being saved
I must tell you what I learned out on the desert
So many years ago
(Sung by the Carter Family)
When the day is oddly quiet
And the breeze seems not to blow
One would think the sun is resting
But you'll find this is not so

It is whispering softly whispering
As it slowly moves along
And for those who stop and listen
It will sing this mournful song

(Sung by an unknown male choir)
Of sidewinders and the horn toads
On the thorny *chaparral
In the sunny days and moonlight lights
The lonely coyotes yell

(Sung by Johnny Cash)
How the stars seem they can touch you
As you lay and gaze on high
At the heavens where your hoping
You'll be going when you die

*Here's a definition to help
You better understand the song
According to the liner notes
A chaparral is "a thorny bush
Native to the Southwest."

You say you love me darlin'
Please, call me on the phone sometime
You say you love me darlin'
Please, call me on the phone sometime
When I hear your voice
Ease my worried mind

One of these days
I'm gonna show you how nice a man can be
One of these days
I'm gonna show you just how nice a man can be
I'm gonna buy you a brand, new Cadillac
If you only speak some good words about me

Hear my phone ringin'
Sound like a long distance call
Hear my phone keep ringin'
Sound like a long distance call
When I picked up my receiver
The party said another mule kickin' in your stall

[Verse 1]
See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, got my fangs and my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
And every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up tell me how I'm looking, babe

[Breakdown]
Boy, this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's looking, babe
And tell me how it's looking, babe, looking, babe

[Verse 2]
Drop the bass, mayne, the bass get lower
Radio say "speed it up," I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't never seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off your tongue
'Cause when he wanna smash I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like-like liquor, like-like-like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like-like liquor, like-like-like liquor
For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone Ive needed so long
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know Ill be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me
Im not alone anymore

For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me

Ughh taxi come pick this nigga up; a used condom in his truck

Standing in the front yard telling me

(Beyonce & Trina:)

One who wines *&* dines me wit million dollar even tho rap it to equality

Or my football playa friend whose been beggin me to end it
My attorney on Brickle wit a big popsicle
Who ain't neva had a hard time aimin at tha middle
MY NBA All Star who make it wit a sizzle
That's tha shizzle my nizzle; he think his time when he nibble
Don't make me remind u; to tha left, to tha left

[Asher Roth:]
My aura takes the form of the aurora borealis
Or a floral pattern, more or less a forest to your salad
The neural path I've traveled has immediate reaction
Can't you see that I am beaming? I'll be leaving in a second
Sipping magic from a chalice, detached from the distractions
At last, I can relax, looking past all of the action
A fraction or a fragment of me actually is present
The rest of me is heavenly, the seventh house's zenith
Yes, the fence intimidates, it's meant to keep you out (But)
Let your senses resonate and leap it in a bound ('Cause)
Freedom isn't found inside a visa or a crown
And even the voice of reason couldn't speak it out loud (But)
Mortals are immortal when their soul has been imported
To a source that is more sovereign, important to the whole (Whole)
This is the warmest moment of a poet turned heroic
As he slowly comes to focus, go ahead and watch me glow

[Charles Hamilton:]
Rey Mysterio flow, stayin' clear
Of makeup-smeared hatin' queers, makin' clear this is spiritual
Though a spirit you owe, church final
Your funeral in an arena, you searchin' for fire
Or titles, or tidal waves
Tie the game like a shot from outside when it's 95 to 98
To throw slid into you left-side broke (Niggas!) (Beam!)
Boa constrictor, chokin' (Niggas!), the grown man (Beam!)
Pawns mean, your controllers get broken (Nigga!) (Beam!)
Anarchy in the Ford, you need to focus (Nigga!) (Beam!)
Love, I get none, like sayin' no to niggas
Hamiltonian's loneliness, so I hold my (Beams!) (Niggas!)
I logged on to see a c-section, a gross display
Sleep never, and Rolaids, deep lessons won't go away
I keep pressin' like my phone is afraid
To be the star, so I end it and pound it, see what the code can say

[Lupe Fiasco:]
Calling all the good rappers, had to get my crew together
Fire like the fire flower, flyer than the super feather
Superman with two propellers, enter that, ninja rap
You can call it Super Shredder, boss scene, Ross theme
You can call it super better, new to this, Ludacris
Foolishness, Lu been doin' this since super letters
So I can't spell and can't mail it out
If you can't feel, it's too full, you can't peel it out
Showboatin' at the show, but you can't sell it out
I'm on the sea shepherd deck, helpin' the whales out
All my egos in the mirror, checkin' themselves out
Tweeters in the trunk, helpin' the twelves out
The speakers on bump, the rappers on acne
This track is what would happen if the rastas meet the mathletes
Yes, sir, then the Chess Club got dressed up
And went and took all the bitches of the athletes

[Mikey Rocks:]
Big up to what's been up, nigga
Pin-ups from when we clicked up and posed for these pictures, good
And the kids connected up, and they clicked snap
Hollerin', "Yeah, we weighed on the iPhone scale app!"
Without fail, the best to ever do it just will
Haven't done it all, but we got copy wheelwell, though
But it ain't no sweat, I got a whole outfit
And a new fitted cap that I ain't wore out yet
(Check, check, check) And I'm beamin'
Yeah, and I seen it, like a twenty-seven inch Zenith
Projected widescreen, now they got it 3D
Now we NBA'd up from development leagues

[Chuck Inglish:]
Ay, yo, they pale in comparison to stories we tell
Man, he see me on the hovercraft and he got a sail
Bubble-ass Brenda, stacked up in the window
Of whatever 'Lac truck pick her up, retail
Nigga, what? It just hit me like a Mack truck semi
On my last trip to Sydney in the Sheraton lobby
Grab my coattails and get a grip (Grab 'em)
You want the truth? Well, the truth is
This is it, pointin' out the differences
This is exquisite shit, riveting, isn't it?
Lizard king loafers on swole when I'm kickin' it

Joe, the live nigga, real rig-a-marole
You a handshake away, and them fingers is cold

[Blu:]
Touch art, lush heart, brush my niggas' shoulder off
Now that blessed soldier know that protocol, show me y'all's
Maybe not, play me not, say we not remote at all
Roger that, scholars back, solid black, go God
Gobble Gats, go hard, condom snapped, so raw
Pompous asshole, flash flow, turn your soul on
So gone, strode strong through your lawn 'til the dawn
Tell you mom, name another real as John, kill a song
'Cause when you feel it, and it make yo' ass chill and calm
Payin' more than just attention for that glass I'm sippin' on
Dog, I would travel half the globe to kiss a broad
Kiddin', ma? Scratch backs, bringin' out them kitten paws
And pull a bottle out that cabinet while that kitchen's warm
Back to attendin' business, do not lay them digits wrong
Dippin' all gangsta, but a renegade, no Crip or John
This is Blu, shit is true, pyramid, period

[Diggy Simmons:]
I know what you're thinkin', thinkin' I do not belong
Tell me Diggy ain't beamin', 'course I should be on this song
Yeah, I'm a child of God, my reflection is on
Yeah, I'm only 15 and, but my sixteens is strong
Didn't want me to shine, now we sharin' the stage
Twice as good as you rhyme, only half of your age
So the remains, and it ain't even how
That Verizon flow, are you hearin' me now?
Word to Wasalu, they was sayin' my future was dark
I had the fame, but my name was missin' the art
So I'm drawin' the line, and I'm crossin' the Ts
And I'm dottin' my Is, barely catchin' my Zs
But I'll be good by the mornin', on my global grind like JoJo
They be lookin' at what I'm puttin' on and, so fly, so fresh at the SoHo
Most niggas don't know though, they can catch me on the first flight
Been workin' on a new mixtape, I got a call from Lupe
But I did it for the love, no check, mate

[Dosage:]
When people said I couldn't, I wouldn't, I made 'em believers
I come from the school of hard knocks and overachievers
From the City of Brotherly Love, they sayin' we need you
To be the voice of the people and go against all this evil
Some people hate it, but I made it, so I'm never concerned
About what they be talkin' about, I've lived and I've learned
With my dream and my drive, I determined my turn
In this business, because I'm in control, meetin' adjourned
I said, "It's Third Degree, y'all heard of we?
I'm Dosage, have you heard of me?"
I come from the bottom, so the top where I deserve to be
Where people say it doesn't matter to be much
I was on the Steppin' Lasers tour, and man, I shooked it up
That was random, but so what? Life is a war, better load up
If you against me, come correct, I am the bomb, watch me blow up (Boom!)
Right before your eyes, forget about the dividends
I just want to say I remember when

[B.o.B:]
Well, it's B to the O, O to the B
You know it's the flow, you know that it's me, I flow to this beat
As easy as goin' to the store and holdin' receipts
And foldin' 'em neat, I'm focused as focused can be
You know I got phobias, please, approach me with peace
Or things could get heated and you'll get ferociously beat
Speakin' of ferociously beat, you know that girl 'Nique?
You know she's a freak, but anyway, back to what I'm supposed to be
Sayin' all over this beat, you know that we Gs
You see all the crowns, you know that we kings, you notice the rings
Everywhere we go, we roll with the team, yeah
And you know that we lasers, so you know that we beam
It's the All City varsity, hard-headed squad
We played y'all spades, y'all handle y'all cards
But we ain't all odds, we just blaze, man
Y'all playin' checkers in this game, this is chess, y'all pawns
Knocked down everything I tried to do
That sounds something like me holding you
I've known this can make you understand
Take my spirit from my open hand

You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
Me, me, me, yeah, me, yeah, me, me, me, yeah, me, yeah
Me, me, me, me, me, me, yeah, you know better than I do

Knocked down everything I tried to do
That sounds something like me holding you
I've known this can make you understand
Take my spirit from my open hand
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You know better than I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
Well, you said you had enough
You said that you were leavin'
I said, "Shove off honey, baby, I ain't grievin'
Pack your bags and pull out this evenin'
There's a wide open road"

Early this mornin' you where nowhere about
And so I searched the town but you had done pulled out
I looked north, east and west and then a leadin' south
I saw a wide open road

There's a wide open road
It's leadin' south from my abode
If you stick around and turn your damper down
There's a wide open road

Well, the reason I was lookin' for you all over town
Was to tell you that your kitty cat was still around
And you left your weddin' ring when you went down
That wide open road
If you gonna stay away then honey let me know
How to cook hot biscuits, how to roll a dough
Every thing's gone crazy since I told you to go
Down the wide open road

There's a wide open road
And honey, I want you to know
You can look down south or you can turn back home
And there's a wide open road
He was born to be known as everybody's brother
He is the Father, Son, and Mary is His mother
He is a 'scuse my slanguage
Well, a compound country kinda guy
(Yes, He is)

Ain't no way to get around it
You just can't beat Jesus Christ
(No, you can't)

I used to crank and drank
Until my back was to the floor
I'd take it to the limit
Then I'd try to get some more

Yeah, when it came to gamblin'
Well, the Lord God knows I'd roll them dice
(Yes, I would)

Ain't no reason to deny it
I have been saved by Jesus Christ
Praise the Lord
Well, even though I am a sinner
He will always be my friend
He starts in the middle
And He does not have an end

And when my soul was held for ransom
Well, He is the one that paid the price

There ain't no two ways about it
I owe it all to Jesus Christ
You know I do

He was born to be known as everybody's brother
He is the Father, Son, and Mary is His mother
He is a 'scuse my slanguage
Well, a compound country kinda guy

Ain't no way to get around it
You just can't beat Jesus Christ
I mean it
(Hallelujah)
Visions cupped within a flower
Deadly petals with strange power
Faces shine a deadly smile
Look upon you at your trial

Chill and numbs from head to toe
Icy sun with frosty glow
Words that grow read to your sorrow?
Words that grow read no tomorrow?

Feel your spirit rise with the breeze
Feel your body falling to its knees
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse

Now from darkness, there springs light
Wall of Sleep is cool and bright
Wall of Sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in, you have awoken
Oh yeah!

Some people say my love cannot be true
Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you
I will give you those things you thought unreal
The sun, the moon, the stars; all bear my seal

Oh yeah!

Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'til the end of time

Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

Oh yeah!

Now I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger now with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand
Oh yeah!

Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'til the end of time

Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

Oh yeah!

Now I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger now with every hour
Look into my eyes, you will see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I sing (now I sing) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I sing sing sing sing cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing sing sing sing sitting on top of the world

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Man I remember before I say that wait let me issue this statement
No way should reflection be mistaking for glorification
Now I remember so vivid me and my niggas was living
Sub-standard condition still handling business
Still laughing and tripping still having the bitches
I'm rapping now reminiscing and god damn it we did it
From trapping standing and pitching with rich we stand in the kitchen
Splitting it eight ways flip it in 8 days
Thought that wildin unruly it was just the way to behave
Kept the weight and the yay for most the paper we made in all dimes
I ain't lying the pleasure was all mine
Have big work to move but we served the small time
I always outshined the niggas with small minds
Who would of thought we would be arguably the greatest of all time
Around here we developed such a sound down here
But duplicate it off the steel it can only be found here
Only listen to G's that other shit I don't hear
Shit they so far in the rear how would I even care
I'm too busy being a player staring at niggas careers
But talk about it for years and now we finally here

[Chorus:]
I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I sing (now I sing) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I sing sing sing sing cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing sing sing sing sitting on top of the world

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
They say what goes up must come down but I ain't reached my cruising altitude
Take a look at what I did but can you imagine what I'm about to do
The places I'm bout to go and the money I'm bout to see
Gave bill gates some binoculars and said look out for me
Exceeded expectations even at def jam
Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man
My momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
Cause I'm a self-made nappy-headed rich nigga
Private planes help me travel in peace
To four cities in one day and four countries in one week
Cause I work for myself and no one else cause I'm too smart too
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school
Now he my personal chef so that bread he get it
Put them all in houses cleaned up all of my friends credit
And now they witness all the glitz and the glamor
Catch us eating at straits Atlanta with women with table manners
Order in Singapore and lobster
Celebrating coming from nothing to winning grammys and rappers winning oscars
And they say rappers shouldn't act nahh suckers
We see Samuel L.Jackson like what's up mother fucker

[Chorus:]
I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I sing (now I sing) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I sing sing sing sing cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing sing sing sing sitting on top of the world

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I know them haters don't stop plotting and wish you would fall
Cause I'm standing on top looking down at it all
I see you down there to ya'll this ain't like I got it all
Homie I ain't get enough I'm still trying to triple up
That's why we got is street cred and akoo building up
Say I'm doing too much shit I say I ain't did enough
Remember saying damn if I could just get to a million plus
And now I'm like shit what the fuck is a million bucks
Triple that on my bond thanks to bigs and run
But never mind what I've been through just look at what I become
All the shit I've avoided what I done for my sons
And daughters and momma just call her
I sold dope and dropped out of school seems it's all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me
I broke that cycle now my family live a life of
Mandatory minimals but not when the judge sentence them
Cousins in college where you think they get tuition from
Just for standing around wishing huh
And while you standing around looking dumb
I make it happen taking action over time got damn good at it

[Chorus:]
I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I sing (now I sing) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I sing sing sing sing cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing sing sing sing sitting on top of the world

Hands to the sky, and throw your head back
(Bounce
Bounce
Bounce
Bounce)

Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild, we bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
I don't care what anybody thinks about that

[Intro: The Game]
Yo Dre
Skee
Hit the switch (What)

[Verse 1: The Game]
Guess who's bizack
Wit an ounce of crizack
Or a black mizak fitted to the bizak
L.A. Dodgers kid's at
That's where my shit's at
Niggas want my life homey come get that
I'm tired of the rif-rat
Niggas better sit back
Cause when the guns come out they break like kit-kats
But if its beef break me of a piece
I eat that beat that i'm back on the streets
I got a whole lot of bitches to see
And i don't fuck any dub niggas bitches to me
And a bitch is a bitch thats just a simple fact
Next time I'm in town you gonna get me jacked
Send the baby daddy see how the kids react
When the daddy comes home and his ribs is cracked
And he files a lawsuit for a million flat
Fuck it I gotta deal wit that
That's just how it is

[Hook: The Game]
Dre ridin' again
Westside again
Go get your ties again
You muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation
If you come back then we go again
Dre ridin' again
Westside again
Go get your ties again
You muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation
If you come back then we go again

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Guess who's back again
Straight out the C.P.T
D.O.C. D.R.E
Y'all know me wit the shit bangin'
I'm in the streets again
This west coast shit gettin' played again
Its a new season and
A lot of people waitin'
A lot of niggas hatin'
Whole lot of stipulation
It's Dre makin the beats
Puttin' riders on the floor
I gets dope I'm the Aftermath C.E.O
Half the world wanna see me flow
The other half wanna see me go
It won't happen muthafuckas
Dre still rappin muthafuckas
The streets still love him
Paid in full since "Deep Cover"
All three speakers still drumming
Beats still coming
Comptons version of "Feel Drumming"
Same Dre different strokes
Same six-tre different spokes
Same chronic just different smoke

[Hook: The Game]
Dre ridin' again
Westside again
Go get your ties again
You muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation
If you come back then we go again
Dre ridin' again
Westside again
Go get your ties again
You muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation
If you come back then we go again

[Verse 3: The Game]
It ain't easy being signed to Dre
I'm in the press so much I ain't got time to pray
It's been six months too long
Aftermath gotta move on
Now the beef wit me and 50 Cent gone
I told y'all not to fuck wit me
Ghost writer my pens got that Murder Inc
I feel kinda bad about "murdering" Ja
What goes around comes around look at 50's shot (a'ight a'ight)
But fuck that never mind that shit you did
You tryin' to sell albums I'm just tryin' to feed my kid
Game, you gonna respond to Mr. Potato Head
I told I'm just tryin' to feed my kid
Why scoop to a level that requires a shovel
That's like throwing ice cubes at the muthafuckin' devil
I left the group cause the group's too crowded
Now watch Game finish his second album without him

[Hook: The Game]
Dre ridin' again
Westside again
Go get your ties again
You muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation
If you come back then we go again
Dre ridin' again
Westside again
Go get your ties again
You muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation
If you come back then we go again

[Outro]
Aftermath!

I'm so three thousand and eight
You so two thousand and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now
Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more

She goes downstairs to the kitchen, clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free

She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)

She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye, bye)

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs

She breaks down and cries to her husband
"Daddy, our baby's gone"
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)

She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye, bye)
She's leaving home (Bye, bye)
CHORUS
Weirdo...Weirdo, Ima Weirdo(2x)
Killed da pussy, killed the bitch
Turned into a weirdo
Mr zone 6, half a million dollar ear lobe
Weirdo...Weirdo, Ima Weirdo(2x)
Gucci mane, drumma boy
Dis here for da weirdos
Had it like a bag a dro
Flowin like a weirdo

Verse 1
Shawty mad, mad for wut
Man cuz she can't get enough
Tough luck
Diggin Gucci mane and he dont give a fuck
Throw it up, Pick it up
UHH
Shes a material girl

You ain't got enough
Its a weird, weird
And she asking weird questions
Why yo engine n da rear
Switchin gears den im outta here
You boyfriends so last year
Lets have breakfast on the moon
Lets have dinner on Uranus
I got Venus,on my penis
And Serena wrapped round my fingers
Lil mama wet as aquafina
Send dem hoes like Angelina
I like em black
I like em yella
I like em red
I like to meet her
My pocket all swoll', my rims all chrome
When I hit the club everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don't really care

'Cause I ride on 'em, plus, I style on 'em
Yes, I lean on 'em, yes, I flash on 'em
Yeah, I know, that's the way you like it, huh?
Yeah, that's the way you love me, hon'

It's alive, it's alive, rounds cured the eyes
I had to bring the bitch back like Frankenstein
I push weight but Gucci don't exercise
I get extra whipped cream for them eskimo pies

I'm in the 'hood like the mayor 'round election time
Here's a suggestion: don't park your car next to mine
I'mma start when the light hit, I 'posed to shine
Your flow is garbage, they let me out just in time

They got a section but none of the ho's are fine
They need to exit, don't let the grind pass you by
I run laps 'round lames with my shoes untied
I jump the line, walk in, and watch the crowd divide
Still stuck outside, that's the ugly side
Looked Medusa in the eye and Medusa died
This is top secret shit, classified
Don't blame me, Swizz was the mastermind

I can't breathe, can't breathe, Toni Braxton time
I got a chain moonwalkin', Michael Jackson time
I keep on buying ice like I lost my mind
This bloodline of mine is supposed to shine

My pocket all swoll', my rims all chrome
When I hit the club everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don't really care

'Cause I ride on 'em, plus, I style on 'em
Yes, I lean on 'em, yes, I flash on 'em
Yeah, I know, that's the way you like it, huh?
Yeah, that's the way you love me, hon'

Hurry up, hurry up Gucci on the news
They say he walked out the jail rockin' stupid jewels
They tryin' to find out what it do, admit it, you confused
Too much cash on me, hundreds fallin' out my trous'

My yellow wrist, bright as piss, bitch, on the shit
Big Gucci called Swizz, let's make a hit
Two thing in this world I ain't ever seen
Are you a foreigner, nigga? I need to help me get mimi
I hope you suffocate, me told her, baby, let me breathe
'Cause I don't chase nothin' but paper, bitch, you're chasin' me
Excuse my French, but this is Gucci, I'm so fucking gutter
It don't make no sense to switch for any of these motherfuckers

My pocket all swoll', my rims all chrome
When I hit the club everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don't really care

'Cause I ride on 'em, plus, I style on 'em
Yes, I lean on 'em, yes, I flash on 'em
Yeah, I know, that's the way you like it, huh?
Yeah, that's the way you love me, hon'

Somebody said my life is it
I said nah dog, my wife is it
Now I'm back, back on 'em like I never, never left
Plus the boy right here, I'm fresh to death

Woo, Christians on my feet
See, I can't fall for Suzuki jeeps
Now I'm jumpin' off decks
Don't worry about the haters, they gonna be upset

And the Black Card in my back pocket
The Conaseg lookin' like a speeder rocket
Yeah, I'm zoomin' on the highway
And you should love me, I did it my way
My pocket all swoll', my rims all chrome
When I hit the club everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don't really care

'Cause I ride on 'em, plus, I style on 'em
Yes, I lean on 'em, yes, I flash on 'em
Yeah, I know, that's the way you like it, huh?
Yeah, that's the way you love me, hon'
Bet you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though

Cut those cameras on cause my camos on
And my niggas backin' me riding around town
With a big old bag of weed
Taylor Gang, we ain't in your faculty
Me and Snoop Dogg, we created a masterpiece
Smoke all day and I'm makin' this cash, and we
Bout it bout it like Master P
Go hard, stack ya cheese, roll a joint, pass the trees
TGOD, he's the OG, real G shit what it has to be
My real nigga gon' pop tags for me
Fake niggas gon' get bags for me
Say you just wanna shake hands with me?
Same fuck niggas used to laugh at me
Now I'm riding around town in the car that you can't even pronounce
And you can't go fast as me
Smoking marijuana, and she know that I'm a player
So she wanna come up here and spend this cash on me
That pimp shit come naturally
That fuck shit is whack to me
My kush grown organically
My ballin' is actually
Bet you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though fo' sho'

You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on

Let me turn you on and turn you out
To make you feel like you really wanna feel
For real, sho will, nigga I got that kill
You know what I got Captain Crunch, soda pop
Light green kush cut from a bush
Mix it together, get it together
Hypo grow with the hydro flow
Smoking on some shit called I don't know
This is the shit that was caught
From my niggas on the block with a .44 Glock, oh no!
Cuttin it up, button it up
Homie don't speak at all
You might escape, you might be most likely like shark bait
I might hate, nigga you smoking that lightweight
Wrong class, featherweight, levitate
Set it straight, let me break it down for you
Clip it, zip it, let it fly
If it's good, it's gonna get you high
Drop it, stop it, that ain't the one
We don't even smoke that shit for fun!
Bet you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though fo' sho'

You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on

Yea nigga, I'm rolling up that high-grade
Chillin' on the porch, smoking like it's Friday
Every day of the week to Juicy J's a high day
Niggas think I'm Chinese cause my eyes straight
I threw up a six into a twenty ounce
Smoked a half ounce of kush, felt like twenty ounces
Fucked around and popped a molly now I'm high as fuck
Every Jacob seeing, Juicy screamin' out 'let's fuck!'
I dun popped a pill and hit the lean behind it
Where my mind? Somebody help me find it
Got a black and white bitch, they my mixed bitch
They keep my double cup full, OG in my Swisher

Bet you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though fo' sho'
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
Round here you play the cards that you were dealt
I could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel
I can't see you in my rearview cause you left
I'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt

[2x]

[Gucci]
I'm on my hustle, I'm bout my grind
I got a plan to make the whole Atlanta mine
One for the money, two for the show
Three dollars for the soda, I mix it in the coke
I'm icy in the summer, I think I need a coat (burr)
I'll drag you to the river then throw you off the boat
Cold dirty shame, low down dirty games, I use to have them thangs
But now I'm on the screen
Play it how it go, take it how it come
Fuck how you feel cause my feelings numb
Play it how it go, take it how it come
Fuck how you feel cause my feelings numb

Round here you play the cards that you were dealt
I could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel
I can't see you in my rearview cause you left

[Gucci]
Gucci mane I'm hard to kill
Ain't nobody murkin me
Niggas think they hercules, have they ass in surgery
Viagara flow, cialis verses, ain't nobody hard as me
He may have more money but he'll neva have more heart than me
Its big dog, bulldog, leapfrog, jumpoff
Sawed off pump, nigga this ain't what you want
And we goin all out, all out for the yola
I owe it to the soda
I cut the music down just so I can hear the motor
I open up the sun roof so you can smell the odor
Play your cards right or they'll find you in Dakota
Suckers get trampled, snitches ran over, snitches ran over

Round here you play the cards that you were dealt
I could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel
I can't see you in my rearview cause you left
I'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt

Yup! Yup!
Gucci Mane in this motherfucker (Gucci Gucci)
My nigga Zo' on the track (my nigga Zo')
That real shit, that real shit

[Hook] (2x)
I'm a hood rich nigga, I ain't never had shit
I really ain't shit; niggas talkin 'bout me
But they really ain't shit, they ain't said shit
It don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense

[Verse 1]
I ain't never had shit nigga that's the truth
Rich kids in the school used to jones my shoes
Name stayed on the board, fo' checks in chalk
In detention cause the teacher say that we can't talk
Counselor raggin and my momma got that I just walk
I wish I had a nickel for every fight I fought
Stealin candy out the sto' like I can't get caught
Just a lil' bad black boy, it ain't my fault
After school snack syrup and fo' pieces of bread
Granddaddy why yo' eyes so God damn red?
"Got a real soft ass and a hard-ass head
Better mind your fuckin manners boy," that's what he said

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I moved to East Atlanta at the age of 9
Real cold winter, 1989
My brother good at ball, I can't play no sports
They won't let you pack a tool on the b-ball court
Cluster Ave, Monty Paul, where my daddy now?
Things goin alright, we a family now
Got the dopeman Nikes and the Starter coat
Only nigga in school with the dopeman rope
Pull the joint two times, man I'm high already
I like that girl with them braids and them high-top Chevys
Got that bump for stick-up, Starter and the big boy chest
Tried to take it on the train but I just couldn't let him

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
14 gettin drunk at a house party
They locked me up, they must have hid a half a ounce on me
Momma mad as a mother', daddy let him be
Gucci Mane, raised me to be a straight up G
Now my daddy hustle hard, but he love sum liquor
And my momma wanna leave him but she love the nigga
Everything kinda changed when I turned 16
Got the old school Regal with the chrome back rings
Like a newborn baby, man that bitch clean
But the motor fucked up and the transmission
And it's knockin down the street with the 415's
In Mackmile parkin lot, stright whipping
And I'm Bankhead bouncin, fo' hoes want me
Hit the half and give me two dimes for 15
And my mind's on gettin rich by all means
In the trap, cause this rap shit was just my dream

But it's hard to see with all the people standing in the way (Oh!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh
Tell me, have you seen her? 'Cause I'm so, oh

Rollin' on her knees I said, "I'm scared of ya"

Tattoo on her back, lovin' the way she work it
Body movin' like she's dancin' in the circus
Back forth up down when jerk it
Put the thoia, thoia, thong on, now, watch her murder it

I had her singing
Thoia, thoia, thoia, thoia, thong, thong
Thoia, thoia, thoia, thoia, thong
She had me singing
Thoia, thoia, thoia, thoia, thong, thong
Thoia, thoia, thoia, thoia, thong
Thoia, thoia, thoia, thoia, thong
We make a lot of noise
We come through the club
All of the ladies in the house
Come, show ya boys some love

Last call for alcohol
We're closin' down the bar
Tell me where's the after party at?
We rollin' with the R

I had her singing
Thoia, thoia, thoia, thoia, thong, thong
Thoia, thoia, thoia, thoia, thong
She had me singing
Thoia, thoia, thoia, thoia, thong, thong
Thoia, thoia, thoia, thoia, thong

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
Old pirates, yes, they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption song
Redemption song
Redemption song

[Verse 2: Ziggy Marley, Lauryn Hill & Both]
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds!
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Yes, some say it's just a part of it
But, we've got to fulfill the book

[Chorus: Ziggy Marley, Lauryn Hill & Both]
Won't you help to sing
Another song of freedom?
'Cause all I ever had
Redemption song
Redemption song
Redemption songs

[Bridge: Ziggy Marley]
Yeah, L. Boogie

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
Yo, if they can stop this fruit
They would pop this route
Chop this fruit
Treat us like a prostitute
Knock this youth
See me in my cocky suit
God's recruit
From fallin' even God's salute
Tribal truth
Ja people can't be mute
Share my youth to Babylon can't regroup
Sing, to Babylon can't regroup
Sing, to Babylon can't regroup

[Verse 4: Ziggy Marley, Lauryn Hill & Both]
Emancipate yourself from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
Some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book

[Outro: Ziggy Marley, Lauryn Hill & Both]
Won't you help to sing
Another song of freedom, yeah
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption song

[Verse 1]
Confidence is a must
Cockiness is a plus
Edginess is a rush
Edges, I like them rough
A man with a Midas touch
Intoxicate me, I'm a lush
Stop, you're making me blush
People are looking at us

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think you
I don't think you
I don't think you know, know

[Chorus]
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot

Don't wanna lose you, you on my radar (On my radar)

Interesting sense of style
Ten million dollar smile
Think I can’t handle that
Animal in the sack
His eyes see right to my soul
I surrender self-control
Catch me looking again
Falling right into my plan

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think you
I don't think you
I don't think you know, know

I got the horse right here, the name is Paul Revere
And here's a guy that says that if all weather's clear
Can do, can do, this guy says the horse can do
If he says the horse can do, can do, can do
I picked the Valentine, cause on the Morning Line
The guy has got em figured at five to nine
But take the Epitaph, he went to buy a half
He's got it cold in here in the Telegraph
About Rivera's fight, I guess the sport's alright
Suppose it all depends if it rained last night
I know it's Valentine, the morning works were fine
You know the jockey's brother is a friend of mine
But just a minute, boys, I got the feedback's choice
It says the great grandfather was Aqua Poise
I give you Paul Revere, and it's no bum steer
It's from a man right here that's real sincere
I picked my Valentine cause on the Morning Line
The guy has got em figured at five to nine
But take the Epitaph, he went to buy a half
He's got it cold in here in the Telegraph
Epitaph, Valentine, Paul Revere, I got the horse right here

[Verse 1]
Nothing seems to be the way
That it used to
Everything seems shallow
God give me truth (me truth, me truth, me truth)
In me
And tell me somebody is watching
Over me
And that is all I'm praying is that

[Chorus]
Someday I will understand
In God's whole plan
And what he's done to me
Oh, but maybe
Someday I will breathe
And I'll finally see
I'll see it all in my baby

[Verse 2]
Don't you run too fast my dear
Why don't you stop?
Just stop and listen to your tears
They're all you've got
(They're all you've got, they're all you've got)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's in you
You see somebody is watching
Over you
And that is all I'm praying is that

[Chorus]
Someday you will understand
In God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh, but maybe
Someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby

[MCU]

[?]

[Bridge]
No moment
Will be more true
Than the moment
I look at you

[Pre-Chorus]
It's in you
You see somebody is watching
Over you
And that is all I'm praying is that

[Chorus]
Someday you will understand
In God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh, but maybe
Someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby

Too much money to see, what's a stripper to me?
Once I tell her we'll leave, she cut him off permanatley
Cause all my jewelry is platnom, I treat all these women so nasty
They say my mouth is so jazzy, said I can't just be a rapper
And all my hoes get along,

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

Keep on runnin'

Keep on runnin' (hold on)
Runnin' (hold on)
Keep on runnin' (hold on)
Runnin' (hold on)
Keep on runnin'

[Verse]
I'm running from, unhappiness
No place to go, but towards the end
Cause I'm not impressed with the messages sent by those claiming they know me
So I just focus on what I control, my breathing
Running til I reach my goal, I see it
Way far in the distance
I know I can get it if I try
No matter what i gotta

[Chorus]
Keep on runnin'
Don't say its over, cause it's never over
Keep on runnin'
If you try to open your eyes and free your mind then you can
Keep on runnin' (hold on)

Keep on runnin' (hold on)
Runnin' (hold on)
Keep on runnin'

Hello
You know, you look even better than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kissed my lips, you know I started to feel wonderful
It's something incredible, there's sex in your chemicals, oh

Ooh, let's go

You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
This world ain't for you, and I know for damn sure this world ain't for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free, oh

Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

I know
I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around they knows that I’m not myself when you're gone
It's good to see you again, good to see you again
On top of the world
Is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright, everything is alright, oh

Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh

Oh-ooh moonshine
Your love, it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

Don't look down, don't you never look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone

Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh

Oh moonshine
Your love, it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner, we're making our fame
Bona fide hustler making my name
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner, we're making our fame
Bona fide hustler making my name

So say it with me, cause this is my life
This is my life, this is my life
This is your life, living life ..
'cause I'm a champion and you a champion
So say it with em cause
This is my life, this is my life
This is your life, living life last time
'cause I'm a champion and you a champion
So say it with me, cause this is my life
This is my life, this is my life
This is your life, living life ..
'cause i'm a champion and you a champion
So say it with em cause
Here, you focus, so I can see your faces
The eyes are wrong, how will I know if it's working right?
Light confuses, the tiny isles of bruises
The mangled lines, I see the signs of aging

But if I try to feel at all I am deceived, my mind's affected
It's empty now as I lay down, I feel alright, my heart is racing

Turn the noise on, I'd like to feed my poison
Assembly lines, carry a velvet warning
To the yard, it's just like striking matches
The Polish lies

But it's working in your blood which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind and not your heart... no, it's working
It's working in your blood which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind and not your heart
It's working in your blood which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind and not your heart
It's working in your blood which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind and not your heart

I didn't know what time it was then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was, how sublime it was too
I didn't know what day it was you held my hand
Warm like the month of may it was and I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young, to be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch, hear your voice
Say I'm all your own

I did not know what year it was, live was no prize
I wanted love and there it was, shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it's now

(instrumental)

Grand to be alive, to be young, to be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, hear your voice, feel your touch
Say I'm all your own

I did not know what year it was, live was no prize
I wanted love and there it was, shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it's now
I didn't know what time it was then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was, how sublime it was too
I didn't know what day it was you held my hand

Warm like the month of may it was and I'll say it was grand
Grand to be alive, to be young, to be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, hear your voice, feel your touch
Say I'm all your own

I didn't know what year it was, live was no prize
I wanted love and there it was, shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it's now

[Verse 1]
Into the streets
We're coming down
We never sleep
Never get tired
Through urban fields
And suburban lights
It's far from home
It's for the better
What we dream, it's all that matters
We're on our way, united

[Chorus]
Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring it back to life?

[Instrumental Break]

[Instrumental Outro]

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)

[Drop: R3hab]

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
Please tell me
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)

[Drop: R3hab]
Chorus
You got the vocab
I got the vocab
You got the vocab
You know I got the vocab
You got the vocab
I got the vocab
Hey, yo pass the mic so I can tell 'em I got the gift o' gab
Monkey see, monkey what? Monkey, monkey be yourself. (x3)
Hey yo catch me when I'm sober, but now I drink for the belt
So pass the root straight to the right hand side
Make no mistake that the buzz is a natural high
I said it's big emergency mind your busy body
He hit me. I broke his nose. The referee's Mr Fuji
So hey to the blue jay, mocking bird don't mock
The last bird who mocked he got caught in my roughneck chicken pot
So Mr Rooster give me a crookedy croo at 6am
He looked at me a laughin' said my music would make F.M
Station. You're Haitian. You'll never get nowhere
But I sweared on my grandmother grave we'd be here
So now when I back track
I back track far enough to make a nigga run and leave his tongue back
You think I'm cool I think you're cruel so here's a shell cap
On your gluteus maximus and leave ya handicapped
Ratatatat
Chorus

Hoboes above leave the boat for the Pope (?) (x3)
Boat people here we go Hi De Hi De Hi De Ho Yeah
Some quest for the truth, some bust a loop
And search for some knowledge that come runnin' in the woods
And if I should a choose to be one
Then I will be a ???? hoodin' with books and look to kill
My proof is in my puddin'
If I chill in the hood would you be say that I'm hoodin'?
Now. Let me exercise a new style that will brutalise
MCs into a warpath genocide
Nobody move, nobody get hurt. It's a homocide
So jump jump punks ready to get stuck
Evil Kenevil was my man, someone for the stunts
I'm mostly fillies, I'm just straight up front, ha
Meat ya tryin' to light up you get blast like nitrogen
Runnin' for mercy, runnin' for oxygen
Bad L.A. meat you're better off comittin' suicide
I shoot the lip so high I strip you of your carbon dioxide
Rock-a-bye the lullaby he be singin' 'Oh my'
Boof Baff another son a go die
What's the matter with the black man? (Black man) (x2)
Now a statistic. So dreams of her become realistic

Poor bastard gets mystic I don't believe you checked the psychic
Emancipate your mind. Don't set the limit. Reach the summit
Free your spirit 'cause your blunted
From the lyrics I just stuttered
'Live off the streets' says the brother with the machete
'Live off the lady' says the brother with the Glock in patrol
I live logically, no weak slave to poverty
You see it's very easy to slip between the asphalt sheet
Brothers from my way they used to get mad plays
Till they caught us bustin' doughnuts 'til the break of day
Brother, my brother, you played me undercover
She wouldn't be your lover so now you tried to dis her
For sister. You missed her but ask yourself a question
Can I make a suggestion? I need a true confession
Is she skivs 'cause the skin that she's in makes you sin?
Does you hit her just to get her integrate another sister?
Mister. I asked him for a hanky. He asked if he could spank me
So why'd you disrespect me, sir?
Were you thinking I'm misguided or were you tryin to hide it
That you had no father figure
Which? Check out your wackness. It won't distrust my blackness
I wonder for a smack, but don't think that it would help this
What's the matter with the black man (Black man)
All original gunman dem original good (Bahahahahahahaha) (x2)
Come jackin' it up an' I bad an' me fell in ma booby trap
With a rappin' up for the eight track play back laid back sit back
An I'll ???? an me runnin' ???? as a matter a fact
'Cause I trappin' a back like a cool six pack now bring it back. Woah!
United we stand, divided we crumble
What's the flavour? More Babylon, more Babylon, more Babylon fall (x2)
These days every man want to be a god
Lay down the gun every man on the floor
But the real gunman him not play Hollywood role
Because he pull out his gun and send another boy down
Watch us bleed. Another gunman go bleed
Watch us bleed. If I used up all my dust I got ????
Watch us bleed. Me up an' comin' ready
Watch us bleed. Watch us for original Tranzlator Crew
Oh, er, every time we come, we come correct, see
We out
Back the hell off
Rock n roll Jesus with all my nails on
All I need is a blunt and a bail bond
And give these blind motherf*ckers something to feel on
Rollin like a motherf*cker put your wheels on
And let's roll down and heal till the heal gone
I started on the block but that something to build on
And how can I pray when I got nothing to kneel on
Hey
The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which crowd I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone
Son look up
Father just shook us
Never was around like bush is
War just came like Kane with bishop
Movies too different to act not used ta
Boys in the hood messed up
No blueprints they just do it
Then they get commercial shootin
Ruthless, live your T.I. or lose it
Stupid people like ya'll once knew 'em
Who da, new nigga is show and prove it
Never skateboard but I grinds in these Supras
Ya'll niggas foolin, for fame and the fortune
Super human, 430 flame horses
Ready to use it, L.A. to Jerusalem
Betty Bootin, my girls fake Hollywood tits
Couldn't fool 'em, I just pull up
And I hold her, yeah, and adjust, to the mood
Jump-Jump out a window
Let's-Let's-Let's jump off a building baby
Let's Jump-Jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby
Jump-Jump out a window
Let's-Let's-Let's jump off a building baby
Let's Jump-Jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby
Hey
The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which crowd I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone
I know a girl named Crystal her last name Paul
I look into her eyes and I can see it all
I see it when she cry, I'm there when she call
Cause I live inside of the mirror on the wall
Kill 'em all, die in the spirit of the war
Thinkin would a mind be in spiritual fall
My lyric will leave you in physical awe
Miserable, pitiful, ridicule, typical
Chemicals swimming through the inner tube
Get in you, that be the end of you
Times are beginnin new
F*ck what you done this about what I'm finna do
Motherf*ck a 9 to 5
I rather do 10 to 2
Motha f*cker pin a guy now I write a pinnacle
The government is saints and it's f*ckin identical
Kiss my ass, and suck my genitals, tabernacle, biatch!
Jump-Jump-Jump out a window
Let's-Let's-Let's jump off a building baby
Let's Jump-Jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby
Hey
The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which crowd I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone
Let's-Let's-Let's jump off a building baby
Let's Jump-Jump out a window-window
Let's jump off a building babyyy

[T-Pain talking]
Damn lil' mama, you thought Akon and T-Pain was the only ones in love wit a stripper?
Forgot to mention Twista, Pimp C, Paul Wall, MJG, Too $hort?
You know we had to remix this

[T-Pain]
She got the body of a goddess, everybody know that
Super-cute face and the booty so fat
I'm in the club dropping twenty-four stacks
Cuz I'm in love and that's a well known fact
Like, yeah she know what she doing
If a nigga chillin' with a stripper then he never go back home
She got eyes butter pecan brown can't leave it alone
Liking the way she break it down to the flo'
Need to get her over here show her where
It's about to go down right now
I'm in love with a stripper

[Twista]
You wanna know where Twista be on fifty
T-Pain invited me to Magic City
I'm about to have some fun 2001, in these pocket all my e-fizzles with me
I like the way mama get up on the table
I like the way she pour the honey in her naval
I like it when she smack her fatty and open it up in front of me
I wanna touch it but I ain't able
The one leg she can shake at the top of the pole
Look at the Laffy Taffy when she pop, she roll
I wanna get her in the bed right after they close
When I do a video you get the popular role
In the V.I.P. they get a lil' lap dance
Come and grind on the willy of a black man
In my ear tellin' me the shit a nigga like to hear
While I nibble on ya nipple like Pac-Man
She freakin' she lickin' she rubbin'
Then she pulled my dick out and start suckin'
All because I be the Twista
Even though T-Pain told me shorty was a freak
I asked her can I take her home (Down right now)

[Chorus - T-Pain]
I'm in love with a stripper
She really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it
I'm in love with a stripper
Gotta get her, I gotta get with her

I'm in love with a stripper
She really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it

Gotta get her, I gotta get with her

[Pimp C]
Uh, young Pimp C

It really ain't bout no square love it's strictly cause she payin' me
She be wantin' lay me but I can't do too much of that
Cuz even though yo ass fat, freakin' off ain't where it's at
But I can show you how to get out there and get it
You love yo daddy I know ya with it
That's why I got love for you
Cuz you get out there and do what it do
Workin' my piece and work the pole
Break the trick you gotta pay to roll
Get the money break 'em off
And we in the Benz and we scratchin' off

[Paul Wall]
It was love at first sight when I seen that ass shakin'
And bout fifty dollars later it was love in our makin'
Ya simply won my heart when I saw the way ya work that pole
And when you bent over ya had my wallet in a choke hold
I saw you in your birthday suit and and baby it was fate
When you give me a lap dance its like we gone on a date
But I feel like ya cheatin' on me when I see ya dancin' with other guys
I'm runnin' low on ones, I can't lie I'm in love baby

I'm in love with a stripper
She really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it
I'm in love with a stripper
Gotta get her, I gotta get with her

I'm in love with a stripper
She really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it
I'm in love with a stripper
Gotta get her, I gotta get with her
I can't stay out this club

[R Kelly]
I must be the first man to eva fall in love wit a ass
Gon' go down on my knees and ask that ass to marry
That booty makes me forget about any chick that I don' freak wit in the past
Plus we got a lot in common she's a stipper - I'm a freak
Make me wanna grab
I gotta have, gotta have
You can call me the man steel 'cause that ass is just like a magnet damn
You got me so in luv - can't stay way from this club
Anytime find myself rolling up on some dubs
I been around the world
See booty all the time
I neva seen a booty so, so pretty, so, so fine
Coming down the pole, no secret why I'm here
Because you keep my dick on swoll
When drop, drop, when it hop, hop and when T.I. pop, pop
The way you doing that thang
Don't you stop, stop?
I wanna stick it, wanna kiss it
If I could I'll put my whole damn head in it
'cause I'm in luv wit a stripper

[Chorus - T-Pain]
She really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it
I'm in love with a stripper
Gotta get her, I gotta get with her
I can't stay out this club
I'm in love with a stripper

[MJG]
I'm in love with a stripper, I need to get some stripper counselin'
Cuz I'm the first one in the front row when they make a stripper announcement
I think I'm fallin' in love with the one with the most ass
Thin, lil' bitty waist, I'ma go and buy that bitch a Volkswagen
MJG, pimp tight, no mo' tippin' stop the bill
If I come in here one mo' night I'm gon' need Dr. Phil
But I'm a G, I'll step back and tell them bitches outright
Ain't no way I can turn a stripper into a housewife

[Too $hort]
The last girl was pretty but she wasn't fine as you
She sexy but she couldn't do the thangs you do
She could dance but nothin' like the way you move
I used to want her until the day I saw you
I'm a grown ass man I thought I seen it all
Doin' all that on the pole and didn't even fall
And right then I knew exactly what it was (What's that)
I wanna fuck the baddest bitch in the club

[Chorus - T-Pain]
I'm in love with a stripper
She really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it
I'm in love with a stripper
Gotta get her, I gotta get with her
I can't stay out this club
I'm in love with a stripper
She really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it
I'm in love with a stripper
Gotta get her, I gotta get with her
I can't stay out this club
I'm in love with a stripper
She really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it
I'm in love with a stripper
Gotta get her, I gotta get with her

[Intro]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Verse 1]
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch
I would know
And you overthink, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Verse 2]
We used to be just like twins, so in sync
The same energy, now's a dead battery
Used to laugh 'bout nothing, now you're plain boring
I should know that you're not gonna change

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Breakdown]
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Verse 1]
You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi
'Cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake I.D
But you lost the motel key
Spare me your freaking dirty looks now
Don't blame me, me

[Chorus]
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

[Verse 2]
Why are these lights so bright?
Oh, did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis
Why am I wearing your class ring?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don’t call your mother
'Cause now we’re partners in crime
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me, me

[Chorus]
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

[Outro]
That’s what you get, baby
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter
Gimme some cash out, baby
Gimme some cash out, baby
Gimme some cash out, baby
Gimme some cash out, baby
Gimme some cash out, baby
Vegas

[Chorus]
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

We drop right back in the cut
The Evil Genius track and Mike's raps
Got you backing this up like, rewind that
We're just rolling with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life living
Not to be forgotten but still unforgiven
But in the meantime there are those
Who want to talk this and that so I suppose
That it gets to a point feelings got to get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt, it's like

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Jay-Z]
Try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
I told you niggas now ten times, stop fuckin' with me
But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
I told you niggas now ten times, stop fuckin' with me
But nobody's listening

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
And everything left's a waste of time
I hate my rhymes but hate everyone else's more
I'm riding on the back of this pressure
Guessing that its better I can't keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me something to ride on
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears
The uphill struggle over years, the fear and
Trash talking and the people it was to
What up to the Militia and the LPU

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Jay-Z]
Try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
I told you niggas now ten times, stop fuckin' with me
But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
I told you niggas now ten times, stop fuckin' with me
But nobody's listening

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
We got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Nobody's listening
Handful of anger held in my chest
Nobody's listening
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat and tears
Nobody's listening
Y'all watch your back, Machine Shop is here

[Outro: Green Lantern, Kanye West, Mike Shinoda]
Fort Minor, We Major
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon
Let's go!
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn’t find
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn’t stop from tearing it down

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We’re building it up
To break it back down
We’re building it up
To burn it down
We can’t wait
To burn it to the ground
You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall I’ll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We’re building it up
To break it back down
We’re building it up
To burn it down
We can’t wait
To burn it to the ground

We can’t wait
To burn it to the ground

We can’t wait
To burn it to the ground

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Well it's the M-I-crooked letter coming around the South
Rolling straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch
Please, ain't nothing but incense in my atmosphere
I'm bending corners in my ‘Lac, boi
‘Cause that's how we be rolling here
Deep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kicking the khakis and Adidas
Packing yo' heaters 'cause you 'sposed to, cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them empty bottles gots to go
See juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning
Now I'm just a player sipping sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumblebee, niggas who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid ‘cause it ain't nothing see

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No, my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid
Jump and you'll get you sprayed
Who raise your blocks? The one and only OutKast
Many a nigga falling fast and I continue blasting, quickly
They ain't gon' get me, got something for 'em
The devil up in yo grill and you still don't even know ‘em
Show ‘em, who's the OK like collard greens and hoecakes
I got soul, that's something that you ain't got
That's why your style is rot-
Ten, stop in the land of ATL
Where nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale, swell
Swollen got my pockets
Business booming like rockets
Folks try to stop it but they know that it's that

[Hook]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We’re gonna get cha high, high

[Verse 3: Andre 3000]
Time to drop these 'bows like Dusty Rhodes
Then I yell ‘ho’
And knock ‘em up off they feet like a Southern hustler ‘posed to do
I's in the house like… a joint is lit for my kinfolks
And all the niggas that was down, since we been broke
Taking ‘em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
Look my crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham
I'm packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong
Word is bond like super glue, it's funky like pooper scoop
And every word I’ll say you can true

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Well okey dokey KastOut
I swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac
The expialalistic Coupe de Ville, can you handle that you rat?
I take my time cruising round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers it's your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge p-u-m-p
You want to do a jack, I heat the barrel ‘til it's empty, get me?
See, I get friendly getting in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the southernplayalistic shit
So copy my slang and bite my shit but don't try gaffling me
‘Cause sleeping you'll get served with some Southern hospitality

[Hook]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We’re gonna get cha high, high

[Verse 5: Big Boi]
Well Southernplayalisticadillac music has been laid
I may wait for all the, be rolling like that today, hoes
So back up off get up on it if you want it ya'll
Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball, yep
So now I step, rather walk with the pimp limp
While my niggas are at East Point
With that College Park, hemp-smoke style
Is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac

[Verse 6: Andre 3000]
Step up in my shoes you crews sitting on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through
Atlanta skies be blue
The sun is beaming, it’s seeming
That I’m glistening, rather gleaming
20/20 got me leaning to the side
Full of pride
Now ain't that something?
I'm dipping into your hood, this ain't braille but I'm bumping
Thumping out the roaches
Dungeon if y'all missed it
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, PA, OutKast
Southernplayalistic

[Hook]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We’re gonna get cha high, high

(Hey, oh, a’ight) (Repeat 4X)

It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We’re gonna get cha high, high
And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side

Powerless
Powerless
Powerless
Powerless
Powerless

And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side

Mama told me
When I was young
Come sit beside me
My only son
And listen closely
To what I say
And if you do this it'll help you some sunny day (Oh yeah)

Oh take your time
Don't live too fast
Troubles will come
And they will pass
Go find a woman
And you'll find love
And don't forget son, there is someone up above

And be a simple kind of man
Oh be somethin' you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh won't you do this for me son, if you can?
Forget your lust
For the rich man's gold
All that you need
Is in your soul
And you can do this
If you try
All that I want for you my son, is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Oh be somethin' you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh won't you do this for me son, if you can? (Oh yes I will)

Boy don't you worry
You'll find yourself
Follow your heart
And nothing else
And you can do this, oh babe, if you try
All that I want for you my son, is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Oh be somethin' you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh won't you do this for me son, if you can?

Baby be a simple, be a simple man
Oh be somethin' you love and understand...
(Ronnie VanZant -- Ed King)

My poor broke mama told me
When I was twelve years old
You eat and talk much too fast
There's one thing you should know
Take your time my sweet baby
Take your time my blue eyed son
Well you may never have his money
But you won't miss no rich man's fun
I can never give you money honey
I can never buy you clothes
But the way them women been lookin' at you
Someday you should have both
If you take your time my sweet baby
Take your time and love them slow
And if you play your cards right
You won't never wait no more

Well the ladies like their diamonds
They like their brand new clothes
But I was blessed with plenty of other things they love the most
I take my time with the ladies
I take my time and I love 'em slow
And since I turned thirteen
Lord, I ain't never wait no more
I can never give you money honey
I can never buy you clothes
But the way them schoolgirls look at you
Someday you should have both
If you take your time my sweet baby
Take your time and be my son
Well you might never have his money
But you won't miss his fun

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

(Won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last
Won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last
Won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last
Won't last, won't last, won't last) Won't last

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you've learned
You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You love the things I say I do
The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you
You take away, when I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you've learned
You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Yo, yo
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

(Won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last
Won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last
Won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last
Won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last)

(Won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last
Won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last
Won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last
Won't last, won't last, won't last) Won't last

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and (Mike Shinoda)]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you've learned
You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned
You like to think you're never wrong (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You want someone to hurt like you (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned
Like shining oil this night is dripping down
Stars are slipping down, glistening
And I'm trying not to think what I'm leaving now
No deceiving now
It's time you let me know
Let me know

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence
I'll be gone
I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow
I'll be gone
I'll be gone

I'll be gone
I'll be gone
I'll be gone

This air between us is getting thinner now
Into winter now, bittersweet
And cross that horizon, this sun is setting down
And you're forgetting now
It's time you let me go
Let me go
When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence
I'll be gone
I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow
I'll be gone
I'll be gone

And tell them I couldn't help myself
And tell them I was alone
Oh, tell me I am the only one
And there's nothing that can stop me (I'll be gone)

I'll be gone
I'll be gone
It goes a one
It goes a one, two, three...

[Verse 1: Mike shinoda]
I was born with the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don’t need to sweat it when the competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I don’t run the track no, I make the track run
My mama taught me words, my dad, he built rockets
I put ’em both together, now tell me what I got, it's
A pretty smart weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it ’cause you clearly can’t stop it
Like that
It ain’t over ’cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn’t matter if you’re wrong or if you’re right
’Cause once you get the teeth in, nothing really fights
Except for me, I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier, I ain’t standing next to you
I’d be laying on the ground before you’re even in my view
Like that

[Chorus: chester bennington]
Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring
The poor men sing
Bring me to kingdom come

[Verse 2: Mike shinoda]
This is something for your people on the block to black out and rock to
Give you whatcha need like Poppa, who shot ya
Separate the weak from the obsolete
You're meek, I creep hard on imposters
And switch styles on a dime, quick witted
Y'all quit tripping, I don’t have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucka, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up
Bang bang, little monkey man playing
With the big guns only get you slain
I ain’t playing, I’m just saying
You ain’t gotta sliver of a chance
I get iller, I deliver while you quiver in your pants
So shake shake down, money here’s the break down
You can play the bank, I’mma play the bank take down
And no mistakes now, I’m coming to getcha
I’m just a Banksy, you’re a Brainwash, get the picture
It’s like that

[bridge: Brad delson]
We swim against the rising waves
And crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings no more
So rest your head, it’s time to sleep
And dream of what’s in store
The body bends until it breaks
Then sings again no more
’Cause time has torn the flesh away
The early morning sings no more
Part I: The One That Got Away

[Verse 1]
Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got awayPart II: Thinking of You

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your
When I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into yourPart III: The One That Got Away / Thinking of You

[Bridge]
'Cause all this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Outro]
The one....
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, thinking of you

[Hook: Janelle Monae & Sleepy Brown]
We spent summer dreaming
When we could be leaving
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
The moon is now my sun and the nights are now my days
Nocturnal creature by habit, Bruce Wayne know what I mean
I mean, I'm in between sunset and sunrise
Since it's on, type of nigga for the home invasion, surprise-prise
Motherfucka, pow-pow, lay the fuck down now
Naw naw, don't try to talk your way out
Because I'm usually non-violent, positively vibin'
But every now and then you got a nigga wanna try you
(Why?) I don't know, I don't even understand it
But it's simply overstood how you really 'posed to handle it
Pardon me one moment, I just went off on a tangent
Ha ha ha ha

[Hook: Janelle Monae & Sleepy Brown]
We spent summer dreaming
When we could be leaving
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up

Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Typical day off in the A, aye
But Nicks own the Chevrolet, aye
Nigga wanna rob, okay, okay
Where he stand is where he lay, aye
Keep looking at me with a gangsta grill
I'm gonna give your ass a gangsta's pill
That's a little piece of lead, taken to the head
That nigga ain't live, that nigga there dead
Taken dirt naps, sleeping with the fishes
Done like dishes, this a wrap like Christmas
Big Boi, you say the word I'll make these niggas dreams a nightmare
I will bust their motherfuckin' head
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

[Hook: Janelle Monae & Sleepy Brown]
We spent summer dreaming

You're ridin', killin', feelin', straight chillin'
Out here wild and don't give a fuck

We roastin', boastin', flowin', straight coastin'
Out here wild and don't give a fuck

Keep spinnin', we grillin', bendin', straight pimpin'
Out here wild and don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
All along the western front
People line up to receive
She's got the current in her hand
To shock you like you won't believe
Sun in the amazon
With the voltage running through his skin
Standing there with nothing on
She's gonna teach me how to swim
Oh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Said, "ooh-ooh, girl...."
Shocked me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel
Said, "ooh, girl...."
Shocked me like an electric eel
Baby girl
And turn me on with your electric feel, oh

[Verse 2]
All along the eastern shore
Put your circuits in the sea
This is what the world is for
Making electricity
'Cause you can feel it in your mind
Oh, you can do it all the time
Plug it in and change the world
'Cause, you are my electric girl-irl-irl

[Chorus]
I've said, "ooh-ooh, girl...."
Shocked me like an electric eel

Show me how to be whole again (Show me how to be whole again)

Fly me up on a silver wing (Fly me up on a silver wing)
Past the black where the sirens sing (Past the black where the sirens sing)
Warm me up in the nova’s glow (Warm me up in the nova’s glow)
And drop me down to the dream below (And drop me down to the dream below)

’Cause I’m only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see

[Verse 1]
I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don’t eat meat
And drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it’s almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

[Chorus]
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like

All of my fellas, can I get a witness?
But, I'm feelin' kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her

Spare me your freaking dirty looks now
Don't blame me

Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis

Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again, and show you that I'm real

(You lied to me) all those times I said that I love you
(You lied to me) yes, I tried, yes, I tried

(Return of the Mack) watch my flow
(You know that I'll be back) here I go
So I'm back up in the game
Running things to keep my swing
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
'Cos what you did, you know, was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done
So, baby, listen carefully
While I sing my come-back song

(You lied to me) but you did, but you do

It's either now or never
Oh I'll never be this fucked up again

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
I ain't leaving this bitch till I'm seeing double
Toothpicked between two chicks with a couple of bubbles
Loose lips sink ships, save us both the trouble
Post pics and leave tweets and it's over for you
Cause what happens here stays here
Or I'll be more than happy to let you leave here
Now stop playing and pass that
Not that, the other brat that you came with
Oh, you peace'd, didn't want me
There's plenty to go around
Why you beasting, homie?
It all started with a sip of Moscato
Then the sip turned into a whole bottle
And that's when broke hoes start looking like fucking models
Even if they say there ain't no Travie in they serato
Then that's some B-I-ULL shit
If that's the case, I'mma find the plug and pull it

[Hook: Tay Dizm]

That’s not love
That’s not love
That’s not love

[Lil Wayne - Verse 1]
Snakes in the grass, so I stay in the pavement
Survived the battle with animals and cavemen
And dead animals and dead men
I’m all in and my only friend is Amen
Keep your mouth cosed, you wanna know why you die
The answer’s right under your nose
Exposed to the street, in the game I don’t cheat
I just play my position, get MVP
I get money, don’t shit come free
It’s my life and I run it even when
Keep my business in my pockets, don’t wash with bleach
And I never show my hand, not even to me
See…

[Hook]

[Fabolous - Verse 2]
Say what’s on your heart if you’re real
Cause the scars you can’t see be the hardest to heal
And I used to chase money, now I have it brought
Cause you can only chase something that you haven’t caught
If there’s a summertime in hell, it’s not as hot
You empty clip niggas ain't got a shot
These diamonds on my neck are an eyesore
Now you decide if their to die for
Advice to my haters, do what I say now
Report to the nearest roof and take the fast way down
Thought it was love, how foolish of us
I do me, she do her, sometimes we do eachother

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne - Verse 3]
Look, as the crooked World revolves
Love spelt backwards is evol (evolve)
And Evil spelt backwards is live or live
And when death comes you better have lives to give
I spit that real talk like knives to ribs
And rats die ugly, die with kids
These niggas is snitching and still living
I hope my words are like razors to the bitches
Niggas pretend like they actually in
But when it go down they fuck around and be them
That blood look familiar when it’s leaking
If you scared, go see a Deacon nigga
That ain't love

[Hook]

[Fabolous - Verse 4]
Life is but a dream
Ain't always what it seems
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream
Raise your glass and lets toast to when we didn't have
Hustle plus muscle equal success, I did the math!
I see these haters in passing, yeah they ’round
I be on the way up, they be on the way down
Now I can sit and talk shit like Skip Bayless
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip payless
Lifestyle A-list, young black and famous
Bunch of bad bitches in an Ipod playlist
Just anothger page in my success story
I make my worst enemies wish the best for me
Bartender!
"Yeah I hear your wise ass, give me a minute."
I'm trying to get this round over here
"What do you think I'm just working for you here?"
Actually, will you... will you send a drink to the lady at the end of the bar? Yeah that one right there
"Here you are miss."
Yeah, yeah. It's on me. Tell her it's from Travee
"It's from this guy over here."

From the second she shimmied in
I was intrigued by her essence
And my first instincts to make sure that my presence was felt
Simple and plain
I'm probably jumping the train
But all I could see was my name engraved on her belt
Hit the pause button
Damn!
I don't even know this girl
And I'm already practicing my sweet-nothin's
But that's a classic trait of a soft-spoken, heart-broken, fellow like my self best believe
Man: Pussy

I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve
But that night the Jagermeister had my sleeves rolled up
Wait a minute, hold up
I think she caught me grillin' now I'm spillin' my drink
I knew our feelings were in sync so now she gave me the wink
The only problem is, I'm not your ordinary, average Romeo
A Cyrano de Bergerac

Man: Shut the fuck up

In fact, I remember back in 5th grade
I tried to read the book of love, but sadly
The introduction didn't grab me
So I left it on the shelf and kept moving
Assuming that this planet rotates
I'll just procrastinate until the day I bump into my soulmate
Who would've thunk I'd be piss ass drunk when time came for collision?
So I made the decision to just keep my composure

Man: Cool. Cool

Until she started getting closer
And then I felt this weird feeling underneath my left shoulder, and then I
Slipped, tripped, busted my lip and fell in love
The minute that she stepped in the door
The type of girl I'd have to make a couple mix tapes for
To me she equaled MC squared and everything else was mathematics
I never took the time to practice

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Young Money, motherfucker
Young Money motherfucker
So swallo slow, bitch
Suck a whole dick
Yes, they call her L, nigga
And now it's time I bring forth to you, what I call my secret weapon

[Verse: Lauren]
Young Money got me over here, the girls flying on the lear
Just to boost my career, pop the bottles, fuck the fear
Funny feeling in my tummy, like I'm on a period
Gotta keep that paper coming, gotta make a million
Gotta fuck a Philly chick, everything is real I spit
Riding in that Mozerati, feelin so elegant
See, I felt that ever since
Weezy got me diamond prints
Told me I'm a star, so it's cool, fuck the shiny shit
Blowin like I'm out of it
And my people proud of it
Fuck whoever doubted me
Money, got it all for me
Steppin out the drop and shit
All this, I profit
No, I ain't a door, so you can stop fuckin knocking
Roll with them real niggas, stunt on them fake niggas
I told Weezy I'm starving, where the plate, nigga
Go get the eights, nigga
Let's celebrate, nigga
Bring the ice cream and the cake, nigga

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Young Money, motherfucker
Young Money motherfucker
So swallo slow, bitch
Suck a whole dick
Yes, they call her L, nigga
And now it's time I bring forth to you, what I call my secret weapon
Pardon my gang affil
But you're stepping on a rod in the danger field
Weezy Baby, how do the Manger feel?
Respect my aim because I aim to kill
Hahaha, Old bitch ass nigga
Abercrombie and Fitch ass nigga
I talk rich shit because I'm a rich ass nigga
I hope you in the zone because I pitch fast nigga
Ha, I smoke something bitch
My money comes faster than the roadrunner bitch
I keep it on the side just in case you might wonder
Tec 9 Four 5 just in case you like numbers
Haha, bitch nigga we might jump ya
2 Step all in yo face, we might Unk ya

Hahaha, bandana on the right side
East side until I die

You better change like it's Mardi Gras
And we pull guns like Quick Draw McGraw
See I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana
And he's from Compton, baby, bandana
We carry them caskets, we tote them hammers
Su to the Woop, yeah, that's our grammar
Lemme hear you say Su Woop
Su Woop, Su Woop
Cut the music up
A lil' louder
Yeah
You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love
When you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
Te fuiste pero nunca me dijiste adios
Me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber amar como amar?
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar como amar?
Te acuerdas de esa noche eramos adolescentes queria darte un beso
Y tu tan inocente me tenias locamente enamorado, me tenias locamente enamorado
Y ya lo ves, lo que fue ya fue te marchaste poco a poco de mi lado y yo sigo locamente enamorado aqui sigo locamente enamorado
Te fuiste pero nunca me dijiste adios me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber amar como amar?
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar
Ooohh, see I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Yeahh
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual
Far from the usual
How to love
You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar como amar?
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar como amar?

Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah

And snap back and battle my own shadow cus ya'll wack and all that

We make a bitch a mule and everybody act a donkey
Yes, I want you to come around here with that plan boy
I'll shoot this mutherfucker til I burn my hand boy
Bust up in the court and shoot the witness on the stand boy
This is my game ask everybody in the stands boy

You get the stampede, I make blood bleed
You suck dick, I succeed
Yeah, yeahhh, and this is how victory tastes
So I'm a spit in ya face
Kevin

[Chorus: ~Kevin Rudolf~]

Turn your I.D. to a tomb

We will take the knives, and we will take the wives
And we won't take the jewelry but we will take the lives

Control, control

You're not, control, show me
Control, control

Control, control
Control

Let me catch my breath
Hope me do your chance
Feel our hearts cut out
From the other sign

Let me catch my breath
Hope me do your chance
Feel our hearts cut out
From the other sign

Control, control
Staring in your eyes
I felt my desire
You can't take control
Of the love we fight

You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me

Staring in your eyes
I felt my desire
You can't take control
Of the love we fight

Let me catch my breath

Control, control
Control, control

All we're fighting by the thought of losing out your beat alone
Won't be the one who has to see without you
By the time I know I want my way I know that you you wanna take me home
Let it happen and you'll be the one to

And you'll take the time to...
No back in time no... nothing else will come between us
With you enough to say no use and tell me what to do
All this...
Control, control
Control, control

You can't take control

[Game - Verse 1]
Throw your muthaf-cking Cincinnati hats in the sky
Nigga don't ask why
Red laces in and out of them Air Max '95?s
I, walk on the moon, flow hotter than June
Any nigga want drama I kick up a sand dune
Peace to my man 'Tune for giving his man room
Now we hittin' switches to the Spring Break, Cancun
Get it, nah forget it, SuWoo I live it
Made the letter B more famous than a Red Sox fitted
But that was suicide, I don't live in Judah's eyes
Half of these rappers weren't trappin' when I was choppin' the do or die
Suge had me in, I went Puffy like Zab Judah eye
Dre called, told my baby momma "won't you decide"
She chose Doc, first day I poured ? like its Aftermath for life
And all I do is ride
Before I turn on 'em I kill Satan and stick my red flag in the ground
It's Red Nation!!!

[Lil Wayne]
Now Blood the fuck up

Lookin' in the mirror, I'm nowhere to be found
Blood, I'm a dog, call me a blood hound
Throwin' blood in the air, leave blood on the ground

[Game - Verse 2]
Niggas'll trade they soul to be Drake or J. Cole

I'm up out the hood, where they pull guns on you like
Come up out ya hood, it ain't never all good
We roll up in backwoods, nigga get to actin' stupid
Get thrown in the back woods
Los Angeles, home of the scandalous
Pimp, hoes and gamblers
98 degree's on Christmas
Nigga we rollin' cannibus
Swisha sweet ain't it, I told her I'm Charles Louboutin
The bitch fainted, pulled her panites down, stain it

That's my Chi-lingo, yeah I'm bi-lingual
Ball by myself, Ochocinco
Dancing with the stars, bullets and fast cars
And everybody bleed out here, word to God

[Lil Wayne]

Throwin' blood in the air, leave blood on the ground

[Game - Verse 3]
Russia got a Red Flag
US got Red Stripes
Last train to Paris, round the World in these red Nikes
Che Guevara of the New Era, test me
Louieville slugger, you'll get buried in my era
Got that natty on, tighter than a magnum
Walk in the club saggin' with a 38 magnum
Red Ralph Laurens, the double R sittin' on a hill like Lauren
Her and the car foreign
Got my red Dre Beats on, tryna put my peeps on
And I keep it hood like this Phantom is a Nissan
Where my nigga Jim Jones at?
Roll up the weed son, so many bloods in Compton had to get a NYC song
And while I'm out here, I might as well go shopping
And put this new bad bitch I got her some red bottoms
And all these hatin' ass niggas want me dead
Cause I'm Malcolm X before he turned Muslim, RED

[Lil Wayne]
Now Blood the fuck up
Everyday's a gamble muthaf-cker, tough luck

Throwin' blood in the air, leave blood on the ground
Weezy Weezy Weezy Weezy Weezy... Weezy F Baby beach bum swagga
Pull up on the beach met a bitch named Sandra
Talk that shit get her to my sand castle
Take her off your 2 piece leave on your sandals
Told her I'm a beast she said Si she speak Spanish
Tan butt naked make the panty line vanish
The sun fell down and burned me on my crown
And now my head smokin like the heat in Miami
South beach killa she feelin me I feel her

She say she got a man but I'm realer, I steal her
Thief on the beach there's freaks on the beach
We do it on the beach and let the water touch our feet
That's s** on the beach whatcha know about it
Girls on girls I build a girl mountain
It's young money yee ain't gotta count it
Girls on girls nigga I'm surrounded
(Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle)

[Chorus]
Same old shit, just a different day
Out here tryna get it, each and every way
Momma need a house
Baby need some shoes
Times are getting hard
Guess what I'mma do

Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard

Closed mouths don't get fed on this boulevard
Big bank in my pocket
Double up with my profit
See this shit than I cop it
Gimme that there and than drop it
Homie, hold up with my mojo
Peep the whip and the logo
24's and they low pro
I bet she fucking, I know so
Nigga ain't no doubt about it
Riding round with that rocket
Load it up and I cock it
Send bout a couple off in your nog
And hear them 808's and they knocking
Whole club and they rocking
Rose in them buckets
All my homies up in here vibing
Nigga big shit in my household
Real niggas I die for
Creeping off in that Tahoe
All about that ?
Nigga don't stop the party
We be getting gnarley
Old kimosabe homie's chiefing cause I'm Marley
This is the same old shit

[Chorus]
I think I'm from Kingston, Jamaica homes
'Cause I got ten jah and ten om's
I don't leave the crib without my chrome
I keep blowing up, like my mobile phone
Them L red bottoms, I designed em homes
I spiked them whole damn shoe for you assholes
I used to stunt my black card for my new broads
Now I just whip the four-door, oh my gosh
The ? Aston, I did that too
Wait til we come with Matt reds and Matt Blues
I'm an empire, you a little boy
Got a Lamborghini, that's my son's toy
Where the flip did I get that paper
Shades on I can't see you haters
Taking off when I see you later
I-I-I hustle paper

[Chorus]
Okay now, all I know is hustle
Get it off the muscle
Block is my attire
Keep them sticks off in that cupboard nigga
I be going hard, bitch I'm going hard
I just hit the mall
You just swipe the card
I'm with a couple latin broads
I just do menage
Fuck you other guys
Pussy telling lies
Homie, free my nigga AG
Fuck you niggas pay me
Swagging in my saline
Two door coupe Mercedes
I am too much for you buster's
Bitches I don't trust em
Fuck em once, I fuck em
Lust em never love em
They won't play me for no sucker, play me for no paper
Make my bitches stomp her
Alpha zeta mega, better no-one really on it
Drive it, bet I own it
Money is involved, bet I know I'm on it
That's wording to my mother
Gotta get it one way or another
I put that on my brother
I'm out here on the come up

[Chorus]
Before I die
I'd like to do something nice
Take my hand
And I'll take you for a ride
You hit me yesterday
Because I made you cry
So before we die
I'd like to do something nice

I want to buy you something
But I don't have any money
No I don't have any money
I want to buy you something
But I don't have any money
No I don't have any money

If I had a car
I would trade in my car
If I had a gun
I would trade in my gun
Honey we ran from the country
When we rushed to the city
And now there's nothing to be done
There's nothing to be done
There's nothing to be done
There's nothing to be done
I want to buy you something
But I don't have any money
No I don't have any money
I want to buy you something
But I don't have any money
No I don't have any money

[Jae Millz]
Black and grey pink stripes suit
Marc Jacobs hard bottoms I'm fly spreading my wings like true
And my date yeah she beautiful too
She went easy on the make-up but the bitch still cute
We ease out the Rolls and proceed forward, ain't a soul I'm passing twice
Feeling like a Graduation with all of these Flashing Lights
You fuckin right a lot of Veuve Clique gon' splash tonight
You damn right a lot of wives gon’ get smashed tonight
Red carpets, cameras, I say: “Millz yikes”
Shit this must be what victory feel like
Got you niggas stuck like still-life’s
Weezy told me: ‘kid we bout to know what makin' history feel like’
Young Money got 'em about to hurl like Garnett
I throw my hands in the air and scream: “Top of da world''
The champs have arrived thanks for the applause
You are far too kind, now pass us our award

[Mack Maine]
Pass me that H20, I'm in the H2
Passing all my old bitches they hollering out I hate you
New bitches that I don't know like, Mack I wanna date you
Walt Disney on Ice, every time I skate through
I got that blue flame flow, its inferno
Chlamydia type of words, they will burn you
Your flesh is what I burn through, I’m son-ing you niggas, I'm paternal
I ain't going' nowhere, like Joe Paterno
I'm still calling shots from the press box
I make you niggas cough up a lung like S. Dot
Put hot sauce on my bullets, now ya flesh hot
Glove over my shooting hand, when I feel the Tecs hot
You niggas on da bench y’all gets no P.T
Because you can't ball hard like B.D., you niggas wanna be me
When you at home you listen to my CD
And roll your eyes every time you see me
I used to bump to B.G., I got a White House that ain’t in D.C
Try Atlanta nigga, me and my brother Toon
We riding round in Phantoms nigga, and Maybachs
With wheels that cost a fortune like Pat Sajak
And we still got that Vanna White
We done made it from Hollygrove to this, nigga this a Fabulous Life
Honeycomb hideout, Young Money beehive
Let me move to the side here comes the best rapper

[Lil Wayne]
And I will not lose
I got them bitches looking at the bottom of my shoes
Call me first place Carter, I live in the lead
I’ma die with the title, and winning is vital
Women is after we get that money right now
My paper chase me it’s on my heels like some white socks
I’ma just go, cause I don’t really like stop
Pull this bitch out and shoot you once in da right spot
Y’all niggas phony, the top is so lonely
I had to tell the Devil you gone have to postpone me
Right now I’m in a race, in a race against time
Cause everybody else is like a race against mom
But momma kind a fast though, momma told me smash though
So I’m about to smash yo motherfucking ass ho
Motherfucking asshole, yeah I know this
But when you get cash out da asshole you got to be on some shit
Future billionaire, yeah I got to be on da list

Young Money, Young Money, swallow that shit bitch
Santa Claus killer with a holiday shit list

I'ma say it again
My office i was a nine to five

But right now i'm in the studio
And everytime I try to say that's what i'm doin'
She just think it's an exuse
And i'm all tryin' to get some new pussy
I tell her i'm a hustler baby
And new money feels better than new pussy
But right now i'm in the studio
And everytime i try to say that's what i'm doin'
She just think it's an exuse
And i'm all tryin' to get some new
Okay, honey i'm home
And yeah i'm top
And if i fall asleep then shawty
I'ma fall asleep in your bed

[Verse 1]
Superstar, where you from? How's it going?
I know you got a clue what you're doing
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby
Look at you, getting more than just a re-up
Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up
Faking like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby

[Chorus]
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are, you-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (womanizer)

[Post-Chorus]
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You say I'm crazy, I got you crazy
You're nothing but a womanizer

[Verse 2]
Daddy-O, you got the swagger of a champion
Too bad for you, you just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many, makes it hard, it could be easy
Who you are, that's just who you are, baby
Lollipop, must mistake me for a sucker
To think that I would be a victim, not another
Say it, play it how you wanna, but no way, I'm never gonna fall for you
Never you, baby

[Chorus]
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are, you-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (womanizer)

[Post-Chorus]
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You got me going, you're oh-so-charming
But I can't do it, you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You say I'm crazy, I got you crazy
You're nothing but a womanizer

[Bridge]
Maybe if we both lived in a different world
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer
It would be all good, and maybe I could be your girl
But I can't 'cause we don't, you...

[Chorus]
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are, you-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (womanizer)

[Post-Chorus]
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You got me going, you're oh-so-charming
But I can't do it, you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You say I'm crazy, I got you crazy
You're nothing but a womanizer

[Outro]
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby

Half-black half-white domino
Gain the money - Op-e-doe
Yo, I'm runnin' through these hoes like Drano

Put your, put your (whoo)
Put your, put your
..your hands up

Put your hands up
Every day I'm shufflin'
Up in the mornin' and out to school
The teacher is teachin' the Golden Rule
American history and practical math
You studyin' hard and hopin' to pass
Workin' your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone
Ring, ring goes the bell
The cook in the lunch room's ready to sell
You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom, open your books
Keep up the teacher don't know how mean she looks
Soon as three o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Close up your books, get out of your seat
Down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and 'round the bend
Right to the juke joint, you go in
Drop the coin right into the slot
You're gotta hear somethin' that's really hot
With the one you love, you're makin' romance
All day long you been wantin' to dance
Feeling the music from head to toe
Round and round and round we go
Hail, hail rock and roll
Deliver me from the days of old
Long live rock and roll
The beat of the drums, loud and bold
Rock, rock, rock and roll
The feelin' is there, body and soul

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out

[Pre-Chorus]
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

[Chorus]
I wanna go all the way, taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind
Whoa, I wanna go all the way, taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind
Whoa

[Verse 2]
Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told just what to do with it
To keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out

[Pre-Chorus]
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

[Chorus]
I wanna go all the way, taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind
Whoa, I wanna go all the way, taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind
Whoa

[Breakdown]
Shame on me (Shame on me)
To need release (To need release)
Uncontrollably (Uncontrollably, -lably, -lably, -lably...)

[Chorus]
I wanna go (I wanna go...)
All the way, taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show (I wanna show...) all the dirt
I got running through my mind
I wanna go all the way, taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind
Whoa

[I've been thinkin' 'bout you]

[The way I feel about you]
I had you on my mind
Way we met it all happened so fast
It was love in your eyes
When we touched there was love, so let's make it last

[Sometimes you can't tell if love is real]
If love is real

[There ain't no doubt about the way I feel]
The way I feel, yeah

[I've been thinkin' 'bout you]
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love

[The way I feel about you]
There just ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love

[I'm in love]

[I'm in love]

I woke up late last night
Visions of you real they seem
Needed you by my side
Now with you in my life I can live in this dream

[Sometimes you can't tell if love is real]
If love is real

[There ain't no doubt about the way I feel]
The way I feel

[I've been thinkin' 'bout you]

And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love

[The way I feel about you]
There just ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love

[I'm in love] I'm in love, yeah...hey...yeah...

[I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love]

[Love, oh...]

[I've been thinkin' 'bout you]

[The way I feel about you]

[I'm in love]

I'm in love, love, love, yeah, yeah, yeah

[I've been thinkin' 'bout you] Baby
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love

[The way I feel about you]
There just ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love

[I'm in love]

I'm in love, ah

[I'm in love]
I'm in love, ooh

[I've been thinkin' 'bout you] Ooh
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love

[The way I feel about you]
Way I feel about you, there ain't no doubt about it

[I'm in love]
No, no, I'm in love
Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out

Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa
Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out

I've been told do what you do with it
We keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa
I'm an Irishman
Leather weathered Irish skin
Beard orange as the sunset over the flag
In the night sky we fly it in
Pride for the life we fight to live
History, I write with it
Spit it with the dialect
And this is a celebration of course
The green, white, orange
And when they pulled up on that shore
First generation born
Toast to those that made it on a boat to New York
And when the English came the colonizer came
They filled up bottles of gasoline, turned 'em into balls of flame
And hurled 'em to protect what's ours
Don't touch these lucky charms
Whole bunch of Irish screaming "Fuck the London Guard"
I'm kidding not dissin' London, it's bloody raw
But go against the Irish and get a bloody jaw
Preaching nonviolence but reminds of the scars
Unify us, put a pint up everybody sing a song
We put our glass to the sky and lift up
And live tonight 'cause you can't take it with ya
So raise a pint for the people that aren't with us
And live tonight 'cause you can't take it with ya

We put our glass to the sky and lift up
And live tonight 'cause you can't take it with ya
So raise a pint for the people that aren't with us
And live tonight 'cause you can't take it with ya

From New England to New Brunswick
Galway to Dublin
A rebellious nation of freckled face hustlers
Heart, blue collared workers and family
My heritage, proud to be a Haggerty
Now with whiskey in our veins
Claiming were the bravest men
I drank Old Crow, but pretended it was Jameson
Dad sipped Guiness, I sipped Old English
'Til he sat me down at 16 and said "boy, this is what a beer is"
I put down the drink, couldn't drink like a gentleman
That doesn't mean I can't make a drinking song for the rest of 'em
Challenge us in football, yeah we might lose
But don't put us next to a bar stool
We take the history, script it in song
Light the torch then you pass it on
That's right I said, lineage through the rhythm we script it from the palm
And we give til' Ireland is on
Bottoms Up
We put our glass to the sky and lift up
And live tonight 'cause you can't take it with ya
So raise a pint for the people that aren't with us
And live tonight 'cause you can't take it with ya

We put our glass to the sky and lift up
And live tonight 'cause you can't take it with ya
So raise a pint for the people that aren't with us
And live tonight 'cause you can't take it with ya

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna marry the night, I won’t give up on my life
I'm a warrior queen, live passionately tonight
I'm gonna marry the dark, gonna make love to the stark
I'm a soldier to my own emptiness, I'm a winner
I'm gonna marry the night, I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night, I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night, I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night

[Drop]

Ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-night
Ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni

[Chorus 1]
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

[Post-Chorus]
Ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna lace up my boots, throw on some leather and cruise
Down the streets that I love, in my fishnet gloves, I'm a sinner
Then I'll go down to the bar, but I won't cry anymore
I'll hold my whiskey up high, kiss the bartender twice, I'm a loser
I'm gonna marry the night, I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night, I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night, I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night, the night
The night, the night
The night (Night, night, night)
(Ni-ni-ni-ni-ni)

Lady luck shows my love me
Oh, when she blessed me with your loving charms
I've found my place in the sun
With heaven right here in your arms
I feel so lucky, so lucky baby
Oh, lucky to be loved by you
And I wanna thank you, thank you baby
For all the little loving things you do
I got to tell the world about it
I've got to stand right up and shout it
Hey, look at lucky me
Ooh baby, ooh baby
I don't mind stormy weather
The rain no longer makes me blue
And I don't care when my friends all get together
And leave me out of everything they do
It's alright if the sun don't shine
It's impossible to darken my day
Makes no difference if I don't have a dime
I'll be wealthy anyway
Mmm, I'm no good without you
But listen baby, as long as I got you
Hey, look at lucky me, hey, ooh baby
In my life, there's no misfortune
No struggle or strife today
You're my lucky charm, my guiding star
So just smile and chase them blues away
I can't help it baby, you're so wonderful
Oh, how lucky can a-one man be
Oh, your tenderness and sweet caress
And it all belongs to me
I wanna tell the world about it
I wanna stand right up and shout it
Hey, look at lucky me

The world is spinning too fast
I'm buying lead Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I've tried to lose
My mama said to slow down
You must make your own shoes
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood

[Bridge: 2-D]

There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapor trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between his brain and his tail
And if time's elimination
Then we got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message
It's the music that we choose

It's complicated
It always is
That’s just the way it goes
Feels like I've waited so long for this
I wonder if it shows

Head underwater
Now I can't breathe
It never felt so good
'Cause I can feel it coming over me
I wouldn’t stop it if I could

When love takes over, yeah
You know you can’t deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something’s here tonight

Give me a reason
I gotta know
Do you feel it too?
Can't you see me here on overload
And this time I blame you
Looking out for you to hold my hand
It feels like I could fall
Now love me right like I know you can
We could lose it all

When love takes over, yeah
You know you can’t deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something’s here tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

And I'll be loving you all the time, it's true
'Cause I wanna make it right with you

When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over

When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over
Over, over, over, over, over
Over, over, over, over, over

(feat. Pharrell)

[Intro:]
Uh, what up ya'll
Soundtrack what's poppin' baby
Ya'll ain't know
I go by the name of
Lupe Fiasco
Representin' that 1st & 15
Yea
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grindin' (ya know what I'm saying)
Legally and Illegally
Ha
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
So, check it out

[Verse 1:]
First got it when he was six
Didn't know any tricks
Matter fact
First time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip and bust his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp
Like this
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit it was something in the air
Yea
He said it was somethin' so appealing
He couldn't fight the feelin'
Somethin' about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it
Couldn't understand it
Brand it, since his first kickflip he landed
Uh
Labeled a misfit, abandoned
Ca-kunk, ca-kunk, kunk
His neighbors couldn't stand it, so
He was banished to the park
Started in the morning wouldn't stop till after dark
Yea
When he said it's getting late in here
So "I'm sorry young man there's no skating here"

[Chorus:]
So we Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast
And the way he roll just a rebel to the world with no place to go
So we Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast
So come and skate with me, just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's Kick, and Push, and Coast

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Push down with the right, lift up with the left
Push down with both feet man, now land that shit fresh
We used to ride around just doin' that
With some used Airwalks and Billabong on my back
Happily because my mom couldn't afford it
When it came to Black validity, I guess they felt shorted
Identity crisis, they scrunched they facial
How we both black and our kid is biracial?
Okay, let me simplify the story yo
I was black but white in the middle like an Oreo
I skateboarded past all the shit I coulda been
I know my dead homies wish they was much gooder then
I mean gooder then, not cuz I'm better than
See, Airs got hooder man, blood got wetter than
I was just tryna bring it home and set a trend
But they would just yawn like it's Late Night for Letterman
I'm tryna tell 'em, it ain't no chance it's a fad
But they look at my Sadplant like a plant that was sad
These niggas count more grants than my dad
From all the cocaine in the grams of a bag
Skateboard P stand for skateboard past
All the bullshit that the devil's plans had
It grew up happy man, that plant wasn't sad
So I put it in Vanity Fair and the Zoo York ad
And I cooked it up to a crystalized dream
Take a puff, don't that taste like ice cream?
My record come out, the store calls your girl
Hate it or love it, I warthog the world
Yezzur...
So he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push
Coast, and the way he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
So he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push
Coast, so come and skate with me
Just a rebel, looking for a place to be
So let's kick, and push, and coast

[Chorus:]
So they Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast
And the way they roll just lovers in the twine with no place to go
So they Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast
So come and skate with me, just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's Kick, (uh uh) and Push, (yea yea) and Coast

[Verse 3:]
Yea uh, yea, yea
Before he knew he had a crew
That weren't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB Dunks
They would Push, till they couldn't skate no more
Office building, Lobbies weren't safe no more
And it wasn't like they weren't getting chased no more
Just the freedom is better than breathing they said (they said)
And they escape route, they used to escape out
When things got crazy they needed to break out (they'd head)
To any place with stairs, any good grinds the world was theirs, uh
And they four wheels would take them there
Till the cops came and said "There's no skating here"

[Chorus:]
So they Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast
And the way they roll just a rebels without a cause with no place to go
So they Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast
So come roll with me, just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's Kick, (uh uh) and Push, (yea yea) and Coast

Nothing seems to be the way
That it used to
Everything seems shallow
God give me truth
In me
And tell me somebody is watching
Over me
And that is all I'm praying is that

Someday I will understand
In God's whole plan
And what he's done to me
Oh, but maybe
Someday I will breathe
And I'll finally see
I'll see it all in my baby

Don't you run too fast my dear
Why don't you stop?
Just stop and listen to your tears

You see somebody is watching
Over you
And that is all I'm praying is that

[Chorus]
Someday you will understand
In God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh, but maybe
Someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see
You'll see it all in your baby

No moment
Will be more true

I look at you

[Pre-Chorus]
It's in you
You see somebody is watching
Over you
And that is all I'm praying is that

Someday you will understand
In God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh, but maybe
Someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see
You'll see it all in your baby
Someday you will understand
In God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh, but maybe
Someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see

First round pick she a bad bitch, a bad bitch
Lookin at me lookin at her, damn she a draft pick
Elaborate, photographic, gots to have it
My Georgia dick'll have her happy, drizzy getting married
Riding through, zone six Atlanta in a carriage
White house, with white girls and they dancing nasty
Redbones two redbones and they tatted
Plug talking Spanish like Scarface and Manny
Ten birds ten whole thangs in the pantry
Just hit , just right she forgot the panties

Ferrari with the yellow forgiatos, Gucci trippin
I hit the button in my Scaglietti and get missing
Girlfriend missing, now you feel me?
458 paper tag it get missing, it get missing, it get missing
I hit the thrax pass it back, girl lets get missing
I got a Robin jean saggin', and I ain't even braggin'
I gave the bitch five hundred, fuck it I ain't even cryin'
Now I'm gettin' older rocking Gucci, Louis 'loafers
I still remember the first day that I ain't had to serve swoll
You brought sand to the beach, I brought toast to the source
I did ya girlfriend a autograph, Gucci Mane pose
It ain't no muthafuckin' secret, hell yeah I got shooters
I'm the plug to the plug, I'ma goddamn boost
You ain't no muthafuckin' gangsta, you's a goddamn moofer
And you gettin' in the way cause your homegirl choosin'
On my birthday Gucci want a brand new uzi
On my worst day I'm worth ten mill no jewlery

[Hook]
Killa's waitin' in the bushes just to tie ya ass up
Gave my young nigga a gun and told 'em to fire yo ass up
Seems like everywhere you go somebody try ya ass up
I got real money nigga, I can buy my own luck
Headshots 

[2x]
All my young niggas aiming headshots
Headshots 

[2x]
Put a dub on yo head
Headshots 

[2x]

[Rick Ross Verse:]
Yo son call you a dead beat
Stepped on my feet, nigga you dead meat
I'm grinding up this ground beef
I think they just wanna surround me
Self made with a brick too
Nigga shoes dirty but the stick new
Hittin' 12th grade with a big crew
Now I'm well paid I can flip you
Holding on my dick, Michael Corleone bitch
Headshot like Fredo, fuck nigga don't flintch
The empire back, the empire back
I got some whip out in foltin, my brick just keep boucin' back

[Hook]
Killa's waitin' in the bushes just to tie ya ass up
Gave my young nigga a gun and told 'em to fire yo ass up
Seems like everywhere you go somebody try ya ass up
I got real money nigga, I can buy my own luck

[Gucci Mane: Verse 2]
Nigga's got killed at my show last weekend
But how am I to blame when they were already beefin'
When they first started shootin' man, we were just leavin'
Try bricksquad and we won't let you get up that easy
Gucci Mane the C.E.O, I feel like eazy
The rap game love me but the dope game need me
Baby said she never seen a nigga so freezin'
These Vivi S diamond's make me feel like major
I had a pistol in the club first day I met Weezy
AR in the car the first day I met Jeezy
When I first started dissin nigga said it just teasin'
Glock 40 on my hip it was just me and mac breezy

[Hook]
Killa's waitin' in the bushes just to tie ya ass up
Gave my young nigga a gun and told 'em to fire yo ass up
Seems like everywhere you go somebody try ya ass up
I got real money nigga, I can buy my own luck
Headshots 

[2x]
All my young niggas aiming headshots
Headshots

Put a dub on yo head
Headshots

[Chorus]:
Swawty I'm flexin
In da court room burnin dro
Give a f*ck about dis judge
Wat you think my money for?
Shaawty I'm flexin
Ocean front view
And my job is
Like my weed like my girl like my car
Shawty I'm flexin
White ring red watch yellow chain tacky
I'm flexin not matchin
Shawty we flexin
Black and white dogs
Zebra skins
Sittin on them elephant
Took your girl

Flocka:
Boww

Threw a hunded grand
At my shows
Shawty I got gwapa
If she role with waka flame
Then you kno that girl gone swang
Holla at her as tomarrow
She gone come she gone bang
But a nigga ain't gone answer
In da club make it rain
Shawty where tha f*ckin desert
Blue and white grape pain
Lokkin like Barry Sanders
So icy flex game
Shawty we da new atlanta
We da new atlanta
We flexin yup!
We ridin yup!
We iced up and we ain't matchin
They might snatch em
They might grab em
His name waka flocka flex
I gotta have em
JuiceMan:
Ay, ay, ay
Flex diamonds round my neck
Young juice man
And dese diamonds I'm gone flex
Red chain blue chain
Call my shi* so icy chain!
32 e.n.t and I made me a stupid chain
Houses by da lake
Diamonds like a snake
Young juice man
And he super duper straight
And brick squad dogg
You should buy his tape
And Oj da juice, gucci, waka flocka straight
Gucci:
I be Hulk Hogan flexin
Macho man flexin
Juice mane, gucci mane, flocka flame flexin
Frenchie caught another boy
So gucci bought a necklece
I bought me a rolls royce
And parked it on da chest man
Frenchie:
In the right direction
Ain't no need for stretchin
I'll teach you a lesson
I just wanna ball
Take your broad to the West Inn
Have her jigglin balls
I got her with no questions
I go outfitter (?)
Flexin like a bodybuilder
I get every color b*tch
(?) got her mountain climbin
Diamonds water surfin
You scream out cowabunga
These stones filled wih clouds
And mines light up like a thunder
Frenchie
Gucci:
Robbin, bribin, trappin and finess
Diamond bricks, diamond bells
Fake pill flexin
Lex luther flexin
Schwartzenegger flexin
Rock game in the (?)
Im flexin like a Mexican
My pocket all swoll', my rims all chrome
When I hit the club everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don't really care

'Cause I ride on 'em, plus, I style on 'em
Yes, I lean on 'em, yes, I flash on 'em
Yeah, I know, that's the way you like it, huh?
Yeah, that's the way you love me, hon'

It's alive, it's alive, rounds cured the eyes
I had to bring the bitch back like Frankenstein
I push weight but Gucci don't exercise
I get extra whipped cream for them eskimo pies

I'm in the 'hood like the mayor 'round election time
Here's a suggestion: don't park your car next to mine
I'mma start when the light hit, I 'posed to shine
Your flow is garbage, they let me out just in time

They got a section but none of the ho's are fine
They need to exit, don't let the grind pass you by
I run laps 'round lames with my shoes untied
I jump the line, walk in, and watch the crowd divide
Still stuck outside, that's the ugly side
Looked Medusa in the eye and Medusa died
This is top secret shit, classified
Don't blame me, Swizz was the mastermind

I can't breathe, can't breathe, Toni Braxton time
I got a chain moonwalkin', Michael Jackson time
I keep on buying ice like I lost my mind
This bloodline of mine is supposed to shine

My pocket all swoll', my rims all chrome
When I hit the club everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don't really care

'Cause I ride on 'em, plus, I style on 'em
Yes, I lean on 'em, yes, I flash on 'em
Yeah, I know, that's the way you like it, huh?
Yeah, that's the way you love me, hon'

Hurry up, hurry up Gucci on the news
They say he walked out the jail rockin' stupid jewels
They tryin' to find out what it do, admit it, you confused
Too much cash on me, hundreds fallin' out my trous'

My yellow wrist, bright as piss, bitch, on the shit
Big Gucci called Swizz, let's make a hit
Two thing in this world I ain't ever seen
Are you a foreigner, nigga? I need to help me get mimi
I hope you suffocate, me told her, baby, let me breathe
'Cause I don't chase nothin' but paper, bitch, you're chasin' me
Excuse my French, but this is Gucci, I'm so fucking gutter
It don't make no sense to switch for any of these motherfuckers

My pocket all swoll', my rims all chrome
When I hit the club everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don't really care

'Cause I ride on 'em, plus, I style on 'em
Yes, I lean on 'em, yes, I flash on 'em
Yeah, I know, that's the way you like it, huh?
Yeah, that's the way you love me, hon'

Somebody said my life is it
I said nah dog, my wife is it
Now I'm back, back on 'em like I never, never left
Plus the boy right here, I'm fresh to death

Woo, Christians on my feet
See, I can't fall for Suzuki jeeps
Now I'm jumpin' off decks
Don't worry about the haters, they gonna be upset

And the Black Card in my back pocket
The Conaseg lookin' like a speeder rocket
Yeah, I'm zoomin' on the highway
And you should love me, I did it my way
My pocket all swoll', my rims all chrome
When I hit the club everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don't really care

'Cause I ride on 'em, plus, I style on 'em
Yes, I lean on 'em, yes, I flash on 'em
Yeah, I know, that's the way you like it, huh?
Yeah, that's the way you love me, hon'

Hey lil' pinky, thumbin' up "Good"

That body language, I understand it, want us to be on, this Good
You keep on dropin' it, I'll keep you up
Guilty, my wallet baby, I got Ups
How you get down, It's like a Flo Party, doin' this all over like Tevo
I get around, I know you're down, so what are you Virgo or Vegro?
Feelin' your flames, I know you're a fire, I can't get rid of this ego
Screen shorty, you done made me a believer, I'm so addicted to you when I see you, girl

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
(Hey, Hey)
No wastin' my time, she gotta be Zoosk
Walkin' it, talkin' it, know she the truth
All the way down with a freak attitude
Whether you're loose when she walk in the room
Swingin' them hips like you ain't got a groove
Hell of a giver, she sweet as perfume
Fully equipped with that body in tune
Lil' mama is drippin', she hotter than June
I gotta have her no way can I rest
Make her my diva, want only the best
Babies no teaser, I look to impress
Good ladies they help me get rid of my stress
No time for clothes, no bottom the dress
Only one goal, that's showin' her flesh
Shorty's the fly'est chick in the nest
She gotta be Zooskin', nothin' less

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I got the girl that I need, but you're the girl that I want
I want the girl that do everything, but I got the girl that don't
So I can get you, you, and you girl, (ahhh)
Cause you're on Zoosk girl (Aahhh)
And I can have ya screamin' (ohhhhhh!)
So I can get you, you, and you girl, (ohhhhhh!)
Cause you're a Zoosk, Zoosk, Zoosk girl

Because I give in to my lady anyway she want it
Licky up and licky down, now let's, let's get it started

Ha ha ha
Ha ha ha

Now that im finally free
Im 'bout to do it again
I take my life with my hands
Cause im a grown ass man (im a grown ass man)
Now that im finally free

I was lost but now im found
I was blind but now i see
Super high can't touch the ground
Life tested me, but god blessed me
Ever since jayvon's testimony
From a jail house, jumped in a Testarrosa
Had to find myself, then remind myself
Fucked up; im grown, i gotta blame myself
Streets taught me everything; i trained myself
Did wrong so long, didn't know nothin' else
Then while i grew up like ---
Think every man's worth is in himself
Glad as well, but im mad as hell
Because my bestfriend probably gonna die in jail
No lie to tell
Probably cry like hell
Like my 2yearold, cause he got eighty years
Im goin hard, you see, i might as well
Cause i got a hard head like my daddy had
And my daddy dad
And my great great great great grandpa had a real crazy swag
So i stand today
Then get down and pray
That the second is now and my mind is made
I got a point to prove
And ima sign a raise
Can't make the same mistakes that my daddy made
Finally free
You'll never take me away
Took everything i had
For me to follow again
Now that im finally free
Im about to do it again
I take my life with my hands
Cause im a grown ass man
Now that im finally free

Squash the beef, im free of that
This crazy song, i ain't feelin that
I guess they wanna see us kill each other
When im dead, who the fuck gon' help my mother?

I struggled and hustled too hard for this
I had to rob, steal, kill; i ain't proud of that
Smoke weed to appeal, so proud of Pat
Im show you to understand, where the cowards at?
Man my homeboy gone, where the flowers at?
All the money in the world can't bring that back
If i had one wish, wish my momma dear could come down now and see me rap
But she see me now, and i believe in that
Off the strength of that, i ain't going back
So i put my whole family on my back
Got so much time, i can't pay that back
I was lost but now im found
I was blind but now i see
Super high can't touch the ground
Life tested me but God blessed me
Ever since jayvon's testimony
From a jail house, jumped in a Testarrosa
Had to find my self, then remind myself
Fucked up; im grown, i gotta blame myself
Finally free
You'll never take me away
Took everything i had
For me to follow again
Now that im finally free
Im about to do it again
I take my life with my hands
Cause im a grown ass man
Now that im finally free

I was lost but now im found
Thought that you couldn't keep me down
Single life, go round and round
I said i straightened up my ass
And i ain't never going back

Now that im finally free (finally free)
You'll never take me away (you'll never take me away)
Took everything i had (everything that i had)
For me to follow again (for me to follow again)
Now that im finally free (ohhhh finally free)
Im about to do it again (do it all again)
I take my life with my hands (i take my life with my hands)
Cause im a grown ass man (im a grown ass man)
Now that im finally free
Im a grown ass man
Baby I've made a mistake here and there
I wasn't always right
That don't mean, that don't mean
You gotta treat me wrong
Pass it on!

I climbed a lot of mountains baby
A lot of mountains fell down on me
That don't mean, that don't mean
I ain't as weak like I used to be
Pass it on, pass it on
Jesus Christ, I might as well be dead
I can't see how dangerous
It must feel to me
Training human cogs for the machine
Without some shell-shocked lunatic like me
Bombarding their still soft shells
With sticks and stones
That were lying around
In the pile of unspeakable feelings I'd found
When I turned back the stone
Turned over the stone
Of my own disappointment back home
It ain't no comparison and Im not bein arrogant
My jewelery game got u starin but ur jewelery games embarrassin
Still got that nasal flow
I think i need some claratin
Keep that white girl on me
Kim kardashian

Rap game mastered it
Ur g card i cancelled it
Flow hotter than

I'm me

Goddamn
I am
I can
Sing and
Hear me
Know me

[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away

[Verse 2]
Oh no
It go
It gone
Bye-Bye
Who I
I think
I sink
And I die

[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away (As I walk away!)
Watch me unravel I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, I've come undone

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away (As I walk away!)
Watch me unravel I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, I've come undone

[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away (As I walk away!)
Watch me unravel I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, I've come undone

[Outro]
I don't want to destroy your tank-top
Let's be friends and just walk away
Hate to see you lyin' there in your Superman skivvies
Lying on the floor, I've come undone
Duet with kiki dee written by stevie wonder and ivy hunter
Released as a uk single in 1981

I remember yet before we met
That every night and day
I had to live the life of a lonely woman

I remember meeting you
Discovering love can be so true
When it's shared by two instead of one

When you said you love me (when you said you love me)
We could not be parted (we could not be parted)
And i built my world around you (i built my world around you)
I'm so thankful that i found you

And loving you is sweeter than ever
(i ain't never felt like this before)
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever, sweeter than ever

Each night i pray we'd never part
For the love within my heart grows stronger
From day to day
As best i can, and how i try
To reassure and satisfy
'cause i'd be lost if you went away

'cause i really need you (really really need you)
And i need for you to need me too
(if you don't go breaking my heart)
I have built my world around you
(i have built my world around you)
Baby i'm so thankful that i've found you

And loving you has made my life sweeter than ever before
(i ain't never felt like this before)
And loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
So much sweeter

That's what loving you (loving you)

'cause i really love (really really love you)
And i'm thankful that you love me too
(thankful that you love me too)
I have built my world around you
(i have built my world around you)
I am truly glad, i am truly glad
That loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
(you don't know how much this means to me)
When i'm loving you
Me, you, us
Sweeter than ever (tell me about it)
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
(you don't know how much this means to me)
I'm loving you, you made my life sweeter than ever
(you're sweeter than ever baby)
Sweeter than ever (sweeter than ever)
So much sweeter (sweeter than ever)

Loving you
Loving you is sweeter than ever...
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the meaning to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
Well, it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Everywhere you are
Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Any, any, anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
I gotta, gotta be where you are
I wanna be, I wanna be, I
Yeah, yeah, baby now
I wanna be, I wanna be, I
I wanna be, I wanna be, I
Na, na, yeah, yeah
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh I
I wanna be, I wanna be, I
Na, na, baby
I wanna be, I wanna be, I
Big Snoop Dogg
Can you be my doctor? Can you fix me up?
Can you wipe me down
So I can make you give it up, give it up
Make you say my name like a Jersey, Jersey
Shuttin' down the game
Be my head coach so you can
And never take me down 'til you can taste the win
Do it again and again till you say my name
And by the way I'm so glad
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat, sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat, sweat, sweat
Can you, can you get me up like I'm late for my first class
So I can give it to you rough like a first draft
Hold you like a paper plane, you know I got paper, babe
Them dollar bills, girl, make it rain
Holiday Inn, come and meet me on my eighth floor
Damn it feels good but I feel bad for the next door
And I, and I, I, I apologize
But when I slip, slip like two girls into slip n' slide
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat, sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat, sweat, sweat
Where you goin'? Whatcha say?
I'm why her river flowin' to another lake
By to ocean, by the ocean, on the beach, on the beach
Let me dip my feet in and make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat, sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat, sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I'm coming round and now my vision is so clear
If I could change my state of mind, then I would disappear
The love I get from you is something I can't chance
And I could let you slip away, without a second glance

Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaaah, Woaaaah!
Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaaah, Woaaaah!

This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory x2

This is like a flashback
Flashback
This is like a flashback
Flashback

Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaaah, Woaaaah!
Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaaah, Woaaaah!
This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory x2
There's no hold
The moving has come through
The danger passing you
Turns its face into the heat and runs the tunnels
It's so cold
The dark dug up by dogs
The stiches torn and broke
The raw meat fist you choke
Has hit the bloodlite

Glass traps open and close on nite flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to fall

Glass traps open and close on nite flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to call

On nite flights
Only one way to fall

Making a toast to the king, MJ for life
I mess with good women
But you know that they bad, let's ride

Your butt is mine

And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nowhin'

The world is out

Gonna lock you up
Before too long
Your lyin' eyes
Gonna tell you right
So listen up
Don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap
You're now a man
You're throwin' stones
To hide your hands

[Pre-Chorus]
We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Then won't you slap my face

[Chorus]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone

You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it

And ain't nothing changed, Luchando
Except not a sun and a moon know me by my first name, Armando
De santo no tengo nada
Y de diablo lo tengo todo, ay de todo

Hazme el favor y prestame el mojo
I'm so out of this planet
I speak a third language
Called that moon talk
In four years catch me with a billon (Hee-Hee)
Doing that moonwalk

[Chorus]
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shamone
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know it - you know it - you know
You know - you know - shamone
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you
You know I'm smooth - I'm bad - you know it
You know I'm bad - I'm bad baby
You know, you know, you know it - shamone
And the whole world has to answer right now
Woo!
Who's bad
Who's bad
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know I'm bad - you know
Woo!
You know I'm bad - you know it
You know
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad
On this rock pile, with my ball and chain
They call me by a number not a name Lord, Lord

Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
With an achin' heart, on that gal of mine

You can here my hammer, you can hear my saw
Gonna sing it like John Henry all day long Lord, Lord

Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
With an achin' heart, on that gal of mine

When that old judge looked down at me
Said I put you in that penetentiary Lord, Lord

Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
With an achin' heart, on that gal of mine

Well now it won't be long, just a few more days
They'll let me out of here I'm gonna stay Lord, Lord
With that gal of mine, with that gal of mine
She's a waited for me while I've done my time
Uh uh oh ahhhhhhh radio killa
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love

You said you changed, but still nothing
You're still the same, I'm just a part time lover

And I'm the blame, should've went away
But yet I stayed, with a part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out on the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

I left the state, changed everything
No more 818, for the part time lover

What goes around, comes back around
And then you get what you deserve
You part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out
On the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

Watch these red bottoms, and the back of my jeans
Watch me go, bye baby
Don't know what you got until it's gone

Tail Lights is all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit that driveway

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)

Watch me walk it out
Walk it out, walk it out
Walk this right up out the house
Walk it out watch me walk it out
Walk it out walk this right up out the house
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)

[Intro: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Baby, I love you (I love you too)
You know I need you
Gotta have you (What?)
Can't be without you (J.Lo)

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
It's like downtown New York in the middle of traffic jams
All I really want you to know is who I am
You can find me low-key in the back of the club
Or with some fine females, rollin' on dubs
You and me big pimpin' on a shopping spree in L.A
Paparazzi's and critics, who give a damn what they say?

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Boy, I never knew I could feel the way I felt when I met you
I could never forget you
And boy, when you look my way (Oh, damn)
I realize more and more I adore your pretty eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
But what I wanna know from you is do you wanna share my love's bliss?
I long for the day when I'm feeling your kiss (I need you)
Can you love me for a lifetime for just in one night?
I'm helpless for you, baby, but it's alright (Just one night)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Baby, I love you (Love you)
Baby, I need you (Need you)
I gotta have you (I gotta have you, babe)
Can't be without you (Be without you)
Baby, I love you (Yeah)
Baby, I need you (Need you)
I gotta have you (I gotta have you, babe)
Can't be without you

[Interlude: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Papi, I got something to say to you (Woo)

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Blessed and cursed on the day that I felt the power of you  (Woo, woo)
Inside me, it was strong and I loved it (I did, mama, did)
And there comes a time in our lives when things change (It's a brand new day)
And baby, I'll spend it with you

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
What I wanna know from you is do you wanna share my love's bliss?
I long for the day when I'm feeling your kiss (I love ya)
Can you love me for a lifetime but just in one night
I'm helpless for you, baby, but it's alright  (Woo)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Oh, baby, I love you (Baby, I need you)
Baby, I need you (Gotta have you, baby)
I gotta have you (Can't be without you)
Can't be without you (Baby, I love you)
Baby, I love you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby, I need you (I gotta have you)
I gotta have you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't be without you

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Baby I love you (I love you too)
You know I need you (Woo, J.Lo)
Gotta have you (Pied piper, what? What?)
Can't be without you (Uh, J.Lo)

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
It's like downtown New York in the middle of traffic jams
All I really want you to know is who I am
You can find me low-key in the back of the club
Or with some fine females, rollin' on dubs
You and me big pimpin' on a shopping spree in L.A
Paparazzi's and critics, who give a damn what they say?
In the rear, drop-top Bentley on somebody's highway
Who let it jumpin' in some club on this valet?
Got a little smoke, got a little drinks sittin' in V.I.P
Got a little buzz with my hands up, honeys feeling me
Got that Cris' sittin' on ice like a gansta lean
Hands surrounding them like dice like security
After party in the Ritz Carlton, penthouse suite
All my thugs and me, breath smelling like Hennessey
Got a few friends flying in from San Diego
It's a surprise party for my homie J.Lo

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I need you (Baby, I love you)
I gotta have you, baby (Baby, I need you)
Baby, I love you (I gotta have you)
Ooh, oh, I swear I do (Can't be without you)
This a big love, babe (Baby, I love you)

[Outro: Jennifer Lopez]
Ooh (Baby, I need you)
Ladies (I gotta have you)
Do you know what I'm talking about? (Can't be without you)
Oh, woah, when a man gets inside your soul (Baby, I love you)
And it takes hold, and it won't let go (Baby, I need you)
(I gotta have you)
Hey, hey
(Can't be without you)
Hey, hey, hey
(Baby, I love you)
(Baby, I need you)
Opening doors like an answer key, I make the life answer to me, no fantasy
An evil genius, I leave my mark of the beast on the beat
Actually, I'm all like a natural disaster, I make you a casuality
Added up, mathematically, putting numbers up, like 23
And I'm Manning up like Payton be, game is over, I should take a knee
And bow out gracefully, even if you look me in my eyes
See you wouldn't be facing me
So what the fuck is pain to me?
And what the hell is rain to me?
My life is very impressionable, like a Van Gogh painting be
Told me Vincent inside the dimension, that's my mantra
Listen there is no competition, the mission's conquered
Did I mention? These girls at my concert, addicted, no double entendre
Which is why I'm colder than a tundra on Christmas, put your hands up, can I get a witness?
While I kill the dark side's where I live
Horny devils and a red dress and high heels
You don't have an idea how many niggas done took my ideas
I take flight, I'm so bright, I don't even get no light bia
You road kill while I'm driving
I'm high fiving, my dime riding, My time shining
From at the club and I'm outta town but I'm lying around it
Deuce chains I'm fung shway, everyday is my birthday
2 gats at the park, you don't wanna see these guns play
Patron and lemon lime, I got her back, all in her spine
I look my wife up in the eyes, and I think about a another dime
My atmosphere is fractured here this right here is bally gear and I keep on killing shit
And I don't even have no tatted tear
You can put the motherfucker caddie here
You can put the motherfucker beemer there
Still got 2 more garage places, louies on I unlaced it
Every verse I'm going crazy, every girl it's going crazy
2 guns, 2 chains, 2 rings, 2 bracelets
Maria, hey, hey, Maria
Maria, don't you hear me calling, Maria?
Maria, girl, you know you were the only one
Hey, hey, Maria
Maria, don't you miss me a little?
Maria, after all you were the only one
Come on back to me, Maria
Maria, come on back to me, girl
Hey, hey, Maria
Maria, it's been long, so long
Maria, since you've been gone
Hey, hey, Maria
Maria, don't you need me just a little?
Maria, 'cause honest girl you were the only one
Maria, come on back to me, Maria
Oh, come on back to me, girl
Oh, Maria
Oh, baby, I need you
Maria, oh yeah
Maria, why, why do you keep a running away?
Ooh, baby, you keep a running away
Ooh, baby
Maria, I need you, honey
Oh Maria, you sweet little sunflower
Oh, hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me, Maria
Ooh, yeah, yeah
If you're on that lonely night
What's my life without you, girl
I'm so lonely, I'm so blue
Without you darling my life is through
Come on back
Maria
Ooh, baby, I need ya
When I believed in nothing I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint in some place I called her name
And though my days were slipping by
And nights so cruel I thought I'd die
She danced her little dance 'till it made me cry
She was shakin' like this honey doing that

When I needed soul revival I called your name
When I was falling to pieces I screamed in pain

Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real swept over me
You danced your little dance 'till it made me cry
You were shakin' like this honey doing that

Never let me down
She never let me down
Never let me down
She never let me down

When all your faith is failing Call my name
When you've got nothing coming Call my name
I'll be strong for all it takes
I'll cover your head till the bad stuff breaks
I'll dance my little dance till it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that

Never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
Oh no

Respect! Every time

[Outro]
"É falta de opção, né? Infelizmente a gente veio parar no tráfico, não tem estudo não tem nada. Família não tem boas condições, aí a única oportunidade..."
I picture you in the sun wondering what went wrong
And falling down on your knees asking for sympathy
And being caught in between all you wish for and all you seen
And trying to find anything you can feel that you can believe in

May god's love be with you
Always
May god's love be with you

I know I would apologize if I could see in your eyes
'Cause when you showed me myself I became someone else
But I was caught in between all you wish for and all you need
I picture you fast asleep
A nightmare comes
You can't keep awake

May god's love be with you
Always, always
May god's love be with you

'Cause if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find, if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find you
You
I found you... You...
I don't know anymore
What it's for
I'm not even sure
If there's anyone who is in the sun
Will you help me to understand

'Cause I been caught in between all you wish for and all you need
Maybe you're not even sure what it's for
Any more than me...

May god's love be with you
Always
May god's love be with you
Always, Always
May god's love be with you

'Cause if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find, if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find, if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find you...
You
I found you... You
Oh, I found you... You
Oh, I found you...
This house party is crazy, my crew is hela wavy
Yo, flip the cut, then say what's up, then slide out with your lady
No ifs or buts about it, my style is technotronic
Got grips and models so spin the bottle, girl I'm just getting started
Get up, get up, get up
Pump the volume, feel the bass
Get up, get up, get up
Turn me on and let me do my thang
Get up, get up, get up
We in the house and we here to stay
Get up, get up, get up!
Put your hands up, put your put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
We be raging round the clock, feel that bass around the block
Fill that red cup to the top, birthday shots
Doesn't matter, who you are, look around, we in the stars
Round the world, we party all
We go all night strong until we drop
Get up, get up, get up
Pump the volume, feel the bass
Get up, get up, get up
Turn me on and let me do my thang
Get up, get up, get up
We in the house and we here to stay
Get up, get up, get up!
It's party time
2 Chainz!
Motivation, fornication
Beat it up, altercation
On the low, bass my flow
They say money talk, we hear my conversation
Oh, yo bout it baby
Got the love, I got 100 patient
I'm so real, real estate
I play hide and seek on 100 acres
Every day I smoke 100 papers
ESPN, Lakers fan
I'm not P Diddy but I can damn sure make a band
Oh, shake that ass, shake that ass, bands make her dance
Takin shots then break the glass
I'm like come on, come on, come on let's get it
She like hold on, hold on, hold on, I'm with it
I'm like damn girl you bad
You the baddest in the city
Always laugh until the bang

This house is bumping, get the friction on
We ain't going home, even when the lights come on
This house is bumping, bass still go strong
Get up!
See the great white scar
Over Battery park
Then a flare glides over
But I won't look at that scar

Oh, my nuclear baby
Oh, my idiot trance
All my idiot questions
Let's face the music and dance

Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you

All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now

(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) A new killer star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) The stars in your eyes
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
See my life in a comic
Like the way they did the bible
With the bubbles and action
The little details in color

First a horseback bomber
Just a small thin chance
Like seeing Jesus on dateline
Let's face the music and dance

Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you

All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now

(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) A new killer star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) The stars in your eyes
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way)
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way)
(I got a better way) Ready set go
Ooo oo oooo
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way)
Hayley Williams
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

B.o.B
Yeah
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion

And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at that phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back

But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel
And they sayin' "What would you wish for?"
If you had one chance
So airplane, airplane
Sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Hayley Williams
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

B.o.B
Yeah, yeah
Somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank

Yeah back when I was tryin' to get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessing that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Then maybe yo maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur, what's up Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Hayley Williams
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

B.o.B
I could really use a wish right now
I-I-I could really use a wish right now
Like, like, like shooting stars
I-I-I could really use a wish right now
A wish, a wish right now, right now
Senor, senor, do you know where we're headin'?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Seems like I been down this way before
Is there any truth in that, senor?
Senor, senor, do you know where she is hidin'?
How long are we gonna be ridin'?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Will there be any comfort there, senor?
There's a wicked wind still blowin' on that upper deck
There's an iron cross still hanging down from around her neck
There's a marchin' band still playin' in that vacant lot
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not"
Senor, senor, I can see that painted wagon
I can smell the tail of the dragon
Can't stand the suspense anymore
Can you tell me who to contact here, senor?
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Was that train load of fools bogged down in a magnetic field
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring
Said,"Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing"
Senor, senor, you know their hearts is as hard as leather
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor
I'm ready when you are, senor
Senor, senor, let's disconnect these cables
Overturn these tables
This place don't make sense to me no more
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, senor?
(Shut up x4)
Ayyy, girl, what's your name?
My name? Glad I came
Your frame is so insane
Got me numb like Novocain
Damn girl, you're a freak

You wanna cut them, where's your girls
Got a king size at the crib

You know what's happenin'
So why you hummin' in my ear with all this chattin'?
'Cause I'm not here to talk
I get down and let my fingers walk
So shut your lip and take a sip before this needle drop
You wanna cut them - where's your girl?
Got a king size at the crib
Introduce you to my world

[Intro]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and forget her, too"
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best
With a, "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess he's an Xbox and I'm more Atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair

[Pre-Chorus]
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
Oh shit, she's a gold digger
(Well) Just thought you should know, nigga
Ooh, I've got some news for you
Yeah, go run and tell your little boyfriend

[Chorus]
I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and forget her, too"
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best
With a, "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
Now I know that I had to borrow, hah
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Tryin' to keep ya, tryin' to please ya
'Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
Oh shit, she's a gold digger
(Well) Just thought you should know, nigga
Ooh, I've got some news for you
Ooh, I really hate yo' ass right now

[Chorus]
I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and forget her, too"
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best
With a, "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Bridge]
Now baby, baby, baby
Why you wanna, wanna hurt me so bad?
(So bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my momma, but she told me
"This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Yes, she did, and I'm like
Uh! Why? Uh! Why?
Uh! Why, lady?!
Oh! I love you
Oh! I still love you, oh

[Chorus]
I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
"Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and forget her, too"
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best
With a, "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Outro]
Lady
Oh
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah nigga, I'm still fuckin' with ya
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D R E, '99 Nigga
(Guess who's back)
Still, still doing that shit, Andre?
Oh for sho', check me out, it's still Dre Day nigga, A.K. nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say, â€½Dre, fell offâ€
How nigga? My last album was 'The Chronic'
(Nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it
If you ain't up on thangs
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police
(Uh, huh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
(Fo' sho)
Still got love for the streets, repping 213
(Fo' life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still)
Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D R E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still)
Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D R E
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
It's 'Turn Out the Lights' from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D R E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still)
Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D R E
It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world, still
(Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back
So if you ain't up on thangs
Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeque's every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still)
Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D R E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still)
Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D R E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still)
Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D R E
Right back up in ya motherfucking ass '95 plus four pennies
Add that shit up, D R E right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some with your dog, no stress, no seeds
No stems, no sticks, some of that real sticky icky, icky
Ooh wee, put it in the air, oh you's a fool D.R
Speechless

Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence I am lost for words
Words like, like, "I love you"

Human Nature

[Verse 1]
Looking out
Across the night time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out
Into the night time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Chorus]
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way

[Verse 2]
Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

[Chorus]
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Why, why does he do me that way
I like livin' this way
Up in the mornin', out on a job
Work like the devil for my pay
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
A fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Good Lord up above, can't you hear me cryin'
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with your silvery linin'
Lift lead to paradise
Oh, show me that river, take me across
Wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun gave me nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Like that lucky old sun gave me nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
I remember yet before we met
That every night and day
I had to live the life of a lonely woman
I remember meeting you
Discovering love can be so true
When it's shared by two instead of one
When you said you love me (when you said you love me)
We could not be parted (we could not be parted)
And I built my world around you (I built my world around you)
I'm so thankful that I found you
And loving you is sweeter than ever
(I ain't never felt like this before)
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever, sweeter than ever
Each night I pray we'd never part
For the love within my heart grows stronger
From day to day
As best I can, and how I try
To reassure and satisfy
'Cause I'd be lost if you went away
'Cause I really need you (really really need you)
And I need for you to need me too
(If you don't go breaking my heart)
I have built my world around you
(I have built my world around you)
Baby I'm so thankful that I've found you
And loving you has made my life sweeter than ever before
(I ain't never felt like this before)
And loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
So much sweeter
That's what loving you (loving you)
'Cause I really love (really really love you)
And I'm thankful that you love me too
(Thankful that you love me too)
I have built my world around you
(I have built my world around you)
I am truly glad, I am truly glad
That loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
(You don't know how much this means to me)
When I'm loving you
Me, you, us
Sweeter than ever (tell me about it)
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
(You don't know how much this means to me)
I'm loving you, you made my life sweeter than ever
(You're sweeter than ever baby)
Sweeter than ever (sweeter than ever)
So much sweeter (sweeter than ever)
Loving you
Loving you is sweeter than ever...
A wanna be gangster
Thinkin' he's a wise guy
Rob another bank
He's a sock 'em in the eye guy
Tank head
Mr Bonnie and Clyde guy
Look him in the eye
He's not my kinda guy
Never wanna be
Confusion proof
Pudding's sweet
But too aloof
Orange eye girl
With blackslide Dew said
Yo homie
Who you talkin' to
A backed up paddywagon
Mackin' on a cat's ass
One upper cut
To the cold upper middle class
Born to storm
On boredom's face
And a little lust
To the funky ass Flea bass
Most in the race
Just loose their grace
The blackest hole
In all of space
Crooked as a hooker
Now suck my thumb
Anybody wanna come get some
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go (oh woh woh)
Don't ask me why
I'm flying so high
Mr Bubble meets superfly
In my third eye
Searching for a soul bride
She's my freakette
Soak it up inside
Deeper than a secret
Much more
Than meets the eye
To the funk
I fall into my new ride
My hand my hand
My hand my hand
Magic on the one
Is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few
Taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face
Like a stage on Vaudeville
I feel so good
Can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum
Rockin' my red hood
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go (oh woh woh)

Hey porter! Hey porter!
Would you tell me the time?
How much longer will it be till we cross
That Mason Dixon Line?
At daylight would ya tell that engineer
To slow it down?
Or better still, just stop the train
Cause I wanna look around

Hey porter! Hey porter!
What time did ya say?
How much longer will it be till I can
See the light of day?
When we hit Dixie will you tell that engineer
To ring his bell?
And ask everybody that ain't asleep
To stand right up and yell

Hey porter! Hey porter!
It's getting light outside
This old train is puffin' smoke
And I have to strain my eyes
But ask that engineer if he will
Blow his whistle please
Cause I smell frost on cotton leaves
And I feel that Southern breeze
Hey porter! Hey porter!
Please get my bags for me
I need nobody to tell me now
That we're in Tennessee
Go tell that engineer to make that
Lonesome whistle scream
We're not so far from home
So take it easy on the steam

Hey porter! Hey porter!
Please open up the door
When they stop the train I'm gonna get off first
Cause I can't wait no more
Tell that engineer I said thanks alot
And I didn't mind the fare
I'm gonna set my feet on Southern soil
And breathe that Southern air
Tired of seeing some play thing
Acting like a toy
Tired of watching some fool
Trying to be your boy
And I don't like to be the one
Seeing you in tears
Standing in the shadows
Staring out at love again
But I'll be the one
I'm the one reminding you
That you've got a choice
I'm the one to let you know
That I hear your voice
Time and again
I catch you smiling from within
But standing empty hearted
Standing in the wings again
I'll be the one.......
Oh Oh I'll be the one
I'm the one reminding you
That you've got a choice
I'm the one to let you know
That I hear your voice
Time and again
I catch you smiling from within
Standing empty hearted
Standing in the wings again
I'll be the one
I can't be the one to catch you
Every time you fall
I ain't the one to answer
Every time you call
But babe I'm gonna to be the one
The one to see you through it all
Oh Oh I'll be the one
I'll be the one to get you home
When all the rest have gone away
Oooh hoo hoo I'll be the one.......
Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walk alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence
"Fools" said I,"You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you."
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the signs said, 'The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence

[Intro]
You know I love music
And every time I hear something hot
It makes me wanna move
It makes me wanna have fun
But it's something about this joint right here
This joint right here
Its makes me wanna.... Woo!

[Verse 1]
Let it go...
Can't let this thing called love get away from you
Feel free right now, go do what you want to do
Can't let nobody take it away, from you, from me, from we
No time for moping around, are you kidding?
And no time for negative vibes, cause I'm winning
It's been a long week, I put in my hardest
Gonna live my life, feels so good to get it right

[Chorus]
So I like what I see when I'm looking at me
When I'm walking past the mirror
Don't stress through the night, at a time in my life
Ain't worried about if you feel it
Got my head on straight, I got my vibe right
I ain't gonna let you kill it
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just...

[Post-Chorus]
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just fine

[Verse 2]
Feels so good
When you're doing all the things that you want to do
Get the best out of life, treat yourself to something new
Keep your head up high
In yourself, believe in you, believe in me
Having a really good time, I'm not complaining
And I'm a still wear a smile if it's raining
I got to enjoy myself regardless
I appreciate life, I'm so glad that it's fine

[Chorus]
So I like what I see when I'm looking at me
When I'm walking past the mirror
Ain't worried about you and what you gonna do
I'm a lady so I must stay classy
Got to keep it hot, keep it together
If I want to get better
See I wouldn't change my life, my life's just...

[Post-Chorus]
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
See I won't change my life, my life's just fine

[Bridge]
I ain't gon' let nothing get in my way
(I ain't gone let nobody bring me down, no, no, no)
No matter what nobody has to say (No way, no way, no way)
I ain't gon' let nothing get in my way
No matter what nobody has to say
Feels so good, when you're doing all the things that you want to do
Get the best out of life, treat yourself to something new
It's a really good thing to say
That I won't change my life, my life's just...

[Post-Chorus]
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
See I won't change my life, my life's just fine

[Chorus]
So I like what I see when I'm looking at me
When I'm walking past the mirror
Don't stress through the night, at a time in my life
Ain't worried about if you feel it
Got my head on straight, I got my vibe right
I ain't gonna let you kill it
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just...

[Outro]
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just fine
Down in Utah
The guys and I dig a city called Salt Lake

And the number one radio station
Makes the town really swing yeah
Salt Lake City we'll be coming soon
There's a park near the city, yeah
All the kids dig the Lagoon now

They got the sun in the summer
And winter time the skiing is great yeah
Salt Lake City we'll be coming soon
Salt Lake City we'll be coming soon
We'll be coming soon
We'll be coming soon
We'll be coming soon

[Lupe Fiasco:]

Alarm clock said i'm too late
And they said i'm too weak I could use a few weights
So they said I took too long and don't look too strong
Well how long would you take?
Waiting's got me here in the first place
Another second, i've been second maybe third in the worst case
Now it's displayed in my wordplays
Moving weight, it's such a trap
Move and wait, you can't do that
I know i'm dope man but I can't move crack
And it's such a fracture when you're thinking 'bout your plans

But I try and bring it back before your brain hit the pan
Sean from Detroit, Lupe from Chicago land
But both of our chains say made in Japan
German engineers designed both of the Sedans
Ride with Mr. right on time, or stay Miss. another chance
Now, redirected at the girls, not an ultimatum just an option in this world
When things come and go, when the clocks never stop
Be on time for nothing, a little late for a lot
I can hear so much in your sighs
And I can see so much in your eyes
There are words we both could say
But don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
Come close, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, take my hand and let me hear your heart beat
Being here with you feels so right
We could live forever tonight lets not think about tomorrow
And don't talk put your head on my shoulder
Come close, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, take my hand and listen to my heart beat
Listen, listen, listen
Don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
Don't talk, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
Don't talk, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
No matter how long it takes
No mater how long
No matter how long it takes
Well never be alone
Don't wanna make a wrong headline
No matter how strong
They'll be watching every move you make
Don't let em know they can beat you

Fortune favor the brave
Learn how to use that muscle
Take a little chance will get you
Everything you see
Living at the speed of light
Gotta make your heart beat faster
You gotta climb inside
Set that spirit free

Fight the good fight
Fingers to the bone
Gotta take a stand
And save this land of liberty
Stumble on the ground that shakes you
Push it to the point that breaks you
Little bit of fire it gives you
Soul of a winner
Help you bring them to their knees
In the face of the foe
Never let em drag you under
Don't you wanna leave behind ya
A legacy
Catch another streak of lightning
By the God of fire and thunder
Battle in the name of the nation
Making history

Fight the good fight
Fingers to the bone
Gotta take a stand
And save this land of liberty
And brother when you're down to zero
Everybody needs that hero
Gotta be a star to follow
All the way there
And all the way home
Lena's been burning both ends of her candle
She's over her head in complication and scandal
But Lena takes her troubles in stride
As she runs to the bottle
To confess and confide
Lena surrenders

Lena has taken to flaunting her passions
Offers herself in the boldest of fashion
But Lena says it's under control
As she looks to the bottle
To calm and console
Lena surrenders

Lena
Surely you don't believe
By hiding in bottles you'll never relieve
All the pain love has brought you
The fire and the cold
Lena
Take heart
Take heart
Lena
Surely you don't believe
By hiding in bottles you'll never relieve
All the pain love has brought you
The fire and the cold
Lena
Take heart
Take heart
Take heart
Take heart
Lena!
Lena!
Take heart
Lena!

Now you don't wanna be the little woman
No you don't want to be the little woman
I love. No, no, no, no. I love
Now you don't wanna stay in my school
You don't wanna be the one that's cool
You don't wanna be the little woman I love

[Intro]
(Turn the lights on)
(Turn the lights on)
(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 2]
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
Either way I don't wanna...
(Turn the lights on)

[Bridge]
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto we livin'

These streets remind me of quicksand
When your on it you'll keep goin' down
And there's no one to hold on too
And there's no one to pull you out you keep on fallin'
And no one can here you callin'
So you end up self destructing

On the corner with the tuli on the waist line
Just got outta the bing doin' state time
Teeth marks on my back from the K9
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine
'Cause they said that I wouldn't make it I remember like yesterday
Holdin' on to what God gave me

'Cause that's the life when your
Living in the
(Ghetto)
And eating in the
(Ghetto)
Or sleeping in the
(Ghetto, ghetto)
That's the life when your
Living in the
(Ghetto)
And eating in the
(Ghetto)
Or sleeping in the
(Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)
No need to cherish luxuries 'cause everythin' come and go
Even the life that you have is borrowed
'Cause your not promised tomorrow
So live your life as if everyday's goin' be your last
Once you move forward can't go back
Best prepare to remove your past

'Cause ya gotta be willin' to pray
Yes there gotta be there gotta be a better way
Yes ya gotta be willing to pray
'Cause there gotta be there gotta be a better day
Whoever said that the struggle would stop today
A lot of niggas dead or locked away
Teenage women growin' up with AID's

'Cause that's the life when your
Living in the
(Ghetto)
And eatin' in the
(Ghetto)
Or sleepin' in the
(Ghetto, ghetto)
That's the life when your
Livin' in the
(Ghetto)
And eatin' in the
(Ghetto)

I see people come and go, see people fall in & outta love
As my mother told me she said don't let life control me, but I did
So what you think of me, what you think of me now and who I am?
I'm everything you wanted me to be, as you can see I'm very happy

I need sometime to find myself in me

And I need sometime to find true love
But if I can't then I won't stop trying
If I don't then I won't live lying
What do people really want?
They wanna be happy...
I wanna be happy
Lonely I am Mr. Lonely
I have nobody
For my owwnnn
I'm so Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody
For my owwnnn

Ahora se lo que mi nena sufria
Y oye duele saber que tu que perder
Para aprender en el futuro saber mantener
Una relacion que me lleno de querer

If you ever cross that line
I guarantee you there'll be nothin' to save ya
I got a whole bunch of gorillas
Ready to pull the trigga
And we all for that paper
Comin' from a life of crime
Tryna be on my best behavior
You see my rep's gettin' bigger
But still that same ***
Bustin' shots at them haters
But only if you cross that line
I was birthed in the ***
But what made it worse, every first is a packed house
Little brother knowin' life illegal
No toys, just playin' wit pipes and needles
I'm gon' find knights and regals
5000 on the paint just so life will see ya
Green cards for the free lunch
Now his green cards scream larger than seats crush
Big *** for the other side
Try me I'ma teach his momma homicide
I wanna see his momma eyes
I done cried 20 years now I'm runnin' dry
If you ever cross that line
I guarantee you there'll be nothin' to save ya
I got a whole bunch of gorillas
Ready to pull the trigga
And we all for that paper
Comin' from a life of crime
Tryna be on my best behavior

But still that same ***
Bustin' shots at them haters
But only if you cross that line
Don't cross that line
Hopin' that you don't cross that line
Don't cross that line
Baby, don't cross that line
When I'm low on funds, I'ma load up
Slap ya in the head I'ma open one
African in bed, she just hope I'm done
See the voodoo priest, then the *** gon' come
Open up a drum, I'm eatin' Oprah crumbs
Got poor credit, got *** debit
Walk in the 40-40, I'ma score, bet it
Four tennis chains ***, I'm progetic
But the 4 pellets will getcha prosthetics
If you don't get it, just don't let it
A life sentence is a light sentence
All my homies got 'em, they just like business
If you ever cross that line
I guarantee you there'll be nothin' to save ya
I got a whole bunch of gorillas
Ready to pull the trigga
And we all for that paper
Comin' from a life of crime
Tryna be on my best behavior

But only if you cross that line
Don't cross that line
Hopin' that you don't cross that line
Don't cross that line
Baby, don't cross that line
Don't push me, I ain't ***
You 'Would be killas', that is 'Could be'
The last minute of your last breath
I'm the last entrance right before your last step
Shot a *** papa, my block gotta
Cross the line, pay the fine, cop dollar
No matter you're age, creed or color
Can't cut it, stay choppin' through the butter
Critics wonder will I last long
Even though I showed my *** on my last song
I gets my mash on, no mask on
Cross Ross, baby, it'll be a sad song
If you ever cross that line
I guarantee you there'll be nothin' to save ya
I got a whole bunch of gorillas
Ready to pull the trigga
And we all for that paper
Comin' from a life of crime
Tryna be on my best behavior
You see my rep's gettin' bigger
But still that same ***
Bustin' shots at them haters
But only if you cross that line
Don't cross that line
Hopin' that you don't cross that line
Don't cross that line
Baby, don't cross that line

[Verse 1]
You build me up
You knock me down
Provoke a smile
And make me frown
You are the queen of run-around
You know it's true

[Verse 2]
You chew me up
And spit me out
Enjoy the taste
I leave in your mouth
You look at me
I look at you
Neither of us know what to do

[Chorus]
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin

[Verse 3]
Immobilized by the thought of you
Paralyzed by the sight of you
Hypnotized by the words you say
Not true, but I believe them anyway

[Verse 4]
So come to bed, it's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel your heart begin to race

[Chorus]
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

[Refrain]
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do (Life gets hard)
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)

[Chorus]
(That may) That may be all I need (All I need)
In darkness, she is all I see (All I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Verse 2]
Fingers trace your every outline (Yeah, yeah)
Paint a picture with my hands (Oh, whoa)
Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

[Chorus]
That may be all I need (all I need)
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave (Yeah)

[Refrain]
Oh yeah
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do (Life gets hard)
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

[Chorus]
And you may not know
That may be all I need (all I need)
In darkness, she is all I see (You are all I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow, ooh, yeah, yeah...

[Outro]
It's a flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair
Ooh, yeah, yeah...

[Verse 1]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Bridge]
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
(And she will be loved)
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
(And she will be loved)
And her heart is breaking in front of me

[Verse 1]
If I be so inclined to climb up beside you
Would you tell me that the time just isn't right?
And if I should ever find the key you hide so well
Will you tell me that I can spend the night?

[Chorus 1]
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
Yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
If I could bottle up the chills that you give me
I would keep them in a jar next to my bed
And If I should ever draw a picture of a woman
It is you that would come flowing from my pen

[Chorus 1]
Leaving the clothes on the floor
Making me walk out the door (Walking)
And I still fail to understand what it is about this woman

[Verse 3]
Helplessly melting as I stand next to the sun
As she burns me, I am screaming out for more
Drink every drop of liquid heat that I've become
Pop me open, spill me out onto the floor

[Chorus 1]
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand, fail to understand
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman

David-David-David-David-David-David
David Banner, nigga

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I didn't hear what you were sayin'
I live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions, never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to say we
Never would have made it, babe?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could have given love, now I’m taking love
And it’s not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don’t say a word

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't think so

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I find you sleeping soundly
And your lovers screaming loudly
Hear a sound and hit the ground

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could have given love, now I’m taking love
And it’s not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now so don’t say a word

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't feel so bad

[Verse 3: David Banner]
I couldn't disrespect the crib, you brought a man where I live
Now my pistol pointed tryin' to leave led in his ribs
What's in something that I did, what's it time I did the spin
When I think about him, I think time you crack a rib
Call a preacher at the corner it all when wrong
David Banner, Maroon 5
This is bigger then the song, dawg
Yeah! Uh!

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
No, he won't come around here, I don't feel so bad

[Outro: Adam Levine]
I don’t feel so bad (Wake up call)
I don’t feel so bad (Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)
I don’t feel so bad (Don’t you care about me anymore?)
Don’t you care about me? I don’t feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so

[Verse 1]
Wake up, blood-shot eye
Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back

[Pre-Chorus]
I still don't have a reason (Reason)
And you don't have the time (Time)
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you and I

[Chorus]
So this is goodbye
Is this the end of you and I?
So this is goodbye
Is this the end of you and I?
So this is goodbye

[Verse 2]
Can't stop my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I've left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you and I

[Chorus]
So this is goodbye
Is this the end of you and I?
So this is goodbye
Lying to my lovers eyes
So this is goodbye

[Bridge]
I've been here before
One day I'll wake up and it won't hurt anymore (Ho-oh-oh-oh)
You caught me in a lie (Ho-oh)
I have no alibi (Ho-oh)
The words you say don't have a meaning  (Ho-oh-oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so this is goodbye

[Chorus]
Is this the end of you and I?
So this is goodbye
Lying to my lovers eyes
So this is goodbye

[Breakdown]
Oh-oh-oh

Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh, say goodbye

[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Danced all night, slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games
You don’t cry, you don’t care
Afraid to have a love affair
Is that your ghost or are you really there?

[Chorus]
Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I’m stuck living out that night again
I’m not falling apart

[Verse 3]
I heard you say you needed me now
What’s the problem I can’t see
You destroyed me, I won’t fall apart again
I’m not falling apart
Take what you wanted
I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night

[Verse 1]
Danced all night, slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games
You don’t cry, you don’t care
Afraid to have a love affair
Is that your ghost or are you really there?

[Drop]

[Chorus]
Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I’m stuck living out that night again
I’m not falling apart

[Verse 3]
I heard you say you needed me now
What’s the problem I can’t see
You destroyed me, I won’t fall apart again
I’m not falling apart
Take what you wanted
I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night
Waiting and falling
Constantly calling out your name
Will it ever change?

[Chorus]
Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I’m stuck living out that night again
I’m not falling apart

[Verse 3]
I heard you say you needed me now
What’s the problem? I can’t see
You destroyed me, I won’t fall apart again
I’m not falling apart, ooh

[Verse 1]
I never knew perfection till
I heard you speak, and now it kills me
Just to hear you say the simple things
Now waking up is hard to do
And sleeping is impossible too
Everything is reminding me of you
What can I do?

[Chorus]
It’s not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we’re better off this way?
I’m not fine, I’m in pain
It’s harder everyday
Maybe we’re better off this way?
It’s better that we break

[Verse 2]
A fool to let you slip away
I chase you just to hear you say
You’re scared and that you think that I’m insane
The city looks so nice from here
Pity I can’t see it clearly
While you’re standing there, it disappears
It disappears

[Chorus]
It’s not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we’re better off this way?
I’m not fine, I’m in pain
It’s harder everyday
Maybe we’re better off this way?
It’s better that we break

[Verse 3]
Saw you sitting all alone
You’re fragile and you’re cold, but that’s all right
Life these days is getting rough
They’ve knocked you down and beat you up
But it’s just a rollercoaster anyway, yeah

[Chorus]
It’s not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we’re better off this way?
I’m not fine, I’m in pain
It’s harder everyday
Maybe we’re better off this way?
I’m not fine, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we’re better off this way?
I’m not fine, I’m in pain
It’s harder everyday
Maybe we’re better off this way?
It’s better that we break, baby

[Verse 1]
You left me hanging from the thread
We once swung from together
I lick my wounds
But I can never see them getting better
Something's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same

[Verse 2]
You make me think of someone wonderful
But I can't place her
I wake up every morning
Wishing one more time to face her
Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged
Oh

[Chorus]
I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out alright, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
So much to love, so much to learn
But I won't be there to teach you, oh
I know I can't be close
But I'll try my best to reach you

[Chorus]
I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Disorted Voice]

[Verse 1]
I’m sick of picking the pieces
And second-guessing
My reasons why you don’t trust me
Why must we do this to one another?
We are just passionate lovers
With trouble under the covers
Nothing worse than when
You know that it’s over

[Distorted Voice]

[Pre-Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

[Chorus]
Please don’t leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?

[Pre-Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said

[Distorted Voice]

[Verse 2]
Well, I’ve got nothing to hide
Dip down and come for a ride
Embrace a devil so sly
You cannot hear 'em coming
‘Cause my defenses are weak
I have no breath left to speak
So take the evidence
And bury it somewhere

[Distorted Voice]

[Pre-Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

[Chorus]
Please don’t leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?

[Pre-Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said

[Distorted Voice]

[Bridge]
Oh my, I don’t mind
Being the other guy
Nice try, for these games
I do not have the time
If you want me, call me
Come and take a risk
Kiss me somewhere deep below the surface

[Pre-Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

[Chorus]
Please don’t leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?

[Pre-Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said, said, said...

Uhh
Hit them with a lil' ghetto gospel
Yeah! Ma Ghetto Gospel!

Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin'

(2Pac)
If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and reminisce, nigga and bliss on the good days
I stop and stare at the younger, my heart goes to 'em
They tested, it was stressed that they under
We never really went threw that coz we was born B.C u n me b4 crack
In our days, things changed
Everyone's ashamed to the youth 'cause the truth looks strange
And for me it's reversed, we left them a world that's cursed, and it hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And y'all condemned like Malcolm x and Bobby Hunton, died for nothin
Don't them let me get teary, the world looks dreary
But when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take the time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, 'cause we're human
I hope we see the light before its ruined
My ghetto gospel
(Akon)
Whoever said that this struggle would stop today
A lot of niggas dead or locked away
Teenage Women growing up with aids
Cause that's the life when your
Living in the (ghetto)
Or eating in the (ghetto)
Or sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto)
That's the life when your
Living in the (ghetto)
Or eating in the (ghetto)
Or sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)

(2Pac)
Tell me do you see that old lady ain't it sad
Living out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess she's given birth to a baby
I don't trip and let it fade me, from outta the frying pan
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I keep discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottle
I make mistakes, I learn from everyone
And when its said and done
I bet this brotha be a better one
If I'm upset, you don't stress
Never forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes, I go blind, and let the lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace in that war on the streets
My ghetto gospel
(Akon)
Whoever said that this struggle would stop today
A lot of niggas dead or locked away
Teenage Women growing up with aids
Cause that's the life when your
Living in the (ghetto)
Or eating in the (ghetto)
Or sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto)
That's the life when your
Living in the (ghetto)
Or eating in the (ghetto)
Or sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)

(Akon)
Gun shots every night in the (ghetto)
Crooked cops on sight in the (ghetto)
Every day is a fight in the (ghetto)

Got kids to feed in the (ghetto)
Selling coke and weed in the (ghetto)
Every day somebody bleeding in the (ghetto)
(oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto)

Livin in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)

[Verse 1:]
Used to be a mess
Be so stressed
How could I've allowed myself to go there
Spread my love
And spread my will till there wasn't enough left for myself

[Chorus:]
Then I realised that no one alive would care for me the way I would do
(Gotta learn myself)
Just a matter of time
You find yourself searching back something inside
You always knew
Can you believe
My heart is healed after all it's taken
Can you believe
My heart is healed after so much breaking
(I'm ready) yes I'm ready x3
(I'm ready) to give it all I got
(I'm ready) yes I'm ready x3
(I'm ready) to give it all I got

[Verse 2:]
I know there will be days where things will not go my way
And I know, that giving up ain't in my taste
Cause I've always stood by what I've always known
Streghth at the side will make this strong
You decide to look who you be in love
Be in love ohhh yeahhh

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
In life there's so much to provide
Too much to sacrifice that it's crazy
But I learn to accept and forgive
Ooooo yeahhh

[Chorus:]

[Intro: Lil Zane & T-Bone]

[Verse 1: Lil Zane, T-Bone, Both]
For God I`m a slave To get to heaven Reverend said I gotta be saved

Words can`t express what I feel inside of my flesh
Every breath is giving Him glory until my death (I feel blessed)
Cuz everyday I`m seeing Him work (I feel blessed)
I don`t wanna do no more dirt (I feel blessed)
If the path I was on was wrong (I feel blessed)
It`s time to come home

[Verse 2: Beyoncé, Melba Moore & Angie Stone]

Maybe you need to come home So your life can be cleansed

Come unto Him and He will give you rest
For any heart that`s heavy laden

[Intro: Pharrell]
Let's party!

[Rap Verse 1: Terrar aka Pusha-T]
Imagine the Backstreet Boys
Here with the Neptunes
Call it the rec room
Play time now holla
Pusha be the one you follow
Slo' mow, low-low
Thousand spoke on the go to Impala
Crushin', love my women in couples
One each arm, keep double the trouble
So I gotta, shift 'em and shuffle
Love how I twist 'em and tussle
Sex play, next day, call me, uh

[Verse 1: AJ]
Let me tell you the story
'Bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out
Just to end up in misery
Was about to go home
And there she was standing in front of me
I said "Hi...
I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should have said "No!"
Someone's waiting for me
But I called my girl up and said

[Chorus]
Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go

(Woman)
Hello?

[Verse 2: Nick]
Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out
That she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside
That she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

[Chorus]
Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go
Pharrell, (Backstreet Boys), 

[Woman]:
Dance (Listen, baby, I'm sorry) 

[Hello?]
Dance (Listen, baby, I'm sorry) 

[Hello?]

[Rap Verse 2: Malice]
Don't stay up and wait
Cause I'mma be somewhere late
I feel for ya if you can't relate
I take it aways like two days stays
But look, still hit me on my Two-way page
See, I'm heavy in the streets like a cream Denali
Cold outside? We take trips to Maui
AJ, Brian, Kevin, Nick and Howie
Company by Clipse, Pusha T and Mali

[Verse 1: Nick]
Let me tell you the story
'Bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out
Just to end up in misery
Was about to go home
And there she was standing in front of me
I said "Hi, I got a little place nearby..."

(AJ)
Gotta go

[Chorus]
Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me

Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry

Gotta go

We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby, gotta go

(Woman)
Hello?
Hello?

[Outro: Pharrell]
Haha, yeah
Let's party, know why?
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby
I gotta go girl!
If tomorrow all the things were gone
Id worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my family by my side
Id thank my lucky stars, to be livin' here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston, to New York to L.A
Well there's pride in every American heart
And it's time to make a change
That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up, next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means

Check it out, you can catch me on top now, playin a club
Throwin a shot down, tryin to stay above
Ground, another ground-breakin day in the club
Surrounded by my home thoughts, playin a cut
Reminesin on days I didn't have a pot to piss in
No watches to glisin, no V's with hot systems
Missin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes
Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies
On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong
Had to get our shit together and move it along
Had dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas
Drivin the hottest cars, movin out with our moms and I'm

Wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means

Was interuppted by this chicken that I used to cluck wit
Back in the days when I was movin much shit, "What up chick?"
Maintanin, it's the same old thang
A little stress, a little bullshit, ain't too much changed
I see you kept it movin, you see I kept improving, she nodded her head in agreement
Remember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin it down
While the Streets is Watchin, stay hooded down
Just to earn a rep, but what good is it now?
She said "Damn I just stopped to say Hi.... Bye"
I was too deep for you from day one
Thats why we never had relations, continued in my own zone
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done

Uh huh, We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks
Run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark
Wanted to be like the older fellas, sneak and drink old Chample
Dangerous games we played on the third rail
Fiend for the summer breeze
Hopped out the Lee's Dungrares
Into the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports
To take us away from here, but I cut too much
So I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush
My sinners used to back me up
Like Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me
All my niggas is you with me, each of ya'll
Let's reach for the stars now... Jigga!

I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done
Darlin', darlin' you know I love you
I love you, for myself
But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else

I think of you, think of you every morning
I dream of you, every night
And I'd love to be with you always

When night began to fall
I cry, cry alone
And I wish, I could hold you in my arms tonight

Darlin', Darlin' you know I love you
I love you, for myself
But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else
(feat. Kelis)
I can't believe that every day and every night
It’s getting better with you out of my life
It’s like I flicked a switch and now I’m feeling good
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could
When the weekend comes I know I'll feel alive
You will be the last thing on my mind
No regrets, do you know what that means?
It's hot, it's now, it's when
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back
I can love again tonight
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back
Bounce, bounce, bounce
It's, it's now, it's when
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
I don't care what anybody thinks about that

.
Well you come home ah' feeling
For the knob on the door
You better pick up your feet
You're gonna' fall on the floor
I keep on ah' telling you
I'll tell you some more
You better leave that
Junk alone
And drink water
Lord that liquor's hot
Drink water
You don't wanna' be a sot
You better lay down the bottle
And put on the top
And drink cool H20

Well your eyes are baggy
And ah' bloodshot red
It's been a week or two
Since you've been in bed
You better pay attention
Now to what I said
You better leave that
Junk alone
And drink water
Lord that liquor's hot
Drink water
You don't wanna' be a sot
You better lay down the bottle
And put on the top
And drink cool H20
Well now I'll forgive you
For your running 'round
If you just promise that
You've come unwound
I'll buy you anything
You want in town
If you'll leave that
Junk alone
And drink water
Lord that liquor's hot
Drink water
You don't wanna' be a sot
You better lay down the bottle
And put on the top
And drink
Cool H2O

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Shorty when ya come over
I know just what to do girl to make u feel right
Ya know I know ya
Don't come be a freak for me when ya come tonight
I wanna show ya
Things u ain't never seen girl your just my type
Ya know I know ya
Don't come do all the things u know I like
I want u to show me what you know baby
But I'm a teach you new tricks
Introduce you to my ghetto karmasutricks
Close ya eyes, imagine being stress-free
Open ya eyes between ya thighs, baby that's me
When I push the pressure to pleasure it's so hard to measure
U leave me on ya mind cause nobody do it better
The intensity so real, damn shorty hold still
Then it's back to the action baby u know the drill

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
I can tell you want girl
You ain't gotta worry no more
You keep my bottles cold and you pop 'em
As soon as I walk in the door
These dude don't know me from Adam and Eve
That's why they can't mess up my flow
And when this beat drops, your heart stops
You feel it from your head to your toes

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
If you know what I'm talking 'bout
Let me see you work it out
Girl that's what I'm talking 'bout

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest
Who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest
Just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
Let me take it off

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]
I know a little girly from uptown
Just waiting just to cater to me
I know a little betty from downtown
That'll do anything that I please
All my other people that dance around
When they hear me rocking the groove
Now it might sound cocky
But is it really cocky if you know that it's true

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
If you know what I'm talking 'bout
Let me see you work it out
Girl that's what I'm talking 'bout

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest
Who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest
Just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
And let me take it off


Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Give it to me baby, c'mon give it to me baby
Now baby c'mon give me some more
I said give it to me baby, c'mon give it to me baby
Now baby c'mon give me some more
Give it to me missionary, doggy-style, cowgirl, lowwhile
Kissing it below the neck, everything drippin' wet
Latex safe sex, ya I do that correct
Like that as much as I like that baby ya I bet

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
(Slow down girl)
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
(Slow down girl)
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
(Slow down girl)
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest
Who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest
Just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
And let me take it off
Now that the lights are on, I guess that means it's over
And it's time to go
It's even easier to see how hot you are now
Though you had me at hello, whoa
Is it alright if I desire you?
You are definitely dressed to win
And I caught the eyes of a few others
But this is what my time is invested in, mm
Wish you could see my home, it's so exciting
You shouldn't be alone tonight
We've had so much fun, I don't know 'bout you
But I've talked up an appetite
I understand if you don't wanna make a scene
Just tell me where I'll meet you
..and I don't really want any food, it's late
So I guess I'll have to eat you, hmmmm...
Baby, the night train's leaving
Are you reaaaaady? (So read-yyyyyy)
Baby, the night train's leaving
Are you reaaaaady? (Yeaaaaaah, uh!)
On nights when the moon is full
I get to howlin, for you
And if you get too close to my body
Don't know what I, will do
I'm so cantankerous
Never been obedient, except when ya...
'Til we get down to the floor
No shirt, no skirt, just pump
Say say Gipp love your theatrics
Are you a star, model or an actress?
...Kinda startle from your antics
Pardon me for not bein passive
...So sexual
Better yet, you're interlectual
Cool hush and gon' wit' Lo
The lights on, they ain't hit the do'
She can tell that the way I stare
Silhouette, no clothes, I don't care (I want you!)
She can tell that the way I stare
Footprints on my ceiling, err'where (I want you!)
She can tell that the way I stare
Wanna f*ck her in the sky, juicebox in the air (You!)
Dark night, bonin her, babe
Lips wet with Charnay and Chardonnay
Girl, don't miss out on a good thang
Playin hard-to-get, you might miss this night train
Rick James baby, give her (pain), give her (pleasure)
Evil Root, in my juice just for good measure
Oh snap! What's that? A ring on my finger?
She don't give a f*ck and I don't give a f*ck either
Put a bug in her ear
Where you wanna go?
We can do the backseat or we can hit the mo'
Shawty, take advantage of me nooooooooow
C'mon! Ha-ha-ha chiiiild
Well c'mon! The train is leaving..
C'mon!
I'm not the going steady kind
I miss 'em all, all the time
I told Annie I'd be true
But I still think about Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
I still think about Katy too

If you should see miss Mary-Ann
Just tell her I'm her loving man
Give my love to Jane and Sue
But don't forget ol' Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
Don't forget ol' Katy too

I like Sadie's chicken stew
And Suzie's good at stitchin' wool
I like Mary's barbecue
But I still like ol' Katy too
Katy too, Katy too
I still like ol' Katy too

Now, girls I'm not the flirty kind
But I just can't make up my mind
I'd like to marry all of you
But I still miss ol' Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
I still miss ol' Katy too

To all the girls I make this toast
I love you eveyone the most
But don't ask me to say "I do"
'Cause I still miss ol' Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
I still miss ol' Katy too

Cupid you bet you been good to me
I got more girls than I can see
But if you give me all but two
Then let's squeeze in ol' Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
Let's squeeze in ol' Katy too
Run run run away so lost lost never comin'
Home rollin' rollin' down a track
No no I'm never comin' back
Love pumpin' in my veins
Our love I hope it's not too late
That's the road that's the load that's the role
I've been down I've been down I've been down

(What part of forever)
(Don't you understand)

I could stay stay stay, if that's what you want want want
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart
And we could go go go
And never look back on now
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart

Run run run away so lost lost never comin'
Home rollin' rollin' down a track
No no I'm never comin' back
Love pumpin' pumpin' in my veins
Our love I hope it's not too late
That's the road that's the load that's the role
I've been down I've been down I've been down down
(What part of forever)
(Don't you understand)

I could stay stay stay, if that's what you want want want
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart
And we could go go go
And never look back on now
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart

Imagine eternity, it doesn't seem that hard
They say nothing lasts forever
We'll have to prove them wrong

I could stay stay stay, if that's what you want want want
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart
And we could go go go
And never look back on now
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart
Give it up to this time full of strife
Get down, you might be fucking with the song of life
Extend your deeper senses, there will be no fight
At the never ending ocean of perfect insights
'Round your molecule beam with a halo of light
The animated aura will give delight
Soon, your every single worry will be out of sight

With the power of It, we are about to astound
All your preconceptions, they will come unbound
Listen very close, my inner voice expounds
We are the human race, and we groove to the sound
Yes, we deliver the truth to our musical birth
A soul shocking sound with electrify the earth
People have to know that it's not about money
Cash is not the way to make your life sunny
There is no need if you got the soul seed
Love, life and peace, it can only begin
When you know in your heart that the change is within
Love all your brothers and love all your sisters
Love all the missus and love all the misses
And don't be shy when you're sharing your kisses
Greed, jealousy gets boos and hisses
What it is, what it is, so much to be found
What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds
What it is, what it is, what it is in a song
What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong

Balance your life with the right kind of foods
To eat a sad cow is to eat another you
Well, that's an unfair rap, it's unforgivably rude
It'll put your Karma in the worst of moods
Someone's drinking booze and taking too many ludes
'Cause when you cop, don't you cop an attitude
And that's an ugly thing, it's not the real you
So please y'all, take some sound advice
Be yourself, clear your mind, make a sacrifice
The always sober you is especialy nice

Don't loot, don't shout, give comet the boot
I love it kickin' back and playin' my bamboo flute
Refuse to fight wars for political whores
Unsurpassed peace lines the salt water shores
It is my notion that the perfect peace potion
Can be found in the wake of the green sea ocean
The long rocky swells of the mighty blue ocean
Is the cradle of peace, it's the perfect peace potion
There you will find it, with sweet sea creatures
The smile of a dolphin is a built-in feature
We will learn much peace will the whale as your teacher
Good morning class, how very nice to meet you
What it is, what it is, so much to be found
What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds
What it is, what it is, what it is in a song
What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong

Open up your hearts to the planets; to the stars
With your spirit take a trip from Venus to Mars
You know, Einstein did while Hitler hid
Now, Albert lives forever in every single kid
But, with Adolph Hitler, we are permanently rid
Picasso, Mister Dali and my man, Jimi Hendrix
These cool brothers make the world go 'round
Yeah, they do it with art, and Jimy did it with sound
But, by all these men, it was found
Each and every person can be just as renowned
Don't let the world's racist creeds give your pretty face a frown
Stand up for equal rights, I mean buckle down
Go spread the word from town to town
We are the human race and we groove to the sounds

Now that you've heard what it is in a song
From here on in, you can do no wrong
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

And dreamed of para, para, paradise
Para, para, paradise
Para, para, paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
In the night, the stormy night (Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
She'd close her e-e-e-eyes
Flew awa-a-a-ay
Goes o-o-o-on
She'd say-oh-oh-oh
Close her e-e-e-eyes
Flew awa-a-a-ay
Goes o-o-o-on
She'd say-oh-oh-oh

Close her e-e-e-eyes
Flew awa-a-a-ay
Goes o-o-o-on
She'd say-oh-oh-oh

Close her e-e-e-eyes
Flew awa-a-a-ay
Goes o-o-o-on
She'd say-oh-oh-oh

Close her e-e-e-eyes
Flew awa-a-a-ay
Goes o-o-o-on
She'd say-oh-oh-oh

Para, para, paradise
Para, para, paradise
Para, para, paradise
Para, para, paradise
And dream of Para, para, paradise
Para, para, paradise
Para, para, paradise
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
E-e-e-eyes
Flew awa-a-a-ay
Goes o-o-o-on
She'd say-oh-oh-oh

Close her e-e-e-eyes
Flew awa-a-a-ay
Goes o-o-o-on
She'd say-oh-oh-oh

Close her e-e-e-eyes
Flew awa-a-a-ay
Goes o-o-o-on
She'd say-oh-oh-oh

Close her e-e-e-eyes
Flew awa-a-a-ay
Goes o-o-o-on
She'd say-oh-oh-oh

Para, para, paradise
Para, para, paradise
Para, para, paradise
Every time she closed her eyes
I know it doesn't seem that way
But maybe it's the perfect day
Even though the bills are piling
And maybe lady luck ain't smiling

But if we'd only open our eyes
We'd see the blessings in disguise
That all the rain clouds are fountains
Though our troubles seem like mountains
There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose heart
Give the day a chance to start

Every now and then life says
Where do you think you're going so fast
We're apt to think it cruel but sometimes
It's a case of cruel to be kind

And if we'd get up off our knees
Why then we'd see the forest for the trees
And we'd see the new sun rising
Over the hills on the horizon
There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose faith
Give the world a chance to say...
A word or two, my friend
There's no telling how the day might end
And we'll never know until we see
That there's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose heart
Give the day a chance to start
There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills

[Verse 1]
A wanna be gangster thinkin' he's a wise guy
Rob another bank, he's a sock 'em in the eye guy
Tank head, Mr. Bonnie and Clyde guy
Look him the eye, he's not my kinda guy
Never wanna be confusion proof
Pudding's sweet but too aloof
Orange eye girl with a backslide dew said
Yo homie, who you talkin' to?
A backed up paddywagon mackin' on a cat's ass
One uppercut to the cold upper middle class
Born to storm on boredom's face
Add a little lust to the funky ass Flea bass
Most in the race just lose their grace
The blackest hole in all of space
Crooked as a hooker, now suck my thumb
Anybody wanna come get some?

[Chorus]
(If you have to ask) You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go
(If you have to ask) You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go

[Verse 2]
Don't ask me why I'm flyin' so high
Mr. Bubble meets superfly in my third eye
Searchin' for a soul-bride, she's my freakette
Soak it up inside, deeper than a secret
Much more than meets the eye
To the funk, I fall into my new ride
My hand, my hand
Magic on the one is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face like a stage in Vaudeville
I feel so good can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum rockin' my red hood

[Chorus]
(If you have to ask) You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go
(If you have to ask) You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go

[Guitar Solo]
Oh, Love is a burning thing
And it makes a firey ring
Found my wild desire
I sleep into a ring of fire
I fell into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
Oh, I fell into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went hgher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
Oh, The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire was wild
Oh, I feel into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire...
Ezy Ryder

Tryin to find his heaven above but he's dyin to be loved

[Can You Feel It?]

[Intro: The Jacksons, Michael Jackson]
(Can you feel it?) (Can you feel it?)
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it? (Woo)
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
All the colors of the world should be
Loving each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother
And tell him twice
Spread the word and try to teach the man
Who's hating his brother when hate won't do, hoo
'Cause we're all the same
Yes, the blood inside of me is inside of you
Now, tell me

[Chorus: The Jacksons, Michael Jackson]
Can you feel it? (Tell me can you feel it)
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? (Woo)
(Can you see what's going down)
Can you feel it?
(Can you see it in your bones?)
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? (Hee)

[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]

[Intro: Michael Jackson]
You know I was, I was wondering
If you could keep on
Because the force
It's got a lot of power
And it make me feel like, ah
It, it make me feel like... ooh

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?) Ooh
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

[Billie Jean]

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
People always told me
Be careful what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts (Hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)
Hey-ay

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Billie Jean is not my lover
(Don't call me, Billie Jean, woo)
Billie Jean is not my lover
(She's not at the scene, hee)
Billie Jean is not my lover
(No, no, no, woo)
Billie Jean is not my lover
(No, no, no, no)

[Interlude: Michael Jackson]
(Michael, Michael) Hee
(Michael, Michael) Hoo
(Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is Not my lover

[Black or White]

[Intro: Macaulay Culkin]
Eat this

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you
Yes we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight, hee, ah, ah

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're Black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're Black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're Black or white

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

[Outro: Michael Jackson]
It's Black, it's white ('Cause we're all the same)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's Black, it's white ('Cause we're all the same)
Ooh hoo

[Is It Scary]

(Piano intro)

[Spoken Intro: Haunted Voice]
I have seen the Book of Tales
Crafted by magical hands
Older than time itself
Its pages are filled with darkness
And mystery

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs
There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
'Cause they're hiding everywhere
(Aaaahhh!)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, boy
Is it scary for you, baby
Is it scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby

(*Whispering and breathing*)
{Sorcery...Illusions...}

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
There's a creaking on the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin nearly open
Where a restless soul is pokin'

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
I am gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Perform before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

[Interlude: Michael Jackson]
I, I, I, I, I always feel
I, I, I, I, I - Somebody's watching me
I, I, I, I, I always feel
I, I, I, I, I - Somebody's watching me
I, I, I, I, I always feel
I, I, I always feel like somebody's watching me

[Interlude: Rod Serling]
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Never Land, that's the place
A monster, that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing you could fear

[Threatened]

[Intro: 50 Cent]
All hail, the king has risen
All hail, hail, the king, hail, the king has risen
All hail, the king, king, king, king, king, the king has risen
All hail, the king, king, king, king, the king has risen

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
You're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you

[Chorus: Michael Jackson, 50 Cent]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me
(Ooh hoo, come on, baby)
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened (Yeah)
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me
(The king has risen)

[Outro: Rod Serling]
What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't - it's the beginning

I can't believe that every day and every night (Bounce)
It's gettin' better with you out of my life (Bounce)
It's like I flicked a switch and now I'm feeling good (Bounce)
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could (Bounce)

When the waking comes I know I feel alive (Bounce)
You will be the last thing on my mind (Bounce)
No regrets, do you know what that means?

Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild, we bounce to this track

Hands to the sky, and throw your head back

I can love again tonight, we bounce to this track

You go my summertime now, yeah that's chillin'
Swimsuit, backyard

Girl, got mee!
Groove it to the beat, palm tree
Giving me the keys, anywhere you please

I got my mind up in the clouds
It's easy cause you're good to me
And it's only getting brighter now
Cause I know you're so good for me
I got my mind up in the clouds
It's easy cause you're good to me
And it's only getting brighter now
Cause I know you're so good for me
I can built it in the air today
So they saw a smile on your face
I know the weather when I'm with you
I know, I know there will be no rain
There will be no rain
There will be no rain
Only sunshine
There will be no rain, no no
'Cause I know the weather when I'm with you
I know, I know there will be no rain

[Spoken Intro]
Planet Earth, my home, my place
A capricious anomaly in the sea of space
Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul
Planet Earth, gentle and blue
With all my heart, I love you

[Verse 1]
What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores?

[Chorus]
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooooooh

[Bridge]
I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

[Outro: MJ & (Choir)]
Hey, what about yesterday
(What about us)
What about the seas
(What about us)
The heavens are falling down
(What about us)
I can't even breathe
(What about us)
What about apathy
(What about us)
I need you
(What about us)
What about nature's worth
(Ooh, ooh)
It's our planet's womb
(What about us)
What about the holy land
(What about it)
Torn apart by creed
(What about us)
What about the common man
(What about us)
Can't we set him free
(What about us)
What about children dying
(What about us)
Can't you hear them cry
(What about us)
Where did we go wrong
(ooo, ooo)
Someone tell me why
(What about us)
What about baby Boy
(What about it)
What about the days
(What about us)
What about all their joy
(What about us)
What about the man
(What about us)
What about the crying man
(What about us)
What about Abraham
(What was us)
What about death again
(Ooh, ooh)
Do we give a damn
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooooooh
Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooooooh
Yo B (turn your speakers up man)
Turn your speakers up money!
Yo God! (Yo God?)
Yo I got mad skills
Isn't that money?

Chorus: Snoop
New York New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I'm from the Dogg Pound

Verse One: Kurupt
It's the incredible, the lyrical
You can't be me like Niece, to see me is gonna take a miracle
I'm driving motherf**kers hysterical, with a
Touch of this twister, stylistic mixture
What I create pulsates, there is no escape
Annihilate your mental mindstate
Dre labels my vocabulary abusive
I packs more knowledge than Confuscius, I'm deadly
Induce you like Medusa, with thoughts to shed
And niggas throughout this hemisphere, far and near
Prepare, catch me chillin like the winter
Up against the number one contender, as I enter
Cause I gets heated like friction
Motherf**k your whole jurisdiction, react this fact not fiction
Telepathic addiction, to this homicidal recital
Dangerous and vital to all my rivals
Suicidal, brainwaves conveys
To the average motherf**ker's minds these days
I'm all ready to put work in
Take ten steps and turn to shoot the first nigga smirkin
Give a F**K, what's your name, what you claim
Or why you came, motherf**ker don't explain
Simply, don't tempt me, cause I'm simply
Layin hoes lifes empty, the invicible MC
Chorus One

Chorus Two: Snoop
Too much, I serve too many people, too much
It's too much, I serve too many people
And when I finish servin ain't gon be no sequel

Chorus One and Two

Verse Two: Kurupt
Gimme a couple G's, for every MC, I knocked to his knees
Verbally useless, oh you got the juice? I squeeze you juiceless
The barbaric, versatile, you're no kin to me
So how the f**k you inherit my style?
Now, out the clear blue sky, I can't deny
Not a day goes by, don't get high, don't ask why
Tonight's the night for me to rip microphones
Into bits and pieces lyrical telekinesis
Gets me into verbally vindictive
Violent vocabulary bobs to existance
Catch me in the pitch black path
I sit and let the sick thought pass through my mental
Till I hear an instrumental
And detrimental verbals get to spittin
The highest in intellect, try connectin with the written
Now they faced with the forbidden, vocally chosen
To explore new terrain, then remain unseen, throughout the war
Dips like a low-low, with my verbal fo'-fo'
The cocoa complexion MC with the slow flow
Fo sho', I takes it to you from the do'
Motherf**ker, mentally I go hardco' (you know!)
I disconnect ya, Kurupter, MC to vocally
Bore your whole molecular, structure
Catastrophic, mystic as Mixelplix
Hittin MC's like picks the deadliest lyricist
Chorus One and Two: repeat 2X

[Kurupt]
We live... tonight I serve two thousand MC's
We live... cause can't none f**k with the DPG'z

[Daz]
We live (baby) because tonight I serve two thousand MC's
We live (baby) none can f**k with the DPG'z

[Snoop]
DPGC, ba-by
ABC the DPG'z
Ba-by...

Verse Three: Kurupt
Eryday, I bust rhymes and recite
In ways that make MC's stop in daylight
I'm the deadlies MC you wanna see on the streets
Invincibility is what makes me complete, compete
Nah you can't even fade me
I f**k, you, your momma, your auntie, and your lady...
*bzzt to static*
Nothing remains
We could run when the rain slows
Look for the cars or signs of life
Where the heat goes

Look for the drifters
We should crawl under the bracken
Look for the shafts of light on the road
Where the heat goes
Everything has changed
For in truth it's the beginning of nothing
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
For in truth it's the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed

(In your fear)
In your fear
(Seek only peace)
Of what we have become
(In your fear, seek only love)
Take to the fire
(In your fear)
Now we must burn
(Seek only peace)
All that we are
(In your fear, seek only love)
Rise together
(In your fear)
Through these clouds
(In your fear)
As on wings
This is the trip
And this the business we take
This is our number
All my trials
Lord, will be remembered

Everything has changed

Mystikal

[Verse 1 - Mystikal]
I'm the conscience in the toolbox that's coming for the carpenter
I'm the leerer they call me clipping the suits flipping the car and they call me the godfather
I'm one of the brand new number two pencils out the pencil sharpener
I'm the scarlet water out the delta faucet
I'm the rhyming I'm the artist
I'm the vomit in the toilet
I'm the comet when it charges
I'm the drama in New Orleans
I'm the vegetables that grow in the garden
All the weed, dope, coke, and alcohol at the parties
I'm the M-I-A-C-H-E-L Tyler
I'm the loud blakka, blakka, wakka, wakka, coming from behind ya
I'm the stitches of the shirt that make the polo man trill in the side of the Timberland
I'm the bells on trigger man
Who? Me that's who!
I'm the voice in the microphone coming from the booth
I'm the ground when you think
I'm the file on the shank
I'm the pile in the bank
I'm the round out the tank

[Chorus - Mystikal and Snoop]
I'm that nigga, Mystikal! (and I'm the Dogg)
That's that nigga (I like to hustle and ball)

Knuckle up nigga, knuckle up nigga

Knuckle up nigga, knuckle up nigga
If you sleeping I'm trippin' buckle up nigga
Snoop Dogg
I'm in the club in New Orleans
Just got finished eating a batch of chicken wings with some collard greens
I'm down south in the house straight turning it out
Got bitches in my face and I can slap they mouth
With all the shit that they be tweaking
Some niggas be speaking
Game leaking, but I'm streaking
Snoop Dogg ain't leaking
My game is tough and tight
See ain't nothing like
This G shit nigga, this LBC shit nigga
I'm thinking I'mma fall off in this club tonight
Where my old lady at? I'm tryna find a fight
I'm in this muthafucka mad, drunk, stupid and shit
Ready to take off on a muthafuckin' trick-ass bitch
Old pussy-ass nigga looking at me strange
Like he don't know which gang I claim
I'm a Dogg Pound gangsta till I fall off the planet, god damn it
Don't take it for granted, biatch!

[Outro - Mystikal and (Snoop Dogg)]

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Bricksquad bachelors, cook ups we get extras
Say that that's your bitch but nigga we didn't ask ya
Spent 10 million dollars on VVS'
Woke up in Texas, he text me, I start flexing
Diamonds chains sexy, my pistol is my best friend
I haven't killed in so many years, I get rusty
Hustling, my 40 keep budging in on the justice
These scary niggas calling the cops, but I ain t touched them
Finessed em, tricked them, left his ass on Simpson
Impress them, a victim, another lick hit successful
My weapon, FN, join if you wanna help it
And since you said you looking for Gucci, I'm on Gresham

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust him, he'll take some, he'll take some, we'll take some
Don't trust us, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Work for couple mill, still I take some
24 hours, got the base running
Sale swag bad, I got freights coming
Sell you swag pack, take it back from you
Them diamonds round your wrist, cause you a lot of problems
You scared, you tuck your ice, cause you don't want no problems
These young niggas out here hungry, they say it s no more starving
Finessing juug season, everybody robbing
Don t trust me, cause I m from the streets
Going drug shoppin, cop a couple of keys
I finesse the plug, when we don't agree
Dummy bank rolls, send em over seas

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust him, he'll take some, he'll take some, we'll take some
Don't trust us, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Ya'll niggas know how I move, y'all niggas know what it do
Versace frames on my face, I'm a 4 eyed fool
At Fountain Blue with your boo, paint mountain dew on my coupe
A quarter brick for the boots, at least a 4 and a deuce
You know I shoot through my jacket, you call the troops for your truce
Full metal jacket a savage, I put 3 mill on your crew
Throw a grenade in the room, watch all your partners kaboom
I'm a so icy tycoon, got 2 balloons in my Trues
Is you gon hoe up or blow up? Is you gonn grow up or throw up
Cause I got doja to roll up and I might pour us a 4
I can't drive a Corolla, roll around in a roller
That's a drop head Rolls Royce, y'all niggas act like you know us

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust him, he'll take some, he'll take some, we'll take some
Don't trust us, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some

And since you said you looking for Gucci, I'm on Gresham
You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it
The more you want it and then one day you get it
It's so good too but it's just like my girl
When she's around me I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones 'cause ooh
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
I know, I know, I know
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
Ain't no sun, ain't no sun
No no no
Anytime she goes away
Ain't no sun when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
Uh uh oh ahhhhhhh radio killa
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love

You said you changed, but still nothing
You're still the same, I'm just a part time lover

And I'm the blame, should've went away
But yet I stayed, with a part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out on the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

I left the state, changed everything
No more 818, for the part time lover

What goes around, comes back around
And then you get what you deserve
You part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out
On the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

Watch these red bottoms, and the back of my jeans
Watch me go, bye baby
Don't know what you got until it's gone

Tail Lights is all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit that driveway

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)

Watch me walk it out
Walk it out, walk it out

Got no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes (Uh uh)
All we do is shop until we drop (I said if you get money, if you get money)
All all all all all we do is shop until we drop (if you get money)

Just throw it in the bag
It's Mr.Throw it in the bag
I just throw it in the bag
I don't know how much it costs but I know this bitch is bad
Walk up to that register like I didn't know it had a tag
I'm no liar I don't front I'm a buy her what she wants
Cause the queen supposed to get what she desire what she wants
If my lady likes to eat, then I'm a buy her restaurants
And she such a boss bitch she can hire who she want
She can help me blow this cream, she the fire to my blunt
You can try it if you want but it's gon cost you
Bags with the G's, jeans with the horseshoe
She can go to work or chill like a boss do
That nigga ain't ya nigga unless he endorse you
They say it ain't trickin if you got it, they lyin'
I say it ain't trickin if you got her, she mine
You niggas ain't gotta worry about her, she fine
My player's card approved, ya'll niggas declined, nice

Uhh Ahhh
We up in Barneys going dumb again
Everytime we leave the manager say, "come again"
Honestly shes probably old enough to be my momma's friend
She just want that feeling back, I make her feel young again
If the card declined you need to check that shit and run again
They don't give you limits when you keep that money coming in
Yeah, just fold some paper round the magnet
As soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag
She mature to say the least
And if I get a car she make sure to pay the lease
She used to have a husband until she found out he cheats
Then she filed for divorce and watched that bank account increase
She got a condo with a view, a house with a pool
He son that's 26 but he just went to away to school
She always show me pictures of him, tell me that's a baby
I hope that I never meet him, that nigga look craaaazy
And I be spending all my lady chips
She got me feeling like my daddy back in 86
Yeah, she say that she lucky that she his
No, I m lucky that you mine baby, you know what it isss

Shorty so nice, I don't mean polite
When I say nice, I mean looking right
And you can't put a price on something looking right
If they ask how much, tell em what it's looking like
Everything I buy fly, it's like I'm booking flights
If I want it I'm a get it, that should not be tooken light
And it's on everything I got a crazy lady
So money ain't a thing, Jay-z, JD
Like Jay-Z lady, it's Beyonceing
Supporting your woman goes beyond paying
Watching me ball is like LeBron playing
I'm in the Louie shoes you might see Kanye in
They say it ain't trickin if you got it, they lyin'
I say it ain't trickin if you got her, she mine
You niggas ain't gotta worry about her, she fine
My player's card approved, ya'll niggas declined, nice

Hey little brother

[R. Kelly:]
Hey sis how you doing?

[Kelly Price:]
Fine, what's going on with you?

[R. Kelly:]
Oh nothing much

And something just didn't sound right
And so I'm calling you back to check on you
How you holding up?

[R. Kelly:]
Oh everything is fine

[Kelly Price:]
You know I don't believe you

[R. Kelly:]
Whatcha saying? You think I'm lying?

[Kelly Price:]
I'm not saying that, but I know you

[R. Kelly:]
How you know me?

[Kelly Price:]
'Cause you're my brother, and therefore I can tell when something is troubling you

[R. Kelly:]
Ok Ok, I give you that
Nothing's wrong, I take that back
There is something on my mind but sis, I don't want to waste your time

[Kelly Price:]
But I done told you time and time again whatever you're going through...you can come and talk to me and I will say a prayer with you

[R. Kelly:]
But I done prayed and prayed night and day
I still can't seem to find my way

[Kelly Price:]
Rob that ain't nothing but the devil telling you
That you're washed up and you're through, but sister's here to let you know
Boy you're gonna make it through

[R. Kelly:]
Sister, do you really believe that I can rise again?

[Kelly Price:]
Yes, and not only that, Rob, God will forgive you for your sins

[R. Kelly:]
Can you tell me what to do?

[Kelly Price:]
Well, first you've gotta believe the truth

[R. Kelly:]
Sometimes it's hard to believe in Him

[Kelly Price:]
That's okay because he believes in you

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us (I will survive)
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us (and I believe, yeah)
Through all of the hills
And valleys roamed
Trust hat we must come to (woah)
Walk side by side, follow the light
And we'll make it through (We'll make it through yeah)

[R. Kelly:]
So, so...What you're saying is believe a little more?

[Kelly Price:]
Yes, cause faith is the key that opens up the door

[R. Kelly:]
What you're saying to me, it's hard to receive
Especially when trouble follows me

[Kelly Price:]
When we're keeping it real
Robert, sometimes
Trouble can follow where you lead

[R. Kelly:]
Yes sister, I know sometimes, but I...

[Kelly Price:]
Just wait, let me make a phone call

[R. Kelly:]
To who?

[Kelly Price:]
A prayer buddy of mine
She can help you tear down your walls

[R. Kelly:]
I don't want nobody in my business

[Kelly Price:]
She's a friend
And besides you need this

[R. Kelly:]
You know how church folk can be

[Kelly Price:]
Boy, I'm your sister, trust in me...Now hold on

(Phone dials)

[R. Kelly:]
Maybe she's gone...

[Kelly Price:]
No

[R. Kelly:]
Maybe we ought to just try...

[Maurice Mahon:]
Hello?

[Kelly Price:]
Shh shh, hello, is Kim there?

[Maurice Mahon:]
Yes, I think she's around here somewhere
Hold on

[Kelly Price:]
Now you just let me do the talking

[Kim Burrell:]
Hello?

[Kelly Price:]
Hey girl, how you doin'?

[Kim Burrell:]
Hey Kelly

[Kelly Price:]
My little brother's on the line and needed advice from you

[Kim Burrell:]
Ooh what can I do for you?...Hello?

[Kelly Price:]
Go ahead Rob, she's talking to you

[R. Kelly:]
Oh, well, I know you must be very busy
So I'm not going to mess around, nah
Just telling my sister how my life is upside down
And I don't know whether I'm going left or right half the time
I Sometimes think I'm gonna lose my mind, you feel me?

[Kim Burrell:]
Mmm hmm... similar to what I used to go through

[R. Kelly:]
Really?

[Kim Burrell:]
Yes, and sometimes I still do

[R. Kelly:]
Yeah?

[Kim Burrell:]
See it doesn't matter who you are
Or where you're from
If you struggle, God will use you

[Kelly Price:]
Amen sister, what you're saying is so true
Rob are you there?

[R. Kelly:]
Yes, I'm just listening to the both of you
It's so easy to say, but not so easy to do

[Kim Burrell:]
Yes but if you stand the truth
It will free you
Just stand strong

[Kelly Price:]
Stand strong

[Kim Burrell:]
With your head held high

[Kelly Price:]
With your head held high

[Kim Burrell:]
Said it won't be long
In time he will provide

[R. Kelly:]
Will he?

[Kelly Price:]
Yes he will

[Kim Burrell:]
You just stay in the race

[Kelly Price:]
Just stay in the race

[Kim Burrell:]
And keep on running

[Kelly Price:]
And down to the end

[Kim and Kelly:]
For your day is coming

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us
Through all of the hills
And valleys roamed
Trust thatwe must come to
Walk side by side
Follow the light
And we'll make it through

[Kelly Price:]
He'll give you peace
In the midst of your storm

[R. Kelly:]
Sometimes I feel like it's too late for me

[Kelly Price:]
But he'll never leave you

[Kim Burrell:]
No way

[Kelly Price:]
You just gotta hang on

[Kim Burrell:]
Hang on

[Kelly Price:]
Robert say a prayer, keep your head
God will do just what he said

[R. Kelly:]
Finally I think I get it

[Kelly Price:]
Yes, that's it
That's the spirit

[Chorus: Kim Burrell+Kelly Price+R. Kelly]
The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us
Through all of the hills
And valleys roamed
Trust that we must come to
Walk side by side
Follow the light
And we'll make it through

[kim Burell]
So if you really want it..

[R.Kelly]
..yes, I do

[Kim Burrell (R. Kelly)]

[Turntan, Turntan & Stitches All]
You got me runnin' goin' out of my mind
You got me thinkin' that I'm wastin' my time

Don't bring me down, no no no no no
I'll tell you once more
Before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You wanna stay out with your fancy friends
I'm tellin' you it's go to be the end

Don't bring me down, no no no no no
I'll tell you once more
Before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me down, Bruce
Don't bring me down, Bruce
Don't bring me down, Bruce
Don't bring me down
What happened to the girl, I used to know
You let your mind out somewhere down the road

Don't bring me down, no no no no no
I'll tell you once more
Before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You're always talkin' 'bout your crazy nights
One of these days you're gonna get it right

Don't bring me down, no no no no no
I'll tell you once more
Before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me down, Bruce
Don't bring me down, Bruce
Don't bring me down, Bruce

You're lookin' good just like a snake in the grass

Before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Flo Rida!
Gucci!
Brr!

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I done bought all this Ciroc
Now lil' mama on my jock
Staring at me up and down like when my Roley's six o'clock
Now you know you better stop
You done heard about my squad
I am G po boy
You either (Uhh) or you not (Hold up, shawty)
Wait a minute, shawty, why you came?
Who you know and who the hell told you to come?
All up in the middle with the business unofficial
When I can't stand a chick tryna spoil my fun
Lookin' for a dude to rip you off some funds
I don't need a chick tryna throw my 1's
"Let me look rich, I wanna have his son"
I sip Pérignon, but do I look dumb?
Get a job, tryna turn my knob
And if the door open up, make sure you slob
My boys they know we buy the bar
Sit back, blow smoke from a Cuban cigar
What's your mission?
Looks suspicious
I don't get it
No permission
Back no interest
What's the business?
Shawty, listen

[Chorus: Git Fresh & Ludacris]
I'm just tryna figure (Figure)
Why you up in here? Why you up in here?
Why you up in here?
I'm just tryna figure (Figure, figure)
Why you up in here? Why you up in here?
All up in my grill
Why you dancin' on me
Steady talkin' to me
When you know that you're not gonna give it to me?
I'm just tryna figure (Figure, figure)
Why you up in here? Why you up in here?
Watchin' you doin' up in here, man?
Get your ass on
All up in my grill

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Now I ain't got no time for silly games
Got no time for silly notions
But get smacked silly for playin' with my emotions
You figured you lead me on
But bitch, you led me out the door
Now let me lead you with a song
It go like, "D, you's a hoe"
Drunk up all my Cointreau
Ain't even leave me with a glass
So cough up my whole bottle
Or I'ma take out your ass
'Cause you don't wanna see me angry (Nope)
You don't like me when I'm angry (Nope)
Live like Jackson 5
But get greezy like Jermaine
Be dangerous like Michael
So Tito pass the tissues
Don't test me 'cause I keep a clipper number 2 pistols
And you will be erased
Outta sight and outta mind
So get the fuck on
Or my girls will wipe the floor with your behind

[Chorus: Git Fresh & Gucci Mane]
I'm just tryna figure (Figure)
Why you up in here? Why you up in here?
Why you up in here?
I'm just tryna figure (Figure, figure)
Why you up in here? Why you up in here?
All up in my grill
Why you dancin' on me
Steady talkin' to me
When you know that you're not gonna give it to me?
I'm just tryna figure (Figure, figure)
Why you up in here? Why you up in here?
Flo Rida! Gucci!
All up in my grill

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
All the 4's on my Maserati, whoa kemosabe
I should be a wine taster, bottle poppin' is my hobby
I should be a food critic, all the restaurants I dine in
A quarter million dollars gone, I only got one diamond (damn!)
I'm just tryna figure
How you think you teasin' a nigga
On some 

[?]
Rock so much ice that'll make ya shiver
M.I.A. to East Atlanta
Big ups if you make the scrilla
I'm too official like I'm Referee Wilson
Referee, bitch, back in Y.A. killed 'em
Gorgeous chica speakin' with a loaded smile
Bad attitude but a song tied
I ain't even hit her like one time
But that could've been a fun time
Could be the back then brought her back
But can't keep it here, you can have her back
I am stable, I am grateful
I ain't faithful, but fuck that
Gucci!

[Chorus: Git Fresh]
I'm just tryna figure (Figure)
Why you up in here? Why you up in here?
Why you up in here?
I'm just tryna figure (Figure, figure)
Why you up in here? Why you up in here?
All up in my grill
Why you dancin' on me
Steady talkin' to me
When you know that you're not gonna give it to me?
I'm just tryna figure (Figure, figure)
Why you up in here? Why you up in here?
All up in my grill
When I say "Hey!", you say "Ho!"
Hey! (Ho!)
Hey! (Ho!)
That's basically how Hitler rose to power

My ex-girlfriend, she was a bitch, but you know, they say, like, if you want to know what a girl's gonna look like, look at her mother
You know, so I am so glad I broke up with her
Cause she would've been, you know... dead

Guys, I'm a realist
Okay? I try not to romanticize reality
You know, like when life gives you lemons
You probably just found lemons

But at the same time, I don't deny the beauty in the world
Cause there is so much beauty because life can be so symmetrical that gives birth to this almost silent poetry
You know, like a hermaphrodite playing the keytar
Or a young Amish boy trying to blow out the light bulbs on his birthday cake
Or, or a girl who's terrible at grammar saying, "Mama, you raise me good," and then being pushed down a well

If I had a dime, oh!
If I had a dime for every time a homeless guy asked me for change
I'd still say no
Here's some racial humor for you guys
White people are like this, "Ah"
Black people are like this, "Uh"
We're destined to fight forever
Blood in the streets

Yo momma's so fat
Yo momma's so ugly
Yo momma's so stupid
Your mother's breasts sag with such severity that the late, great surrealist artist Salvador Dali mistook them for clocks

[Chorus]
You see right through me
How do you do that ish?
How do you do that ish?
How do you do that ish?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?

[Verse 1]
You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin', you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice I always hated
But lookin' back, it made me greater
You always told me forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I tryin'? Know you ain't buyin'
I tried to fight it back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yellin' at you and gettin' at you
Pickin' up dishes, throwin' 'em at you
Why are you speakin' when no one asked you?

[Chorus]
You see right through me
How do you do that ish?
How do you do that ish?
How do you do that ish?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
You see right through me
How do you do that ish?
How do you do that ish?
How do you do that ish?
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you?

[Verse 2]
What are we doin'? Could you see through me?
'Cause you say, "Nicki," and I say, "Who, me?"
And you say, "No, you," and I say, "Screw you"
Then you start dressin' and you start leavin'
And I start cryin' and I start screamin'
The heavy breathin', but what's the reason?
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin', yo
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin' passive-aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay, you're right, just let it go
Okay, you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You could turn a free throw to a goal
N**** got the peephole to my soul

[Chorus]
You see right through me
How do you do that ish?
How do you do that ish?
How do you do that ish?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
You see right through me
How do you do that ish?
How do you do that ish?
How do you do that ish?
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you?

[Bridge]
Stop (Ooh)
Stop (Ooh)
Won't you just stop lookin' through me? 'Cause I can't take it
No, I can't take it (You see right)

[Chorus]
You see right through me
How do you do that ish?
How do you do that ish?
How do you do that ish?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
You see right through me
You see right through me, baby
You see right through me (Do that ish)
You see right through me (How do you do that ish?)
How do you do that? How do you do that?
How do you do that? How do you do that?
Baby

Watch me move, when I lose, when I lose it hard
Get you off with the touch dancing in the dark
You notice what I'm wearing, I notice when you're staring
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
Hotter than the A-list, next one on my hit-list
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

[Chorus]
I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on, get me, get me on the floor
DJ what you, what you waiting for?

Keep on dancing till the world ends
World ends, world ends, world ends...

Taking steps in my direction
The sound resounds, echoes
Does it lessen your affection?

No

(Ahh ahh ahh) (x4)
You say I'm foolish
For pushing this aside
But don't burn down our home
I won’t leave alive

Glaciers have melted to the sea
I wish the tide would take me over
I’ve been down on my knees
And you just keep on getting closer

(Ahh ahh ahh) (x8)

Girl I must have been crazy to say that it was over
I had to be a fool to yell out we were through
And now I'm all lonely and feeling down and out baby
When I never meant for this to end, it was so so crazy of me
Sometimes we say things that were really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby, bring your lovin' back to me

[Chorus]
I can't sleep babe, I can't think babe, I can't live babe
Without you in my life I can't go on baby
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothin' if I go away baby
And I can't do nothin' if you're not around
Though I must admit that things got out of hand
When you told me that he was just a friend
I should of had my trust in you from the very start darlin'
'Cause I never meant for this to end
How can we get it back again?
Oh sometimes a man can say things that he really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby- bring your lovin' back to me

[Chorus]
Baby we can meet somewhere and talk about it
Oh baby, can we work it out
I'm not gonna let you go my baby before I let you know that I

[Intro]
Like a queen, a queen upon her throne
It was the sweet, sweetest thing I've known

[Verse 1:]
Uh, uh, uh
The sweetest thing I've ever known (ha)
Was like a kiss on the collar bone (no doubt)
The soft caress of happiness
The way you walk, your style of dress
I wish I didn't get so weak
Ooo baby, just to hear you speak (L-Boogie!)
Makes me argue just to see
How much you're in love with me

[Chorus:]
Was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known
Oh, Mahogany, mahogany, oh, Mahogany L
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known
Oh, Mahogany, mahogany, oh, Mahogony L

[Verse 2:]
I get mad when you walk away
So I tell you leave when I mean stay (stay)
Warm as the sun dipped in black
Fingertips on small of my back
More valuable than all I own (new hit!)
Like your precious, precious baby dark skin tone (L-Boogie!)

[Rap Verse :]

[Lauryn Hill]
I met him on the subway in Brownsville, Medina
God like Apollo, I follow like Athena
Keener, cleaner, just a few misdemeanors
Hit me in the heart, part profession-al cleaners

[John Forté]
Shorty dig, you wasn't from this side
We did the slide and let me whip your ride
L-Boogie had the flavor sized up a T
Vocal was exquisite, and still love the street

[Lauryn Hill]
I shoulda seen her like when Ike met Tina
How you were shooken when I booked the arena
Jakes had you locked up, fakes had us knocked up
Snakes in the state could have anybody popped
But we stayed in the struggle, prayed in the trouble
While you on the street, I'm on tour, we make double

[John Forté]
I held the heat fine and you held mics divine
With every cat singin' with you "one time!"
You was the media's dish
Locked 

[??]
Callin' me your lil' Brownsville Swedish Fish

[Lauryn Hill]
More times than not, it got hot tryin' to date you
You know I never meant it when I told you that I hate you

[John Forté]
And though durin' our turn, everyone tried to beat us
I keep you in my heart, you was always the sweetest

[Outro 2: Dirty Harry (Lauryn Hill)]
Ayo, L-Boogie—what happened to Peace?
(Peace)

[Breakdown]
I'm running this (Like a circus)
Yeah, like a what? (Like a circus)
Let me see what you can do (Like a circus)
Let's go

[Verse 1]
There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain and the ones that observe
Well baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kind of girl
Don't like the backseat, got to be first, oh-oh
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot when I put on a show
I'm running this
When I put on a show
I'm running this
(Like a circus)

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me, and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me, and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

[Chorus]
All the eyes on me in the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor, just like a circus
All the eyes on me in the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor, just like a circus

[Verse 2]
There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me and ones that are scared
So baby, I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware
I'm like a ringleader, I call the shots
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot when I put on a show
When I put on a show
(Like a circus)

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me, and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me, and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

[Chorus]
All the eyes on me in the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor, just like a circus
All the eyes on me in the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor, just like a circus

[Breakdown]
Let's go
Let me see what you can do
I'm running this (Like a circus)
Let me see what you can do (Like a circus)

[Intro]
Please, forgive me

[Verse 1]
Notice me, take my hand
Why are we strangers when our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

[Verse 2]
I make believe that you are here
It's the only way I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

[Bridge]
I may have made it rain
Please, forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

[Bridge]
I may have made it rain
Please, forgive me (Forgive me)

And after the original it's probably this (fiesta)

Game recognize game, hoes do too

So thugs, pop yo' toasters, but don't approach us or
Bullets'll chase you like Moet mimosas
Catch us both coasts, racin' twin Porsche's
Boxes with Glocks that'll pop ya to make ya ghost-es
Whoever come closest you've been warned
But niggas don't get the picture 'til the weapons is drawn
Make your way backstage, baby girl it's on
And we'll be drinkin' 'til six in the mornin'
In the back of the club with ma-ma
Poppin' bottles of Cris with ma-ma
Put the bar on the tab for ma-ma
Throwin' hundreds up for grabs for ma-ma
Cause it's about to go down tonight
I'm a be drinkin' 'til the early liz-ight (that's right)
Nigga high like a muh'fuckin ki-zite
Take three honies just to make me feel ri-zight
My, my, my, my
It's what they all say when they see the frozen ice
They say my, my, my, my
Anytime they see them big things only cause I
While y'all gotta club date, I'm fuckin' wit arenas
Gotcha man sayin' "Kelly have you seen her?"
Yeah she wit me on the low
Gettin' high off the 'dro, got her knees on the flo'
Fiesta, fiesta, fiesta

Fiesta, fiesta
Switchin' lanes in my Six, in the 'burbs
I met a broad named Tasha, in the 'burbs
Took the hood then I moved it, to the 'burbs
Now no more sheriffs or polices, in the 'burbs (that's right)
And we about to tear this club up
Don't worry 'bout expenses cause I got that sho' 'nough
Ready to BOO like I'm fresh outta jizzail
I need some WOO from all the honey's on the DL
I said my, my, my, my (yeah)
It's what them thugs yellin' when the strippers on fizzles
They say my, my, my, my (yeah)
Got Kisha yellin' from that up and down sizzle
While y'all gotta club date, I'm fuckin' wit arenas
Gotcha man sayin' "Kelly have you seen her?"
Yeah she wit me on the low
Gettin' high off the 'dro, got her knees on the flo'
I put the big body up, come through in a Rover
Not only Kelly and Gotti, it's Boo and Hova
Pop Cris if you like, my ice glist' in the light
I'm wit Roc-Land right, so I'm rich for life
I'm like Heaven, everybody wanna get to me
How you make it to the gates and forget the key?
I'm the one God chose so you blessed through me
Gotti Floyd getchu higher than that ecstasy
Hey yo I come through stunnin'
Plus I'm gettin' blunted in the new six-hundred with the big rims on it
We rock rocks that'll light ya shoulders
Gotta lotta hot cars but the drops is colder (ah)
You see V-I-P me, Kelly, Gotti, and Hov'
Drinkin' Cris' like its H-2-O
All we do is spend cheese cause we love the dough
Mami roll more trees before it's time to go
If you got cash money then you feel this shit
And if you rollin' on them things then you feel this shit
If you drunk off in the club then you feel this shit
If you'se a motherfuckin' thug then you feel this shit
If you smokin' on some 'dro then you feel this shit
And if you off that ecstasy you got's to feel this shit
If you sippin' on some Cris' you got's to feel this shit
And if you throwin' up and shit, you got's to feel this shit
Fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta
Sleep as the goer, the bridge that watches the light speed through
And cries while the spirit stumbles
The inside missile for the protection of you
Maybe it's silent, the voice can't bear anymore strain
But speaks without even knowing
And streams outside in the direction of truth

There's no reason there's no secret to decode
If you can't save it, leave it dying on the road
Wide-open arms can feel so cold, so cold, feel so cold

Balance the books, the ledges, the loons
The disappointed looks on the faces that squint at the moon
Let's see it with shadows enhanced
And then vote to decide who'll advance
Silver jet plane, making a turn
Exciting the brain that expects it to crash and then burn
It's not the life lesson I'd have guessed
If you're conscious, you must be depressed or at least cynical
But someone might still eat the steaks even if they're tough
Spending the day, chewing the fat
Floating away isn't rough, but it's not enough
Oh, Marianne, pass me the joint
The sandpaper's tan, go-getters are surfing the point
And London's a scratch on the lens, it's over before it begins
Silk round her neck falls down to her shoulders
The older I get, the more I suspect there's a trick
But really, there's no trick at all, that doesn't result in a fall or a faltering
But something might spit out the bait even if it's real
Rolling away, missing a spoke
Close to the ground like a wheel, but it's not a joke
Holding the line, clutching the phone
Nobly wasting the night, but it isn't right, it's not right
Smelling for blood, praying for rain
Running away isn't rough, but it's not enough
The low tide is telling me, when it's over
To breathe in everything exposed
And comes back to cover me with a blanket
Being here's always changing tunes

The empty sky surrounds me but I can't see at all
Wide-open arms can feel so cold
And you can sit beside me and tell me what it's worth
But I hope I die before I get sold, I hope I die before I get sold
I'd rather die before I get sold

If you find the soul that you lost frozen in a starry void
Take it within and hope the sight of blood can will signs of life to return
Back to the way that it was, long before it made a noise
To keep on quietly reminding you what's never created nor destroyed

Wake as the swell peaks, the close-outs drowning the birds with roars
And howls scare the new unkindness
That picks and laughs at the carrion scene
Forces you see breathe can always go into hiding
And wait 'til it passes over
Or stay far gone for all eternity
Ok, pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
I say pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
You got to pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
And no ceilings
And no ceilings
And no ceilings
Yeah

Open up her mouth and she catch it like Braylon
Young Weezy F, the F is not for failing

If you niggas fly then I must be para-sailing
We are not the same, I'm a motherf*cking alien

Shit, we tryna get it for real
Oh, Rich Boy, you niggas better get focused
Get money, muthafucka, get money, muthafucka

Let me take ya through my hood where I was born and raised
Where niggas tote semi-automatics, bustin' them K's
Heavy guns and dope boys harassed by the police
Still gettin' pulled over and asked by the police

'Bama wasn't made for a nigga to win
See the color of ya skin get 'cha put in the pen
It's real life, over dice, Dwayne dead and gone
Sendin' niggas to the pen or the funeral home

I be feelin' like the Lord'll never answer me back
So I'm holdin' on my gat just in case they attack
Bullet holes in ya house'll make it hard to sleep
Ya see the fiends on the street want the hard for cheap

'Lotta niggas doin' life from under covers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men
Niggas doin' life from under covers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men
It's where you live, it's where you play
It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto

It's where I live, it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto

Can't explain how I feel growin' up in the gutter
Told my mama that I love her put nobody above her
Doin' crimes, a hard time for food on the plate
Know a couple of niggas ain't never comin' out the gate

Movin' weight the only thing them street niggas know
Servin' thangs at school, they never teach 'em, don't show
But a 44'll get 'cha money fast from robbin'
Do or die situation when ya tired, be stavin'

Government'd never send me a dime for school
So I went and started workin' like my nine my tool
I'm a leader for the South, pa, open ya ears
Young kids where I'm from wear permanent tears

It's where you live, it's where you play
It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto
It's where I live, it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto

I'm a product of the block, watch the fiends come back
Got a couple white packs 'cause they fiend for that
Early five in the mornin', pigs showin' they badge
Real niggas in the street still showin' they rags

Speed bumps in the road start slowin' me down
See them fake niggas actin' like they know me now
Got a chance to advance, so I'm makin' my move
Couple o' people still thinkin' they got somethin' to prove

Pay the card for the South, yeah the hood my home
Told my mama I'ma leave the dope game alone
On my knees every night conversatin' wit God
Niggas dyin' everyday 'cause they wanna be hard

Still totin' my piece 'cause it ain't nothin' like the movies
I'm wearin' my vest in case they hit me wit the Uzi
Even if I take a trip around the world and back
I'm representin' for the hoods where they feel me at

It's where you live, it's where you play
It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto
It's where I live, it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto, your world, ghetto

Throw 'em up if you know what the hood like
Throw 'em up if you lookin' for that good life
Throw 'em up if ya ghetto, shit
Your world, ghetto

See, see I'm steppin' out froze

Now holla for a dollar, act strange for the change
Thats my nigga Gudda Gudda, yeah he came in the Range
My homie, Mack Maine with the shades and the chains

And me I'm so fly, I swear I came in a plane, landed in a lot
Smooth like grease, laughing at the pop, you should chews like teeth?
Fresh outfit boy, came to shut it down
And it's only gon be worn once, like a wedding gown
Somebody tell the town Short Dawgs in the annex
Pistol on my hip and I pop it like Xanex
Got them niggas trippin cause we got the hoes drippin'
You see I'm ballin' like Jordan you just a Scottie Pippen
Catch you slipping, then you better go and get ya boys

Tell them runts I got some game I can sell 'em
I walk up on her, while she with them lames and I tell her

[HOOK]

[WAYNE]
Tunechi in this bitch, fresh watch me do it
Bitches know I ball, I go HAM, Cam Newton
Shorty on the pill, get this hoe some fluids
And if that bitch bad, I put her on my todo list
See I step up in this bitch like a gamma, get ya camera's

Money on the table bitch, respect my table manners
Young Money the shit, did you get the memorandom
And these other niggas think they fly im fina land them
Haa, What you doing?
I'm throwing money, they take too long with the ones
Fuck It, I'll start throwing hundreds
Gollum niggas ain't spending shit, they tippin' on a budget
Man, they pockets getting skinny, what that is Jennifer Hudson
Order a bottle and I drink it til its hollow
And my coupe is a 2 seater so you bitches gotta follow
Now buss it open backwards like the doors on a Rolls
I got money in my pocket, I got hoes on the pole

[HOOK]
See, see I'm steppin' out froze

[Short Dawg - Verse 2]
It's young Elvis Freshly in the four door European
And the tint dark as coffee, a nigga feeling bossy
Pulling hoes like a tooth and it's hard to get em off me
I'm a stunna like the CEO of Cash Money records
The Louie V rag got me chequered with the matching kicks
Grinnin' at your chick, the surp got me leaning like 10 after 6
Therefore I tell her, go on buss it open
Goin buss it open, they call me short dawg but no I ain't from Oakland
My money so tall that you gon have to climb it
If she know how to rewind it, trust me I'm gon change the climate
And then I get behind it like I'm tryna do the heimlich
She heard that I be rhyming and I'm balling like Kurt Heinrich
She's looking for some love, but over here she will not find it
So get down on your knees, you're in the presence of Your Highness

[HOOK]
What a difference a day made
Twenty four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers
Where there used to be rain
My yesterday was blue, dear
Today, I'm part of you, dear
My lonely nights are through, dear
Since you said you were mine
What a difference a day makes
There's a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy
Since that moment of bliss, that thrilling kiss
It's Heaven when you find
Romance on your menu
What a difference a day made
And the difference is you
What a difference a day makes
There's a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy
Since that moment of bliss, that thrilling kiss
It's Heaven when you find
Romance on your menu
What a difference a day made
And the difference is you
Gee it's cozy in the park tonight
When you cuddle up and hold me tight;
Stars above, they seem to know
We're puttin' on the late late show!
Hear the crazy music in the trees
See the flowers dancin' in the breeeze
Old man moon begins to glow
He's joinin' in the late late show!
Birds that should be dreamin'
Start in chirpin' a song
While fireflies are gleamin'
We kiss, ooh, kiss, ooh, all night long!
Then we amble back to my front door
Say goodnight and then we kiss some more!
Guess you know I like you so
It started at the late late show!
It's so cosy in the park tonight
When you cuddle up and hold me tight;
Stars above, they seem to know
We're puttin' on the late late show!
Hear the crazy music in the trees
See the flowers dancin' in the breeeze
Old man moon begins to glow
He's joinin' in the late late show!
Birds that should be dreamin'
Start in chirpin' a song
While fireflies are gleamin'
We kiss, ooh, kiss, ooh, all night long!
Then we amble back to my front door
Say goodnight and then we kiss some more!
Guess you know I like you so
It started at the late, late, late, late, late, late
At the late late show!
Something is boiling, boiling in me
Someone is toying, toying with me
It won't get out, it won't stop
It don't move out, it won't leave
It won't get out, it won't stop

I leave it now...

Someone's ignoring, ignoring defeat
But the taste of your poison
Your poison is sweet, so sweet

He won't give up, but I won't up and go
I don't know how
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
He's had enough...
I leave it now...

Something is boiling, boiling in me
Someone is toying, toying with me
It won't get out, it won't stop
It don't move out, it won't leave
It won't get out, it won't stop
I leave it now...

Someone's ignoring, ignoring defeat
But the taste of your poison
Your poison is sweet, so sweet

He won't give up, but I won't up and go
I don't know how
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
He's had enough, enough...
We strolled the lane together, laughed at the rain together
Sang love's refrain together and we'd both pretend it would never end
But one day we cried together, cast love aside together
You're gone from me but in my memory
We always will be together
Oh darlin', the memory of all the happy moments
We shared together will always remain in my heart
The picnics at the park, the boat rides on the lake
The way we danced all night, the warmth of your kiss
The way you held me tight are all part of a tender love
I'll never, never forget
You're gone from me but in my memory
Darlin', wherever you are
We'll always be together

Hope of the world is in our generation (let's straighten it out)*
It's all left up to us, to change this present situation (let's straighten it out)
Take caution from our elders, don't make the same mistake (let's straighten it out)
Let's fill the world with love, and get rid of all the hate
Our elders taught us one thing but, practice another
Just look what happened to the Indian and the brother
(Straighten it out!) {3x}
Hope of the world is in our generation (let's straighten it out)
It's all left up to us, to change this present situation (let's straighten it out)
Our leaders make us fight, and we don't know what for (let's straighten it out)
If they want people killed, let them fight the war!
It's gotta end somewhere, this killing's got to cease
If no one were to fight, we'd all live in peace
Our generation (let's straighten it out)
It's all left up to us (let's straighten it out)
Our generation (let's straighten it out)
Let's do just what we must
And straighten it out! (Straighten it out)
Gotta straighten it out! (Straighten it out)
Straighten it out! (Straighten it out)
Yeahhh we gon' straighten it out, yeahh!

[CL Smooth]
As long as there's a you, there's a better me
It's why we're together and stronger than they ever thought it could be
A world motherless - can health care cover this?
A love for all people no matter what the culture is
Our generation, is makin huge strides
A self-empowering movement that's on the rise
The more the door is open, the more the youth can see
A fair chance means a greater opportunity
To have a brighter future, deeper insight
Work hard to be anything you want in life
It's what it's all about, the longevity
Educated enough to know what's ahead of me
Need to straighten it out, seek and you'll find
They can cage your body, but not your mind
We lay it all on the line in the struggle
We grew, but together here's what we gotta do

[John Legend]
Our generation (let's straighten it out)
It's all left up to us (let's straighten it out)
Our generation (let's straighten it out)
Let's do just what we must, and straighten it out!

[JL with background singers]
Our generation - straighten it out!
Let's straighten it out - and straighten it out!
Heyyyyyyyyy we can straighten it out, YEAHHH!
C'mon yeah! Our generation - let's straighten it out
Hey hey, we'll straighten it out
We'll straighten it out - straighten it out
New York City, better straighten it out
Atlanta, better straighten it out
In Los Angeles, you better straighten it out
We can straighten it out, we can straighten it out

[fades out]
Worried in the nighttime, worried in the day
'cause another woman, took my man away
Down in St. Louis, there I lost my pride and joy
St. Louis woman, stole the heart of my big boy, I'm cryin'!
St. Louis gal, just look what you done done, I mean what you done done
St. Louis gal, we're gonna have some fun, I mean a-lots of fun!
I'm always cryin' the blues, both night and day
Now, daddy's gone but you will shake in your shoes
Hear what I say, 'cause some fine mornin', without any warnin'
St. Louis gal, I'm gonna handle you, I mean manhandle you
You'll find yourself in a jam, as sure as anything what am
I'm going a-huntin', do, do, de, do
You know just what I'm gonna shoot, you stole my pal, St. Louis gal
Down in Missouri, there'll come a time, your life won't be worth a dime
You stole my pal, St. Louis gal

You're on the curb lookin motherfucker, how you feel?
See your boy plottin, talkin 'bout you got steel

I came from Louisiana, bananas get peeled
This ain't no propaganda, my knocker that's real
Ain't promotin no violence, just encitin violence, nigga chill
And if I said not to move, then you motherfuckers be still
Chopper ain't in the driver's side, that a make your man yield
Get your motherfuckin ass out the car, yeah you know the drill

Jump in the car, flip the God and roll a blunt (yee!)
You can't see, your boy's from Miami
Ears like Sammy Sosa, bitch we're takin over
Bags underneath my eyes, I ain't sleep in days
I'm in the bushes with a K, your semi's gon' spray
Eat mangos and grapes, as your body decay
Bunny holes and yay, you had us in ninth grade
Hey what can I say, alligator suflet

Wife beater chinchillas, life can't get no realer, nigga

Violate a "Violator" nigga, we fuck you up
Don't you ever think or even try to confront on a tread

In others words, your whole rap roster whack, give me your label
Whenever, whatever, whoever be thinkin they better
Test "Violator" man to merge five labels together

It's a Cool & Dre epidemic
Who wanna test, c'mon
Who wanna test, Violator 3

[Verse 1:]
When life seems full of clouds an' rain
And I am filled with naught but pain
Who soothes my thumpin' bumpin' brain?
Nobody!
When winter comes with snow an' sleet
And me with hunger and cold feet
Who says, "Here's twenty-five cents, go on, get somethin' to eat"?
Nobody!

[Chorus:]
I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time!
And until I get somethin' from somebody
I will never do nothin' for nobody, no time!

[Verse 2:]
When summer comes all cool and clear
And my friends see me drawing near
Who says, "Come on, let's have a beer"?
Nobody!
When I was in that railroad wreck
And thought I'd cashed in my last check
Who took the engine off my neck?
Nobody!

[Chorus]
Rise above, gonna start the war
Oh, what you want? What you need? What'd you come here for?
Well, an eye for an eye and an 'F' for fight
They're taking me down as the prisoners riot
Eh, yeah

Sometimes I want to disappear
Disappear
Disappear
I want to disappear
Eh, oh, eh
Disappear
Disappear
I want to disappear

When I feel kinda bad and don't want to stress
I just pass it off on ability
Well, you got what you want and what you never knew
Perfect gift from me to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Sometimes I want to disappear
Disappear
Disappear
I want to disappear
Eh, oh, eh
Disappear
Disappear
I want to disappear

(Raise up to your ability)
You never knew what I could find
What could come when we realize
I don't want to compromise
(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah, I'm scared but I'll disappear
Running around before it corners you
Like he's someone who lost his way
(Raise up to your ability)
I know that you want me
'Cause it's simple to see of my ability
(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah, you're undecided
Hey, it's the right feeling
Yeah, I don't wanna run away

You gotta focus on to your ability
Focus on to your ability
Gotta focus on to your ability
Focus on to your ability
Then they can't get what they want to steal
Can't get what they want to steal
Then they can't get what they want to steal
Can't get what they want to steal
Sometimes I want to disappear
Disappear
Disappear
I want to disappear
Disappear
Disappear
I want to disappear

(I think we're ready for eh, the second installment of the Sloppy Love Jingle, roll it, action)

Okay, continued
What's next upon the menu?
Hmm, maybe I should crack a joke
Attack and ask her if she smokes
'Cause I can't seem to find my matches
And that could break the ice but
I'm a bad actress with three lighters
I acquired the previous night
And there I was, do or die
She was approximately five feet away from my frame
So I decided to take a stride, swallow my pride
Tellin' her my name like
Hello miss, my name is Travis
Just a ordinary cat, I'm into art and fuzzy rabbits
Kinda smart with a big heart, you can have it
See you find that funny
I'd love to buy you a drink but I got bent and spent my money
But would you kindly accept a rain check
Perhaps some deep chit chat
She didn't think twice, nodded her head and said
"I'm with that"
By the way do you have some matches?
She's like, "No but there's a lighter right in front of you"
And now we both giggling
This girl's so crazy, got my gullet jiggling
Fiddling with my feelings like an out of tune piano
Like I'm on Ritalin
The way she's got my undivided attention dismissin' any thoughts of lettin' this one get away

[MF Doom]
Smack it up, flip it, pulled out, 'bout to fail
Sunday in the A-T-L and I'm all outta ale
Like a bat out of hell, tripped on a cat tail
Mutt drinkin out a pail, who let the rat out the cell?
Got all the ingredients and recipe, might as well
Since last week the bootlegger been in jail
If all else fail, inhale the ale
Makin sure they can't see your sale via snail mail
Mind like a sewer, servin rhyme on a skewer
Doom'll step to a fine dime like he knew her
My black sister, she said "Step back" before he kissed her
She did the dipper and the smack just missed her
There go a list of politics like Henry Kissinger
99% of rap is just a friendly issue to
I'm like these dudes must have some screws loose to hate y'all
Or a couple of ounces short of deuce-deuce or 8 Ball
Y'all know it's time for the end, when the day come
Buy an album, get rudely insulted over fake drums
Same CD's you get for free, you break 'em
Wa-alaikum, make 'em eat they food like steak'um
Why she wanna ask me if I could pass the paparika?
One hand on the mic, the other on the beaker
Every week or so peaked out the lab though, eureka
A technique to keep somethin uniquer in your speaker
For yo' information, I didn't do the beat y'all
It ain't my fault, if she didn't move her feet at all
Skeeter, got Peter to pay Paul
So you can drink it on Mary so she can play ball
... So let her have my scrilla
And cut it out with all that funny hand jive will ya?
All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E
Drink it all fast, make you haul ass slowly
And rhymin to remember what you told me
Holey moley, did you get a load of her roley poley?
Yo G, remind me to remember what you told me
Whoever don't feel him build walls like a goalie
One for the money, two for the better green
Three for methanine-dioxymethamphetamine
Told the knock kneed ghetto queen get the head fiend
Tell him it's for Medellín and use oxyacetylene
Who needs airplay, it's all just hearsay
Leave a wig like it was havin a bad hair day
Miracle glide master, asked him what's his secret
He said Shasta, and turned to formaldehyde faster
When I'm home with my lady, I try to duke her daily
One night she tried to flail me with her ukelele
Pack your heat, the Villain on the cover of Black Beat
With a bunch of crackers and some snack meat
... You better have my scrilla
Cut it out with all that funny hand jive will ya?
All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E
Drink it all fast, make you haul ass slowly
Remind me to remember what you told me
Holey moley, did you get a load of her roley poley?
Yo G, remind me to remember what you told me
And if you don't feel him build walls like a goalie

[Verse 1: John Martin]
Into the streets
We're coming down
We never sleep
Never get tired
Through urban fields
And suburban lights

[Pre-Chorus: John Martin]
Turn the crowd up now
We'll never back down
Shoot down the skyline
Watch it on primetime
Turn up the love now
Listen up now, turn up the love

[Chorus: John Martin]
Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring it back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight

[Bridge: John Martin]
Who's gonna...?
Who's gonna...?
Who's gonna save...?
Who's gonna bring...?
We're gonna save the world tonight

[Verse 2: John Martin]
It's far from home
It's for the better
What we dream, it's all that matters
We're on our way, united

[Pre-Chorus: John Martin]
Turn the crowd up now
We'll never back down
Shoot down the skyline
Watch it on primetime
Turn up the love now
Listen up now, turn up the love

[Chorus: John Martin]
Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring it back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight

[Bridge: John Martin]
Who's gonna...?
Who's gonna...?

You're all I need to get by
Like the sweet morning dew, I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny
With my arms open wide
I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life for you
I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need
And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill
There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough
You're all, You're All I need to get by
I all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
All, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all, You're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by
Like an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me
Darling in you I found
Strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal
Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination
You're all, You're All I need to get by
I all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
All, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all, You're all I need to get by

[Rep My Hood Lyrics on
There was a time, i used to look into my father's size
In a happy home, i was a king i had a gold throne
Those days are gone, now the memories are on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where i was born

Up on the hill across the blue lake
Thats where i had my first heart break
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
Ooh ooh ooh ooooh!
See heaven's got a plan for you
Ooh ooh ooh ooooh!

There was a time, i met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world
Thought i'll never lose her out of sight, we were so young
I think of her now and then
Still hear the song reminding me of when
Up on the hill across the blue lake
Thats where i had my first heart break
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
All i do is stunt stunt, i get anything i want
Started in the back, now im that nigga in the front
Shout out to Rozay nigga look at what you done
All this shit i spit so sick and my pockets got the mumps
And my neck, it be so cold... boy my money old
And my prezi glow and everybody know ima
Purp popping, polo draws rocking. Bad bitch getting
Muthfucka ima problem. Yeah, its mine.. i spend it im riding around
And im getting.. im riding around in my city with the top down in my bently
And my windows up, nigga what? Goin hard, and i dont give a fuck
Put mirror tint all on that bitch so when niggas hate they see theyself
Sloppy Love Sequence 3
Cameras rollin'
Action!

The bomb's been detinated
I'm just waiting for an explosion
I was at second base and it was time for me to close in on third
With blurred vision and
Precisely placed slurred words we started kissin'
Man listen it was like a scene bad V movie with a very low budget
But fuck it I was drunk and I admit I loved it
Every last second
I couldn't kill that thought of us butt ass naked
Tely surfin with the fan on
Chattin about the session and
Slowly gettin in to closet skeleton confessions
That's when she made an offer I couldn't refuse
And chills when up and down my leg like Samoan tattoos
She said she had a pad that wasn't too far away
And she loved it if I stayed until the following day
So it was time to exit stage left
I made my rounds, gave my pounds and hugs
Gathered my thoughts and took a deep breath
And now we walkin to the door but
Right before we stepped outside she bought me one more
Now I'm feelin' it
I had my hand in my pocket but she stealin' it
With our fingers interlock
And as we walk down Exchange Street
With our hearts pitter-pat to the same beat
And then she popped the question
Like "Trav, you ever been in love"
And I'm like "Tcha, not that I recall"
But there was one situation, but I didn't have the patience
Or the balls to say it
And everytime I try I just digitally relay it
And it sound something like a "Duh duh duh duh duh"
Man my speech impediment left my heart vacant without a single resident
The first ten had got evicted the second she settled in
I seen her the other day ridin' my bike and kept peddlin'
If it wasn't for meddling kids would love even exist? (Nope)
If it wasn't for alcohol would I be saying this? (Nope)
She probably took offense, I probably started getting sober
'Cuz she started getting ugly and I think I probably told her
Then my feet got heavy, I started drippin sweat
I knew I was getting into something I would later regret
Right when I lit the cigarette I caught an occasion of the spins
I started wishin I was back at the bar with my friends
And then it happened
I fell flat on my face
When I awoke I found that I was in a very strange place
Must have goten my wish granted, 'cuz I was butt ass naked
But the only downside was that the room was pretty vacant
Except next to the bed there was this note on the dresser
While I'm trying to deal with this hangover head pressure
With a smile I grabbed the note with a smoke and sat back
"Dear whoever, lose my number
P.S. The sex was whack"
See here's the thing

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig the attitude and how you're actin' like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travie and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me?
Hmm, that sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burgulary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some naked peekaboo
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Such an angel with a devilish angle
I'm quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl
And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Now here's another bar, I'm coming for the slow gunners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your mom and 'em
No turning back so you better buckle up
Shit, don't be concerned with mine
I feel like a Speak and Spell way I got you learning my lines
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I change my name to "Did He Really Just Say That Shit?"
Yep
I'll take a mile if you let me
6-5, 200 plus and so sexy
My legs going numb for keeping my phone on vibrate
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been tryin' to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

[Verse]
Good god girl, you're giving me goosebumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you
It's not a scam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan, I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like the antidote's under my tongue
Whoa

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Damn

Bitch im on probation,so my nerves bad
And they say time flies,but mines first class
I landed in the sky and fell from da streets
I talk alot shit and practice wat i preach
Back from hell...cell 23
Tell da warden kiss my ass.. pockets on monique
Bitch im from da murder capital....hoe im far from practical
Shit happens n since im da shit im who it happen too
Young money cash money blood gang im red hot
I dont see nobody see nobody like a headshot
All dat bullshit is for da birds throw sum bread out
Got it sewn up check the thread count
I remember when I first laid eyes on you
My man Tom introduced us but I was too shy to say hi
When I finally built up enough nerve to drop a line
You made it clear you wasn't just another MySpace mistress

And I didn't take it personal
When you ignored my request to be your friend I spilled my guts and hit send
Waited 2 weeks for a response and got nothing
Honestly it only made me want you more

Week 4 rolled around and I was this close to letting go
But something wouldn't let me even though I hardly knew you
It was plain to see we were meant to lock lips
You knock me out with the brass knuckle tats on your hips

I was on this website late night lurking
When I got a message from you that was labeled urgent
You said you weren't impressed by lame dudes with no game
They're all the same tryin' to get your instant messenger name

But the fact that you hittin' me back made me smile
You must've saw somethin you liked when you was skimming through my profile
You caught me at the most pivotal moment
So now I'm emailing my love with a dozen digital roses
So click approve, so simple
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Just click approve, you're killin' me here
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Let's face it, it's a sad situation when we have to resort to keyboards as a means of making relations
But I don't have the patience, I get straight to the point
So this is me at my most honest
No egos, no Gym Class status, just Travis

Love it or leave it, but you gotta admit
On a scale of one to awesome I'm the shit
Just get over it, it happened god damn it, I've been waitin too long
Even wrote a song about, like to hear it, here it go
If I'm being too annoying, let me know (just let me know)

But it's hard for me to not hate when I'm on MySpace
I never see my face in your Top 8
Approaching 6 weeks now, it's kinda obvious that you're either occupied or playing a game
All my money's on the latter, this is not a LOL matter
Why would you pass up a chance this great?
If there were two forces and I split them down the middle, I could swing back and forth for 3 days
Rephrase
If I had two horses, and I beat them with authority, I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face
But all I got is this Powerbook and iChat

Besides I hit you all the time and you never write back
I stay on my feet
Shit
And be persistent 'til my name is under who you would like to meet

So click approve, so simple
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Just click approve, you're killin' me here
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Who cares if we don't know each other's last name
All I know is that I'm smitten with your pictures wishin' you would feel the same
I admit I get a little jealous when other dudes leave you comments
Don't let it gas you up, it's all nonsense

Lately I been romancing the thought of me and you speaking in tongues in this mansion I bought
But it's all wishful thinking
Just give me some kind of sign to let me know I'm not freakin' you out
And if you lovin' what I'm speaking about, then say something
I check my inbox ten times and ain't nothin'
You probably busy doing something sexy
I just hope I'm in your thoughts next time you log in
And if not, ain't no love lost between you and me
I'll be here when your man ain't fully down as he used to be
So yeah it's time to sign out, my vision's getting blurry
This is madness, XOXO dash Travis

So click approve, so simple
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Just click approve, you're killin' me here
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose
So click approve
No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man (When Eminem created Slim Shady)
Behind the lies (DJ Cinema)
No one knows what it's like to be hated (He really started to connect with people across the world)
To telling lonely lies (Have outraged just as many people as the won over)
(Mardi Gras)
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that's sorta unique, cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep and I'm stillmatic
The way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still
It's like tryin to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped just knowin any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if
Bush rapped I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money you can't pay me enough
You to play me
Is cock-a-mani you just ain't zany enough
To rock with shady
My noodle's cock-a-doodle
My clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose
Yeah the whole kit and caboodle
I'm just brutal
It's no rumor I'm numeral uno
If Assuming
There's no humor in it no more
You know I'm rollin' with a swollen bowlin' ball in my bag
You need fag to come a tear a new whole in my ass
No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind the lies
No one knows what it's like to be hated
To be faded
To telling lonely lies
Damn I ain't never kill nobody I promise
An I promise if you try me
You gone hafta to rewind this track
And make me go back that thing'll go 'lack''
That boy'll lay flat so flat
That act is what I perform amongst you haters
Got nina in my palm an I'm masturbatin
Black peter pan fly till I die
Wat u sayin Bathe in ape
Eve Saint - evie sue what I stay & gat me feelin'
Like scarface light the cohiba
Streets reply I look right in a four seater
You know I be high get right in the four seater
Top floor of the four seasons
Four of them whores
An they all know how to cook it up
An look I got some and only one know how ta bag
Bitch bundle up
See it's a cold world so homie bundle up
Clean on this grind full or not get your hustle up
No one knows what it's like (I know that you put a lotta pain in your music)
To be the bad man
To be the sad man (Some of it comes from def jam)
Behind the lies (bein frustratin with other niggas)
No one knows what it's like to be hated (Some of it comes from my chick pissin me the f*ck off)
To telling lonely lies (I'm feelin a lotta pain)
(Mardi Gras)
I'm dealing with some shit homie
It's in the back of my head
An it's some shit homie but I just rap it instead
See I got wolverines bones in me but
The whole worlds throwin stones at me
Like they all got a bone with me
Got a childs mother and I hate her to death
But that's my childs mother so that's my
Mate to the death it's wow how I love her for
For putting little me here
And me and her could be forever
She gonna still be there
Then it's some other niggas
I judged the character wrong but
They some other niggas
Now let's get back to the song
I gotta Drug Problem
That I ain't tending to, cause I gotta enough problems
An my solution is to stuff problems
But if something goes wrong with that
Then it's back to Pcp and so long with rap
See I'm depressed lately
But nobody understands
That I'm depressed lately
I'm sorta feeling repressed lately
So ya'll been hearin and seein me less lately
Like does anyone notice the regress lately
Look deep nigga don't I seem stressed lately
Seem disturbed alota regrets lately
Yeah
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings like I do
An I blame you
No one fights back as hard on their anger
None of my pain in the world
Can show through

[Lil Wayne:]
No regrets at all, I'm high and I hope you can catch the fall
Welcome to my lecture hall, you can't shake my infection off
Take me to your leader and, I promise I will be the man
Swim until I see the sand, then die as soon as I reach the land
The water's over our hands, what happened to our plans
Swim until I see the sand, then die as soon as I reach the land!

[Chorus:]
This is my resurrection, so fuck your resolution
I don't need no protection, I don't need your confusion
Don't know what to believe
Don't know what to believe
Don't know what to believe
Don't care what you believe
Cause I'm so over you, yeah I'm so over you
Yeah I fly over you, cause I'm so over you

[Shanell:]
Heeeey
I did everything by the book, book, book
Scribblin' (?) that I took, took, took
Find that you'll never (?)
Setting the setup to fall like the twins, you... struck
Show them a picture of my I.D
Better enough to prove that it's me
Look in the mirror
Now who should I...

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne:]
Ha!
Don't know what to believe (huh)
Don't know what to believe (yeah)
Don't know what to believe (huh)
Don't care what you believe (yeah)
Don't know what to believe (huuuh)
Don't know what to believe (yeaaaaah)
Don't know what to believe (huuuuuuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaah)
Yeaah!
Huh!
What about me, yea
Oh what about you
What about all the things that we done gone and went through girl
Just forget bout it, get bout it (Cause i'm gone)
Just forget bout it, get bout it (Cause im gone)
So just forget bout it, get bout it (Cause im gone)
So just forget bout it, get bout it (Cause im gone)

Chu-chu-chu-chuckin up the deuces got me feelin like this
Reminiscing all the times we went through and it's sick
It hurts me, thinking bout it all again
It hurts me, i'm thinking bout it all again
Like damn, i don't think you understand
I just wanna be more than your average man
Please tell me where me and you stand

If not, i'll be gone til November like damn

What about me, yea
Oh what about you
What about all the things that we done gone and went through girl
Just forget bout it, get bout it (Cause i'm gone)
Just forget bout it, get bout it (Cause im gone)
So just forget bout it, get bout it (Cause im gone)
So just forget bout it, get bout it (Cause im gone)

Thats flyer then the wrestler, you don't want to mess with young Rey Mysterio mixed with Chavo Guerrero (yup!)
Flyer then the rest of them, make them all remember me
Make em all similar to the mind of an elephant
Mine wreaks excellence, y'all wreaks estrogen
Everybody know me like the Contra code for extra men
Beyond the extremities of everyone or anyone, train of thought runnin' like its Kenny and I carry on
Been in more beef then ceriums I bury em
Always next to madness like Kenyon, I carry on
Flyer then the rest, I told you I'm the 'ish
Watch me exercise my excrement
While sending messengers
DMV's messenger
Love it so I'm reppin' it
Hail to the 'Skins
Rest in peace, Sean Taylor

(Girl)
So what are you doing back?

(Man)
Well, I set back and thought about
The things we used to do
It really meant a lot to me
You mean a lot to me

(Girl)
I really mean that much to you?

(Man)
Girl, you know it's true

I'm in love with you, girl, 'cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you pack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true?
You're soft, succulent, so sweet and thin
That's kind of like a vision upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's, oh, so true
Together we're one separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
'Cause you contain a quality, you that I admire
You're pretty plain and simple, you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love, girl, I'm in so love, girl
I'm just in love, girl, and this is true
Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you

This is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain
My emotions starts up when I hear your name
Maybe your sweet, sweet voice would ring in my ears
Then delay my system, girl, when you are near
And with your positive emotion, love-making enjoyin'
That's for me to bust, it's like a girl and a boy
These feelings I get I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I
Now what you're wearing I don't care, or as I've said before
No reason that I like you, girl, just for what you are
If I said I'd think about it, you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love, girl, I'm in so love, girl
I'm just in love girl, and this is true

Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love
Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Dead in the water
It's not a paid vacation
The sons and daughters of city officials
Attend demonstrations
It's hardly a sink or swim
When all is well if the ticket sells

Out with a whimper
It's not a blaze of glory
You look down from your temple
As people endeavor to make it a story
And chisel a marble word
But all is lost if it's never heard

But I've got someone to make reports
That tell me how my money's spent
To book my stays and draw my blinds
So I can't tell what's really there
And all I need's a great big congratulations

I'll keep your dreams
You pay attention for me
As strange as it seems
I'd rather dissolve than have you ignore me
The ground may be moving fast
But I tied my boots to a broken mast
The difference is clear
You throw it in your cauldron
Rust and veneer, dusk and dawn
Steinways and Baldwins
You start with a simple stock of all the waste
And salt to taste

But damn my luck and damn these friends
That keep on combing back their smiles
I save my grace with half-assed guilt
And lay down the quilt upon the lawn
Spread my arms and soak up congratulations
Well c'mon everybody and let's get together tonight
I got some money in my jeans and I'm really gonna spend it right
Well been a-doin' my homework all week long
And now the house is empty and my folks have gone
Ooo c'mon everybody
Well my baby's number one but I'm gonna dance with three or four
And the house'll be a-shakin' from the bare feet a-slappin' on the floor
When you hear that music you can't sit still
If your brother won't rock you then your sister will
Ooo c'mon everybody
Well we'll really have a party but we gotta put a guard outside
If the folks come home I'm afraid they're gonna have my hide
They'll be no more movies for a week or two
No more runnin' round with the usual crew
Who cares, c'mon everybody
C'mon everybody
Soulja Boy Tellem!

(Chorus: repeat 2x)
Hopped up out the bed
Turn ma swag on
Took a look in the mirror said wassup
Yeeeeea I'm gettin' money (ohh)

Turn ma swag on
It's ma turn now turn it up
Yeeeeea, yeeeea
I put my team on, and ma theme song
Now it's time to turn it up
Yeeeeea, yeeeea

I got a question why they hatin' on me
I got a question why they hatin' on me
I ain't did nothin' to em
But count this money
And put my team on, now my
Whole clique stunnin'
Boy wassup, yeeeea
Boy wassup, yeeeea
When I was 9 years old
I put it in ma head
Ima die for this gold
(Soulja Boy tellem)
Boy wassup, yeeeea

(Chorus)
I'm back again
I know a lot of y'all thought I wasn't coming back
Yeeeeea, yeeeea
I had to prove them wrong
Got back in the studio and came up with another hit
Yeeeeea, yeeeea
I told the world my story
The world where I'm from
Soulja Boy X L dot com, boy wassup
Yeeeeea, yeeeea

Now everytime you see me spit
Every time you hear me rhyme
Every time you see me in your state of town
Say wassup
Yeeeeea, yeeeea

Soulja Boy Tellem
(Chorus)

Next thing you know we be K-I-S-S-I-N-G
In the back of my Maserati
Then I drop you off before curfew time
The kind of guy I be
Oh I'm
So kind
Them other guys ... are not like me
So don't pay them ... no mind
Uh-uh!

[Chris Brown]
Shorty, shorty

You got me open and waitin', and poppin'
You keep me on and poppin'
Oh, oh

[Intro: Rihanna]

Baby, you can call me
Anytime you want me
Loving you is all I need
Boy, we can get it crackin'
You can make it happen
Come and get the best of me
Baby, watch me and step up
You don't wanna mess up

'Cause, baby (Baby), you got (You got) the fires the remedy

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]

Tell me, what's it gonna be?
I got the hotness
Boy, if you want this, baby, you should talk to me

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Baby, we can ride out
Go somewhere and hide out
Far away from everything
We ain't gotta tell nobody
We can just get it poppin'
Baby, come get next to me
''Cause, baby, what you got
Can't nobody take it, no
It's on lock
Baby, you know you can get it
So baby (Baby), take me (Take me)

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
It's too hot

I got the hotness
Boy, if you want this, baby, you should talk to me

[Outro: Rihanna]
I got the hotness
Oh-oh
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Here, you focus, so I can see your faces
The eyes are wrong, how will I know if it's working right?
Light confuses, the tiny isles of bruises
The mangled lines, I see the signs of aging

But if I try to feel at all I am deceived, my mind's affected
It's empty now as I lay down, I feel alright, my heart is racing

Turn the noise on, I'd like to feed my poison
Assembly lines, carry a velvet warning
To the yard, it's just like striking matches
The Polish lies

But it's working in your blood which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind and not your heart... no, it's working
It's working in your blood which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind and not your heart
It's working in your blood which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind and not your heart
It's working in your blood which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind and not your heart
Legendary, Runners, you know me
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, Trilla
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Every dollar that I count can't go in my account
My accountant can't count up all my money in a hour
?Cause it's comin? too fast and I'm scared it won't last
Look that white girl in her face, told her this was her last dance

Goddamn, speedin' got my heart racin?
I don't have the nominations you could blame that on my occupation
Caesar salad, Caesar's Palace
You're not a boss little nigga 'cause your cheese is average

In the Benz, AK, ridin? shotgun
It's a Benz ?cause you're broke ?til you got one
It ain't nothin' doin? 100 in the Maybach
Throwin? money out the roof motherfuck the brake pads

Fast life, I live, big cars, big cribs
Speedin?, I'm speedin?
I can't stop, it's all I know
From a youngin? I was taught get doe
I'm speedin?, speedin?, I'm speedin?
These people came lookin? for me, shit I got ghosts
See the West Coast close up in the Montrose
Big money, boss major
American Idol, I got fans like Fantasia

Read between the lines or yo' ass like Fantasia
Get hit between the eyes, he died, they can't save him
In a Porsche, I'm weavin?
No dough, but I'm speedin?

I'm starin' at the skyline I got a million on my mind
I'm the best and these pussy niggas runnin' out of time
Ricky Ross, I'm the chill, quarter mill for the timepiece
Yeah, I bought a wheels like deals with the dime beats

Fast life, I live, big cars, big cribs
Speedin?, I'm speedin?
I can't stop, it's all I know
From a youngin? I was taught get doe
I'm speedin?, speedin?, I'm speedin?

Sittin? in the livin' room, watchin' The Grammys
Wishin' that was me that was on The Grammys
All I needed was someone to get behind me
Money rain on me!
I was a determined ill nigga, dirty shoes and Hilfiger
Homie helped me out 'cause his boy was a drug dealer
Now I'm flyin? high ?cause my gifts grew wings
And now I'm flyin? down like the coupe grew wings

Kells and Ross on the Hollywood scene
Red carpet and we smellin? like green
Now I floss ?cause I got paid off
Collabo was the Hip Hop and R&B boss, oh!

Fast life, I live, big cars, big cribs
Speedin?, I'm speedin?
I can't stop, it's all I know
From a youngin? I was taught get doe
I'm speedin?, I'm speedin?, I'm speedin?

E-Class, I think somebody followin? me
Meet me at the helipad, Mickey Beach
I'm worth fifteen million baby
I'm tryin' to blow it all in one week!

Fuckin' wit you, Triple see?s, it?s the Boss
(I'm speedin I'm speedin')
I'm a fly away on you haters
I done came up so fast
Movies, endorsements, films
(I'm speedin I'm speedin')
We own things, Boss!
Aboard a train
I met a dame
She was a hipster
Man a real gone dame
She wasn't pretty
For New York City
As we strut down on that ol' fairlane
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
Get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
Get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
I made a stop round Albuquerque
She must'a thought I was real gone jerk
Got off the train at El Paso
A' looking so good I couldn't let her go
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
Yesterday, forget it
Tomorrow is nada
The present is right here, through the breath, watch it
Atheist Jesus piece, hanging on a cross
We sit and discuss God on lawn chairs
About how we got here
What it is, what it isn't, shit
Fate vs. fate, scrimmaging with coincidence
Leave out the market and hold up on the business end
Focus on the genuine, and everything else, you can shed the skin
I was a couple moves away from being dead
In that ER overdosing, eyes bleeding red
I fell in love, made an album, got a buzz
Lost it all, sobered up and guess what?
Now we meet again
And now I'm back, finally just laughin'
Expectations are resentments waiting to happen
Studying the Dharma, Karma, Vipassana practice
Bahá'u'lláh, Buddah, God to the mountaintop and I'm traveling
Learning, yes, reflecting on what matters
People, impermanence, lack of attachments
It's space and time, a couple man-made distractions
The measure of a spirit that no human can ever capture
Church, ha, this booth is my Vatican
I don't control life, but I control how I react to it
Student of the breath, break beats and balancing
Desire vs. truth until I finally find happiness
I was put here to do something before I'm lying in that casket
I'd be lying on the beat if I said I didn't know what that is
The world's a stage and we play a character, I found him
It took me 20 something years and a bunch of shitty soundchecks
I'm not gonna be content, till I find gratitude
Regardless of my sales or the record deals that they're handing you
If the next generation takes a legacy in samples
You will have a bunch of mp3's of misled kids to pass 'em to
I use my veins to create the color I paint from
Delve into self until my heart becomes my paint brush
I told my momma I'm not stopping till my names up
Thinkin' those comments on that blog is gonna save us
Searching for everything but God to validate ya
Get insecure and then we start blaming the haters
Used to look to women to fill a part of me that was vacant
Truth, the only thing that I ever used in moderation
So I stare into this paper instead of sitting at a cubicle
Take all the ugly shit inside and try to make it beautiful
Use the cement from rock bottom and make it musical
So that people can relate to where I've been
Where I'm going, what I've seen, what I've heard
From the guts, fuck the glory
Just a person on a porch putting it all into recording
Many in my past and many that came before me
I just keep walking my path and I'm blessed to share my story

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling raw
I'm in the prime of my life
Let's make some music, make some money
Find some models for wives
I'll move to Paris, shoot some 

[Censored]

[Censored] with the stars
You man the island and the 

[Censored]
And the elegant cars

[Chorus]
This is our decision, to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?
Forget about our mothers and our friends
We're fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend

[Verse 2]
I'll miss the playgrounds
And the animals and diggin' up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother
And the weight of the world
I'll miss my sister, miss my father
Miss my dog and my home
Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom
And the time spent alone

[Chorus]
But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten, life can always start up anew
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models, everything must run its course
We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end
We were fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend

[Outro]
I said yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: LIl Wayne]
Got me a caddy and a trunk full of luggage in december, december
If it go through trial i'll be missing every christmas like forever, forever
Let's go!

[Bridge 1: Lil Wayne]
Sometimes I feel like givin' up (No, No)
But she call and I can't stop from pickin' up the phone (But)

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Oooh, oh, the love, the love, the love, the love

Feel like flowers in the morning after very bad weather
Out my mind all the time but the sign said take a new direction, direction
Let's go!

[Bridge 2: Lil Wayne]
Sometimes I feel like givin' up (No, No)
Then she fall and I can't stop from pickin' up (Ooh)

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Oooh, oh, the love, the love, the love, the love
Oooh, you know, you know, you know

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
They say she bad for a nigga and I know it
But it seem like I can't keep my mind off her
And she a bad mothafucka' when she make that kitty purr
And that ass real soft like fur
Word, I'm trippin'
No suitcase no luggage
Goin' back in forth like Aaliyah I'm buggin'
Her good love got me runnin' back
But she give me head, make my eyes roll back
Gotta kick it like a bad habit
Yeah I'm addicted i'm her addict
Try to make a left turn, gotta go another route
But I make a U-turn now i'm back in front her house
Yeah, all my niggas say I'm crazy
I might be crazy but she's amazing
Yeah, all my niggas say I'm crazy
I might be crazy but she's amazing

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah

Hit the town up, I'm passin a dufflebag
Let the niggas know I'll be back for the dufflebag

Honey, put the money in the bag, don't look up

Open up the belly on that new Mercedes
Got that bitch lookin' like she straight havin' a baby
But that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a muthafuckin' Cash Money millionaire

[Intro - Hook]
I said, ooh, girl, shock me like an electric feel
Baby girl, turn me on with your electric feel

[Instrumental Bridge]
All along the western front, people line up to receive
She got the power in her hand to shock you like you won't believe
Saw her in the Amazon with the voltage running through her skin
Standing there with nothing on, she gonna teach me how to swim

[Hook]
I said, ooh, girl, shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl, turn me on with your electric feel
I said, ooh, girl, shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl, turn me on with your electric feel

All along the eastern shore, put your circuits in the sea
This is what the world is for making electricity
You can feel it in your mind, oh you can do it all the time
Plug it in, change the world, you are my electric girl

[Hook]
I said, ooh, girl, shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl, turn me on with your electric feel
I said, ooh, girl, shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl, turn me on with your electric feel

Do what you feel now
Electric feel, now
Do what you feel now
Electric feel, now
Do what you feel now
Electric feel, now
Do what you feel now
Electric feel, now
You must be living in a fantacy
You've got me dreaming now I believe
And there I saw you
Looking oh so right
Working the dance floor
You superstar of the night
You take me up you take me down
Shake your body to the ground
How do you do the things you do
I know it must be true that you

You pull me closer like I knew you would
I try to please you the way you think I should

You make me feel I'm in control
You take my body and my soul
You fill me up
This empty cup
I just can't get enough of you
Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out

Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa
Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out

I've been told do what you do with it
We keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

Who the hell is hounding you in the BMW?
How the hell he find you? 147'd you
The feds gon' get you, pull the strings on the hood
One paranoid youth blazin' through the hood
Who the hell is hounding you in the BMW?

Suck a dick'll help you
Don't let 'em get to you, if he's got one you get two
Backstab your crew, sell it I could sell you
They say
Rivers gonna run though, work is gonna save you
Pray and you will pull through, suck a dick'll help you
Don't let 'em get to you, if he's got one you get two
Backstab your crew, sell it I could sell you

[Verse 1]
Cause I'm the best
Bitches call me no less
I stay grounded in the age of unrest

While I'm chillin'
Must confess
It's just important that I get this off my chest:

Every time I hit refresh, reboot, reload
I need to refill, rebuild, react

A hustler is a female version of a hustler
So come here little soldier
Get you very faster

This is my vent
I scream it down my celly
When you start makin' me peanut butter jelly
It may be wrong, but it's just sometimes scary
Every time I scream it out
You don't seem to hear me

Terrapin Station
Terrapin Part One
Lady With a Fan/Terrapin Station/Terrapin/Terrapin Transit/At a Siding/Terrapin Flyer/Refrain
Terrapin Station - Lady With a Fan
Let my inspiration flow in token rhyme, suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake you, till my tale is told and done
While the firelight's aglow, strange shadows from the flames will grow
Till things we've never seen will seem familiar
Shadows of a sailor, forming winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady many years ago
Here beside him stands a man, a soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights, but lost at love
While the story teller speaks, a door within the fire creaks;
Suddenly flies open, and a girl is standing there
Eyes alight, with glowing hair, all that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it, in the lion's den
Which of you to gain me, tell, will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you if you will not take the chance
The sailor gave at least a try, the soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength, and not disaster
The sailor, coming out again, the lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today. You decide if he was wise
The story teller makes no choice. Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light, and not to master
Since the end is never told, we pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will return, but he cannot be bought or sold
Terrapin Station
Inspiration, move me brightly. Light the song with sense and color;
Hold away despair, more than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast, statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb, to get to Terrapin
Counting stars by candlelight, all are dim but one is bright;
The spiral light of Venus, rising first and shining best
On, from the northwest corner, of a brand new crescent moon
While crickets and cicadas sing, a rare and different tune
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon, Terrapin Station
And I know we'll get there soon, Terrapin Station
I can't figure out, Terrapin, if it's the end or beginning, Terrapin
But the train's put it's brakes on, Terrapin
And the whistle is screaming, TERRAPIN
Terrapin Station - At the Siding
While you were gone, these faces filled with darkness
The obvious was hidden. With nothing to believe in
Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain
You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again, for good or ill again
Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out

Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa
Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out

I've been told do what you do with it
We keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

When the roll is called up yonder
I hope you see me there

It's in the water, it's where you came from
It's in the water, it's where you came from

When the crowd begins to wonder
And they cry to see your face

It's in the water, it's in the story, of where you came from
Your sons and daughters, in all their glory, it's gonna shape her
And when they clash and come together, and start rising
Just drink the water where you came from, where you came from

So the roll it was called from yonder
Never sold yourself away

It's in the water, it's in the story, it's where you came from
The sons and daughters, in all their glory, it's gonna shape them
And when they clash and come together, and start rising
Just drink the water, where you came from, where you came from
And when they clash and come together, and start rising
Just drink the water, where you came from, where you came from
(i'm fresh...)
(yeah, ryan lewis...)

If it ain't fresh then you ain't gettin' play in my tape deck
Way back, i used to rock the hat with the suede strap at ABC's
Bought my food from the A-rabs
Played craps on corners with the OG slain gat
Uh, cross colours i'm the boss of the playground
I hit you on the nuts cos i know how to play house
The 8-ounce baby from eighty-four then grew up
Cleaner than my Easter suit was with my shoes buffed
Don't step on my new ones
These reeboks beat blocks, you give 'em a few pumps
Baby while you're at it too boo boo
She came from a new school and all i wanna do is my zoom zoom (all I wanna do is my zoom zoom)
My uncle stayed faded like crew cuts
But i was too young to know the what's-what and the who's-who
'round here, they could give a fuck if you got props
You get clowned for rockin' British Knights to the sock hop
The BK stood for "black kids," the hood was crackin
And poison was on everybody's tracklist
Spandex was in fashion, back then
And bad chicks had tracks in that lasted
Before CD's, and internet the kings was in effect
Ya fiends wasn't gettin' respect

[respect...]
Before MP3s and CD-J's we pop in a tape cassette
Chain on my chest, I'm fresh

[fresh...]

Let's take it back, b-b-b-back to the days of AC/DC back in black
Gimme a mullet .. a 1984 Chevrolet
Alright I'm lyin' I was listenin' to rap

[ra-rap ra-rap]

Oshkosh bagosh, stone wash, so hard
Overalls hung, one strap on, one off
Eatin' on my cold lunch, grabbin' on both nuts
Mama wanted jerry curl: fuck this bowl cut
Ice cube's got one
Quick in my walkman
Blowin' on the cartridge
Hypercolour: "awesome!"
Cube's in my pocket and i'm outta here I'm bouncin'
And sam goody's not gettin' shit from my allowance

Daydreamin' in class, no i'm zonin' out and
Rosie perez's titties are right where my mouth is
Who says that white men can't jump?.. they were hella wrong!
A'ight they were right, but i was really good at tetherball
Before the days of gettin' drunk at kegs
We were bumpin' some jodicie and dry-humpin' legs
That's right: i was born in the '80s
Pimpin' adventure shrined above my babysitter

House party? crackin
Humpty dance? crackin
Never find the baby: david bowie, labyrinth
Why don't you reminisce and bring it back, rap shit
Dodge caravan, humpin' in the back: classic

Before CDs and internet the kings was in effect
Ya fiends wasn't gettin' respect
Before MP3s and CD-Js, we pop in a tape cassette
Chain on my chest, i'm fresh

Stranded in the spooky town
Stop lights are swaying and the phone lines are down
The floor is crackling cold
She took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun

Driven by the strangle of vein
Showing no mercy, I'd do it again
Open up your eye
You keep on crying, baby, I'll bleed you dry
The skies, they blink at me
I see a storm bubbling up from the sea

And it's coming closer

You shimmy shook my bone
Leaving me stranded, all in love on my own
Do you think of me?
Where am I now, baby, where do I sleep?
Feels so good, but I'm old
Two thousand years of chasing, taking its toll
And it's coming closer
Say...
Can you see
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes & bright stars
Through the perilous fight, oh Lord
Oh, the fight
O'er the ramparts we watched were so galantly, yeah
Streaming
& the rockets red glare!
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof
Through the night
That our flag
Was still there
Oh, say
Does thy star-spangled banner
Yet wave
For the land
Of the free!
& the home
Of the...
Home of the brave
Oh, Lord
Whooo!

[Intro]
I see you
And I just wanna dance with you

[Verse 1]
Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you (You, you)
Public display of affection (Ooh)
Feels like no one else in the room (But you)

[Pre-Chorus]
We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking (We keep on rocking)
We keep on rocking (Keep on rocking)
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watchin' (They keep watchin')
Keep watching, feels like the crowd is saying

[Verse 2]
The center of attention (Do you feel this?)
Even when we're up against the wall
You got me in a crazy position (Yeah)
If you're on a mission (Uh-huh), you got my permission (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking (We keep on rocking)
We keep on rocking
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watching (They keep watching)
Feels like the crowd is saying

Early mornin'
Alright, I was a little late last night
Got a little messy
Early mornin'
Can't be like that anymore, no

[Chorus]
I was shaking my ass in the streets till mornin'
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early mornin'
Passed out on the couch, I'm yawning
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early mornin'

[Verse 1]
Met a dark dude, kind of dark hair
When he walked up Tony grabbed him
But I liked him, told him "Come here"
Kind of cool
Baby, we can make plans
Where you live? Does your mama live there?
We can hook up at the hotel
He's down so I told him, "Let's go"
What happened next, guess what?
You don't wanna know

[Chorus]
I was shaking my ass in the streets till mornin'
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early mornin'
Passed out on the couch I'm yawning
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early mornin'

[Verse 2]
Oh, in love
I went out with my girl Jen
And we called up Gabe and his friends
He was talking bout hitting up show
So I said, what the hell
Let's go
Got up, got on the dance floor
Hooked up with a guy named Joe
When the music was fast and slow
But what happened next, guess what?
You don't wanna know

[Chorus]
I was shaking my ass in the streets till mornin'
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early mornin'
Passed out on the couch I'm yawning
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early mornin'

[Hook]
Call all your boys
Call all your girls
Call all your friends
Let's do it again
Let's do it again
Yes, early mornin'
Yes, can't keep doing this

[Breakdown]
I'll light your fire
Your one desire
Pull on me, baby
And I'll take you higher
(I wanna get with you)
You should try her
So come over here and let's go so

[Chorus]
I was shaking my ass in the streets till mornin'
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early mornin'
Passed out on the couch, I'm yawning
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early mornin'

[Hook]
Call all your boys
Call all your girls
Call all your friends
Let's do it again
Let's do it again

[Outro]
Stop till the early mornin'
Stop till the early mornin'
Anyone who ever loved
Could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed
Could look at me
And know I dream of you
Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You, you couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you hurt me
And be so untrue
What am I to do
Every time you go away
I always say it's goodbye dear
Loving you the way I do
I take you back
Without you, I'd die dear
Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You, you couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you've hurt me
And be so untrue
So what can I do
Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you hurt me
And be so untrue
Anyone who had a heart
Would love me too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me in her arms
And, and always love me, and love me, love me
Why won't you
Anyone who had a heart
Would love me too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me
Anyone would take me
Why, why won't you
No one's gonna love ya like I do
No one's gonna make you feel the way I do
Yeah
No one
No one, no one, no one, no one
Gulliver's gone to the final command of his master
His watery eyes had washed all the hills with his laughter
And the seasons can change all the light from the grey to the dim
But the light in his eyes will see no more so bright
As the sheep that he locked in the pen

There's four feet of ground in front of the barn
That's sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm
But now it lies empty so cold and so bare
Gulliver's gone but his memory lies there

By passing the doors of his life was a stage I remember
And in later years he would cease to bare teeth to a stranger
For sentiment touched him as cyclamen holds him
And later men came from the town
Who said clear the child this won't take a while
And Gulliver's gone with the dawn
Well, I've been searchin', I've been searchin'
I've been searchin' every week and day
Well, I've been searchin', I've been searchin'
I've been searchin' every which way
Like the North West Mountain you know I'll bring her in someday
Well, if I have to climb a mountain, you know I will
And if I have to swim a river, you know I will
No matter where she goes, Oh Lord, you know I will
And if I have to climb a mountain, you know I will
And if I have to swim a river, you know I will
I know she's hiding up there
If you marry him don't you know I'll find her, child I will
Well Sherlock Holmes, Sam Spade gonna put that child on me
No matter where she's hiding
She gonna tell me you're coming
I'm gonna walk right down that street just like bulldog jumping
Cause I've been searchin', I've been searchin'
I've been searchin' every which way
Like the North West Mountain you know I'll bring her in someday
Bip bop be-bop bop

[Intro]
Baby I'm sorry
Can't you find a way to somehow forgive me
I never meant to touch you

[Verse 1]
Somebody take my hand off
Cause I never meant to hit you, babe
I know I don't deserve another chance
But I had to say it anyway

[Chorus]
I can't sleep
I can't think
I can't eat
I'm so weak
And I won't breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
It was such a silly move I made
On the only one who truly loves me
Took advantage of the love you gave
And turned around the truth
Now look at me
I can't sleep
I can't think
I can't eat
I'm so weak
And I can't breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 2]
Now I'm the nigga that you read about
In those freaky magazines
Sometimes I can't believe my ears
And what they say about me
Who gives a fuck about what they think
Is what my OG used to say
You just keep on doing your own thing boy
And sing your praises up that way

[Chorus]
And you'll sleep
And you'll think
And you'll eat
Won't be weak
And you will breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
You will breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
You will breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
You'll breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
You'll breathe
You'll sleep
You'll think
Whoo
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Tonight I'm here
Feel the beat of the drum, gotta keep it that bass

I'm up against the speaker, tryna take on the music
It's like a competition, me against the beat

You changed that right away, baby

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore (Anymore)

Found another place to stay, another home

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore (Love don't live here anymore)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore (Anymore)

Why'd ya have to go away? (Away)
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love?

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore (Love don't live here anymore)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore (Anymore)

The definition of a hotti
R. Kelly is born into the 90's
You know what I'm saying
With the new shebang swing
The definition of a hotti

This track is going out to all the hotties out there
You know what I'm saying
To all the fellas that don't know what a hotti is
I'm here to define the definition
So check this out

Yo here's the definition of a hotti
A girl with Noxema skin and a V-8 body
She can relate with your wildest dreams
By wearing a short skirt or nice tight jeans
She'll put you in shock
And clean you up with clorox
And then you'll say
Damn, the hotti body is bare box
Lipstick shining
Earings glistening
Yo listen to me
As I kick the ballistics
Last night
I went to a club, to a club
To see if I could have myself some fun, yeah
All the ladies
Standing on the wall, standing on the wall
I'm not leaving
Till I catch me one, till I catch me one

Cuties, all the cuties
So fine, so fine
We could spend some time
You are, you are
The one, the one for me
Can we have some fun

[Chorus]
Hey Hotti
Definition of a Hotti
Hey Hotti
Come on yeah
(x4)

Don't too many fellas turn her on
But if you're kicking the funkies
Then her word is born
Its best to blend in with the program, yo
Play the same game
And then say thanks ma'am
Some hotties like to pose
But they warm you up
Just like a hot buttered roll
Some hotties don't carry a purse
Yeah it gets worse
Check the second verse

Last night
I took her out, I took her out
To see what we could get into
What we could get into
She showed me what she was all about
Hotti go it going on
What's a man to do, what's a man to do

[Chorus]
Hotties play games
Like when you got with your fame
They sit back
Act like they don't even know your name
Playing it smooth
Until the very last minute
Drive up in a Benzo huh
Yeah they'll jump in it
And satisfy you like Snickers
You see them with their girlfriends
You can't get with em
The H O T T I
Is on a mission
Fellas
I Hope you're listening
Yo Yo

[Fade Out]
Ugh, yo, yo yo
I'm a bad what? bout to get a maniped
I'm the big bad wolf and your granny dead
Eventhough I'm in mexico
I rep New York like Plexico
Look, switch my name, now I'm celebrating Hannukah
Lewinski bitches, young money Monica
I been hot since hedgehog, Sonic the
So could you pass me the keys to the Tonica
I mean Tonka, That's the truck bitches
F*ck you and f*ck all of you f*ck bitches
Matter of fact, put some sprinkles on my cupcakes
And get ready to put your dimples in this duct tape
Let us pray
Oh, uh, please
Don't feel like you can't participate if you're not Christian
Cause this is a prayer for all faiths, so
Dear Jesus of Nazareth
First of all, I'd like to thank you for calling yourself Jesus of Nazareth, it's sort of like the Lord of the Rings or something
"I am Jesus of Nazareth, son of Orflec the butcher"
We know, Lord
From John 3:16, that you so loved the world that you sent your only son to die for us, your only son
But at the same time, we're all your children, so in your eyes, we're a bunch of girls
So help us as we struggle with the temptations of lesbianism. Amen

People come to me all the time, all the time
They say the same thing, you know
"Bo, you're an artist; how do we fix Africa?"

I read recently that there are over 22 million people living with HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa
I know, it's a Snapple fact

How do we fix it? How do we fix it? This....
Because laughter, laughter is the best medicine, you know, besides
Medicine
I just wanna live my life because I wanna, and I need to
So don't be trying to steal my light because you don't
Know me, don't pretend to
I've been busy on my grind, just like you, I've been trying
I've even shed a tear or two, I swear to you, I ain't lying

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel the world is after me
Trying to get to me, trying to stop what I do
Because I'm the only one that looks out for me
Can be me and walk in my shoes
Everday there's something that's new to me
I just, gotta breathe, I don't, know about you
But I'm the only one that looks out for me
Can be me, and... walk in my shoes
It ain't easy being Emily
But I don't want to change my name
Because I ain't got to, and I don't need to
So I'm a do what I do, because I ain't gotta live for you
But I'm a keep up with mine, keep on striving and surviving no

[Repeat Chorus]
See everybodys got their own problems that their going through
I take it day by day, it's only thing that I can do
So I live for me as you live for you
But you can't be me unless you walk in my shoes

[Chorus x2]
Walk walk, walk walk, walk walk - walk in my shoes 

[x 2]

[Chorus:]

Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch

Wassap wassap
Real nigga wassup

Wassap, wassap
I wanted to be a physicist when I was younger, and I wanted to also be a comedian. But, only one of those sort of worked out, so I'd like to try to do both, though, now in a bit that I call "Theoretical Dick Jokes." It goes like this:

My penis is so small that I have trouble finding it cause it's so greatly influenced by one mechanical fluctuation in the fabric of space-time. And, when I'm having intercourse with a woman, she can only know where my penis is or how fast it's moving because it's small enough and light enough to be fully-governed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. "I've got an eating disorder." Yeah,.... more like nutritional entropy. So....

I never said it was funny, so stop staring at me

Segues are weird

How old is too old to stop believing in like the Tooth Fairy? .... like twelve?

I have a cousin who is eighteen. .... yeah. .... still believes in gay marriage

I know what you guys are thinking: "Oh, Bo, you tackle such taboo subjects. You know. Is there anything off-limits.... anything you don't find funny.... anything that you think is too sacred to laugh at?" And, the truth is, there is:

.... White people

I think we've been through enough....

I find numbers to be fascinating and, more specifically than numbers, I find statistics so...enlightening. You know.... thought-provoking even. So, I've gathered some here, and these are all 100% true. When you leave this theatre and enter the world devoid of art, you can check these, and they will come back because they are true. So, I don't want to blow your mind or anything but maybe you'll hear one of these and go, "Whoa, I never thought of that!" You know? So, these are my statistics:

Approximately 33.33% of the Jonas Brothers have diabetes
One in every four kids with the initials A.D.D. actually has it, and four out of four kids with the initials A.D.H.D. has an annoying, self-righteous mother who wouldn't just shut the fuck up and take her husband's last name

Here's a fun one. One of every fourty-four U.S. presidents can dunk. It's fucking Millard Filmoore, you racists

The average child of Sarah Palin has 46.2 chromosomes

Can't get angry at the numbers, you know what I mean?

Here's a really interesting one. The average person has one fallopian tube

20% of the Jackson Five...too soon...

The average penis length is 5-and-a-half inches, and finally, the average penis length of a man who Googles "average penis length" is 3-and-a-half inches

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Let's hit the sweet spot away, way, way
I, I'm ready to go, I want candy tonight
Let's hit the sweet spot

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Yeah, I wanna hit the spot and make you hot

Uh, don’t you get me started, hit the afterparty
All the night, to a rave to freak that I take you home
Make you moan, watch the throne
And yeah lil mama, I’m the king of these kicks, gotta love it
If you want it you can have it, no question
Been a whole lot of rubbin' and touchin'

I’ll be the first to give your body sweet justice
So pack a luggage and let’s, let’s...

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Hey, I coulda been born any place in the world
When I turned a day old
But a brother gotta pass to the block
That's known for more than legos
Not a guap on the pay-roll
But I got, got, got that playdough
For the hot hot girls on the table
See, their lock locks wrapped in halos
Good good money, hood money
That's where you could money, gotta M.I.Yayo
Full of green but it's not for the bagel
Everything that I want to be labeled
On the first 48 watch cable
Where they ride 28's unstable
You don't want this up yo' nasal
You ain't never been street, that's fatal
My city where I be, can't change it
See them walk, see them talk that language
Ard denim louis belt still hanging
Wear a flag, but I, but I ain't bangin'
305 the way I ride, the way I vibe
I love it every day outside
And I can't lie the sunny skies, the hunnies right, the money's right

[Verse 2: Brisco]
I came from the bottom of the beaca, and got hard as I got older they say I started with some sand then I shook it to a boulder
And that's how I handle business
I'm just tryna reach my quota
When I come up on my stunnin', do exactly what I told ya
All I know is dough and yayo, I receive it by the freight loads
The coast guards cool, I just break 'em off some c-notes
And my Haitian friends told me it's gone be a nice summer
Time to tally up the books and calculate the numbas
Dade county the M.I.Yayo
Them goons on my line and they don't move until I say so
And I wouldn't be shit without this coke and this weed
And this crack and these pills and these 305 streets Brisco

My stick on the tablem counting the profit from the whole pie
Team with my own nine's, Cheddah we ran through
Spook to ever rap on these shells that how they jam fool
I fly to Haiti in person, and then we meet up
Touch on several topics from work to doing clean up
It's dirty out here in the south, but that's nothin' new
Besides, I got goons in the hood that need something to do

Hey, walk out the house with my swagger
Hop in there with dough, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious

Hotter than cajun, girl won't you move a lil' closer
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage

You wanna shoot like a gun outta holster
Tell me whatever and I'll be your gopher

You spin my head right round, right round

The stars up above that play with Laughing Sam's dice
They make us feel that it was the world for us
The Zodiac grass and dreams will come through the skies
It will happen soon, for you

Alright now, everybody just keep it together now

Thank you, thank you
And now watch me ride

I'd like to say that there will be no throwing cigarette butts out the window
No throwing cigarette butts out the window thank you, thank you

Out of sight, really out of sight
And if you look to the left you will see Mars
I hope you brought your parachute with you

[Outro]
Hey look out!
Look out for that door
Don't open that door
Don't open that door
Oh well
That's the way it goes
Now we're coming through the Milky Way section
Green cornflakes and stuff like that, the Milky Way
Yeah, everything's alright and out of sight
If you look around you, you will see a few minds being blown
Exactly - assembly, baby
I hope you enjoy your ride - I am

Which one of y'all, which, which one
Which, which one of y'all
Which one of y'all goin' home with Trigga?

I see you at the club, ooh, shawty
Walkin' past a nigga lookin' at me all naughty
Then I said, "Baby, wassup?"
Reach for that hand shake, got a hug

Bottles of the Ace got me with a lil' buzz
Up in VIP with all my thug niggas
You leaned over and said you want me

Girl, when the valet pull the Benz up
Off to the crib, shawty, where we gonna end up
Girl, sit back, relax, hold up
Let me turn the radio on

Girl, when I get you to the crib
(Get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
(Upstairs to the bed)
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think

You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex

Put the code in the gate, pull up to the driveway
Said she like the way I touch her, listenin' to usher
(Yup)
I got a confession
(What?)
Know we 'bout to sin, but your body is a blessing
(Father, forgive me)

Girl, can we take it up stairs
(Up, up, up stairs)
My bed's waitin' there
(Waitin' there, yeah)

All I want to do is
(All I wanna do)
Is give you all of me
Won't you give me all of you?
I want your body like right now
(Right now)
You know I live a magnum lifestyle
(Lifestyle)
Baby, turn the lights down
And I'mma turn you on

Girl, when I get you to the crib
(Get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
(Upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think

And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think

You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
'Cause I do it like I did
You gonna think I invented sex

It's a celebration clap, clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of Moscato
For the girl who's a student and the friend who's a model
Finish the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card and baby you can max this out

Show me where your tats is
Show me where you heads at, maybe I can grasp it
If you ever come up with a question, you should ask it
Caught up on your ex still? I can get you past it

Yeah, and your friends all suggest
What's the chance of this nigga being better than the rest?
Just tell 'em you appreciate the help
But you just got to know for yourself

Girl, when I get you to the crib
(Get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
(Upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think

Girl, when I pull back them sheets

Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think

You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
Uh uh oh ahhhhhhh radio killa
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love

You said you changed, but still nothing
You're still the same, I'm just a part time lover

And I'm the blame, should've went away
But yet I stayed, with a part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out on the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

I left the state, changed everything
No more 818, for the part time lover

What goes around, comes back around
And then you get what you deserve
You part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out
On the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

Watch these red bottoms, and the back of my jeans
Watch me go, bye baby
Don't know what you got until it's gone

Tail Lights is all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit that driveway

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)

Uh uh oh ahhhhhhh radio killa
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love

You said you changed, but still nothing
You're still the same, I'm just a part time lover

And I'm the blame, should've went away
But yet I stayed, with a part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out on the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

I left the state, changed everything
No more 818, for the part time lover

What goes around, comes back around
And then you get what you deserve
You part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out
On the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

Watch these red bottoms, and the back of my jeans
Watch me go, bye baby
Don't know what you got until it's gone

Tail Lights is all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit that driveway

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)

Watch me walk it out
Walk it out, walk it out
Walk this right up out the house
Walk it out watch me walk it out
Walk it out walk this right up out the house
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)

You little ugly ass nigga!

Nothin' can save ya
Ain't no love, $hort (4x)

Now mickity mic down
Guns out, mothafuckas
Lowin' the holes

Punks get on tapes
And they sound so real
But real niggas don't get in court and squeal
Yeah, regard all that punk ass Racia shit
Got on the stand and ran your mouth
Like a bitch, little snitch
Pooh-Man did it! Pooh-Man did it!
He made me with it!
Court is in session, $hort
And you've been indicted
Hoe trusta Oakland busta
And you gets no love from the gutter
See we remember when you had to have
A baserock cawy and a nice hot bath
Smokin' and chokin', Sir Too $hort
Just thinkin' about the day before
See you never shouldn't fuck
With the real killa
I goes deep on you dopefiend nigga
Got on the mic and called me a punk
And funk is what you want
So there it is, junk
Dirty, tired, fucked around
And get my foot off in his ass
Let's hood ride, mob, fuck talkin' bad
No punk let?s me check myself, partner
I ain't gonna bust ya
I rather ride up and drop ya
But the rappin' is weak shit
And I'm down with this street shit
And you ain't shit but a weak bitch
The ugliest nigga in rap
Try to cap on the nigga
From the mothafuckin' hood
So when I see you it's all good

Too $hort...
Nothin' can save ya
Ain't no love, $hort (4x)

Ant Banks: read this...

I boarded to your ass last year
But you didn't hear me dough
It's 94 and Banks need a little more
Lips lookin' hell of luscious
Digidy down goes my zipper
Nigga, you can suck this
And you must like slurpin' dicks
Because you ridin' on $hort's tip
Like a jockin' little bitch
Ridin' around in your too-$hort-hand-me-down
I left the Dangerous Crew
And that's why you're clownin' now
The bigidy Banksta ain't no gigidy gigidy gangsta
When the truth comes out you ain't shit but a pranksta
Try to hang in my hood lookin' out of place
With that blank ass look on your face:
(What should I do? What should I do?)
Now get in where you fit in, chunk
Can't hang on the block
Cause you ain't shit but a punk
So I ain't givin' no rule
To assume you want some mothafuckin' funk
Then bring it to the crew
So bring it on if your ass want to trip
And to this hollow-tip, bitch
Blast that ass, yes I would
Cause on the streets, nigga, it's all good
Too $hort...
Nothin' can save ya
Ain't no love, $hort

Beep, beep, beep
Oh, there goes my pager
And it's your bitch, yo, I think I best to fade her
Took her to the motel parking lot
Little light skinned bitch got just a little too hot
It's goin' down, pannies comin' off
Another tramp bitch got automatically toasted
I think you found out and got jealous
Cause I was diggin' your bitch
And runnin' back tellin' all the fellas
But you took her home
And wanted to marry the bitch
I would dig her in this, mister
And bury the bitch
Stop spendin' all your cash and fix your teeth
$hort Dog must like bein' ugly
Came at a nigga wrong
Little cavity creep walkin' around with Nikes on
Bitch ass nigga ain't got no heart
Be ready to finish anythin' your punk ass started
Cause I did funk with the best
So when you ridin' in your lexus
Nigga, put on the vest
And stay the fuck out my hood
Cause death is a factor and it's all good
Too $hort...
Nothin' can save ya
Ain't no love, $hort (4x)

I like girls that like girls
So they have an open invitation to my world
If you know one, I am open to referrals
So go and tell a girl to tell a girl to tell a girl (Girl girl girl)
I like girls that like me
So you and me and her can have a fun menag-a-three
Let's party in the club, in the whip or in the sheets
Doesn't matter how we party, long as I am in-between

[Chorus]
There's something about her, there's something about you
There's something about us, that makes me just want to
So we can have fun fun fun fun fun
'Cause 2 is better than 1, 1, 1, 1
There's something about her, there's something about you
There's something about us, that makes me just want to
So we can have fun fun fun fun fun
'Cause 2 is better than 1, 1, 1, 1

[Verse 2: Ya Boy]
Pink ring on, he's so pimpin'
Louis V on, she's so temptin'
When I met her, she was like he different
Just try it, girl, stop trippin'
Turn the club to a bedroom, you and her, we got leg room
Did you hear what I said, boo? I want you, and your friend too
We can do all the above, ya'll gonna make a nigga fall in love
BFFs and it's all because, you both use me like a party drug
Now tell me how you want YB, grab her arm and just stay by me
I'll show you how to have some fun
The number 1 rule is 2's better than 1

[Chorus]
There's something about her, there's something about you
There's something about us, that makes me just want to
So we can have fun fun fun fun fun
'Cause 2 is better than 1, 1, 1, 1

[Young Jeezy:]
This is my muh fucking house, hey I'm by the front door
Here about a blond haired bitch named Sisco
She'll do anything for daddy man the bitch go
Tell 'em what the doormat read baby {Big blow}
Uh, Pyrex and a digi scale
Fuck gloves I got gay all in my fingernails
And I can leave a set of white fingerprints
Chris Tucker, Larenz Tate, Dead Presidents
Dead white boys spread across the coffee table
I don't know maybe I'll start me up a record label
Fuck it get high and call what's her name
She like to play this little game called fuck a brain
Lord when you talk them numbers sound sophisticated
It ain't nothing even the pit-bull's affiliated
Yeah, the trespasser's gettin' bust on
G shit even the coupe's got Chucks on

[Snoop Dogg:]
Yeah
This is my mother fuckin' house nigga
This is where I do it at
You got a problem with that
Yeah big dog nigga
If you ain't a big dog stay on the porch nigga
Dog house or nothing
Dog house everything nigga
I gotta whole house trap house and a flat
I'm on parole bitch so I need my pistol back
These rap niggas is too soft
I built this from the ground, the pound up
Until I knock your roof off
New boss Snoop off and on and
Heed him in the morning catch him while he yawning
My bitch is on the phone and my homies 'bout to zone in
Cracky smacky dippy whippy habitual potential
Strip for your credentials
Mental unessential, shit's official like a referee with a whistle
Nah my nigga shit's official, like a Jihad, Muslim with a missile
Catch me in the air we close to the nickel block
Nigga went platinum but I still serve that nickel rock
Hard times bad times fuck doing jail time
Cook it up rock it up bag it up and sell mines

[E-40:]
This my mother fuckin' house
Take your mother fuckin' shoes off when you step in my house partner
Matter of fact take your hat off too
Nigga this the round table nigga
If you can't stand the heat get your punk ass up out the kitchen
I'm in the mother fuckin' room

This is my house in the middle of the trap
Open this door I'm sweating like I ran a fucking lap
Customers on hold stressing they keep coming back
3 6 5 2 4 7 I got Jumbo Jacks
Would you like your cheese with that
Yeah I like my cheese with that
Crack in the pot, round the clock
Open all night hitchin' blocks
Serving that doop stuck in my loop
Pitching that tragic all in the traffic
Me and my group, me and my cabinet
Fillin' the coop, pick it and bag it
I got the key to this spot break in, you gonna get popped
Fuck around and get molly whopped in here
Better not attract no cops
I got another round chopped up in here
Who want what I got in stock?
Not from Atlanta but I got heart
Chickens birdies quails, baking soda scales
Heavy weights exhale, 5 star hotels
I'm a grinder about my grit
Trying to increase my profit quick
50 thou under the couch
This is my mother fucking house
This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking
This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house
This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking
This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house
This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking
This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house
This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking
This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house

[Repeat and out]
From factory to field
How many tears must fall
Down there below
Nothing is moving

Woohoo

I might just stop needing you
I might just stop loving you
I demand a better future

I demand a better future
For I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future
(I demand a better future)
When we talk
We talk to you
When we walk
We walk to you

From factory to field
How many tears must fall
Down there below
Nothing is moving

Please don't tear this world asunder
Please take back this fear we're under
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop wanting you

Please make sure we get tomorrow
All this pain, and all this sorrow
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop needing you
I might just stop needing you

Give my children sunny smiles

I demand a better future
For I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future
(I demand a better future)

[Chorus: Rakim]
Do You Ever Think
What Life Would Be
Where You Will Go
After you Die?
Do You Ever Think
What Life Would Be
Where You Will Go
After you Die?

[Verse 1: Rakim]
Do you ever sit back and get a little too high
Start thinking what happens to you when you die?
Does your soul rest where your coffin is
Or is death just a metamorphosis?
Does life go on in the mental form
If we live a good life will we get reborn?
Is it a heaven or we trapped in hell?
Where do we go from here, nobody came back to tell
If we reincarnated or perish in time
Could you shine when darkness inherits your mind?
And your eyes closed for good, you out the galaxy now
Is this subconscious dream my reality now?
Listen to brain, with no physical frame
Could we return to the hood on a spiritual plane?
Ask yourself, "If I pass tonight
Am I prepared for what's after life?" (After you die)

[Chorus: Rakim]
Do You Ever Think
What Life Would Be
Where You Will Go
After you Die?
Do You Ever Think
What Life Would Be
Where You Will Go
After you Die?

[Verse 2: Rakim]
Could we come back, do we get left in the past?
Fuck that, i'ma kick death in the ass
To come walk with the creator, 'til my mind is greater
Get insight so I could design and find data
'Til my third eye gives me a bird's eye view
Focus 'til my ghost is on a curb by you
Watchin you mourn my death, like im lost in time
But im with you even if I don't cross your mind
When you pour out liquor, im catchin the Cognac
When you pull out a spliff im catchin the contact
Try to look after my people, that's trapped in evil
Playin craps and c-low, to get gats and kilos
And still do some of the things that I love to do
Hang on the streets, throw it up in a club or two
See women and catch'em in their wildest dreams
Possess 'em, make'em do the wildest things
And my peeps, what i'ma do, is pray that you blest
And my kids, keep'em away from the angel of death
So just in case if I pass tonight
Yo, im prepared for what's after life. (After you die)

[Chorus: Rakim]
Do You Ever Think
What Life Would Be
Where You Will Go
After you Die?
Do You Ever Think
What Life Would Be
Where You Will Go
After you Die?

[Outro: Rakim]
Do You Ever Think
What Life Would Be
Where You Will Go
After you Die?
Is anyone actually reading this?
When I believed in nothing I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint in some place I called her name
And though my days were slipping by
And nights so cruel I thought I'd die
She danced her little dance 'till it made me cry
She was shakin' like this honey doing that

When I needed soul revival I called your name
When I was falling to pieces I screamed in pain

Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real swept over me
You danced your little dance 'till it made me cry
You were shakin' like this honey doing that

Never let me down
She never let me down
Never let me down
She never let me down

When all your faith is failing Call my name
When you've got nothing coming Call my name
I'll be strong for all it takes
I'll cover your head till the bad stuff breaks
I'll dance my little dance till it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that

Never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
Oh no
A ship came in, but it was empty;
And then it sailed back out to sea again
Now there's the sail on the horizon
And now I wait until your ship comes in

And I'll be waiting in the port of lonely hearts
Watchin' for your topsail on the sea
Prayin' that my ship of love will come
To the port of lonely hearts where I will be

I'll brave the storm until you're with me
Cause wind and rain can't change a love that's true
I'll be alone until you anchor and then
I'll leave this lonely port with you

Till then I'm waiting in the port of lonely hearts
Watchin' for your topsail on the sea
Prayin' that my ship of love will come
To the port of lonely hearts where I will be
Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby
They might say hi and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
Coz they got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby

Not not not nothing on you babe
Not not nothing on you
I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel so around I spun (spun)
With no directions just tryna get some (some)
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun (sun)
This is how I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly I ended up with none

There's no much nonsense
It's on my conscience
I'm thinking baby I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering if there was something that you wanna know
(That you wanna know)
But never mind that we should let it go (we should let it go)
Cos we don't wanna be a t.v episode (t.v episode)
And all the bad thoughts just let them go (go, go, go)
Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby
They might say hi and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
Cos they got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby

Not not not nothing on you babe
Not not nothing on you
Hands down there will never be another one
I been around and I never seen another one
Look at your style they ain't really got nothing on
And you out and you ain't got nothing on
Baby you the whole package plus you pay your taxes

And you keep it real while them other stay plastic
You're my wonder women call me Mr. fantastic
Stop... now think about it

I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even went out there to Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia to new Orleans
But you always steal the show (steal the show)
And just like that girl you got me fro (got me fro)
Like a Nintendo 64 (64)
If you never knew well now you know (know, know, know)
Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby
They might say hi and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
Cos they got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby

Not not not nothing on you babe
Not not nothing on you
Everywhere I go I'm always hearing your name (name, name)
And no matter where I'm at girl you make me wanna sing (sing)
Whether a bus or a plane or a car or a train
No other girls in my brain and you the one to blame

Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby
They might say hi and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
Cos they got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby

Not not not nothing on you babe
Not not nothing on you
Yeah and that's just how we do it
And I'ma let this ride
B O B and Bruno Mars
Be sure it's true when you say I love you
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of hearts have been broken
Just because these words were spoken
I love you, yes, I do, I love you

If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure that it's true
When you say I love you
It's a sin to tell a lie

Cross my heart and I hope to die
I'll never, never, never tell another white lie
Took my little girl out on a date last night
Next to her Greta Gerty would have looked alright

Now I'm between the devil and the deep blue sea
'Cause I said, "Baby, you look good to me"
I told her I loved her and oh, how I lied
Now she's getting set to be my blushing bride
If she leads me to the alter I'm sunk
'Cause I can not tell the preacher I was drunk
Lord have mercy on a no count sinner
Give me one more chance to let another guy win her

Cross my heart and hope to die
I'll never, never, never tell her one more time
I'll never tell another white lie
Well, East Coast girls are hip
I really dig those styles they wear
And the Southern girls, with the way they talk
They knock me out when I'm down there

The Midwest farmers' daughters really make you feel all right
And the Northern girls, with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night

I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls

The West Coast has the sunshine
And the girls all get so tanned
I dig a French bikini on Hawaiian island dolls
By a palm tree in the sand

I been all around this great big world
And I seen all kinds of girls
Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the States
Back to the cutest girls in the world
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls

I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)

I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should old acquaintance be forgot
And days of Auld Lang Syne
For Auld Lang Syne, my dear...

Thank you very much

...May old acquaintance be forgot
And days of Auld Lang Syne
I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry hill when I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And lingered until my dreams came true

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be

Tho' we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill
Hey girl
Is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand

So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, baby
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong

Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way

Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without you
Tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry

It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay baby 'cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around, yeah

Now girl
I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now (on now)
And maybe I should do the same (maybe I should do the same)

Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, baby
And now, it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it, no
Don't want to talk about it, hmm
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way

Just so confused about it, uh
Feeling the blues about it, yeah
I just can't do without you
Can you tell me is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Shoulda known better when you came around
Shoulda known better that you were gonna make me cry

Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around yeah
What goes around comes around, yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that

What goes around comes around, yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that

Don't want to think about it, huh
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way

Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without you
Tell me is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Shoulda known better when you came around
Shoulda known better that you were gonna make me cry

It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
Now it's breaking my heart
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay baby 'cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around yeah

Yo, yo
Let me paint this picture for you baby

You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone

I heard you find out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes

When you cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without saying
That you left me feeling hurt

Just a classic case
A scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved

And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right

But girl I ain't somebody
I'm out of sympathy
You'll see

(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey

See?
You should listen to me, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Because...
(What goes around comes back around)
The Lord's prayer
Our Father
Which art in heaven
Hallowed be
Thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth
As it is
In heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us
Our debts
As we forgive our debtors
And lead us not
Into temptation
But deliver us
From evil
For Thine
Is the kingdom
And the power
And the glory
Forever...
Amen!
Amen!
(Intro)
This the remix
I mean, I ain't really into rims and all that
If I'ma take, five, ten stacks of some D's it's gon' be a different kind of D's
You know what I'm saying? Hm?

(Chorus 1)
Kanye's got stacks, ya'll already know that
Louis that, Goucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Something feel different...
Cute little college chick, linin' up a scholarship
Just got a school grant, spent that on some new tits
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Ain't that a true bitch?
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you how to do this shit

(Verse One)
Get you a cute chick, face got potential
Working with her little hips, waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you, but you know how 'Ye do
Says she love Beyonce, let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain, says "is that He-Su's?"
If I'm unfaithful, blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift, it all depends
She ain't pregnant but about to have twins
Now, is it real love, I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon' finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them D's...
(Chorus 2)
Kanye's got stacks, y'all already know that
Louis that, Goucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Man, that's a prerequisite
Cute chick living good, down here in Hollywood
Upcoming actress, but she got a flat chest
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
That'll give her access
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you what happened

(Verse Two)
Walking down Melrose, spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad, tell by the Chloe bag
She ain't no hoodrat, she ain't gotta prove that
I peep the McCartney's, Stella got her groove back
Hold on, lemme ask you, why you spend your money on that shallow shit?
Why don't you buy some bigger tits?
Something that'll last you
I couldn't tell you if Halle's really real
But I'ma let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I don't need no hands to know Lindsey Lohan
She on the same program as Britney, is you wit' me?
That's why I respect Alicia Keys
She say f**k getting them D's
I'ma just ride out with these
(Chorus 2)
I am the little red rooster
Too lazy to crow for day
I am the little red rooster
Too lazy to crow for day

Keep everything in the farm yard
Upset in every way

The dogs begin to bark, and my hounds begin to how!
The dog begin to bark, and my hounds begin to howl!
Watch out now people
Little red rooster on the prow!

If you're about to see my little red rooster
Please drive him home
If you're about to see my little red rooster
Please set back home

Ain't had no peace in the farm yard
Since my little red rooster's been gone
Well a readin' and a writin' and 'rithmetic never did get through to me
It ain't because I'm square or thick cause I learned my ABC's
But when I graduated from the grammar school and I moved one grade above
I began to be a snook at books but I made straight A's in love

Now the teacher would say to learn your algebra but I'd bring name C's and D's
How could I make an A when there's a swingin' maid
On the left and on the right and in the back and the front of me
Oh my grades are low on my card I know but they oughta give me one above
If I made a mark for learnin' in the dark I'd have straight A's in love

Now in my senior year with graduation near I did my home work every night
And when my mama said I oughta go to bed I'd turn out all the lights
But my sweetic pie was waitin' right outside she'd be a cooin' like a dove
Though I did my beat I made some mess o'test but I made straight A's in love

Now the teacher would say to learn your algebra but I'd bring name C's and D's
How could I make an A when there's a swingin' maid
On the left and on the right and in the back and the front of me
Oh my grades are low on my card I know but they oughta give me one above
If I made a mark for learnin' in the dark I'd have straight A's in love
More than I love the first of spring
I love you more
More than the sweetest song I sing
I love you more
More than the Christmas bells that ring
I love you more my Lord

More than a star filled summer's night
I love you more
More awe than viewing a wondrous sight
I love you more
More than the Christmas cards I write
I love you more my Lord

More than the days, more than the nights
More than seasons and reasons for every life
More is my love for Jesus Christ
And my God who made it all

More than the autumn's falling leaves
I love you more
More than snowflakes dancing in the breeze
I love you more
Much more than Santa and Christmas trees
I love you more, my Lord
Mistletoes and everything wow
Christmas just as I pictured it
Mistletoes and everything wow
Champagne, Pineapple juice

More than the days, more than the nights
More than seasons and reasons for every life
More is my love for Jesus Christ
And my God who made it all

More than the autumn's falling leaves
I love you more
More than snowflakes dancing in the breeze
I love you more
Much more than Santa and Christmas trees
I love you more, my Lord

With every single breath of life you give me
I love you more
More than I love the first of spring
I love you more
More than the sweetest song I sing
I love you more, Lord, I love you more
Mr. Bigs, you know you got to keep me jigs
Mr. Bigs, you know you got to keep me jigs
Mr. Bigs

Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)

Can't get you off of my mind
Girl I've been thinking of you
So lets not waste our time
Tell me what you want to do

Your body's hot for mine
Girl let me hold you real tight
Don't rush lets take our time
I wanna love you all night

You know just what to do
Go down and taste my love
I'll do the same for you
You know what I'm thinking of
Tonight I'm gonna cry
Until I'm soaking wet
Do every thing you like
Baby comfort me
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)

Don't wanna stop this groove
Just wanna keep goin on
The way your body moves
Oh girl I can't let you go
Just let me come inside
Until you can't take no more
You're body wrapped on mine
Now baby, let me explode

You gotta give me some more
I love the way it feels
The way you caress me
Take me to ecstasy
Oh baby up and down
Just hit it all around
This love it feels so right
Bring it hold me too

Little Kim you don't know what type of chick this is
Number one baller of the mistresses
Mr. Bigs you know you got to keep me jigs
Even though it might mean stealing chips from kids
You know why summer clothes too hot for you folks
Get "c" notes every time I do coats
Ya loosing it, acting like ya new to this
Get true to this make it shift in my uterus
Sexing in the ass, ay Martin, when wifey comes home
Get the dough and I'm departing
I wanna see if you can make me scream I hate ya
Give me back shots of sweat out, my cream of nature
Don't you stop
You turn me on I need release, whoa
Love me here, touch me there
Something to share

Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)

[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, look at all the lonely people

[Verse 1]
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

[Pre-Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Verse 2]
Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

[Pre-Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Chorus]
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

[Verse 3]
Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

[Pre-Chorus]
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?

[Outro]
Ah, ah, ah
Let your hair down baby
Let's have a natural ball
Let your hair down baby
Let's have a natural ball
Cause when you're not happy
It ain't no fun at all

You can't take it with you
That's one thing for sure
You can't take it with you baby
That's one thing for sure
There's nothing wrong with ya baby
That a good T-Bone shuffle can't cure

Have fun while ya can
Fate's an aweful thing
Have fun while ya can
Fate's an aweful thing
You can't tell what might happen
That's why I love to sing
I wanna tell you about my baby
Yeah, she ran off with the garbage man
I wanna tell you about my baby
Yeah, she ran off with the garbage man

She better come back quick
Come back and empty my garbage can

I don't know where she's been
And I don't know where she goin'
I don't know where she's been

Please, come on back baby
My trash can is really over flowin'

[Incomprehensible]
She spend all my hard earned cash
You know baby
She spend all my hard earned cash

She better come back this mornin'
Steal you a shotgun
Steal you a shotgun
Steal you a shotgun and 

[Incomprehensible]
And when I go away
I know my heart can stay with my love, it's understood
It's in the hands of my love
And my love does it good

Wo-wo-wo-wo, wo-wo-wo-wo
My love does it good

And when the cupboards bare
I'll still find something there with my love, it's understood
It's everywhere with my love
And my love does it good

Wo-wo-wo-wo, wo-wo-wo-wo
My love does it good

Oh I love, oh wo my love
Only my love holds the other key to me
Oh my love, oh my love
Only my love does it good to me
Wo-wo-wo-wo, wo-wo-wo-wo
My love does it good

Don't ever ask me why
I never say goodbye to my love, it's understood
It's everywhere with my love
And my love does it good

Wo-wo-wo-wo, wo-wo-wo-wo
My love does it good

Oh I love, oh wo my love
Only my love does it good to me
Woah, woah, woah
What up John (testing one, two, three)
What up Kon (hey convict music)
Let's go (can you believe it)

Fresh white tee, fresh car walls, summertime hood niggas look like stars
Jewelry drip, fresh white airs
Mommy shake it up keep your ass right there (oh, can you believe it?)
My man got liquor and my cup's right here
I can smell smoke pass the dutch right here
Nigga pass that, Capri pants with the waist cut off
I wanna smash that (oh, can you believe it?)
Party ran pack, mingling baby, and I can LL shake, you jingling baby?
Back your ass up, I'm a start tingling baby
We can have more fun if wiggling baby (yea, can you believe it?)
P hit the club with a dutch and a dub with it
Nigga don't cuff it if you ain't in love with it
Matter fact let the grub get it
Please don't hate cause at least you can say you was with it

[Chorus]
Can you believe it? Get a break and get off the streets
Clear my mind from the shit I see
In a world full of smoke, contact from the weed
That's when it really bond on me
I'm a be here for life, I ain't never gonna leave
The ghetto is all that I know
It's just another day in the hood my nigga
Laying back trying get this dough
Yellin out ohhhhh, all up in the club
And you know how we roll, squad deep like oh
Bad little bitch*s with their booty on score trying to beat like whoa
Know your ass feel it cause its outta control
Let me hear you say oh, let me hear you say oh oh
Can you believe it?
Big ass truck, brand new rims, tank top Yankee, tanned out Tims
Bracelet, chain, fronts bob thin, new tattoos
New black shoes (hey, can you believe it?)
Gucci, Ermays, do that too
Wanna feel the breeze get a new black coupe
Nigga drop the top, come through the hood
Put a hundred on your three or your foul line shot
(ooh, ooh, oh can you believe it?)
Lending outfits all in the bus cause none of us could
See a summer without trips (none of us can see it)
Mad hoops so the little boys might bark at you
But they all lack good if the hood bothered you

Can you believe it?
Get a break and get off the streets
Clear my mind from the shit I see
In a world full of smoke, attack from the weed
That's when it really bond on me
I'm a be here for life, never gonna leave
The ghetto is all that I know
It's just another day in the hood my nigga
Laying back trying get this dough
Yellin out oh, all up in the club and you know how we roll
Squad deep like oh
Bad little bitch*s with their booty on score trying to beat like whoa
Know your ass feel it cause its outta control
Let me hear you say oh, let me hear you say oh oh
Can you believe it?
Basketball tournament, pitbull pups
Ladies in the club poring Chris in cups
Niggas in the jail calling home on the phone (cause they locked up)
But you still trying to act like ain't shit enough
Mad sieves in the park, mad fights in the park
Niggas talk how they run every night from the narcs
Aside from the light to the dark then the dark to the light
I wanna smoke but I could search for my life

Can you believe it?
I've done spent ten again, watching her bend again, dancing for many men
Tell me have ever though about getting in
A room full of convicts and D Block militants
We'll show you the time of your life
You can occupy my passenger side
Introduce you to the street life
Watch you fall in love after just one night
Ohhhh, all up in the club and you know how we roll
Squad deep like oh
Bad little bitches with their booty on score trying to beat like whoa
Know your ass feel it cause its outta control
Let me hear you say oh, let me hear you say oh oh
Can you believe it?

Can you believe it? (Can you believe it? )
Lil' John, Akon, S.P. the ghost
Feel what we trying to do (Can you believe it? )
Can you believe it (Can you believe it? )
The more I look at her, the more I look it here
The streets are kinda crazy like damn, I gots to be more careful
It's ugly out here mane
These niggas out here talkin', these bitches ain't no good
I'm strapped up and I'm on one and wishin' it go wood
I'm ridin' 'round in my big thang, still up in my hood
I'm ridin' 'round with that big thang cause niggas ain't no good
I've got to be, got to be, got to be more careful
I've got to be, got to be, go-got to be more careful
I've got to be, got to be, got to be more careful
I've got to be, got to be, go-got to be more careful
Like Scarface, who can I trust?
Bonfire, this only us
I'm outchea, I gotta have it
Paper chasin', I gotta grab it
Money talks, I don't talk about it
Take the loss, be a boss about it
Catch me slippin', I really doubt it
I don't leave my house without it
My masterpiece, bad about it
Jealous nigga, that's old shit
Laugh about, cop more whips
And hustle hard, get more chips
I got to be more careful, these niggas out here feds
I got to be more careful, go read what he said
It changed out here and all my silent niggas are gone
Somehow, somewhere, all the shit that went wrong
I never thought that it'd get to this
All these niggas, all snitchin' in
If it's too hot to handle it
Then stay on out and I'm catchin' in
These niggas out here talkin', these bitches ain't no good
I'm strapped up and I'm on one and wishin' it go wood
I'm ridin' 'round in my big thang, still up in my hood
I'm ridin' 'round with that big thang cause niggas ain't no good
I've got to be, got to be, got to be more careful
I've got to be, got to be, go-got to be more careful
I've got to be, got to be, got to be more careful
I've got to be, got to be, go-got to be more careful
They slip outchea, Deba
Got to be more careful
Never leave the crib, never leave my home
Without my street instrument, my baritone
Blat! This what I put aside
Polite on the sucker, leave his face in his lap
I get it play the game of death, they don't play fair
Gotta pack up 30 dig and always stay prepared
I got some Girl Scout cookies and some Jackie
A badass bitch with a short hair
Tatiana Ali but, blowin' all up in my Ruprecon truck
Should I say G? Talk is cheap
Skatin' through the streets your tremendous ass be
My money kinda tall but I don't play ball
Actin' all the pictures nick the paint off the wall
Wutchu need? Problem you havin' mane?
I'm like the concierge, I can get you anything
My heart that pump, get my heart pumped, propane
I've always been a factor, I ain't never gonna lame
Got a couple crash dummies that will wrap you like a mummy
Push you in the graveyard where it's dark, got Sunny
Do it for a friend but I ain't gotta give him money
Slap you with the kid and they'll do anything for me
These niggas out here talkin', these bitches ain't no good
I'm strapped up and I'm on one and wishin' it go wood
I'm ridin' 'round in my big thang, still up in my hood
I'm ridin' 'round with that big thang cause niggas ain't no good
I've got to be, got to be, got to be more careful
I've got to be, got to be, go-got to be more careful
I've got to be, got to be, got to be more careful
I've got to be, got to be, go-got to be more careful
Nineteen birds in a sycamore tree
Everyone with his own melody
They're singing all together without a beat
Somebody tell me how come it all sound so sweet

Brother bee caught the bear with his hands in the honey (Yes, it is)
Stung him all over 'till it wasn't so funny (Oh)
It's the law of the jungle man has got to survive
Seems like everything wants to wanna be alive (Wants to be alive)
Yes, it does

But it's the motion in the ocean, the wind in the leaves
Two got something just trying to make three
Every natural thing has got its groove
I don't know how it comes, it just do (It's the natural thing)

(Love is a natural thing)
It takes two to make it true to keep the love lights burning (Yes, it does)
Ain't nothing too it once you get it to turning (Hey)
Let the feeling overrun you then snatch it back
I tell you, the push and the pull is a natural fact (Push, pull)
But it's the motion in the ocean, the wind in the leaves
Two got something just trying to make three
Every natural thing has got its groove
I don't know how it comes, just as long as you do (It's the natural thing)

Just like the stars, just like the rain
They're all different but they're all the same
I don't know how else to tell you but go on and bet your money
On the natural thing, yeah

Love's a natural thing (Natural thing)
Yes, it is, love's a natural thing (Natural thing)
Tellin' you that it's a natural thing (Natural thing)
Do you believe that it's a (Yes, it is)

Yes, it is, love's a natural thing (Natural thing)
Yes, it is, love's a natural thing (Can you feel?)
Can you feel it? Yeah (Can you feel?)
Can you feel it? (Yes, it is)

Love's a natural thing (Yes, it is)

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

[Chorus]
(Halo, halo, I can see your halo)
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace

It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

[Chorus]
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more

Yeaah
(Obie Trice)
Whatchu gonna do with it A?
Whatchu gonna do?

(Akon)
Take 'em on back to the street

(Chrous: Akon)
I keep the 40 cal on my side
Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster
You see a nigga pass by
Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya
Got Glocks for sale, RED tops for sale
Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you, Yeah
Just don't, whatever you do, snitch
Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah

(Verse 1: Obie Trice)
Thats risky, the bitch tenderize out a nigga
His history's snitch, who decided he's a member?
Once he got pinched, coincided with law
Same homie say he lay it down for the bar
Brought gang squad around ours
How could it be?
Been homies since superman draws
Only phoniness never came to par
He had us, a true neighborhood actor
Had his back with ks, now we see through him like X-Rays
Cuffed in that Adam car, no matter his loss
We at 'em, it's war
Knowin not to cross those reservoir dogs
You help to plant seeds, just to be a vegetable?
When we invest in team, its to the death for sho'
No X and O's, tex calicos
Aimed at your chest nigga
(Chorus: Akon)
I keep the 40 cal on my side
Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster
Ya see a nigga pass by
Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya

Got Glocks for sale, red tops for sale
Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you Yeah
Just dont, whatever you do, snitch
Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah

(Verse 2: Obie Trice)
We started out as a crew, when one speak, it's all honest
Private conferences when we eat, Benihana's
Recondences when we peep enemies on us
Been in these corners
Sellin' like anything on us
Knowing heaven'll shun us being devil's miners
But that ain't got shit to do with the tea in China
We gon' keep the grind up till death can find us
Mean time, leanin in them European whips reclined up
It's eye for an eye for the riders
We ain't trying to get locked up, we Soul Survivors
Po Po's is cowards, its no you, its ours
We vow this, mixing Yayo with soda powder
Who woulda known he would fold and cower
Once the captain showed, he sold Old McDonalds
No X and O's, tex calicos
Aimed at your chest nigga
(Chorus: Akon)
I keep the 40 cal on my side
Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster
You see a nigga pass by
Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya
Got Glocks for sale, red tops for sale
Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you
Just dont, whatever you do, snitch
Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah

(Verse 3: Obie Trice)
Nowadays, Sammy the Bull's, got the game full
So he moved to a rural area to keep cool
They snitchin on the snitch now, it's nothing to tell
Nowadays your circle should be small as hell
Ain't tryin to meet new faces, this don't interest me
Even if we bubble slow, we get it eventually
No penitentiary, though we know clemecy
You will meet the lord snitchin, given us a century
These cats is rats now, the streets need decon
Thats how they react now, weak, when the heat's on them
Stop snitchen, you asked for the life you live in
This act is not permitted, no where on the map
It is forbidden to send a nigga to prison
If you've been in it along with 'em
And then snitch and become hidden
No X and O's, tex calicos
Aimed at your chest nigga

(Chorus: Akon)
I keep the 40 cal on my side
Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster
You see a nigga pass by
Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya
Got Glocks for sale, red tops for sale
Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you
Just dont, whatever you do, snitch
Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah

(Obie Trice)
You rat bastard! (bastard)(echo)
Oh-a-w-oh
When I was just a little child

Happiness was there awhile

And from me, it...
It slipped one day (ay)

[Intro: Al Green & Corinne Bailey Rae]
Just you take your time, ooh ooh
Just you take your time

[Verse 1: Corinne Bailey Rae]
Do you remember when
We used to take our time
You'd write me a letter, baby
And I'd wait for you all night, oh
Now it seems everyone's rushing around, including you and I
I wanna take a little time
Just to fall in love again
'Cause they're telling me...

[Chorus: Al Green & Corinne Bailey Rae]
Just you take your time (No hurry, baby)
Just you take your time

[Verse 2: Al Green]
When I think about yesterday
Everything was easy
Everything was okay
Now everything is going fast
You're the best thing I ever had
Ah, and losing you
Ah, it'd make me, make me
That would make me feel so bad, hey, hey
Would you help me saying...

[Chorus: Al Green & Corinne Bailey Rae]
Just you take your time
Just you take your time

[Bridge: Al Green]
Sing low and take it slow
I'm inclined to agree
'Cause ain't nobody living
Can try to hurry me

[Outro: Al Green & Corinne Bailey Rae]
Just you take your time
Just you take your time
Just you take your time (No need to hurry, baby)
Just you take your time (I don't wanna really hurry you, baby)
Just you take your time (There's no rush, baby)
Just you take your time (All the time in the world for you, baby)
Yeah, yeah, Space Age forever; Niggas and hoes better recognize
Eightball and MJG, been ten toes down in this game
Since we were two young playas in a one-horse town
Then hopped to a muthafuckin' grasshopper
Nigga, my life would have been done got cut off
If my dues weren't paid

It's a thinnin' line between wrong and right
Trapped in a trap till the mornin' light
Ghetto ain't left me no choices; I had to fight
My mama and daddy was too young to raise me right
Maybe I been made a man from all the mistakes I made
Niggas dead, niggas gone; I still ain't afraid
Ain't too grown to get back on with ghetto games I played
My life would have been done got cut off if the dues weren't paid

In the middle of doin' crime; it never stopped me from writin' rhymes
It never stopped me from playin' music
God, but it didn't mean I had to use it
It was obvious: I had to give up the streets for the beats
Not knowin', but havin' faith on just how long that it would be
Before I made it, before somebody picked up my tape and played it
With a remark like, "Hey, played that instrumental, you cat's got potential."
In the process of doing talent shows, parties, and mix tapes
We even put it down on some of our homeboys jail release dates
I can remember in the past closin' down at fast foods
Strictly stickin' to my dreams, but feelin' like I'd be the last dude
Who can make it in this rap; I thought that they ain't gon' see me in Memphis
It was like a time they looked over Tennessee
And didn't know hip-hop was in us
To all my vets in the game, I got love; stay on your toes
'Cause back in the days, I used to use your 4-5 instrumental to do my shows
And, look, I was seventeen when I signed my first contract
And about eighteen and a half when I signed my worst contract; we hurt from that
And till this day they still distributin' our first tape
Before Comin' Out Hard, now can you feel it?
Be humble and patient with whatever you should choose
'Cause to get to where I am right now, I done paid my dues
It's a thinnin' line between wrong and right
Trapped in a trap till the mornin' light
Ghetto ain't left me no choices; I had to fight
My mama and daddy was too young to raise me right
Maybe I been made a man from all the mistakes I made
Niggas dead, niggas gone; I still ain't afraid
Ain't too grown to get back on with ghetto games I played
My life would have been done got cut off if the dues weren't paid

A c-note for a concert; I know that sounds preposterous
Nigga, we didn't have a pot to piss
So we got on stage, and we rocked the bitch
Fuck the cheese; I love to see my niggas in the front row
Get buck wild, start a fight; the police make a nigga stop the show
Niggas all in the parkin' lot, bustin' shots, fuckin' with hoes
Box Chevy with the spokes and vogues
Niggas didn't know shit about a twenty inch Mo-Mo
Hard head, young nigga don't believe that shit till I see that shit
See them heavyweight niggas; one day, I'm gonna be that shit
Okay, everybody know everybody done sold dope, ran with a gang
Pimp some hoes and snorted a little coke, but, uh
I'm space again, and we'll forever be
Eightball, the fat mack, and M-J-fuckin'-G
Turn the page from then to now, and we still grindin'
Small clubs and small towns think they bouncin', and we find them
Put them on the guest list, make them pump their fist and get buck to this
Make one of them weed smokin', gangsta bitches get fucked to this
Expand, give all my true fans what they demand
Do my part again and, uh, come out hard again, and, uh
Keep space again, and we'll forever be
Eightball, the fat mack, and M-J-fuckin'-G
It's a thinnin' line between wrong and right
Trapped in a trap till the mornin' light
Ghetto ain't left me no choices; I had to fight
My mama and daddy was too young to raise me right
Maybe I been made a man from all the mistakes I made
Niggas dead, niggas gone; I still ain't afraid
Ain't too grown to get back on with ghetto games I played
My life would have been done got cut off if the dues weren't paid

Money in the air as mo' fell, grab you by your coat tail

[Verse 2: Akon]
Shorty, I can see, you ain't lonely
Handful of niggas and they all got cheese
So you looking at me now, what's it gonna be?
Just another tease far as I can see
Trying to get you up out this club
If it means spending a couple dubs
Throwing bout 30 stacks in the back
Make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-dealer use to move 'phetamines
Girl, I spend money like it don't mean nothin'
And besides, I got a thing for you

[Hook: Akon, Tego Calderón]
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole. (Ajá)
I know you see me looking at you and you already know. ('Tá bien!)
I wanna fuck you (Ajá!), fuck you, you already know. (Tú sabes!)
I wanna fuck you (Voy yo), fuck you, you already know, girl

[Verse 3: Tego Calderón]
Hey, te mentí con lo de hacernos jevos, con lo del viejo
Pero, mucho gusto, yo soy Tego
Tú te vas pa' encima cuando caminas (Qué, qué? Ja!), tú eres mi budín de esquina (Uy!)
Así que no te hagas la bruta y ponte pa' ésta ruta (Ponte!), que llegó Papá Machuca (Papá)
Te veo mirando, sé lo que estás pensando (Ajá!) y te noto bellaqueando (Uy!)
Por ti, yo cambiaría par de días hasta que deposite alguito en tu alcancía (Ay Dios)
Quiero ser tu papi, mami. Dame un break, bendito, que me tiene asfixiadito
Ok

[Hook: Akon, Tego Calderón]
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you (Ajá!) and you already know. ('Tá bien!)
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know, girl

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg, Akon]
Mobbin' through the club in low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoking section (Just smokin', just smokin')
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (Baby, I see you, I see you)
It's cool, we jet, the mood is set, your pussy is wet
You're rubbin' your back and touchin' (Yeah!) your neck
Your body is movin', ya humpin' and jumpin' (Yeah)
Your titties is bouncin'
You're smilin' and grinin' and lookin' at me

[Verse 5: Akon]
Girl, and while your looking at me
I'm ready to hit the Caddy right up on the patio
Move the patty to the Caddy
Baby, you got a fatty, the type I like to marry
Wanting to just give you everything
And that's kind of scary
‘Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncing, got me tipping my glass
Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

[Hook: Akon]
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know, girl

[Verse 6: Tego Calderón, Akon]
Ando pensando en pájaro preñado, enchulado, me tienes bien emburrado
En otra vida, te doy par de chamacos. En esta vine a romperte el trato (Ajá)
Na' de pensiones, na' de embarazos
Si quiere uno yo trato, oyó?
Mamita, yo trato. Tú tratas? Jaja
(You break it down for Tego)

[Outro: Tego, (Akon)]
Yo quiero darte (Hey!) tabla (Oh!), mi chula (Hey!), you know (Oh!)
Yo quiero darte (Yeah!) felpa, you already know, jaja!
Qué fue?

[Verse 1]
Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight, who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here and tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say, you should say it right now
(You should say it right now)

[Pre-Chorus]
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

[Chorus]
I was wondering, maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)

[Verse 2]
I know you said to me
This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be
Time is only wasting, so why wait for eventually?
If we gonna do something about it, we should do it right now
(We should do it right now)

[Pre-Chorus]
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it

[Chorus]
I was wondering, maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way, I'm sayin'
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Sayin'
Why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (Fly away)
I can't say, I can't compare
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me?

[Chorus]
I was wondering, maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way, I'm sayin'
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
Oh, sometimes
I get a good feeling, yeah
Get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no no

Get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling
Kiss my lips and taste the Sauvignon
I wrap the vines around your thighs
I can see the kind of tip you're on
There's no confusion in your eyes

Let's unwind together
Together
Ease our minds together
Together

Taking sips to push the moment on
But it's just the bottle that's run dry
Lose the watch 'cause we got nothing on
And I'm not keeping track of time

Let's unwind together
Together
Ease our minds together
Together

Together
Together
Together
Ease our minds together...

[Chorus: Akon]
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
Do you make money, mothafucka?
I'm the mascot, baby
In the city in the crib off of Caspin, Christmas
Count the city that with the cash by Billy and I ain't gon' stop
No nigga, I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Self made
Anthem on my life for the marching band
Montana, I'll beez the bomb like the Taliban
Poppin' like a frying pan, slide like a violin
Through the crackhole blindfold like a Telescan
Most underrated, but never underpaid
Fake niggas mad and all the real niggas glad he made it
Gladiator baby
Don't be actin' shady baby
Seein' they be shinin' through the diamonds, tryna see me baby
I'm the product, get that product baby serving dog
Fuckin' with the hottest, so the hottest I deserved the ball
It's that Cocaine Mafia Connect
Juicy J, Project Pat, Montana roger that

[Chorus: Akon]
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I done did what I had to
Grind on my own two
Feet from the street with the killas and the real goons
Watchin' out for popo
Tryna sell the Yayo
Tryna be the weed man
Even sell the beans man
I'm a always stand out
I don't take no handouts
But I take you're money bruh
Run up in you're gram house
I hustle till I die
With the rappin' with the trappin'
Whether be a hit man with the guns clappin'
Comin' straight from the hood, I'ma make it happen
I ain't never had shit, I had to sell or snatch it
Chrome cree fifty seven got always packed in
That I cut you're fuckin' head like a fuckin' hatchet

[Chorus: Akon]
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man

Count the city that with the cash by Billy and I ain't gon' stop
No nigga, I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
I'm self made
Gettin' paid, went and found my own plug
Just like Frank Lucas did, went and got my own drugs
Taped up by my nugs, on the plane Cali buds
Soon as I hit the hood, I ain't showin' Cali love
Everything for the streets, nigga gotta give me me
Five hundred dollars ounce of purp in these Memphis street
I done made a killion off a drug dealion
Rap up bout my life and I sold me a million
Mr Gold Plate, get raw then we pop ya
DB investments, Cocaine mafia
Pistols and shotguns, grams and the hard run
Twenty eights on the dough, got these Hummers so much

[Chorus: Akon]
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
Do you make money, mothafucka?
I'm the mascot, baby
In the city in the crib off of Caspin, Christmas
Count the city that with the cash by Billy and I ain't gon' stop
No nigga, I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man

[Akon:]
I used to tell my homie
Slow down time after time
But he never would listen
Until he got some time
The life that he was living
I knew it wasn't right
The judge gave him that sentence
And put him up for life
You don't miss the water
Til the well runs dry
Don't miss the living til they die
Don't know the reason
Don't know why
We just let life pass us by

[Chorus:]
Cause you never know (never know)
What you got (what you got)
Until it's gone (gone away)
Away away away away
Long long gone
Cause you never know (never know)
What you got (what you got)
Until it's gone away
Away away away away
Long long gone

[Rock City:]
See my best friend used to stay with me
Each and every day he'd chill with me
Always told me to pray for me
But I always thought that he'll be fine
Now I got to watch his mother cry
Cos she loved him child
Don't miss the water
Til the well runs dry
Don't miss the living til they die
Don't know the reason

Don't know why
We just let life pass us by

[Chorus:]
Cause you never know (never know)
What you got (what you got)
Until it's gone away
Away away away away
Long long gone
Cause you never know (never know)
What you got (what you got)
Until it's gone away
Away away away away
Long long gone
So don't you take for granted
The life you've been handed
Be thankful and grateful
Cause life goes on
With or without you
Plus there's so many people worse off than you
With no chance of changing
It's truly up to you

[Chorus:]
Cause you never know (never know)
What you got (what you got)
Until it's gone away
Away away away away
Long long gone
Cause you never know (never know)
What you got (what you got)
Until it's gone away
Away away away away
Long long gone

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there

Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate

As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
'ving been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

Put on a fresh white suit, in a Mini coupe sitting on dubs (sitting on dubs)
I'm just looking for somebody to talk to and show me some love (show me some love)
If you know what I mean, uh huh
Everybody jockin' me as soon as I stepped in the spot (I stepped in the spot)
Two hundred bitches, and I'm bettin' ain't none of them hot (ain't none of them hot)
'Cept for this pretty young thang that was workin' all the way at the top (all the way at the top)
Shawty, what is your name?
Ooh, she made us drinks to drink
We drunk 'em, got drunk
And then I think she thinks I'm cool
She gave me a wink, I winked back
And then I think that we hit it off something proper like...

I like the bartender (Ooh, if you're lookin' for me)
I'm at the bar with her (Uh huh, okay)
I like the bartender (Yeah, if you're lookin' for me)

Got a brand new girl, so I'm feeling all good inside (all good inside)
Feel like I put some brand new twenty-fours on a brand new ride (on a brand new ride)
Triple shot of Patron on the rocks with little bit of lime (with a little bit of lime)
I'm just keeping it real (uh huh)
Baby still working at the club, so I'm getting in free (so I'm getting in free)
Wednesday night, I'm on the list: T-Pain plus three (T-Pain plus three)
Every time I hit the spot, baby girl taking care of me (taking care of me)

Unless I'm in the M6 doing tricks, freeway burnt out (freeway burnt out)
Got a passenger side that's empty, wanting it to be your spot (be your spot)
Put you on my billboard, we can act like the charts; I can end up on top (end up on top)
Don't smoke, don't drink: that's why I don't be by the bar, baby (baby)
Just lookin' at you from a distance looking like a goddamn star, baby (baby)

Oh, this old heart of mine, been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away, I think your gonna stay
Lonely nights that come
Memories that go
Bringing you back again
Hurting me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake
To show this love I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing if I'm coming or going but I

I love you
This old heart, darling is weak for you
I love you
Yes I do (Yes I do)

These old arms of mine
Miss having you around
Makes these tears inside
Start falling down
Always with half a kiss
You remind of what I miss
Though I try to control myself
Like a fool I start feeling 'cause my head starts spinning 'cause I

I love you
This old heart, darling is weak for you
I love you
Yes I do (Yes I do)

Ooh, I try hard to hide
My hurt inside
This old heart of mine
Always leaves me crying
The way you're treating me
Leaves me incomplete
You're here for the day
Gone for the week now

But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours, whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it, tell the world about it 'cause I

I love you
This old heart, darling is weak for you
I love you
This old heart, darling is weak for you
(Darling I) I love you
This old heart of mine darling is weak for you
I love you, yes I do, yes I do
I love you
Yes I do, darling it's weak for you

[Big Sean:]
Okay, I'm young and rich
And this the shit man
(What what you you?)
You you is a shit stain
Me I'm connected like I switch planes
Addicted to Weed bitches and big chains
Woop, car so big I crash it if I switch lanes
Sayin you the man nigga quit playin
How you winning if I ain't switch teams
Bitch I had the same dreams since I was sixteen
Ripping life out out of the plastic
Turning everything to platinum
Got six rings do I look like Phil Jackson
Me, earl mac and a bunch of Toni Braxton's
Fill your cup to full full fullest
Tone if they acting up then pu-pu-pull it
High off money we the p-p-pussy
I don't st-st-st-stutter
Go g-g-girl do it right now

[Chorus:]
This ain't nothing new to me
Addicted to the cars and jewelry
All the bad bitches like whoa it's he
Swear you know you know you know you know what I do
To me, do to me, do to me, do do
To me, do to me, do to me, do do
You know what I do
All my life's a circle;
Sunrise and sundown;
Moon rolls thru the nighttime;
Till the daybreak comes around
All my life's a circle;
But I can't tell you why;
Season's spinning round again;
The years keep rollin' by
It seems like I've been here before;
I can't remember when;
But I have this funny feeling;
That we'll all be together again
No straight lines make up my life;
And all my roads have bends;
There's no clear-cut beginnings;
And so far no dead-ends

Chorus:
I found you a thousand times;
I guess you done the same;
But then we lose each other;
It's like a children's game;
As I find you here again;
A thought runs through my mind;
Our love is like a circle;
Let's go 'round one more time
Chorus
Never too soon to be through
Being cool too much too soon
Too much for me too much for you
You're gonna loose in time
Don't be afraid to show your friends
That you hurt inside inside
Pain's part of life don't hide behind your false pride
It's a lie your lie
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
I'm tired of being untouchable
I'm not above the love
I'm part of you and you're part of me
Why did you go away
Finding what you're looking for
Can end up being such a bore
I pray for you most every day
My love's with you now fly away
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself

The band had been long-time fans of the show, and bearded drummer, Will Champion, actually took time off at one point to act in the famous 'Red Wedding' episode.
They've gathered in the Henson recording studio in Los Angeles to work up the 16 songs required for a full Broadway stage production.

[Chris Martin]
Fella's, how ya doin'?

[Chris Martin]
I had a moment of inspiration, it was
a flash of genius -- get the whole cast to come in. Everyone thought it was a brilliant idea, so that's what's happening. It's a big day, big day for us.

All the actors are gathering to hear the songs performed for the first time.

Know she'll be a part of my life

Let the poor find money
Take away their sorrows
Give them sunshine tomorrow
But don't take her out of my life
Don't take her out of my life
What would I do without her, tell me now

Let the bird sing
With the coming spring
Let the church bells ring
Let the rain fall
Let the grass grow
Let the moon glow
On the fallen snow

But don't take her out of my life
Please keep her a part of my life

And I wanna talk to you

Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done

Computer voice: Now talk baby!
Computer chant: Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...
Are you lost or incomplete
Do you feel like a puzzle
You can't find your missing piece
Tell me how you feel
How you feel
How you feel
How you feel

So you take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung, or do
Something that's never been done

And you feel like you're going where you've been before
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk...

Smile, smile for me
Why don't you smile, you can be free
In a little while, your heart will see
Just like a child, smile for me

[Verse 1: Prohgress]
Yo, stress is eatin' me alive
Can't enjoy a moment, even worry on the rise
9 times out of 10, when you stop to smell the roses
Is when the opposition sneaks right under your noses
I keep my eyes open, for enemies and fakes
My body's getting tired, how long can they wait?
What's it gonna take, one mistake and they nail ya
Mama can't wait 'til she can label me a failure
50 in the hole and it's blurring out my vision
Sometimes I wonder if I really made the right decision
The future of my seed in the hands of my homies
One's in and out, the other's ducking for the police
I reciprocate, work my fingers to the bone
7 days a week in this shitty studio
I got one hope, if it's gone then it's all bad
But Catch never sleep, what if he dies in a car crash?

[Hook: Ken Oak]
Smile, smile for me
Why don't you smile, you can be free
In a little while, your heart will see

[Verse 2: J-Splif]
Yo, I'm in a choke hold, it's gettin harder to breath
Havin terrifying dreams in my sleep, shit is deep
I try to fly away, but someone's tugging at my feet
Feeling out of reach with myself in time of need
Out of my zone, fully losing control
And no amount of dope can make my problems just go
I'm losing my sanity, so I take a few hits
Escape from reality cause the truth makes me sick
Another gloomy day, the sun's been out of touch
Locked in my room all alone, feeling stuck
The pressure's kicking in, and this Prozac ain't enough
And I know in the future I'ma lose the ones I love
It scares me to death, but the clock won't stop ticking
So I keep living with my hopes and ambitions
Enjoy my stay on Earth, flash my pearly whites
'Cause when it hit your turn, you gon' take an early flight

[Hook]
In a little while, your heart will see
Just like a child, smile for me

[Verse 3: KevNish]
Chilling in the Village feeling right
In the morning yawning 'cause the doja got me high
My scrambled Cinemax and HBO is out of sight
I'm infomercial zoning, do I flip or do I buy?
I'm messing with this chick, caught on my dick
Thinking how she fell in love
With a pimp, wanting a hit, wanting none of the above
Now some kid's up in the mix, playas never use a glove
My sidekick's out of service 'cause my anytime is up
Eyes is closed, 'cause I'm hopin' when I open 'em
Time won't go back to 1999 when my mind was grown
Educated with the answer to th open doors
Hold the phone, pause
You's a fool, wanna make it in the swimmin pool
Blew his cool
My reflections need a miracle
Life is full of everything I never wanted
Dive in, thank the Lord I can't swim

[Hook: Ken Oak]
Smile, smile for me
Why don't you smile, you can be free
In a little while, your heart will see
Just like a child, smile for me

[Intro]
Yester-me yester-you yesterday

[Verse 1]
What happened to the world we knew?
When we would dream and scheme
And while the time away
Yester-me yester-you yesterday

[Verse 2]
Where did it go that yester glow?
When we could feel
The wheel of life turn our way
Yester-me yester-you yesterday

[Verse 3]
I had a dream, so did you
Life was warm and love was true
Two kids who followed all the rules
Yester fools
And now now it seems those yester dreams
Were just a cruel and foolish game we used to play
Yester-me yester-you yesterday

[Verse 4]
When I recall what we had
I feel lost I feel sad with nothing but
The memory of yester love and now
Now it seems those yester dreams
Were just a cruel and foolish game we had to play
Yester-me yester-you yesterday
Yester-me yester-you yesterday
Sing with me
Yester-me yester-you yesterday
One more time

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'll leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
So, put me on with these hoes homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie

[Hook: Kanye West]
Drive slow homie
Drive slow
You never know homie, about these hoes homie
You need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawlin'? You see them screens fallin'?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' somethin' candy coated, crawlin' like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jammin' on this Screw
I'm looking for them hoes baby, what it do? Drive slow homie

[Interlude: GLC & Kanye West]
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes (drive slow homie)
If you're ridin' round the city with nowhere to go (drive slow homie)
Live today, cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know homie, might need some hoes homie
You need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie

[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TV's in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby this evidence
You see a player flicking and how you ain't convinced
That you should gon kiss it, just a lil bit
I wear my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
My cylinder quiet like tip-toes
I sold O's and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie drive slow (Drive slow, drive slow)

[Bridge: Tony Williams]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Mm, hm
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Mm, hm
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Looking at life through my rearview, all the problems I had
Could be seen a lot clearer after time had passed
Known for living so fast, they wonder how he don't crash
With 220 on the dash, and he constantly mashin'
"Why don't he slow down?" they be constantly askin'
But me in the fast lane is like metal and magnets
Now I ain't trying to say that this the way of the masses
But it's so hard to change, I love this shit with a passion
Since me and C were cuttin' class, and showin' our ass
Shooting out in broad day in the middle of traffic
I remember sellin' crack faster than I could bag it
Just sharin' my past wit ya shawty, I ain't e'en braggin'
Me and Cap got life, them other folk got blasted
Had a partner O.D. and after this all happened
Life the only thing that kept a pimp from crying and laughing
Then the Lord smiled on me at the end of the madness
I never thought that I'da made it this far rappin'
For introducing the youth to what we now call "trappin'"
Considered now a classic, who'd've imagined?
Me in Milano getting models in next year's fashion
So nowadays, they can call me old-fashioned
But it's way too much cash to see blue lights flashin'
So I guess the moral of this here class is:
Life about who make it, not about who make it the fastest
Drive slow homie

[Outro: Kanye West (Chopped & Screwed)]
Yeah, bumpa bumpa bump bump
Drive slow homie
Drive slow homie
You never know homie, might need some hoes homie
You need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie
Drive slow homie
Work it work is never over (x30)

Work it harder never over (x8)

Work it harder makes is better do is faster never over (x2)

Yeah, what ima do right here is take my time
And dedicating this one to my niggas resting in peace
And my niggas behind the wall
See you when I get there, you know what Im saying? (really doe)
So drip with me as I go down memory lane
Boy it's a loony where the grass is greener
(1-8-7 ain't shit but a misdemeanor)
Ive seen a lot of niggas come up, but few niggas done up
Some rest in peace, with their khakis heavy squeezed
But it's a east side thang, a hoo ride thang
(cause if we bang to the boogie than we boogie to the bang)
I bring you the motherfucking .38
(just get the mc and the homie nate)
So we can slide, slide, slipperdy slide
As I take you on a trip nigga ride (east side)
Nate (daz):
Do you remember back on the east side?
Where all us niggas used to love to ride
We didn't care what we did
Time was nothing to us we were just kids
Times are different now, but you still get stuck
Im not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck
So if you're thinking about coming and stepping to me
Keep this in mind: Im a motherfucking o.g
Snoop:
Lets speed the clock up and pass some time
June 17th, 1979
That's my first time being arrested
I know I did the crime, but I ain't going to confess to this shit
I learned than from the gs
A g is an overseer, the overseer sees
More than you do cause he gets experienced
And besides Im just a juvenile delinquent
So I was gone, and Im on my way home
My mommas going to get me, and I flee with (? ? ? )
She puts a jacket on my back and hands me a comb
We stop and frosty freeze for a couple snowcones
She telling me that I didn't need to do what I done
She said: "playing football should be your only fun son"
Im like "allright" so we enter the house
Come up to the door and pops fired to the mouth
I couldn't do nothing but cry like a bitch
I looked at my momma and said: "damn, why you snitch? "
They put me on punishment but that didn't work
Now wearing khakis, wallabees, and a t-shirt
And throwing up the neighborhood gang sides
I do my first robbery and now I gotta do time
Nate:
My homie told me one day he had a jack move
He said: "come on nate dogg, it'll be smooth"
I agreed and said "come on, lets go and jack them fools"
Next day we were draped in the county blues
I went and did a little time in the bucket see (seventeen years)
Saying to myself "ill never fuck with that nigga again"
Fore Im locked down I learned to be
What I am now and that's a motherfucking o.g
Original gangsta
Daz:
I grew up in the city as a chap, faced the trials
Never smiled, became a gangster in the meanwhile
Youd find me swearing and lying, trying to be an o.g.,
Beating the shit out of niggas for guess, some hillfigers
The man behind the trigger, committing robberies
With the homies, no one could stop, nobody knew me
Breaking niggas for showing, sucker niggas better know me
Because we ain't letting the bullshit slide no more
Do your wear nigga and kick in your front door
To let you know we can't take no more
Feeling revenge, killing enemies, family and friends
And let you pay the cost for my homies life, it's lost
Toss a coin in the air, run my fingers through my hair
And ask myself: "who the fuck should I really fear? "
I ran around with the best killers
Thug criminals and drug dealers
Blasting niggas if they come near us
(? ? ? ) with evil spirits, no one could help us if we could
Knock on wood for good luck
Serve every nigga in your hood with a buck, now youve been struck
Stood gangsta in a static gangsta mack
A grown child laying niggas the fuck down
Nate (daz):
Original gangsta (original gangsta)
Coming from long beach (the town by the sea where niggas know me)
Coming from the east side...
Youre fucking with the pound, oh nigga please
C-o-b.s can't see the d-o-double gs, 

[o.g.s... repeat 5 times]
Shout outs to my nigga mr. d-a-z
Shout outs to my nigga mr. warren g
Shout outs to my nigga s-n-double o-p
Shout outs to my niggas c, style and me
Snoop (nate):
Yeah, straight up, based on a true story
You know what Im saying? it's a g thang baby (original gangsta)
You trick ass bitch!
Last night, I had a dream about you
In this dream, I'm dancing right beside you
And it looked like everyone was having fun
The kind of feeling I've waited so long

Don't stop, come a little closer
As we jam, the rhythm gets stronger
There's nothing wrong with just a little, little fun
We were dancing all night long

The time is right to put my arms around you
You're feeling right, you wrap your arms around too
But suddenly I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it, this dream was all gone

Ooh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I wish this dream comes true

Ooh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
We'll make this dream come true
Why don't you play the game?
Why don't you play the game?

Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well, maybe just a half a drink more
Why don't you put some records on while I pour?

[Verse 2: CeeLo, Christina, Both]
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight
To break the spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby, don't hold out
Baby it's cold outside

[Verse 3: CeeLo & Christina]
I simply must go
See that it's cold outside
The answer is no
I said it's cold out there
This welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Ooh gosh, your lips are delicious
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before

[Verse 4: CeeLo, Christina, Both]
Hey, I've got to go home
Baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat
I mean, it's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I'm thrilled when you touch my hand
Hey, don't you see
How could you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Ooh, think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that old lie
Baby it's cold outside
Ooh yeah

[Snoop Dogg]
From the hood, to the valley, from yards, to the alleys
"Wonderland" in demand and the man is "Malice"
O.G.'s blow trees, gold keys to the palace
Gangbang on 'caine maintain for the challenge
And shank ya, bank ya, levitate ya, spray ya
Butch (Cassidy!) Come with some gangster flavor

[Butch Cassidy]
On my block, I handle my deep business every day
I hustle, on the streets I do it the old fashioned way
I roll out, with some girls that's from the hood
They love me, that's understood
And we burn trees that's so good, damn, we, should
Daily, I stay G'd up with my khakis and my 'gars
Burn, then I pick up my two dogs and bend the curb
That's gangsta, gotta grab a fresh {?} bud
Now I bend it up like a thug
And my Chrysler on two dubs, plus, G'd, up
I keep it gangsta fo' sho', because it's all that I know
The only way that I roll, the only way that I'll go I'm so

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
SO gangsta, I'm so, SO gangsta

Best save for dada, unbutton your collar
Mix the shit yup it's "Tha Doggfather"
Six-deuce Impala, hip-hop to holler
Chipped blocked and locked, hits with rottweilers
Stand out, and van out the week
I bang out, and hang out the streets
Push the line of a capo, a don
Whick-whack niggas did black folks so wrong
Peep that out
Eastside Long Beach, grip that out
Two times on mine; see I'm a vet on the set
Steppin my step, where my weapon is kept
C-rag in my pocket yeah it's still on my left
I'ma smoke 'til my motherfuckin last breath

[Hook 2]

[Butch Cassidy]
Are you gangster? They all know
Hot doe, breaks down do's and kill at shows
Wanksta - never though
Let it go, call up hoes, I got the indo
Boooooom, watch the intellect lose her fear
Street shit they can't come near
Let 'em all know that I'm here, no more fears

[Hook 1]

Sittin' on tonas
Tearing up spots
And blocks in my hood ain't got no corners
Cause we done chipped 'em all off a proper piece
Bustin' rocks and Glocks
And gettin ghost from the police
No peace
So, he gets served with no concern
To who gets burned and one day they'll learn
Not to be f**kin' with the nigga
Buckin' with the trigga
Nothing you could figga
Could help you escape
From this mind state
That I create young nigga
Yeah! and it's just like that

Now it's i, with that stylish flow
So niggas step back or heads get cracked
And I won't let back

The shit that only gangsta's get gangsta with
Now quick to bust your ass like the cop
Waiting, debating for my ass to flip flop
But I don't flop
I just flip the script
When I did and set trip
Keep the clip close to my hip
And don't say shit
When I blast

Slow the f**k on down
Dogg pound, motherf**ker
(snoop)x2
Boom, and you know that
D.p.g's out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom...boom
My rearview mirror's vibrating and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom...boom

From the archives
I arise off the long beach streets
Will be comlete to the do is done to all that competes
Don't be alarmed as I swarm through
I warned you and your crew see wax
So, what's that?
A known fact
Battle that the habitat our men is deadly
You can get diluted
Or depends on where your head be
Striving for what your in for

And for your info mo' flow
Than the tightest nigga flowed in ninety-four
So, stand and deliver
Watch nigga's shiver
Quiver in they boots
As I mob with my troops
Through the east
Where the phonies get deleted
Be seated, and all the g's I know
Stay heated
(tray deee)
See I was born to be known as a thug and theif
So anyone with beef
I gotta slug to sleep
Peep, I'm not no nigga
Figga' he can come up
By getting a job so I mob
Not givin' a f**k
I'm the drama
Mama warned all they kids about
I mash up strapped
Get my dibs n' out
Hustler musn't trustin' a gat
To keep me fat, seeking victims
Pick 'em and then I stick them in track
My heat black
With the cereal number scratched out
Don't wear a glass shield but
You'll still be assed out
I'm mr. tray deee
And since they say "g" as my title
My method mainly homicidal

(snoop)x3
Boom, yeah, and you know that

Boom, boom, boom...boom
My rearview mirror vibrating cause my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom...boom

(tupac)
Ha, ha, ha
Could it be
My history living g like
Enemies that wanna see me
Would it be like
Picture me practicing perfection
Now hit the deck
Playa haters gettin' chin checked
When I hit the set
Watch how they fall
When I buck 'em all
We outlaw, westside
Playa, touch 'em all
I buck them all
Then remain ballin'
Out the moon
With my Glock cocked
Shot calling
Brothers fall then they crawl
And they beg for they life
Should of never tried to rush me
Your dead here tonight
This is thug life
Go tell them busta's
Up at bad boy records
That tricks got a big mouth
Busta better check it
I can see it plain as day
This game I play wide open
I pull the trigga
Dead figga with his eyes open
His pride broke
And I tried smoking
But, bailed out
Soon as they left me at the jail house
Mobbin' in my...

Death row out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom...boom

Years from now, perhaps we'll see

Live in peace, live in peace again

Peace on earth, can it be
Every child must be made aware
Every child must be made to care
Care enough for his fellow man
To give all the love that he can

I pray my wish will come true
For my child and your child too
He'll see the day of glory
See the day when men of good will
Live in peace, live in peace again

Peace on earth, can it be
Can it be
Bing: it's a pretty theme, isn't it?

Let me take you home, let me take you home

I can be your best friend; let me stick it in

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
And not just the tip
I wanna give you all of it
She's a model, all tall and shit
I'm Too $hort, but I ain't got a small dick
Just ask around
I fucked a lot of hoes in this town
I get down, I come long and wide
And when I pull it out they all wanna ride
The sun's comin' up, we started at four
I spit so much game it's hard to absorb
And everything you believe she hates
Like pimpin', she appreciates
'Cause my women, hope they understand the game
It's all about the money, give a fuck about the fame
You'll never get a chance to go out with me
If you a broke bitch, and you're not a real freak

[Chorus: Kokane]
You in the club lookin' grown, with your sexy skirt on
Let me take you home, let me take you home
I'll make you scream and moan, you know that it's on

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You came with your friend but she fat as fuck
And nann one of my homies wanna fuck, and now she wanna front
From the get-go I figured this is how it gon' be
Tell that little punk bitch that you ridin' with me
Don't stop, fo' hop
Hollywood Hills back to Too $hort's spot
You wanna roll, let's get ghost and jet
I wanna see if I can make you wet
'Cause you need it, let me beat it
Your lil' fat friend, actin' conceited
Sittin' in the corner; leave her, the bitch is a loner
Dancin', givin' me a boner (Ooh, mmm)

Me and you, boo, we need to roll on out
You sit here, in the bed where
A nigga just wanna put the head in, biatch

[Chorus: Kokane]
You in the club lookin' grown, with your sexy skirt on
Let me take you home, let me take you home
I'll make you scream and moan, you know that it's on
I can be your best friend; let me stick it in

[Verse 3: Daz Dillinger]
She wanna be my BFF
I'm on a time limit, got no time left
See, I'm a mathematician, you can add the bed
Subtract your clothes then divide your legs
When it all equals out, you can moan in bed
She gave me the P, gave her the D instead
See, you a hot mess with that booty and thang thang
Swangin' in the club when you drinkin' that drank drank
Smoke in the air, chillin' all in the zone
Fuck me on the dance floor with my clothes on
Too $hort, Snoop Dogg, uh, imagine that
She threw me the pussy, I threw the dick right back
See, I just wanna hit it and stick it in
'Cause I don't wanna be your boyfriend (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
And you don't wanna be my girlfriend
I told you once, don't wanna say it again

[Chorus: Kokane]
You in the club lookin' grown, with your sexy skirt on
Let me take you home, let me take you home

[Ice Cube]
Speak on it my nigga, speak on it (and my heat go)

[Chorus]
Only in California
Where niggas pull heat and run up on ya (get your grind on)
Only in California (California)
Where niggas pull heat and run up ya (run up on ya)

Ice Cube the motherfucking don
Snoop Doggy Dogg a.k.a. The Doggfather
Mack 10 alias the Chicken Hawk
Gangstas with rules
Cause you'se the niggas with no rules
Ain't got nothing to lose, we got everything to lose

Threw his ass in, he feel the fin of the barracuda
I negotiate Mack is the shooter
You the nigga on the journey strapped to this gurney
We break breads with accountants and attorneys
Currency never worry me (never)
Who's got the balls to murder me
Degree higher than a 33
Tell em what you drank (Hennessy)
Never tell em what you thinking
Never tell em where the body stinking
Fuck Lincoln, fuck Jackson, banking Franklin what you thanking
Hope your man come with the ransom
Let me see you dance on, no longer handsome
If you don't drop off than walk off, watch him, watch him

[Chorus]

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Them west coast niggas is real set trippas
Will get you for them zippers, on a quest for them chippas
Sliding while we riding, not even hitting switches
Hanging at the high school getting at them young bitches
I got the dove sacks, homies love that (who got the bud)
Where the bud at, hollering at my big homeboy who fresh out
Hanging at my grand mama house, homie burnt out
What you gonna do when you get out of jail (speak on it)
I'm gonna have some fun
What do you consider fun a ounce and about five hun
So I put him on a move that I know about
Hooked him with a home girl from the South (good looking out)
Money made, plug a player in the game
Especially when he represent the same thing I claim
Damn they don't make niggas like they used to
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce deuce (that's real)
Cause everybody wanna be a star
In the city of dope, a.k.a. caviar

[Chorus]

[Mack 10]
What have we a house full of cavi (no stress)
Well known riders from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes licking up so hard we sticking up niggas
Tired of the bullshit so we clicken up
Nigga please we ain't tripping off C's and B's
It's the West side Connect with the DPG's
For the cheese we jab with the gift of the gab
Always capping, Mack, Cube and Snoop rapping
Now how did that happen it's all good (fool)
So peep game If you could
Snoop be from Long Beach and I be from Inglewood
Now you despise cause it came to yo surprise
Two well known enemies now becoming allies
In Californ-I-A we parlay the G way
Some wear red and black and some sport blue and gray
So gangsta's don't dance we hang boogie and bang
So it's the Westside Connect with the Dogg Pound Gang

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]
There we have it, Ice motherfucking Cube
The big fish, rolling with the atomic dog
Snoop Doggy Dogg, down with the ring leader
Mack motherfucking 10, coming back once again
Nigga we make and spend nigga

And my heat goes boom boom boom boom boom boom

[Verse 1]
Your coat and hat are gone
I really can't look at your little empty shelf
A ragged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Don't look me in the eye
We lay in each others arms
But the room is just an empty space
I guess we lived it out
Something in the air
We smiled too fast
Then can't think of a thing to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Lived with the best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Nothing left to say

[Chorus]
Let's take what we can
I know you hold your head up high
We've raced for the last time
A place of no return
And there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
Something in the air
Something in my eye

[Verse 2]
Abracadoo, I lose you
We can't avoid the clash
The big mistake
Now we're going to pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Can't believe I'm asking you to go
We used what we could
To get the things we want
But we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I never wanted
Anyone more than you

[Pre-Chorus]
Lived all our best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Say what you will

[Chorus]
There's something in the air
Raced for the last time
But I know you hold your head up high
There's nothing we have to say
There's nothing in my eyes
But there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
There's something I have to say
There's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
I've danced with you too long
Danced with you too long
There's something in the air
Something in the air

[Chorus] 

[x2]:
"She was only sixteen, only sixteen
I loved her so
But she was too young, to fall in love
And I was too young to know" - Sam Cooke '(She Was) Only Sixteen'

[Verse One]:
Well it started out in the club, yeah
When I ordered a couple of Buds, yeah
And I broke up a couple of buds, yeah
And I rolled up a couple of Dutches, yeah
This thing turned into that, so, I
Ended up takin' her back home
And I ended up bendin' that girl back so
When I woke up I took that girl back home
But when I took her back to the crib, crib
She left her wallet in my whip, whip
So I opened it up, looked at her face, then looked in the sky like, "Shit, shit"
Then I thought to myself, "Is this her weight? And she born in '92?"
Then that must mean that I was too young to realize that I was a fool (damn)

[Chorus] 

[x2]:
She was only sixteen (yeah yeah), only sixteen (yeah yeah)
I loved her so (I loved her so)
But she was too young (too young), to fall in love (in love)
And I was too young to know (yeah)

[Sam Cooke sample]

[x2]:
She was only sixteen
I loved her so
I was too young to know
She was only sixteen

[Chorus] 

[x2]:
She was only sixteen (yeah yeah), only sixteen (yeah yeah)
I loved her so (I loved her so)
But she was too young (too young), to fall in love (in love)
And I was too young to know (yeah)
Slippin' through tunnels in the sand
I hold your heartbeat in my hand
You are getting away
Again, again, again, again, again

I lose my grip and start to drown
Still see your feet from underground
You are getting away
Again, again, again, again, again

It feels like I'm in a glass box
Invisible cape is on top
Keep on confessing your love for
Some other girl you would rather
I feel like a ghost in a white room
Your eyes keep starin' at me straight through
Only not to be two hearts goin' blind
One, two, three, so I kissed goodbye and left the room

Don't break my heart
This is when I lose my balance
This is when I lose all control
This is when I find the challenge
The challenge I can call my own
It's hard to fight a battle
When all my weapons are so far
Out of reach and balance
And I forget who you are

I think I'm about to fall
I think I'm about to fall
I think I'm about to fall
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa

Go fuck yourself!
Ya know ive been around the world and ai ai ai
Ive met a lot of people and what ive come to find out is
That people are the same, they all share the same fears
Share the same tears, and i over the years
So, im just gon be thankful to get what i got
And hold onto what i have can you dig that?
And what i do, i do for the benefit of me and my kids
Dig that
Talk to me

Chorus
Im so glad ive got my own
So glad that i can see
My life's a natural high
And they can't put no thang on me
(x2)

Its something kind of funny
How the man take your money
Be sure as he can be
Its such a way you'll never see
Its a terrible thing inside
When your natural high has died
What we can't turn to dope
And put all aside the hope
Chorus (x2)

Twinkling tinkling braids

We do all sorts of things
While you're in a modest place
Your conciouses only peace

Yeah i had to make peace with myself you know what i mean
I been getting high for the last what 15 20 years
So i told myself i wanna know what it feels like to be high fo life
And i mean man i tell ya it feels real good
You know coaching them lil kids out there on the football field
Doing my thug thizzle still but you know
Just being high for life is a different feeling
You should try it my brother im telling you its a great feeling
Can you dig that
I can dig it

More and more you grieve
(sing that song nephew)
Until you grow another need
You claim this fantasy
You'll have no reality

Chorus (x2)
Darling take a listen
This may be something that your missin
I know your times are funky
But you dont have to be no junkie

Chorus (x2)
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liars chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way
(Bounce
Bounce
Bounce
Bounce)

I can't believe that every day and every night (Bounce)
It's gettin' better with you out of my life (
