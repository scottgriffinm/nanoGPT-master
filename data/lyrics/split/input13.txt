I could, in the woods of Wisconsin
Wake up the cake, it's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when they do in Sicily

[Chorus]
I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know, I know it's you
You say "Hello" and then I say "I do"

[Verse 3]
Where you want to go? Who you want to be?
What you want to do? Just come with me
Oh, I saw God and I saw the fountains
You and me, girl, sittin' in the Swiss mountains
Me, oh my, oh, me and Guy O
Freer than a bird 'cause we're rocking Ohio
Around the world, I feel dutiful
Take a wife 'cause life is beautiful

[Outro]
I know, I know for sure
Ding, dang, dong, dong, deng, deng, dong, dong, ding, dang
I know, I know it's you
Ding, dang, dong, dong, deng, deng, dong, dong, ding, dang
Mother Russia, do not suffer, I know you're bold enough
I've been around the world and I have seen your love
I know, I know it's you
You say "Hello" and then I say "I do"

[Verse 1]
The California animal is a bear
Angeleno, but the devil may care
Summertime to talk and swear
Later maybe we could share some air
I'll take you to the movies there
We could walk through Leicester Square
What could be wetter than
An English girl, American man

[Chorus]
London in the summertime
Call me now, use the satellite
London in the summertime
Cuss me out and it'll feel alright

[Verse 2]
Hesitate but don't refuse
The choice was yours but you said choose
The look she used was green and sharp
Stabbed that boy all in his heart
Come what may the cosmos will
Take me up and down on Primrose Hill
What could be wetter than
An English girl, American man

[Chorus]
London in the summertime
Call me now, use the satellite
London in the summertime
Cuss me out and it'll feel alright

[Bridge]
Yeah, cuss me out and it'll feel alright
It's all right now
Call me now use the satellite
It's alright, it's alright
Down and out and it'll sound alright
It's alright now, it's alright

[Verse 3]
The California flower is a poppy, child
Felony sends me all the gold in your smile
Drift away from anyone you can
Nothing ever goes according to plan
Though I know that every river bends
Time to say hello to snow on the Thames
What could be wetter than
An English girl, American man

[Chorus]
London in the summertime
Call me now, use the satellite
London in the summertime
Cuss me out and it'll feel alright

Some people say you hate me
I don’t believe it’s true, things that you’re going through
Some people say you hate me
I don’t believe it’s you, things that you’re going through
Some people said a prayer for
No one you want to live, the eyes that once were his
Some people said a prayer for
The way you want to live, the eyes you want to give

[Verse 2]
Some people say you played me
I don’t care if it’s true, I’m waiting here for you
Some people say you made it
I’m not afraid to know, when things are getting low
Some people say you hate me
I don’t believe it’s true, things that you’re going through
Some people say you hate me
I don’t believe it’s you, things that you’re going through

[Verse 1]
Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down, get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one

[Chorus 1]
Well I like dirt, well I like dirt, well I like dirt

[Bridge 1]
The earth is made of dirt and wood
And I'd be water if I could
Live in a dream
In your stream, live in a dream

[Verse 1]
Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down, get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one

[Chorus 2]
I like dirt, I like dirt
I like dirt, I like dirt

[Verse 2]
Some come slow and overload
Must roll over when you're told
Let's unzip and let's unfold
A letter to the pet better, get it to go

[Chorus 1]
Well I like dirt, well I like dirt, well I like dirt

[Bridge 2]
Space is made of everything
And I'd be fire that I bring
Live in a dream
In your spring, live in a dream

Some come slow and overload
Must roll over when you're told
Let's unzip and let's unfold
A letter to the pet better, get it to go

I like dirt, I like dirt

[Guitar Solo]

Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun

[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Well, separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
Slittin' my throat, it's all I ever

[Verse 1]
I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I gotta take it on the otherside

[Verse 2]
Well, centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
A stranger thing could never change my mind
I gotta take it on the otherside

[Pre-Chorus]
Take it on the otherside
Take it on, take it on

[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
A-separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
A-slittin' my throat, it's all I ever

[Verse 3]
Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She want to know am I still a slut?
I gotta take it on the otherside

[Verse 4]
A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidature for the soul mate bled
Mmm, push the trigger and I pull the thread
I gotta take it on the otherside

[Pre-Chorus]
Take it on the otherside
Take it on, take it on

[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
A-slittin' my throat, it's all I ever

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down, and then it's born again

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
A-slittin' my throat, it's all I ever had

[Outro]
(How long?)
I don't, I don't believe it’s sad
A-slittin' my throat, is all I ever

[Verse 1]
Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder to tell what came first, um
Underwater where thoughts can breathe easily
Far away you were made in a sea, just like me

[Chorus]
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything

[Verse 2]
Staring straight up into the sky, oh, my, my
A solar system that fits in your eye, microcosm
You could die but you're never dead, spider web
Take a look at the stars in your head, fields of space kid

[Chorus]
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Psychic changes are born in your heart, entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same, bless your heart, girl
Kill the pressure it's raining on salty cheeks
When you hear the beloved song, I am with you

[Chorus]
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything

[Verse 1]
Porcelain
Are you wasting away in your skin?
Are you missing the love of your kin?
Drifting and floating and fading away
Porcelain
Do you smell like a girl when you smile?
Can you bear not to share with your child?
Drifting and floating and fading away

[Chorus]
Little lune, all day
Little lune

[Verse 2]
Porcelain
Do you carry the moon in your womb?
Someone said that you're fading too soon
Drifting and floating and fading away
Porcelain
Are you wasting away in your skin?
Are you missing the love of your kin?
Nodding and melting and fading away

[Chorus]
Little lune, all day
Little lune
Little lune, all day
Little lune

[Verse 1]
To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin
Python power straight from Monty
Celluloid loves got a John Frusciante
Spread your head and spread the blanket
She's too free and I'm the patient

[Pre-Chorus]
A black and white, a red and blue
Ah, things that look good on you
And if I scream, don't let me go
A purple stain, I know

[Verse 2]
Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood
Up to my ass in alligators
Let's get it on with the alligator haters
Did what you did, did what you said
What's the point yo what's the spread

[Pre-Chorus]
A black and white, a red and blue
Ah, things that look good on you
And if I scream, don't let me go
A purple stain, I know
And if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is where I go

[Chorus]
Knock on wood, we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood
It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is what I want to wear
Knock on wood, we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood

[Verse 3]
To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin
Feather-light but you can't move this
Farley is an angel and I can prove this
Purple is a stain upon my pillow
Let's sleep, weeping willow

[Pre-Chorus]
A black and white, a red and blue
Ah, things that look good on you
And if I scream, don't let me go
A purple stain, I know
And if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is where I go

[Chorus]
Knock on wood, we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood
It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is what I want to wear
Knock on wood, we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
One shot, all I need
I've got rhythm when I bleed
'Til death do us part
Break my heart so I can start

[Pre-Chorus 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Supercalifragilistic
Kiss me in the futuristic
Twisted but I must insist it's
Time to get on top of this

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
It's right on time
It's right on time
(It's right on time) It's right on time, it's right on time, it's right on time, it's right on time

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Discard to bombard
Calling all you shooting stars
Holy cow, bow wow wow
Now I'm here, I'm nowhere now

[Pre-Chorus 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Joan of Arc reincarnated
Maybe we could be related
So much blood to circulate
And so much space to decorate

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
It's right on time
It's right on time
(It's right on time) It's right on time, it's right on time, it's right on time, it's right on time

[Bridge: John Frusciante]
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
Plain and simple pain
I want to but I can't complain
Death row, let us go
It's time to blow up for the show

[Pre-Chorus 3: Anthony Kiedis]
All the world reverberated
Coming through, we motorcaded
Start up when we operated
Turning up in solid stated

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
Oh, Lord!

[Verse 1]
Road trippin' with my two favorite allies
Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies
It's time to leave this town, it's time to steal away
Let's go get lost anywhere in the USA
Let's go get lost, let's go get lost

[Pre-Chorus]
Blue, you sit so pretty west of the one
Sparkle light with yellow icing, just a mirror for the sun

[Chorus]
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for

[Verse 2]
So much has come before those battles lost and won
This life is shining more forever in the sun
Now let us check our heads and let us check the surf
Staying high and dry's more trouble than it's worth in the sun

[Chorus]
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for

[Verse 3]
In Big Sur we take some time to linger on
We three hunky dory's got our snake finger on
Now let us drink the stars, it's time to steal away
Let's go get lost right here in the USA
Let's go get lost, let's go get lost

[Pre-Chorus]
Blue, you sit so pretty west of the one
Sparkle light with yellow icing, just a mirror for the sun

[Chorus]
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
Your smiling eyes are just a mirror for

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time in a neighborhood not far away
Was a dude named Timothy, he tried to steal a car a day
He kept a screwdriver close by, he did autotheft
Got with a lil' crew and now he not doing it by himself
One day timothy broke in a truck, quarter million bucks
What the fuck, crazy luck, now he think he rich as fuck
They hit the mall bought it all jordans, bellies, pellet jackies
Six slugs in his grill, all the hoes throwing pussy at him
Little did he know that that dough came from Black & Joe
Joe from down on Coasta Ave and all he did was slang the snow
So Joe sent Black with scraps and goons to catch him at his momma home
Rang the bell, then 'ventually put two shots in his momma dome

[Hook]
Here's a little story bout a boy that hit licks
Dope man, dope man, gimme all the bricks
Zone 6 niggas are always hard
Don't talk that trash cause we'll pull your card
Here's a little story bout a boy that hit licks
Dope man, dope man, gimme them bricks
Zone 6 niggas are always hard
Don't talk that trash cause we'll pull your card

[Verse 2]
Oh shit Tim mad as fuck, angry as a bitch
He didn't know, he didn't give a thought it'll turn like this
Now he mad, man he really mad and he want revenge
And he vows on his mama life he gon' do 'em in
Now he lying down coasta ave, black ain't hard to find
There they go Black and Joe and murder's on his mind
So he let loose the fucking gage, everbody flees
And he catches Black straight in his back he on his knees
Joe was bussin' like a fuckin Russian he barely escaped
But his right hand man is bleeding to death in his face
Tim's gone, he back at the spot, holding on his scrap
And he know that ain't nothing he can do to bring her back

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now big Joe don't give a fuck no more, he can't even love no more
He took 40 g's up out his stack, and set kill tim and his crew
Now Timothy is laying low, that quarter mill's not here no more
His momma she not here no more, and Black will never breath fo sho'
He drinking gin and blowing dro, he sadder than he ever been
He looks at his whole crew, then thinks to himself we were never friends
He can't run away from this, he don't got no where to go
Plus the police looking for em' they was watching Black and Joe
Damn what can he do this shit is real
Cause if he make the wrong mistake, then he'll get killed
Jumped in the car, him and his boys he so confused
High speed chase, they crashed it down, just watch it on the news

[Hook]
Remember this shit right here?
This what we do. W-E-E-D
I shouldn't have to tell you to roll up the blunts
They should already be lit. Bitch

Don't know how I wake up sober I go to sleep (So high)
Can't even keep my eyes open
'Member first time I tried smoking

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Jay Rock]
My people don't love me
Why we hate each other?
Why we kill our brothers, why we hurt our mothers?
My people don't love me
We can love one another
We should stick together because we're all we got
My people don't love me
Why we ride on another, need to love one another
We all we got
My people don't love me
I said we all we got, I swear to God dog we all we got
My people don't love me

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
This whole world's spillin' senseless killing
Universe beyond evil, one topic to serve
Be my black people, we be missing the point like Shaq's freethrow
Sean Taylor, life gone because of haters
A nigga he known tried home invasion, went wrong
Bullet penetrated his leg, femur bone
Days later, wake arrangements, flowers to be catered
That was so impatient, take him from the next man
'Cause he ain't got the will to hustle like he can
Niggas would rather steal than think of a righteous plan
To get residuals, kill for dividends
This life is critical, we living in a time where
9-year olds tote 9's
Turn 10, it's Mac 10's and coke lines
I wonder why successful black man gotta die from a black man

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people don't love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Can't be a positive black role model
Leading the future with no haters to follow
Now that's fucked up, if I ever wanna see
Success, I gotta see death? Be famous for what?
He aiming for higher learning, you aiming to shoot him down
He flying straight, you wanna u-turn him
You burn your brother's bridges
His accomplishments making way for your children
Still you don't compliment, inconsiderate black pride
No, never been, never win, gotta lose
That's the slope that's for the black heritage
We play the fool better than comedians
Disobedient dude no respect, ethics
I refuse to be a statistic
But changing my community don't seem realistic
Show me an African American doing right
I'll show you one that will kill his ass tonight

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people don't love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
We stuck together back in slavery days
Martin and Malcolm them dudes paved the way
The bullshit we doing, I know they're turning over in their graves
The shit need to stop today
Yeah the die for the cause, some like Jesus for us
To become better people, think about it
We used to run from the KKK
But now we running from our brothers that be holding them k's
Man, never thought there'd be days like this
Can't trust your homies that you're hanging with
Damn shame, why you kill a nigga over a chain
When you could get up on your hustle and get the same thing
United we stand tall, divided we all fall
Let's leave this bullshit behind y'all
On the real, the envy and the hate need to stop
Black people we all we got

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people don't love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we

[Outro: Jay Rock]
Y'all better wake up and smell the coffee
We all we got man
It's black on black killing each other man it needs to stop
Real talk
Black people need to smarten up
We all we got

[Verse: The World Famous Tony Williams & DeRay Davis]
One glad morning, when this life is over, I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end, oh, I'll fly away

[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams & DeRay Davis]
I'll fly away, oh, glory
I'll fly away
When I die Hallelujah bye and bye
I'll fly away

[Chorus]
Oh she's only 17
Whine and wine and wound up over everything
Bloody Mary breakfast busting up the scene
Brothers frightened and when's a baby going to sleep
Hidden ship that sails away

[Verse 1]
Said it's a culmination of a story and a goodbye session
It's the tick of our time and the tick in her hair
That made me feel so strange
So I could call you baby I could call you dammit
It's a one in a million
Oh it's the rolling of her Spanish tongue
That made me want to stay

[Chorus]
Oh she's only 17
Wind and wind and wound up over everything
Bloody Mary breakfast busting up the scene
Brothers frightened when's a baby going to sleep

[Verse 2]
Hidden ship that sails away
Said it's a culmination of a story and a goodbye session
It's the tick of our time and the tick in her hair
That made me feel so strange
So I could call you baby I could call you dammit
It's a one in a million
Oh it's the rolling of her Spanish tongue
That made me want to stay

[Outro]
I could call you baby I could call you dammit
It's a one in a million
Oh it's the rolling of her Spanish tongue
That made me want to stay

[Intro]
Uh, let me get a turkey sandwich, uh (Woo), lettuce, tomato (Bitch)

[Verse 1]
My name Mac Miller, who the fuck are you?
Well, my crew too live, but I ain't Uncle Luke
And I ain't no hipster, but girl, I can make your hips stir
From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher
Welcome (Woo,) to the Cam Rellim chronicles
Lookin' out my monocle
I'm dodgin' obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cock-a-roach, I'm heroin 'cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and fuckin' shiny, word to Mop & Glo
Tryin' to get a mansion, ain’t nobody here gon' find my room
Money gon' be green, I guarantee you that my slide stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template
The next day, these losers always goin' with what's trendy
My pen game is somethin' these motherfuckers have never seen
All City Champion, everybody is second-string
No need to testify (Testify,) for the best is I (Best is I)
And anybody in my way gon' be left to die

[Chorus]
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back (Back)
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve, bitch
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back (Back)
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
Anything you need, you can find it at the market

[Verse 2]
I got my own stickers now, so literally I’m everywhere
Hundred different shoes, still feel the need to cop a fresher pair
These motherfuckers treat me like it’s just my second year
Fool, you better get prepared
Don't know 'bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
Frick Park Market, where we kickin' out the garbage
Sick bars, I’ve been a boss, so stick around and watch it
Didn't fit around no college campus, chillin', writin' on top of planet Earth
Fuck who's first, It’s just 'bout who the hardest
On my own, too, fuck who's sayin' different
Every time I rhyme, I get that Punxsutawney feelin'
I’m the starter, you a fill-in
You a martyr, I’m just killin'
Gettin' harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin' it and goin' in
Don’t call me Malcolm if you didn't fuckin' know me then
And if you lonely, girl, I could be your only friend
You got some shit to say? I suggest you hold it in, bitch

[Chorus]
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back (Back)
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
If you don't hold me down, for all I care, you can starve, bitch
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back (Back)
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
Anything you need, you can find it at the market

[Outro]
Yeah
And this is Blue Slide Park

[Intro: Valerie]
Yes, all I could say is yes
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Like the wrong pill
Promise me when they all love you that you’ll remember me
When you fuck them, you'll see my face
My body is yours
Every Thursday

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
It seems like pain and regret are your best friends (Ooh, oh yeah)
Cause everything you do leads to them, why?
Run, run
Yeah, but baby, I could be your best friend, ooh, ooh
And baby, I could fuck you right (Ooh whoa)

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Baby, you could have it all (Ooh yeah)
Baby, you could have it all (Ooh yeah)
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star, oh yeah
Baby, you could have it all
Baby, you could have it all
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Woah
Blaming all your sins on your best friends, ohh, oh yeah
And nothing's never ever your fault
And nothing's your fault baby, no
Well baby, you don't need your best friends (Woah)
Yeah, cause I got everything you want (Woo, ehh yeah)

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Baby, you could have it all (Ooh baby)
Baby, you could have it all (Ooh yeah)
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star, baby you could be a star
Baby, you could have it all (Ooh)
Baby, you could have it all (Ooh yeah)
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star (Oh yeah)

[Interlude: Valerie]
If, all I could say is yes
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Like the wrong pill
Promise me when they all love you that you’ll remember me
When you fuck them, you'll see my face
My body is yours
Give them any other day but Thursday
You belong to me
Every Thursday
I'll wait for you
I'll be beautiful for you
Every Thursday
I exist
Only on Thursday

[Outro: The Weeknd & Valerie]
Ohh, ohh
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday, Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday, Thursday (Ooh)
I love the guitars

[Verse 1]
Hello, welcome to the other side
You're lost
Baby, step outside your mind
You've been really good
You've been really good
You've been thinking bout being bad ever since I put you on
She got money for blow
Just check her damn nose
Prescription ain't an issue
You can mix it with the "oh"
And if you wanna do it, baby
I'm right here with you
I'm on cloud nine
Baby, you're behind
You can follow me
You can follow me if you want

[Hook]
To go downtown with the drugs in your body
Take that step, you're the life of the party
Know that step, you're the life of the party
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I got two little ladies
I got one little room
There's a room full of liquor
Baby, what you wanna do?
The way you move got me feeling so "uhh"
I been thinking about it, baby
I been thinking about it lately
I'm so far gone and you are too

[Hook]
Show me how you go downtown
With the drugs in your body
Take that step, you're the life of the party
Know that step, you're the life of the party
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
I love how you touch
How you feel, how you breathe
Baby, how you do it so good?
How you twist with your hips got the room so small, baby
And, girl, please don't go
You're gonna please my boys
You been thinking about it, baby
Yeah, you're a star
Oh, you knocked one down
Girl, you knocked it down
Girl, there's one, two, three

[Hook]
Go downtown with the drugs in your body
Take that step, you're the life of the party
Know that step, you're the life of the party
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I love her, today
‘Cause it's Wednesday, I won't be late
Ooh, now I need to know
If you're feeling when I'm free

[Chorus]

Why are you calling again? (Oh, again)
But it's not Thursday, baby why you calling?

[Chorus]

Why you rushing me, baby?
It's only us, alone

Just let me get in my zone
I'll be making love to her through you
So let me keep my eyes closed

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
And I won't see a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right

But I'm in need tonight baby
I've been alone for too long
Ohh, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
So, I won't say a damn thing

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man, if pole dancing's an art, you know how many fuckin' artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail, got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well girl let's go, walk your broken heart through that door
Sit your sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own
Aw yeah

[Part I]

[Verse 1]
I got you
I got a hold of you
You said you out to see
How we roll
Well then take a seat, oh yeah
Well, take a seat
And watch your ass go

[Pre-Hook]
Break it, drop it, drink it, spill it
Baby, touch your body, body
You gotta taste it, feel it, I've been on it baby
Don't you worry, you gotta keep up

[Hook]
Cause I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been gone, I've been gone

[Verse 2]
Girl
Why don't you fuck what you heard, baby
Cause I been gone
You can see for yourself, little lady
Girl, I lit a little something
Something something, for you
There's enough to pass around
Yeah, yeah, yea yea yea yea

[Pre-Hook]
Oh well just
Break it, drop it, drink it, spill it
Baby, touch your body, body
You gotta taste it, feel it, I've been on it baby
Don't you worry, don't you worry, you gotta keep up

[Hook]
Cause I've been gone
I've been gone, I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been gone, I've been gone, I've been gone

[Breakdown]
I've been gone

[Part II]

[Verse 3]
Hope I make it home
You'll be thinking of it
I got the whole city on my side, tonight, tonight
Watch us rock it out
Watch us leave the ground
After the show is done
You can take me to yours
But my lungs so muddy
I love the way it tastes
Drink it till I'm ugly baby
Fuck me while I'm faded
Feel that through my denims
Baby girl, I gotcha
I'm only 21 so I do it when I wanna
Gone from the codeine, 'methazine, lean
Got me feelin' kinda weak
And it's kinda hard to breathe
But you're turning 23, so I'll fuck you if you need
In your birthday suit
I'ma give you what you fiend, oh
But I ain't taking off my black boots
I'm fallin'
Cause I'm numb from the neck down
I'm sorry
You won't know that I can't feel it
I can win a fuckin' Oscar
By the way I fuckin' hid it
And you'll never fuckin' know
I'll never fuckin' show it
Except when I be wheezy from another cup of potion
Dirty Sprite toastin'
Fast life, fuck slow
Low life for life

[Outro]
Let the meds flow, let the night flow
I'm so gone, let these meds flow
I'm so gone, let these meds flow
I'm so gone, I'm so gone
Woah, woah, oh
Said I'm gone, gone, gone
Woah oh
I'm so gone
Gone

[Intro]
Bom bom bom bom bom

[Hook]
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep

My mama, mama, mama
I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me and I

[Verse 1]
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me no curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz somebody cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot
A living legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you Mama
I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
Mama, you know I love you so, and I'll never let you go
And I wrote this song just so you know that when you go

[Hook]
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep

My mama, mama, mama
I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me and I

[Outro]
And this life is all a dream
And my real life starts when I go to sleep
My mama, mama, mama
(Crying/Gunshot)

[Intro]
Whoa, with a nigga like me
Whoa, with a nigga like me

[Verse 1]
She said please, mercy me, mercy me
Let me fall outta love, before you fuck her, before you fuck her
She begged me, she gave me all her pills
Now my back hurts, she lost control

[Hook]
Now she pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
Baby got her pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
She said it won't be long before she falls out of love
It won't be long before she falls out of love

[Bridge: Martina Topley-Bird & The Weeknd]
Sandpaper kisses, papercut bliss
Don't know what this is, but it all leads to this
You're gonna leave her
You have deceived her
You're just a bird
Just a bird

[Verse 2]
I tried to kiss you
But you never let me miss you
But you never let me miss you
I thought I told you
I'm not him, I'm not him
Look what you did, nobody forced your hand
And don't you fall for a nigga like me, I begged, I begged

[Hook]
Now you're pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
Now you're pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
She said it won't be long before she falls out of love
It won't be long, before she falls out of love

[Bridge: Martina Topley-Bird & The Weeknd]
Sandpaper kisses, papercut bliss (Oh, my love)
Don't know what this is, but it all leads to this
You're gonna leave her (If she only knew)
You have deceived her
You're just a bird
Just a bird

[Outro]
Just a bird
(Just a bird)
Just a bird
(Just a bird)
Just a bird
(Just a bird)
Just a bird
(Just a bird)
Just a bird
(Just a bird)
Just a bird
(Crows cawing)

[Verse 1]
I'm paying for all my father's sins
So I'mma thank him for you
I'mma thank him for you
My serotonin's gone a while ago
Girl, it's gone cause of you
It's been gone cause of you

[Chorus]
They say (they say), they want heaven
They say, they want God
I say, I got heaven
Well I say, I am God

[Verse 2]
I never prayed a moment in my life
Girl, I'm rewarded with you
I've been rewarded with you
So baby let me kiss your inner thigh
Let me kiss it for you
I can kiss it for you

[Chorus]
Well they say (they say), they want heaven
They say, they want God
I say, I have heaven
I say, I am God

[Verse 1]
Ball so hard, muthafuckas wanna fine me
These niggas can’t find me, cause I’m probably in the air
Cuttin’ through the clouds in a Lear G-5′in
Bitch nigga, we mobbin’
Rich nigga, we buyin’, any bitch we wanna
And it go ‘room when I hit that corner in a batmobile
Strapped for real, bullets hit ya head, make ya head go still
Niggas always ask why you rap so real
Cause I be in the trap sellin’ crack on pills
Got them racks on ill, money so sick
I don’t give a fuck who you run and go get
Ross bought a boat cause I wanna go fish
With his all yellow Rollie got these niggas so pissed
Shittin’ on these niggas where my toilet
Jordan’s, you ain't never seen ‘em cause I’m ballin’
Boy the shit I'm spitting be so retarded
Cause I don’t even write I’m just recording
Got an AP, Rolex, Cartier to the Hublot
I ain't even have to hit the bank
I bought this shit from a few shows, with a new ho in my view so
Beautiful, I see a few hoes
Anchorman, that forecast
I say it’s coming and they move the snow
Ha, got a young bitch look like Nicki tho (Nicki tho)
I said could ya keep a secret just like Vicki tho
I let her sip Ciroc and hit the sticky tho
Told her she can kiss my neck but just don’t give me no hickies ho
Cause my baby momma be trippin’
All these wheels I be whippin’
All this paper I be gettin’
I be dunkin on ‘em: Blake Griffin
Nigga, I got now, you got no!
No W’s for the loser’s tho
All this ice like a jewelry show
Ride through slow like a funeral
Look at my neck, take a look at my wrist
Look at my pockets, take a look at my bitch
Let me take ‘em way back
Thinkin' like ’86, all eyes on me
When I step up in the club I'm feelin’ like Rich
Porter that is, I slaughter that bitch
Don’t touch that work, I order that shit
I wouldn’t give a damn, what corner that is
If they cop that work, I'm goin’ to that bitch
Wit’ a whole sack, no rap, weed, pills, dope, crack
Drop it right on ‘em like "hold that"
Feds takin’ pictures like Kodak
Tappin’ my phone, watching my home
They watchin’ me and I’m watching the throne?
She suckin’ me and I’m watching the dome
Perc in my system and I’m in the zone, yeah, I’m gettin’ gone
Phantom, Ghost, like I'm chasin' Pacman
All this money on my mind, you see it in my catscan
Nigga

[Intro]
Put 'em up
Now put 'em up
MMG (Now put 'em up)

[Verse 1]
I don't know what these haters be talking
I pop any chick that I want
Put your girl in the back of that 'Bach
Main two reasons she ain't gon' front
I menage with her and her friend, put my main homie on one
But my neck and wrist so stupid
And my pockets be on so dumb
Because I'm on one, haters we never condone em
Penthouse full of some bad bitches
Me and my homies gon' show 'em something, it's MMG
Ridin' round in this Lambo goin' ham dog on Collins
And I'm leaning off of that purple shit
So don't judge me like your honor, oh!

[Chorus]
I'm feeling so cold
Yeah we riding dirty but the whip clean
But think a couple years ago
I was in a cell when I was eighteen
And what's up with these new bitches
And why they all wanna fuck so easy
And what's up with these new niggas
And why they all wanna talk so greasy

[Verse 2]
But get it while you here boy
'Cause I got that money to make you disappear boy
It's on my mind don't make me put it on your head boy
I been superfly since Rozay took me to that clearport
Ahh nigga what you know about that
Riding round town with like four or five straps
Truck full of raw and we dipping from the law
I just came from the cell I ain't going right back
Pull up in a Benz they ain't gon' like that
Box these niggas they'll never fight back
Diamonds on my neck, and my wrist white black
And I'm killing these niggas, I ain't even write that
I be stunting 'cause I ain't never had
Got these bitches waving like they tryna catch a cab
They wanna fuck a nigga good so they can touch a bag
She had the nerve to say she love me and I fuckin' laughed

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say? (Say)
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breakin' up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
K-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy), k-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play (Play)
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop callin' me, I'm kinda busy

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone (No)
Out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone (No)
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Boy, the way you blowin' up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home 'cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer

[Bridge: Lady Gaga & Beyoncé, Both]
It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringin'
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central S-Station (Station)
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls, 'cause I'll be dancin'
('Cause tonight I'm dancin') 'Cause I'll be dancin'
('Cause tonight I'm dancin') 'Cause I'll be dancin'
('Cause tonight I'm dancin')
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls, 'cause I'll be dancin'

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Beyoncé]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephonin' me)
Stop telephonin' me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)

Stop telephonin' me, eh, eh eh, eh, eh!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
(D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-Darkchild)
My telephone, m-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
My telephone, m-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
We're sorry- We're sorry
The number you have reached is not in service at this time
Please check the number or try your call again

[Verse 1]
It's been like this from the start
One piece after another to make my heart
You mistake the game for bein' smart
Stand here, sell this, and hit your mark
But the sound of the steel
And the crush, and the grind
It all screams, "Who am I to decide my life?"
But in time it all dies
There's nothing left inside
Just rusted metal that was never even mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I would scream
But I'm just this hollow shell
Waiting here
Begging, "Please, set me free so I can feel"
Hey

[Chorus]
Stop trying to live my life for me
I need to breathe
I'm not your robot
Stop telling me I'm part of the big machine
I'm breaking free
Can't you see?
I can move, I can speak, without somebody else operating me
You gave me eyes, and now I see
I'm not your robot, I'm just me

[Verse 2]
All this time, I've been misled
There were nothing but crossed wires in my head
I've been taught to think that what I feel
Doesn't matter at all 'til you say it's real

[Pre-Chorus]
I would scream
But I'm just this hollow shell
Waiting here
Begging, "Please, set me free so I can feel"
Hey

[Chorus]
Stop trying to live my life for me
I need to breathe
I'm not your robot
Stop telling me I'm part of the big machine
I'm breaking free
Can't you see?
I can move, I can speak without somebody else operating me
You gave me eyes, and now I see
I'm not your robot, I'm just me (Ahh, ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh)
I'm not your robot, I'm just me (Ahh, ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh)
I'm not your robot

[Pre-Chorus]
I would scream
But I'm just this hollow shell
Waiting here
Begging, "Please, set me free so I can feel"
Hey

[Chorus]
Stop trying to live my life for me
I need to breathe
I'm not your robot
Stop telling me I'm part of the big machine
I'm breaking free
Can't you see?
I can move, I can speak without somebody else operating me
You gave me eyes, and now I see
I'm not your robot, I'm just me (Ahh, ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh)
I'm not your robot, I'm just me (Ahh, ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh)
I'm not your robot

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card, card
And all I got was a brand new sports car, oh

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Kanye West]
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Dad cracked a joke, all the kids laughed
But I couldn't hear him all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Kanye West]
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
My god-sister getting married by the lake
But I couldn't figure out who I'd wanna take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave 'fore they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Kanye West]
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)

[Outro: Kanye West]
Ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo
And I, and I can't stop
No, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, I can't stop
No, can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it
Ooh, ooh, oooh
Hoo-hoo, ho-ho-hoo
Ooh-hoo

This is the life

Yea,this is the life
This is the life

[Verse]
Tony killed his own man Ty for a whole brick
Lined him all up and gave him the whole clip
Said he wasn't eatin', he wanted his own shit
And not to mention Ty was fuckin' his old bitch
But Ty wasn't a shooter, that nigga just sold bricks
And Tony he was reckless he never had no picks
Tony was like the Alpo, Ty was the Lil' Rich
Two niggas with a dream that plotted on goin' rich
Started as a team, but Ty he got on quick
Jealousy the reason that Ty got left all stiff
Got Tony at the viewing, Ty mom crying to him
He hug her, he tell her whoever did this, he gone do 'em
From there it was a silence, she ain't condone violence
But they killed her only son so when he said it she just nodded
And he told her that he got her, Grimy at its best
Like Tony had a cold he feelin' slimy in his chest
Yes, he had the nerve to carry the casket
Strapped up before he went he had to carry his ratchet
He nervous, walkin' like he tryna carry him faster
Nigga even grabbed the shovel tried to bury him faster
Next week he at the mall, Rollie on his arm
Two bad bitches with him laughing having a ball
Seen Ty cousin Paul, Paul couldn't believe it
Same nigga asked him for a front last weekend
Walkin' round the mall, Louie on, bags Neiman
With the gold diggin bitches Little Ke and Bad Trina
He dapped Tony up, tryna cap Tony up
In his head thinkin' how he gone clap Tony up
But Tony he ain't worried, cause he strapped Tony up
Seven days of running he already turned it up
He got Pauly burnin up, he ready to ride
He know Tony a killer but he ready to die
Ahhhhh, smell the death all in the air
Pauly thinkin' bout puttin' a check all on his head, but he can't
Cause Tony he done killed his first cousin
If he let somebody else do it it won't mean nothin'
He wanna' see him bleedin', he wanna see him gaspin'
Wanna' watch him die slow, like he sufferin' from cancer
Feel that Tony did it but he don't really know the answer
So he gone let it burn until he get confirmed
Couple months fly by, Tony on the high rise
Started flippin now he got them chickens in like Popeye
Pauly still gettin' it, always been a top guy
He ain't really club but tonight, he gone stop by
Seen Little Ke and them, it was two or three of them
Standin' in the line he said "I'mma pay for me and them"
Pulled his money out, started countin' it and teasin' 'em
You know Ke gold diggin' ass just wanna' be with him
Slid up in the club told the waiter "Give me three of 'em"
Bottles of the spade, now Ke just wanna leave with him
He said "Where yo phone at", she said "Where you goin' at?"
He said "I'mma slide out," she said "I'mma ride out"
Told her friends "call ya'll tomorrow when I get to my mom house"
They got right up out of there, took her to his side house
Soon as they got in the crib, she just blew his mind out
Wasted off them bottles Pauly bought she on her nod out
But Pauly he ain't goin to sleep
Grab her phone up off the sheets
Took it to the living room, her messages he goin through
Scroll up to Tony name, he text her "What you doin' boo"
She text him back "I'm in the crib" he text her back "you comin' through?"
She text "where I'm comin' to?" he text back
"1022, Woodstock in North Philly, take the E-Way to the zoo"
She said that "I'm comin' now", look-e here what Pauly found
Got the drop on Tony where he living and its goin' down
Couple weeks later Pauly on Woodstock
Sittin' in the minivan, tinted with his hood cocked
Tony just rode up, Pauly got the good drop
.44 in his hand bout to make the hood rock
Tony slippin', Pauly all dippin'
Walkd' up on his car like "What's poppin' lil' nigga"
Tony lookin' shocked, his Glock was in his box
So he couldn't grab for it, Paul said "That's yo' ass boy"
He said "you still need that work that you asked for?"
Dropped it all on his lap it was four and a half raw
Tony he lookin' crazy he know that's his last straw
And Pauly just let it go, put his brains on the dashboard
POW!

Air, Air

[Verse 1: Kev Nish]
Yeah, yeah
I never let love in, I left it on the dresser
I never let love leave an impression
But like a fingerprint now I found you at my fingertips
And I just wanna text you every second
You're always on my mind like reflections on my shades
I gotta look away cause I could stare at you for days
I can give you every millisecond every day (You, you)
You can't buy the time that I can give away

[Bridge: Vincent Frank]
I'm not gonna lie I want your body
But I know there's more than just your body
I don't want you with just somebody
Ima let you know

[Chorus: Vincent Frank]
I need to sit down girl
'Cause I can't breathe
You take my breath away from me
Ooh, girl, can't you see
What you've done to me?
You take my breath away from me

[Post-Chorus: Vincent Frank]
You got me, got me fighting for air, air
You got me, got me fighting for air, a- air

[Verse 2: Prohgress]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My life isn't measured by the breaths I take
But the moments with you that take my breath away
I don't need you in heels but I need your head over
Come a little closer
Rest your head up on my shoulder (You, you)
Now you got me smiling
Blown cover
Face with them cupcakes
No butter
They say love is blind but
You're so fine
If I keep you in my life I'd never close my eyes

[Bridge: Vincent Frank]
I'm not gonna lie I want your body
But I know there's more than just your body
I don't want you with just somebody
Ima let you know

[Chorus: Vincent Frank]
I need to sit down girl
Cause I can't breathe
You take my breath away from me
Ooh girl can't you see
What you've done to me

[Post-Chorus: Vincent Frank]
You got me, got me fighting for air, air
You got me, got me fighting for air, a-air

Is there any time left for love?
Le-Lemme take a breath
Suffocating

[Chorus: Vincent Frank]
I need to sit down girl
Cause I can't breathe
You take my breath away from me
Ooh girl can't you see

You got me, got me fighting for air, a-air

You, you, you, got me, got me fighting for air, a-air

[Intro: Nashawn 'Ox' Breedlove (as Lotto)]
Fuck this coward, dawg
Free World in the motherfuckin' house, what's goin' on, baby?
Yo, it's time to get rid of this coward right here once and for all
Sick of this motherfucker
Check this shit out
Huh
Huh, yo

[Verse 1: Nashawn 'Ox' Breedlove (as Lotto)]
Yo, I'll spit a racial slur, honky, sue me
The shit is a horror flick, but the black guy doesn't die in this movie
Fuckin' with Lotto? Dawg, you gotta be kiddin'
That makes me believe you really don't have an interest in livin'
You think these niggas gon' feel the shit you say?
I got a better chance joinin' the KKK
On some real shit, though, I like you
That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to
Fuck "Lotto", call me your leader
I feel bad that I gotta murder that dude from "Leave It To Beaver"
I used to like that show, now you got me in fight-back mode
But oh well, if you gotta go, then you gotta go
I hate to do this, I would love for this shit to last
So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass
And all's well that ends okay
So I'll end this shit with a "Fuck you", but have a nice day!

[Verse 2: Eminem (as B-Rabbit)]
Ward, I think you were a little hard on the Beaver
So was Eddie Haskell, Wally, and Ms. Cleaver
This guy keeps screamin', he's paranoid
Quick, someone get his ass another steroid!
"Blah-badi-boo-blah, blah-blah-badi-bloo-blah!"
I ain't hear a word you said: "Hippity hoopla!"
Is that a tank-top or a new bra?
Look! Snoop Dogg just got a fuckin' boobjob
Didn't you listen to the last round, meathead?
Pay attention, you're sayin' the same shit that he said
Matter of fact, dawg, here's a pencil
Go home, write some shit, make it suspenseful
And don't come back until somethin' dope hits you
Fuck it, you can take the mic home with you
Lookin' like a cyclone hit you
Tank-top screamin', "Lotto, I don't fit you!"
You see how far the white jokes get you
Boys like, "How Vanilla Ice gon' diss you?"
My motto: "Fuck Lotto!"
I'll get the seven digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow

[Intro: T.I.]
Say Foxx? (Yeah-eah-eah...)
I had, I had a chick man (Yeah-eah-eah...)
She went and did me real wrong, I mean (Yeah-eah-eah...)
I did the same thing to her but
She ain't have no right to do me like that though dawg, for real
(Yeah-eah-eah...)

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
You, been seeing him, and I know
And I was with her, and you knew about it
But I was too bli-i-ind to see it baby
And you was out here doing the same thing as me
I wanna ask, has he been by the crib?
Has he been in our, car? And did you let him, drive?
Cause she's been by the house, she's been in the car
I've even let her push the Porsche around a couple times

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]
Oh, we were so the same
I don't know why I can't see it baby
And it ain't a point to feeling blue
You're just like me and I'm just like you

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
You're just like me, shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that Bub, giving all them dudes hugs
And you just like me, she don't know how to act
On the floor backin it back, man I can't be mad
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
Now it's so easy for me to imagine what you been doing baby
So I don't even have to ask (No)
Cause you ain't the only one that's been keeping secrets baby
So it ain't no sense in me playing back
And I, can't say nothing cause I did you wrong
And I was on some bullshit when I let that bitch up in our home
She's also known just like me
And she played the game like one of my homies

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]
Oh, we were so the same
I don't know why I can't see it baby
And it ain't a point to feeling blue
You're just like me and I'm just like you

[Hook: Jamie Foxx & T.I.]
You're just like me, shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that Bub, giving all them dudes hugs
And you just like me, she don't know how to act
On the floor backin it back, man I can't be mad
She just like me-e-ee-e-e (Getting money, having fun, man she)
Just like me-e-ee-e-e (In the club, throwing ones, man she)
Just like me-e-ee-e-e (24's on the Range)
Just like me... (Go on shawty do your thang)

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Hey!
Shawty who you fooling? You, know I'm way too cool for you
To run that game when we play me, trying to do me like I be doing you
Say you heard I was screwing her just like I hear he doing you
Why you worried about me doing me? I see you doing you
I can make her better though, you gonna let him ruin you
Just for the record know I wouldn't have her unless I could have the two of you
I know why he pursuing you, that booty do be moving boo
Late night, straight pipe, that ain't nothing new to you
Wait a minute, can't tell me shit, wanna tell me something, tell me this
If I would've never would've hit that chick, would you even ever know that dude existed?
Naw, got me twisted, yo ass goodbye I've kissed it
Now you all on his dick, shawty look at this bitch

[Hook: Jamie Foxx & T.I.]
You're just like me, shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that Bub, giving all them dudes hugs (Yeah)
And you just like me, she don't know how to act (No one's wrong, shawty)
On the floor backin it back, man I can't be mad (But that don't take on from the fact)
She just like me-e-ee-e-e (You feelin' a man with an ego, ya know)
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me

[Intro]
Yo DJ Hi-Tek
Drop the motherfuckin' beatbox dog
Bring that next-level shit
Uh, yo, for real
That's what I'm talking about
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Totally psychic, open your mind quick as the vibe kicks
Moederfok it, I skeem this vibe's rou
Jislaaik yo
Yo yo yo yo check out this hot flow
I go by the name of
N-I-N-J to the motherfucking A
Straining your brain like T.V. static
Check out the funky 3D graphics
Rave visuals, enter my digital zone
As I recite a poem on the microphone
I'm scoping, third eye strobing, mind open, sweat streaming
Flesh gleaming, best feeling, high-energy peaking, deep meanings
Freak when I see things, like this chick in a G-string
Can I touch you friend?

[Hook: x2]
Beat boy, beat boy
Hit that perfect beat boy
Hit that perfect, hit that perfect
Hit that perfect beat boy

Pump it, uh!
Yo pump it, uh uh!
Yo pump it, uh!
Lick it, dip it, twist it, turn it
Pump it, uh! Yo pump it, uh uh!
Lick it, dip it, twist it, turn it, stick it, dunk it
P-p-p-p-pump it!

[Verse 2]
I think about you when I masturbate
You can't even believe it but that's OK
On the microphone I fascinate
When I let my 3rd eye exaggerate
(Freaky visions) I tell you what I see
Cold concrete scattered with dry leaves
You naked lying on the pavement
People are standing round with laanie shoes
You can hardly move, you look sexy
All of a sudden, the streets are empty
You stand up, open your eyelids
You in a trench coat, it's French, you look stylish
You walk in the silence, not sure what the time is
It's totally twilight, the sky is violet
An abandoned house, look ahead to see
Some open the door, yes it's me
With the meanest penis you ever seen
You're on your period, with no tampon
You kneel down and get with the vibe
Your period blood has crystallized
You offer me the red crystal (It's ill)
Grab hold of the mic tight, tonight's the night
The vibe is live, pump up the bass
I got tentacles coming out my face
I rise into the air, cut myself open
Warm blood pours down all round
I speak from the deep cut in between my thighs
You covered in blood rubbing your boobs, feeling nice
Rubbing your boobs (feeling nice)
Rubbing your boobs (feeling nice)
Rubbing your boobs (feeling nice)
She's covered in blood rubbing your boobs (feeling nice)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You open the door, step into the place
Look around, strange painting on the walls
A chick on the floor on all fours, totally nude
In high heels (The vibe's ill)
She's hand-cuffed, ankle cuffed, steel collar
With a long leash attached to the ceiling
The scene's appealing, revealing weird feelings
Make you forget about what you believing
Another chick chilling against the wall
Flashing her boobs, legs spread with a nice vagina
And a long stick, there's a nice big
Painting above her head (Expensive!)
You check another chick on all fours
Chilling next to another chick lying on the floor
Legs spread in the middle of the corridor
Close shave, (Don't touch what you can't afford)
The next room's a bed room, you become two
What I mean is, you plus another you
You get down with yourself while I watch
Body buzzing like a bed of a billion bees
You kneel down in front of the other you
Time to learn something new
The one kneeling is a slave
Kneel for the master
Feel the warm hand on the back of your head
You got a tattoo on the back of your neck
An infinity sign that represents your past
Your master touches you on your tattoo
And removes your tattoo, now you brand new
I'm proud of you dear
There's nothing you not allowed to do here
Listen to me, the infinity tattoo is a key
Let go to my rhyme and open your mind
Let go to my rhyme and open your mind
Open your mind, open your mind

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Lift up your dress, open up your legs
Your vagina's sewn up, untie the thread
My sublime rhyme inside your head
Your mind is rushing, vagina gushing
Another chick in the corner taking a piss
(It looks nice) The whole vibe's totally kinky
Look around, the new room is fancy
Remove your fur coat, remove your panties
I'm rocking a suit and a blackface mask
I ejaculate into a champagne glass
Your precious flesh is so mysterious
Pierce your nipples with two long needles
Like a crucifix, take you to another level
While I get my freak on, the vibe is mental
Transcendental, we somewhere else now
Still rocking a mask, but I've taken off my suit
You rocking a mask too, shaking your nice boobs
I tell you I like you, you feel my piel
We start french kissing with flippin' long tongues
We somewhere else now, you dressed conservative
I transform into a big black god
Feel the realness, my dick's lank hard
You can't believe it, a dick in your palm
As big as your arm, we somewhere else now
A hospital, uh, get ready for the operation
Lot of guys chilling behind you, blasts from the past
All rocking a mask, penises out
Drop your panties for the surgeon
(I'm not a virgin) It's not a problem
Look in the mirror, you can see it's you
You got two nice boobs and a penis too
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
Look in the mirror, you can see it's you
Look in the mirror, you can see it's you
You got two nice boobs and a penis too
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
Look in the mirror, you can see it's you
Look in the mirror, you can see it's you
You got two nice boobs and a penis too

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
The men in the masks gather round the patient
Waiting in anticipation
The old surgeon says "can you see this?"
A beautiful woman with a brand new penis!
You clap the surgeon, flip him right round
Bend him over, lift his white gown
Gryp the surgeon's milky butt-cheeks
Rape the surgeon, break the surgeon
Absorb your penis into your tummy
You're a woman again, complete with a vagina
I'm flipping my rhyme up
Tripping your mind out
Ripping and vipping your pip
Flip it inside-out
Now you the teacher, you the guide
The real you won't see you denied
You got crazy sex appeal, all tied up
Kneeling on the pavement, you can't say shit
Your mouth is gagged, you surrounded by
A thousand guys totally under your spell
They all totally scared of the power you hold
You can changed the rules of the game and devour their souls
Now's the time girl
Let's head back into the outside world
The world of others, it's time to go back
The door is stuck shut but the walls are beginning to crack
Uh! Now the walls are bleeding
It's all deceiving, you soaking wet
With no regrets, feel your body sweat blood
Peel off your old skin, time to get love

You arrive at the cemetery in time for the ceremony
I give you a hot kiss, grab hold of your ass cheeks
How'd you like to get laid on this
Tombstone in the middle of the rain forest
My gaze puts you in a daze, I'm loving your long tongue
Look at your beautiful face, covered in hot cum
Spread my wings block out the sun
Lie on my back, scope out your bum
My penis stays hard, you breathing heavily
I penetrate you, the feeling's heavenly
Now bounce girl, you know it's hot
Bounce, bounce girl, like oh my god!
Totally freaky deaky funky
Wa'e make you leave your body
Transport you to another dimension
You alone in the desert, totally nude
The silence is violent
You floating above the ground
Invisible energies penetrate
Every hole in your body while you levitate
You start coming apart, shape-shifting
Wild, out of control
Destructo
Ghan odn ar
Dbir vahniss
Dgug rgyud
Hgyur bzan
Bhren sseh
Ehrsta sugam
Satah!

[Intro]
Yo, what's up
Right now, this is Mac Miller with my homie TreeJay
You know what I'm sayin', it's 4/20
Piff Jar, baby, gettin' me fucked up
High as hell right now, so much weed in my lungs
I'm really high, it's like a fuckin' movie
Except I can't see 'cause I'm so high
Thank you TreeJay for this bomb-ass weed you hooked me up with
Peace, love, and more weed, blah blah blah!
Man, you kids got some... you got some other stuff, man
Yeah man, yeah man
Sound like a weed anthem right here
And if you say I make too many weed songs
I say you don't smoke enough weed
Bitch, haha

[Chorus]
Let's get high, high
Let's get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high

Let's get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high
(Grab it, break it, roll it up, go 'head and roll it up, roll it up, go 'head and roll it up)

[Verse 1]
Feel good when you go and get an O
And you wanna roll the whole thing up (Uh-huh)
A little codeine in my cup with some funk, gon' take me up (Up)
I'm tryna get lifted (What?), are you wit' it? (What?)
'Cause you ain't ever been this high before
I'ma light my weed, inhale, then blow that smoke
Got a bag full of good, we can toke
No air balloon, but let's float (Float)
We way up in the clouds (Clouds), dancin' on the stars
Keep breakin' it down (Down), then rollin' up cigars (Yeah)
Paper or blunt, let's roll it
Vaporizer or bong or let's bowl it
So gone, I'm feelin' homesick, this chronic so explosive (Hey)

[Bridge]
I'm so high, so high, I'm so high
And I ain't comin' down (Cheah)

[Chorus]
Let's get high, high
Let's get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high
I wanna get high (Grab it, break it, roll it up, smokin' joints, smokin' blunts)
High (Grab it, break it, roll it up, smokin' joints, smokin' blunts)
Let's get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high
(Grab it, break it, roll it up, go 'head and roll it up, roll it up, go 'head and roll it up)

[Verse 2]
Got a little bit of weed from my homie on the corner, but I gotta get more
Hoverin' above the floor, I can go anywhere, no cord
More or less, I'm high and you can't catch me (You can't catch me)
Yeah, that bag of fifth don't impress me (Nah)
Weed gonna knock me into next week (Ha)
We just tryna get jetski'd
A bong with ice, but no Gretzky (Ha)
You tryin' to get high with me
Travel thirty thousand feet into the sky with me
Smoke 'til you feel like you gon' die with me
I got sour kush and all kinds of weed
Come fly with me, I can sing, I just find the key
And E know where all the vinyls be
So he be makin' all kinds of beats
And when I find my tree, I'ma roll it up
Never ever gonna sober up
If you wanna come show some love, just smoke my drugs, hey

[Chorus]
Let's get high, high
Let's get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high
I wanna get high (Grab it, break it, roll it up, smokin' joints, smokin' blunts)
High (Grab it, break it, roll it up, smokin' joints, smokin' blunts)
Let's get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high
(Grab it, break it, roll it up, go 'head and roll it up, roll it up, go 'head and roll it up)
Stop at the light, I’mma jump out my Barbie dream car

Family guy, let’s have a little Stewie
Bust a U-ie, I forgot my Huey, Dewey, Louie
Red and Green lamb we call it watermelon
I call him SB he call me Nicki tell ‘em
I’m badder than a felon
He’s generous like Ellen
Ain’t talking hair products
When I say that we gellin
I’m the Barbie and he's the Ken
Get my prenup, then get my pen
Get my flower girls, and get my bridesmaid
Don’t need a gift lil mama, cause this brides paid!

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Doctor, doctor, need you back home, baby
Doctor, doctor, where ya at? Give me something
I need your love, I need your love, I need your lovin'
You got that kind of medicine that keeps me comin'

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
My body needs a hero, come and save me
Something tells me you know how to save me
I've been feeling weird, oh
Oh, I need you to come and rescue me
Oh-oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Boy, you make it, make it right
My temperature is super high
If I scream, if I cry
It's only 'cause I feel alive

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
My body needs a hero, come and save me
Something tells me you know how to save me
I've been feeling weird, oh
Oh, I need you to come and rescue me
Oh-oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on

Come and save me now, I know you can (I know you can)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Ah, ah
D-d-d-d-don't let me die young

I just want you to be my doctor
We can get it cracking, chiropractor
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
I know you can save me and make me feel alive

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on

[Intro]
Give me my power
Give me my power
Give me my power
Give me my power
I built this city

[Verse 1]
I got plenty concrete, plenty steel
Please give me my trees, give 'em back
Give me tourists, give me traffic
Give me noise, just give it back
Could you bring back all my police, give me order
Turn back on my lights, give me fuel and water
I think I'm begging, cause now that everything's gone
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
With the streets all dark, it looks like my buildings are gone

[Hook]
I made you the mayor of my town honey
And I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city
Gave you, power over, power over me
Give it to me
Give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

[Verse 2]
Tell the government, please give me funding
Can't you see that I'm doing bad?
Give me floodgates, give me levees
Too much water can you push it back
How you just gon' leave me out of order
I ain't got no lights and no fuel to start up
I know I'm begging, cause now that everything's dried up
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
And with the streets all dark, the buildings look lost

[Hook]
I made you the mayor of my town honey
I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city, all power over, power over me
Give it to me, give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

[Bridge]
We used to be sky high
We used to be major
We used to be sky high
We used to be major, baby, major

[Outro]
Give it to me, give it back to me
The city mine, baby
This whole city is mine
The city is mine, honey
Give it to me, give it back to me
The city is mine, oh baby
The city is mine
The city is mine
Now give it to me
Give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

[Intro]
I do not talk, I am just a rapper

[Verse 1]
I am so different, being me is like the lottery
I am so on like the TV when you fall asleep
Niggas makin pottery, but I broke the mold
Now my shit has got them dancing like I channel Oakenfold
Yes, I got a lust for life, and I drink my weight in whiskey
And these hoes are actin' different cause I'm Rich comma Richie
These friends are iffy, they're alcoholic geniuses
I think they hang around until I'm drunk and buy them Guinnesses
I gotta drink my medicine to cover what's inside of me
I'm still fucked up from the days nobody liked me
I'm lying just a little when I say that I don't give a fuck
You know I gotta give a fuck
My face is broken out
My shirt is hand-me-down
This kid named Vincent wanna take my shit and lay me out
I'm trying to fit in like a fat bitch in her shoe size
It's funny how I'm flyer now than witches on their broom rides
I always thought these new clothes were the potion
Cause I never felt that good in my own skin
It's probably cause I'm the only black kid in my school
And when I meet another black kid they tell me I'm a fool
Cause I wear these tight clothes, tight jeans, tight shirt
Yeah I stay tight like these girls that make my dick hurt
Yeah, I'm self conscious
Go ahead - laugh it up
Cause I dig deep and pull something out to back it up
They told my ass to blacken up
What the fuck are you?
You don't even say shit
Quit writing gay shit
Now they see me and have to squint like asians
Cause I'm on fire and everything I touch blazes
Giving you the realness
Kid I got a lot of it
Listen to my mixtapes, tell me if they contradict
Don't fuck with these niggas cause this swag is abstinent
I don't have time to sleep
I don't have time to eat
These niggas got time to do
Everything but be unique
I gotta do me like I'm jerkin' in the mirror
I am just a rapper
Can't make it clearer
Yes I'm in the building
No I own the company
Your girlfriend's sister--you cannot fuck with me
Childish Gambino
We are all children
I am just a murderer
We have just killed them

[Intro]
Got all my niggas in the building with me
It's the Speaker Knockerz
Somebody call some pretty bitches through
Motivation, yeah

[Verse 1]
I pop a perk, I fuck yo bitch
Got you blowin up her phone while she suckin dick
Yellow bone, hella thick
She know I be gettin money like I'm sellin bricks
If you gone tell 'em somethin you should tell 'em this
Every time them people grab me I ain't tell 'em shit
Not a word, but my government
So they can run my name and I'll be bailin' quick
I'm rollin' round in my town, southside in northbound
Don't throw your ho in that water, we won't save the bitch she might drown
I'm gettin money right now, strapped up with that pound
Got a sad song on my hip I swear you dont wanna hear that sound okay
Yellow rollie, yellow bezzle, ooh my money on another level
Yea, and my bitches gettin' even badder
I'm stackin paper got these haters gettin even madder(you mad?)
Look in they faces, I see they hatin'
Get in they whip they bitches got my CD playin'
Money ain't a joke, and I ain't even playin'
I told her to spend the night and I ain't even stayin'
Them hoes tell me I'm too much, them haters tell me I'm too up
Yea I'm racked out and I'm drooged up
Just 3 deep, we ain't gooned up
We keep heat, yeah that tool tucked
George Jeff. I done moved up
Spin the block pull that coupe up
Handspring, I put the roof up
I think I'm Tony Montana, ridin' with the hammer
Niggas on that ape shit, I let 'em eat bananas
Ak-47 picture perfect like a camera
I point it at your homie leave 'em stinking like a pamper
Fuck what you drinkin, fuck what you thinkin
This 40 hit yo homie leave that nigga plankin'

Yea, ha, catch me in MIA, I probably be with Haitians

[Verse 1]
Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

[Chorus]
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

[Verse 2]
Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded, but Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

[Chorus]
She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Oh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

[Chorus]
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

[Outro]
Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets

[Intro]
Bitch I'm Mack Maine
And this Young Money
Lil brotha get 'em

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Straight out the hood a young hoodlum
Done what I shouldn't did what they say I couldn't
Hid where all the killers hid at
Hung where the other hustlas slung at
Waiting on the get back
Get that
Flip that
Debating on the mix match
Switch that from dope to coke I'm blowin up fast
Now you niggas is slowing up fast
(secret weapons) "I can hear myself but I can't feel myself, I wanna feel myself like tweet!"
Now my niggas is blowin up aves
If I tell 'em you niggas is holding up cash
Rollin up stepping outta the phantom's ass
Put cha litters away ur talking to a can of gas
There's nothing to say no matter who comes to ask
And murder ain't funny but we do love to laugh
Shit we just living take money take baths
Take a nigga bitch and fuck her
And send her back wit nothing
Now isn't that disgusting
Give him back his sista give him back his cousin
Yea, go make a stack or something
Go and buy yourself a spine and give back the frontin'
Yea and to end that discussion
I been had strength I just got the muscle
Fuck ya, this that 'n' the other
I see my people struggle wish that they wasn't
The government try to put us in a muzzle
But you're two fingers ain't the pieces to da puzzle
Shit say to each his own hustle
And I hustle all night and then go home to the fussin'
Then wake up to the fuckin'
Breakfast in bed don't forget my english muffin
Hawaiin punch tastes like robitussin
A nigga jus livin jus breathin jus puffin'
Come on mama drop down and curl up
Dick millimeter cock back and murda
Aye senorita we cannot go any further
If my girl catch us both in the spot she will merk us
Pussy niggas talkin all that slop we will merk cause
Hungry ass niggas I tote two hamburgers
Who want beef? Who want beef? I bring it to your front door and now you seem nervous
Two seater swervin'
Traffic to hell wit it
Shit you can't die with it can't go to jail with it
Might as well wild in it passin and feelin' it
Me I excel fishtail and tailwhip it
Give them niggas somethin' to tell them bitches
Smellin like money at a full court scrimmage
The fam at the table got a four course dinner
Young money cash money dump confetti on da winner
And yet he understood us so when we told em' break it off
Cause gangstas don't' talk one word'll be a war
And yo platoon can't handle the destruction
Hard body baby killin' sound like seduction
Them niggas chase dope bitches follow the instructions
Sometimes you gotta put the whole rooster in the oven
So tell the public I'mma do my thing
Just as soon as I hear dat bing
Gotta come in
Comin' up
You niggas jus runner up
And runnin' up'll get you in that wheel chair forever
It's whatever
I'm still here forever
Cause the lil'nigga better than all you niggas together
I'm gone

[Verse 1]
Saw my signal from afar
Lonely heart sitting at the bar
I'mma try to save you from his flames
Come with me you don't have to think

Take a look at me, I promise I will be
All the things you wanted him to be

[Bridge]

Looking at your eyes I can see the stress
Take a Look at me, I promise I will be
All the things you wanted him to be

[Bridge]

[Chorus 1: R. Kelly, Usher & Both]

But she's been doubling up with us
U (U), K (K)
Man, we been messing with the same girl

[Verse 2: R. Kelly & Usher]
See, I met her at this party in Atlanta (Ayy, oh! Ayy)
Well I met her at this party in Chicago (Oh, oh! Oh)
She came right up to me, giving me conversation
I said "Do you got a man?"
She said "No" with no hesitation
Well, it must be a music thing 'cause she said the same to me
At a party all in my face, while I'm laughing and buying her drinks
She whispered in my ear, said "Can you take me home?"
Me too! Man, she was in the Chi singing that same song
Is that true?
And I thought it was true confessions when she said "I love you"
Man I thought her body was calling when she said, "I want you"
Look, I even got some pictures on my phone
Looky there, there she is with some boy shorts on, hah

[Chorus 2: R. Kelly, Usher & Both]
We messing with the same girl, the same girl
She's the apple of my eye (Yeah!)
And my potential wife
The same girl, same girl
Man I just can't believe that we been messing 'round
With the same damn girl, oh, yeah
The same girl, same girl
Thought she was someone I could trust
But she's been doubling up with both of us
U (Ayy!), K (Ayy!)
Man, we been messing with the same girl

[Verse 3: R. Kelly & Usher]
Said she got me on a ring tone
Are you talking 'bout the pink phone?
Mm-mm, the blue one
Man, she told me that was turned off
It's obvious that she's been playing us, playing us
Ush, constantly she's been lying to us, lying to us
Don't like the way that she been going 'bout it, going 'bout it
Kells, what you think that we should do about it, do about it?
Call her up at her home
She won't know I'm on the phone
Yeah, man, that's the lick
Homie, we about to bust this trick
Man, just ask her to meet up with you
And I'm going to show up too
And she won't know what to do
We'll be standing there, singing, "Same ..."

[Chorus 3: R. Kelly, Usher & Both]
The same girl, same girl
She was the apple of my eye (Blow!)
And your potential wife

Jets and Monsta Beatz
Bitches, now Taylor Gang that
Bitches, now Taylor Gang that
Jets, holla at Wiz

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
By the strength of the quality weed smell
You can tell that I'm somewhere in the building on my Batman shit
Niggas suspended from the ceiling
Not really, but that's the way the weed got me feeling
Gondola rides in Venice
Mami you got the vision and I see in HD
And it couldn't be any clearer
You should be with Spitta
And you know that this your chance
Don't blow it like birthday candles
Good guy Spitta keep his name outta them scandals
It's not a secret, I prefer my girls in sneakers, never sandals
Posing naked in only a pair of Nike Vandals
Bottles pop, back to back
Extra large chronic sack
Cellphone, camera's out
Mama I remember that
Anytime I look at that
I go to wondering where you at
So baby where you at, with it
I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly
And maybe we get back up in a minute

[Hook]
Fast cars
Fly clothes
G5's flying over seashores

Baby I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly
So tell me if you is
Or if you isn't

Fast cars

So tell me if you is
Or if you isn't
With it
(Yeah)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Listen, if you with it, get in
What you sippin'?
Hit it out of the park
That's if you pitchin'
First you look at me wrong
Like uh-uh, no he didn't
Then you turn into Robin on me
You start to give-in, get it?
By the beach, watching tennis
Crack another bottle of Perignon
Louis V carry-ons when you visit
Sending all them signals in your sidekick sentence
Then I reply, like "Be there in a minute"
Just put me and Curren$y on your friend list
The weed come from a village
Truck tire, sour diesel scented, that's real shit
From smelling this she wanna see how the cigar taste
We lighting reefer, bumping 808's & heartbreaks
Skinny broad, but out them jeans she got a heart shape
Skip the movie date and take her to the horse race
And let you bet it all, keep the winnings
Young entrepreneur, give you the business, dig it
(Yeah)

[Hook]
Fast cars
Fly clothes
G5's flying over seashores
Get it
Baby I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly
So tell me if you is
Or if you isn't

G5's flying over seashores

Baby I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly
So tell me if you is

[Verse 1 - Trey Songz]
I told her, go go pop that pussy get my dick wetter
All the hoes think I’m hot shit so they pissed at her
Niggas show envy but that don’t offend me
I wanna go to heaven where the angels free of sin be
They saying that I’m surrounded by the devils that’s within me
They say cash make you change, but that ain’t no epiphany
Cause I would say the same, dead faces making sense to me
Life moving fast so I’m quickly making history
I’m bullshit proof, if I kick it this shit’s truth
Like I’m stepping on the five, cause Abe Lincoln never lie
It’s such a crazy world you just somebody baby girl
What goes up must come down, look at that paper girl
I keep getting higher though, top kinda quitet though
Trigger man eating all you niggas on a diet ho
Hot a grip on the game make me beat you with these pliers
I put her body to work and she do whatever’s required

[Drake - Hook]
She just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and tell me baby, its real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won’t
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

[Verse 2]
She will cause I’m one of those, what you wanna know?
I told her, go go make that pussy splash
Nah, never did the dougie but I do that make your pussy dance
I’m the truth bitch, haters telling lies
They know I’m the shit and they be on it like some flies
I tell them get a life but they so concerned with mine
Ah, and bitches fighting is the last thing on my mind
This money mountain watch how fast a nigga climb
Like the hands on the Rollie, I’m just passing through the time
(You're nobody) 'til the paparazzi spot you
And shot you … when the crib is colossal
Put my cheese and my lettuce over the beef like a taco
You niggers sweeter than syrup circle of squares like a waffle
Want a picture I got you but baby listen not now
Bitches keep they bottoms up cause I keep my top down
Flow’s overload like I keep them stock pilled
And it’s money over hoes, so I tell them squat down, now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Its ignorance that won’t allow, the listeners
They listen when the blistering the whispers
Do nothing to my significance
Competition non-existent, less I’m the mirror then
I’m kinda scared of him, tell myself beware of him
Meet my money on the double like it was a pair of them
You niggas fucking joking right? You niggas smoking
Like your favorite rapper saying some thought provoking
Cadence and lyric is dope but it just be fucking boastin'
You talking about some real shit you must be fucking broke
Or wanna be fucking broke
Radio ain’t gonna play that shit
They gonna play that hit, I don’t give a fuck what you say
That neo-soul ain’t gonna pay, hey
Truthfully I wanna be conscious as Marv' Gaye
But I feed a lot of people, yeah they eating entree
Money turn boys to men like Wanya
Well at least … this other niggas …hold up wait.. Who yall talkin to?

[Intro]
The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing

[Verse 1]
Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gunshot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either Crip or Piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's brewing, real talk, and

[Chorus]
This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, ya know?)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

[Verse 2]
I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like "hol' up"
"Where you from?" I don't bang
"Where you stay?" Westside, that's a Piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed across Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the I-95, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said, "fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you"
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but

[Chorus]
This is why they fuck with me (I told you, nigga)
This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

[Verse 3]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straight jacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, you know?

[Chorus]
This is why they fuck with me (haha)
This is why they fuck with me (real talk)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

[Outro]
So there you have it
But I'mma leave you with this
An O.G. once told me
A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money
I'm gone

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Uh, with everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going, but
You think that ya on your way
Life lined up on the mirror, don't blow it

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Woah, look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Lil Wayne]
Mirror on the wall (Woah)
Here we are again (Yeah)
Through my rise and fall (Uh)
You've been my only friend (Yeah)
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin' at the..

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Lil Wayne]
Mirror on the wall
Here we are again (Yeah)
Through my rise and fall (Uh-huh)
You've been my only friend (My only friend)
You told me that they can't
Understand the man I am (They can't understand)
So why are we here (Misunderstood)
Talking to each other again? (Woah)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn, I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in a broken mirror
I see my mama smile, that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message coulda been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the...

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Lil Wayne]
Mirror on the wall (MJ taught me that)
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall (Uh)
You've been my only friend (Take 'em to Mars, man)
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we
Talking to each other again? (Uh)
Mirror on the wall (Woah)
Here we are again (Yeah)
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend (Any questions?)
You told me that they can (I come to you)
Understand the man I am (You always have the answer)
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?

[Outro: Bruno Mars & Lil Wayne]
Mirror on the wall
Hey B.P, looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time
So why are we
Talking to each other again?

[Verse]
Man, fuck them bitches and them hoes
And them niggas pussies, camel toes
I got some money on me, and the weed nice
My shit won’t ever stop, suck my green light
Bitch it’s Carter 4, murder's all she wrote
Now it’s fuck everybody, like a Scorpio
Still running shit, I’m on my cardio
Boy I’m going in, like my water broke
Suicide note, suicide doors
I put in overtime, like a tied score
Tinted windows bitch, that mean mind yours
And the weed loud, like a lion's roar
Stare into the eyes, the eyes of forever
Hear no evil see no evil, Helen Keller
No music on, rock it acapella
And I don’t need a watch, the time is now or never
Tell my niggas love, I die behind this shit
A nigga counting money, you niggas counterfeit
Real nigga nigga, proud of what I am
Young Money is an army, bitch I’m Uncle Sam
Them hoes call me Tunechi, mama call me Tune
I left the bullshit in the waiting room
Straight to the money, no short cuts
Now watch me go retarded, yellow short bus
We do drive-bys, we do walk-ups
And bitch I be so high, I get starstruck
Millz in this bitch, he said fuck them hoes
And the jewelry bright, like summer clothes
And I keep some bud, like Rudy Huxtable
I’m bout to slam the beat, nigga Dusty Rhodes
I’m from eagle street, I go Hercules
I get on the beat, murder 1st degree
YMCMB, we don’t give a fuck
You faker than some titties, you get tittie fucked
This the best worst feeling
And nigga if I die I die a death worth living
This that text book G shit
I’ve been in that water but I’ve never been sea sick
Yeah, knock me I knock ya face off
Life’s a crazy bitch, Grace Jones
Mind of a genius, with a heart of stone
C4, Mr. Carter’s home!

[Produced by Willy Will]

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Yeah, when I step in the spot, motherfuckers say "who that?"
Big Bun Beeda but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin' on the trill OG, where they do that? (for real!)
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix, man, just gon' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand with no easy fix, man (damn)
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar and hoes in the crib
Drank and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with P.A. so you know what it is
I'm sittin on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
Said we do it for the Pimp so no holding back, let's go!

[Verse 2: Nas]
Look who crept in, crept-crept in
Look-look who crept in, look-look who
L-l-l-look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB 'til the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants
Like Kanye West and Em
Track record, goes back to the Essence
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man's intestines
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
Gut 'em like a gastric bypass
But ya Nas advocates actors seem
To get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper
Now it's Chandon, fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young, little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs
That'll bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight
That my crown ain't for testing, testing
Chop heads off like King Henry the Eighth
Guillotine to your neck, bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wildin' dude
Studied Taoism and made power moves
Watched Wild Planet, seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
But yo, my nigga Wayne
Let them niggas hate, 'cause like my nigga Drake say
"We ain't got time to respond to niggas"

[Verse 3: Shyne]
I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta when I pop up with them poppers, burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa, Blood, Bl-Blood gang, five
It’s that Blood gang five but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain't gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain't gon' fire
They actin' like they ain’t gon' die, until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed Do-or-Die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it’s no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it’s the green that we want
Cash Money is the company, and Weezy the boss!

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
They say I’m underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Hm... Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That’s when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth
Got 'em sayin' "There he goes again!"
See now, they nominated a nigga to come and flatten everything
Now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain’t no fakin’, ain’t no kind of mistaking
How I be breakin' up everything
And be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done (Damn!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I’m out the door
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with "Tha Carter IV"

[Chorus]
I stepped on a flower, foot on a petal
Good wasn't home, so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like, "Hey, I like the view from here!"
I'm so high, I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy and problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho
That's why I go hard, ho

[Verse 1]
God bless the world, and most people in it
It's anybody's game, but nobody's winning
Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish
We went from Boyz to Menace, Menace II Society
Now we get higher, call that shit karate
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover
Bitches eat me up, like my name is Russell Stover
Murder the perception, make 'em get it right
If I'm flirting with perfection, I'm fucking her tonight
I'm a Southerner's delight, Louisiana pride
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive
And today I took a walk outside and...

[Chorus]
I stepped on a flower, foot on a petal
Good wasn't home, so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like, "Hey, I like the view from here!"
I'm so high, I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy and problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho
That's why I go hard, ho

[Verse 2]
Uh, and we all kiss our mamas
Cause promises are broken, but tomorrow isn't promised
Think I'm gettin' sick, I'm feelin' ill-egal
And not having money is the root of all evil
Life is a midget, so try to live it up
It's Dr. Carter, bitch, I got this shit nipped and tucked
If these walls could talk, they probably won't shut up
I need some wall-paper, before they start to fuss
Yeah, pick up the phone and call your bluff
Human growth hormone, now my pockets all buff
I don't think about the future, it come soon enough
Motherfucker, I don't shoot ya; bitch, I shoot ya up
I ain't like these niggas, I don't like these niggas
I just roll another joint, like Spike Lee, nigga
And I woke up this morning, got the cold out my eyes
And then I took a walk outside, and...

[Chorus]
I stepped on a flower, foot on a petal
Good wasn't home, so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like, "Hey, I like the view from here!"
I'm so high, I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
All these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy and problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho
That's why I go hard, ho

[Outro]
Zero! (Yeah)
Stop playin' (Yeah)
Run up in your fuckin' mouth, nigga! (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm beside myself
So that make two of me, nigga!

[Produced by Diplo & DJA]

[Chorus]
Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
It's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser

[Verse 1]
Goons in this bitch, leave a nigga on a stretcher
It's all there papa, you ain't even got to measure
Laughing at how all my old bitches look jealous
Well, what goes around comes around, propellers
Money Over Bitches, M.O.B, Goodfellas
Cut our ears off, ain't shit you could tell us
Write your name on the bullet, that's a fuckin' love letter
If I ain't a trendin' topic, I'm a fuckin' trend-setter

[Chorus]
I'm on two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
Man, it's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser

[Verse 2]
If you're scared, go to church; Mason Betha
Sometimes the paper chase could be like chasin' a leopard
The pussy wetter, wetter than it's ever been
But she gon' probably try to cross the line like a Mexican
I ain't on that bullshit, shorty fine as fuck though
Now she kiss me on my neck, I hope she ain't cut-throat
Cut down on the syrup cause it made me fuck slow
Shoot so many times I'mma choke off the gunsmoke
Life, death, love, hate, pleasure, pain
Pay me no mind but I don't have change
I cock back and aim at your membrane
Broad day, no mask, close range
Bop-bop!

[Chorus]
You can get two shots from wherever, two shots from whoever
It be like a puzzle tryna put you back together
I should probably do better, but probably, whatever

[Verse 3]
Your bullshit is stinkin' up the place
Me no tek bad up, me a done de place
Can't let these bitch niggas slide and touch base
I make her cum so many times, call her "nutcase"
It's Young Money baby, take your clothes off
Give me them three holes, bowlin' ball
Two shots of whatever
Keep them bitches cummin' and she gon' do whatever

[Chorus]
Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
It's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser

[Outro]
Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever

[Verse]
Hey
Microphone testing, uh, testing
You playin' politician, you Martin Sheen on The West Wing
Guessing the best thing for me to do is spit it
This shit is never a gimmick, you listen more than a minute
I been spittin' flows since the kid was six-years-old
And if you listen close I do this like some mismatched clothes
It's whatever, put it together, you never could be this clever
I'm rockin' the mic forever, you gonna stop me never
I'm cocky because I love it, you Rocky without the punches
Hockey without the ice and boxes without the lunches
Flowin' like me, no one, and that got you mad, bitch
Saw your boys are nothin' but just a-verage
I ain't tellin' nobody how they should live their life
I got my own shit to deal with so that just isn't right
I'm just tryna to leave the crib, go out and live tonight
Shit, fuck that, I'm locked in the lab, workin'
Droppin' a track, beats get bodied and bagged, certain
See the world through first, second, and third-person
Omniscient, listenin' so efficient
Trapped in my own goal line, ready to go the distance
Consider it a privilege that you get to witness
History in the makin', you fuckin' bitches
Haha, just playin' witcha'll
Still in line waitin' for my name to get called, yuh

[Intro]
Hahaha, listen, yeah

[Chorus]
I dream, I imagine (What?), I believe that it'll happen (What?)
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
'Cause I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen (Wassup?)
Bitch please, I'ma make a million (Uh)
With ease, I'ma make a million

[Verse 1]
A lotta times I don't get the credit
Forgettin' about my ethical work
Let it be first said that I'm here to earn bread
I been dedicated ever since I turned ten
Got the type of style quickly gonna turn heads
I been workin', part-time hustla
Hit you with a dub for ya bubbla, it's nothin', bruh
On the road with a dollar and a dream
'Cause anything is possible, believe bitch, please
It ain't nothin' to spit, sparkin' up in the whip
Stayin' stuck up on my dreams like they rubber cement
No one ever see a legend when he stuck on the bench
And my screw's so loose it'll fuck up your wrench
My head can't contain all these dreams of mine
When I'm rich there's some shit I'm gonna leave behind
For now, it's food for thought, here to feed your mind
But you can't get a piece of mine
Nah, homie

[Chorus]
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
'Cause I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
With ease, I'ma make a million

[Verse 2]
Now, I can either try and be a hero
Or I can grab a one with six zeros (What?)
What would I do with a million dollars?
First off, I'd start payin' bills to my father
Then pay for college, get TreeJay a camera
Grab a spot in LA, a crib in Atlanta
Cop a Phantom, just to ride in
Some celebrity friends to get high with
Couple foreign models that I fine dine with
'Cause the music that I make is timeless
The pressure's on, don't choke, Heimlich
Maneuver, got my songs all through your computer
You wonderin' is it buzz or just a rumor
I'm Superman, y'all just Lex Luthor
I'ma make a mil, that's for real, no deal
Just the illest mothafucka in the bill, so chill

[Chorus]
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
'Cause I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
With ease, I'ma make a million
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
'Cause I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
With ease, I'ma make a million

[Verse 1]
Reminiscing on a younger love
Blowing kisses to me through the window of the bus
Daddy told you that I was dangerous
But I couldn't stop hustling, even if he asked me
Fast forward now we're grown-ups
But how could I forget that loving you was such a rush
Our future could've been different
But lets just say I wouldn't stop hustling even when you asked me
But you knew me well, you knew I had a love on a different scale
Heavy as the heavens, you could tell
I'm different now but I still carry her with me still
It takes a strong young man to survive out here
Carrying the pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
Used to have a backpack full of that work
Now I got a backpack full of this hurt
And the broken pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
It's getting heavier

[Verse 1 - Mac Miller]
Ayo Jerm I need you to do me a favor real quick
Turn the beat up in my headphones a lil bit
This shit needs to knock a lil bit for me feel me
Ayo Cardo you keep hitting me with heat like this man
Imo have no choice but to kill it you feel me

Hey Hey I want a bunch of bad broads, a couple fast cars
So high up in the air that I can grab mars
Got a bunch of miles in me like a gas card
King of the jungle bitch I'm Madagascar
Don't aggravate him cause I don't have the patience
Send you home early like a bad vacation
Fuck with hoes that been struck with infatuation
But I be on the road and have em waiting
Escape from reality, life is just a fallacy
So we ride the clouds round skipping through the galaxy
On the Millennium Falcon you see me traveling
That's the type of shit to have you falling off the balance beam
Way to confusing got they hearts moving
Homie life is a game and you loosing
Better start improving, boy get your stats up
Cause my shit is gonna hit you like a mac truck bad luck

[Hook - Mac Miller]
In my Polo button up and a starter cap
Keep My clothes real clean at the laundromat
Hit the hit the liquor store to get my medicine
I'm in a league of extraordinary gentlemen
In my Polo button up and a starter cap
Keep My clothes real clean at the laundromat
At the laundromat,At the at the laundromat
I keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat

[Verse 2 - T-Shyne]
Louis duffle on my way to the laundromat
I'm the reason fathers wonder where they daughters at
Pussy on platter yea imo order that
Mac Miller on the song who would've thought of that
Haha doesn't matter 'cause it came through
Shy high cause I'm in my paper plane mood
Bottles of that Clicquot that's what my fame do
I get it in you just claim to
I won't blame you, you ain't a business man
Gettin' money 'til my death you niggas in a jam
Living spam, me I live a clean life
Money in my pocket love nature its a green life
Double dutch the same size as Harry Potter's wand
It last a NBA game 4 quarters long
And when its done we rolling up another one
I stay with bud like gold stays with a leprechaun

[Hook - Mac Miller]
In my Polo button up and a starter cap
Keep My clothes real clean at the laundromat
Hit the hit the liquor store to get my medicine
I'm in a league of extraordinary gentlemen
In my Polo button up and a starter cap
Keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat
At the laundromat, At the at the laundromat
I keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat

[Verse 1]
I seen him buy you a drink
I start kissing ,holding hands
While you're looking at me (at me)
I hope that he don't think that he is the only man
That you getting freaky with (freaky with)

[Pre-Chorus]
When you sleeping at night, she's creeping out
It's not you it's sex that she's worried about

[Chorus]
Why try to cuff her, cuff her
She's just taking all your money
She don't love ya, love ya
It's so funny, he's a sucker
Try to cuff her, cuff her
She's just taking all your money
She don't love ya, love ya
It's so funny, he's a sucker for love
Sucker for love, sucker for love, for love, for love
Sucker for love, sucker for love, sucker for love, for love, for love
And I'm sorry for you

[Verse 2]
Her body's fierce, she's like scorpion
Her body said get over here
If I knew she had a man
I can't lie, I still would hit it
But I don't really understand
How you blind and you can't see it

[Pre-Chorus]
When you sleeping at night, she's creeping out
It's not you it's sex that she's worried about

[Chorus]
Tryna cuff her, cuff her
She's just taking all your money
She don't love ya, love ya
It's so funny, he's a sucker

Sucker for love, sucker for love, for love, for love
Sucker for love, sucker for love, sucker for love, for love, for love
And I'm sorry for ya

[Bridge]
One day you gonna stop and you gonna get caught
Whether you like it or not
You ain't gone get far, one day you gonna fall in love
And someone's gonna break your heart

[Chorus]
Tryna cuff her, cuff her
She's just taking all your money
She don't love ya, love ya
It's so funny, he's a sucker
Tryna cuff her, cuff her

It's so funny, he's a sucker for love
Sucker for love, sucker for love, for love, for love
Sucker for love, sucker for love, sucker for love, for love, for love
And I'm sorry for ya

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]

I told her that I missed her put her on a plane
Goyard luggage just a product of the fame
I told her that I dug her I wasn't running game
And if she left a nigga I wouldn't be the same

She met me at the W grabbed me by my chain
Then kissed me like she meant it so glad she came
Told me she was in love she wasn't running game
And since she got off the plane she didn't feel the same

[Hook: Frank Ocean]

I made a change for my baby a difference for love
And I ain't frontin' feel like you were the one
I got the rain girl if you want could have my name
Girl if you want

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
See baby I been looking so long
Feel like you let me show you wasn't feeling the at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love a sucker for love
Girl I'm a sucker for love a sucker for love

If you been searching to long
You knew that other lover wasn't feeling the at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love a sucker for love
A sucker for love a sucker for love

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]

So now we're loving the winter flaming in the rain
The only one I'm into never gonna change
Cause when I said I dug her I wasn't running game
Since she been rocking with me the crush has been insane

She's a 1 of 1 D color VVS stone
My precious you're my everything no please don't leave me lone
She told me she was so sprung I never was a lame
And that the feelings so good she wish that it would stay

[Hook: Frank Ocean]

[Hook: Frank Ocean]

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]

Love, said I only think about her when I wake up
Oh
Love, we did for we did it for love love love

[Chopped Hook: Frank Ocean]
See baby looking so long
Sure you wasn't feeling them at all
A sucker for love 

[x4]

Been searching too long
Sure you wasn't feeling them at all
A sucker for love 

[x4]

[Fade Out: Frank Ocean]

Love, said I only think about her when I wake up
Oh
Love, we did for we did it for love love love

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

[Chorus]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 2]
Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?"

[Chorus]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 3]
Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

[Chorus]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 4]
Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

[Chorus]
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Ya, uh

Ya, ya
Oh my God, haha
Hey

[Verse]
Yeah, they always want that fun shit
When you tryna spit a little somethin' real
They start runnin', turnin' chicken like a nugget meal
How the fuck I feel? Kinda like a hundred mil'
Spun the wheel, bought a vowel, I don't owe you nothin' still
Fuck a deal, I can do it with my own team
Won before Sheen, hear how all these hoes scream
When I was fourteen, sippin' on my OE
Tryna marry money, but that bitch kept gettin' cold feet
Music loud, hear it bangin' through the whole street
Beat gettin' shit on, ha, toilet bowl seat
No sleep, just work
Got a couple horny girls in a see-through shirt
So believe my hype, muthafuckas can't read nor write
Still they talkin' shit, man, I've seen your type
Got problems, can't sleep at night
'Cause your girl want to come around, freak all night
I'm a sex drill when I'm rollin' off them X pills
Five bikes, ten wheels, girl, I'll leave your legs still
Say, "I don't do drugs, just weed," haha
Well, I'ma do drugs and speed down the street
Do doughnuts, your flow sucks, you so butt
Your girl's gettin' throat fucked, I get high, I go up
Why you sayin' that he's a trend?
Then come to all his shows just to meet your friends?
So much coke sniffed, fuckin' hoes with bloody noses
Just a couple doses, fuck the roses
Class time, better take good notes
You bitches couldn't touch me with a Facebook poke

[Outro]
Bitch, hahaha

Real nigga movement, young nigga year
Lookin' so fresh, you'd thought I was a queer
Feeling like Homer Simpson, drinkin' out a beer
Money in the front with the lean in the rear
Get him out of here, swag of the year
Young Soulja Boy, I went and tattooed all my tears
Damn, I had no fears, I feel like a bitch
Shouts out to Lil B, I'm sitting on my dick
Pull up to the trap, hoes like, "Damn"
All this fucking money, bitch, I think I'm Uncle Sam
Tatted on my wrist and my clip don't jam
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em in the kitchen cooking yams
Trap goin' ham, speakers going hammer
Took your main bitch, then I bammed her and I bammed her
Yeah, I rammed her then I jammed her
Nutted in her mouth, I fucked that bitch in Alabamer
Yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes

Fuck you talkin' about? bitch I’m Kenneth Cole

I smoke that Green Day, I’m on my Billie Joe
I’m a dog bitch: B-I-N-G-O
I’m a rich ass nigga, you bitch ass nigga
I’m from the school of Hard Knocks, you skipped class nigga

Get some brain out that ho and call that ho a "brainiac"

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I got some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes

Fuck you talkin' about? bitch I’m Kenny Cole

I’m in my lane bitch, you a gutter bowl
Boogers in the watch, it got a runny nose

And we are Young Money, the untouchables
I hit her from the back, I make her touch her toes
I’m on that drink baby, I think I’m comotosed

And everybody with me strapped, tell them hoes adapt
Shoot ‘em in his head, he dead before he collapse
Young Money we the crap, no salary cap
Money talks bitch and mines yap, yap, yap

Headshots, one on top

Them hoes treasure me, like a pot of gold

I’m laughin' to the bank, this shit is comical
We do it real big, astronomical

Now get it poppin for a nigga, show me what you’re workin' with

Please know my niggas got them pistols for emergencies
I’m lookin' for a head doctor for some brain surgery
Some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes

[Intro]
Bronsolino
Fuck that sitting-down rap type shit, man
I stand up, cause I'm a motherfucking man
And I'm motherfucking hot

[Verse 1]
Peep it
I'm on the third floor, your class was in the basement
You know what that means; you got a hint of retardation
Well, me too, I'm fully-blown just like the flow, though
Spit the silky shit that's ankle-length like a kimono
Uh, sharp instruments to rock like a fossil
Shotty for the haters, that's trimmed off at the nostrils
Well, me and Docker eating dinner at the brothel
Never sniff that blanco, that's word to OJ's Bronco
Cop a Dutch and break it open, overfill it
I'm rollin' in the car, it may be shaky, never spill it, though
Cause when I rhyme, I feel possessed by El Espirito
Encounters of a Third Kind, X-Rays on the visual
Ginger ale and hot sauce, two things I live by
I'm such a chill guy, but fuck around and, yes, you will die
Green DeVille, right, green drugs, but hold the serum
Rub the things together, then you clear 'em, flatline
The prosciutto, olives from Tunisia
Drums are hittin' hard because they chopped up like a cleaver
And yes I'm smokin' all the reefer
The night creeper
I love the pussy really tight, that's with a light Caesar
Can it be that I'm the Golden Child, the chosen one
The piggies saying freeze, but every time they did I chose to run
Takin' that attachment on the nozzle like a soldier's gun
Hide behind the boulder, silver bullet through you shoulder, son
Crack the pepper over thin crust that's handmade
I'm stayin' strapped just like the Air Raid
Yo, take a taste of my nuts
Know they sweet just like the candy
Dick is the same color as Band-Aid, understand me?
I built this building, they came and then I conquered
Two hour flights to Heathrow up in the Concorde
Fermented grapes up in my glass that bear the same name
I'm working hard because that's what I need to maintain
Killer Queens is on the rise, so understand me
Ain't never stoppin' 'til there's a Grammy in a room for my family
Also known as a den
Post and toast with Lauren
Posing for pictures, kicking scriptures that form up a phlegm

[Interlude]
Uh, let me take a little break fam
I'm fucking straight out of surgery, man
I need a little break
When I come back in, I'mma come back in hard, though
I promise you that
(Look at my motherfucking shoulders, son)

[Verse 2]
Yo
I'm diving in like Louganis
I'm aiming right for that anus
Trying to give her a payment to rent the pussy like Avis
Peace to Shaevitz & Shaevitz
My rhymes are seasoned for flavor
Fuck with shorties that's in shape, they got the V like they're Vader
Ah ha, Animal Style, flippin' like a flipjack
You heard the cat rap, like animal's fear from a rat, got
Ankle length, that's suede, the jacket
Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke
Do the Chatatimmy Shimmy like a crackhead
No one compare to me, lampin' with my tangerine
I'm fiend out, so I'm bangin' on the tambourine
Yo, bring the drugs and call me when you on the corner
And I'mma send the doja down in case they run up on ya
Your style is celibate, I'm elegant, trust
My style is liver and I'm ivory like a elephant tusk
Swirl the wine inside the glass that got the delicate musk
Shoe be pointy at the toe, closin' down the show
Poison be the flow, got the boysenberry blow
Finish on the women
That mean the bitch from Finland
Her tits are bonkers
Chilling in her chanclas
Rollers in her hair, I'm running through it, Larry Csonka

[Outro]
Bronsolino
You don't even know who fucking Larry Csonka is, man
Get the fuck off my wee-wee
Pussy

[Verse 1]
Hey there, sugar baby, saw you twice at the pop show
You taste just like glitter mixed with rock 'n' roll
I like you a lot, lot, think you're really hot, hot
Know you think you're special when we dance real crazy
Glam-ophonic, electronic, disco, baby
I like you a lot, lot, all we want is hot, hot

[Chorus]
Boys, boys, boys (We like boys in cars)
Boys, boys, boys (Buy us drinks in bars)
Boys, boys, boys with hairspray and denim
And boys, boys, boys (We love them, we love them!)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, whoa-oh-whoa-oh
Oh, whoa-oh-whoa-oh

[Verse 2]
Baby is a bad boy with some retro sneakers
Let's go see The Killers and make out in the bleachers
I like you a lot, lot, think you're really hot, hot
Let's go to the party, heard our buddy's the DJ
Don't forget my lipstick, I left it in your ashtray
I like you a lot, lot, all we want is hot, hot

[Chorus]
Boys, boys, boys (We like boys in cars)
Boys, boys, boys (Buy us drinks in bars)
Boys, boys, boys with hairspray and denim
And boys, boys, boys (We love them, we love them!)
Boys, boys, boys (We like boys in cars)
Boys, boys, boys (Buy us drinks in bars)
Boys, boys, boys with hairspray and denim
And boys, boys, boys (We love them, we love them!)

[Bridge]
I'm not loose, I like to party, let's get lost in your Ferrari
Not psychotic or dramatic, I like boys and that is that, it's
Love it when you call me legs, in the morning buy me eggs
Watch your heart when we're together, boys like you love me forever

[Breakdown]
Oh, whoa-oh-whoa-oh
Oh, whoa-oh-whoa-oh
Oh, whoa-oh-whoa-oh
Oh, whoa-oh, uh, uh

[Chorus]
Boys, boys, boys (We like boys in cars)
Boys, boys, boys (Buy us drinks in bars)
Boys, boys, boys with hairspray and denim
And boys, boys, boys (We love them, we love them!)
Boys, boys, boys (We like boys in cars)
Boys, boys, boys (Buy us drinks in bars)
Boys, boys, boys with hairspray and denim
And boys, boys, boys (We love them, we love them!)
Boys, boys, boys (We like boys in cars)
Boys, boys, boys (Buy us drinks in bars)
Boys, boys, boys with hairspray and denim
And boys, boys, boys (We love them, we love them!)

[Intro]
Give it to mama
Give it, give it
Give it to my mama, oh
Give it
Give it to my mama

[Verse 1]
For some strange reason
You're done pleasin' me like it's okay, ohh
Like a perm that's been left too long (It starts to burn)
The result is it just won't take, ohh (I can see)
Now it's all coming so clear to me now (I can see)
Misinterpreted all my naiveness
Was just thinking if I had no you then I can't do
My stock just went up over two million

[Chorus]
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
(Give it to mama)

[Post-Chorus]
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, red light, green light

[Verse 2]
Some see me, say I should be trophied
'Cause it gets no stronger
Ladies, y'all know (Yeah girl, ya'll know)
This pimp-ish gets no older
Is that a threat? (What's another threat?)
Yep! (That's another threat)
I'm immune, you can't get no colder
You got the green light, you the king, right?
You holdin' up traffic, green means go!

[Pre-Chorus]
Go, go, go, goooo
Go, go, go, goooo
Go, go, go, goooo
Go, go, red light, green light
(I said you're holdin' up traffic, green means go!)

[Chorus]
So if you want to, you got the green light (Green light, baby)
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
Give it to mama

[Bridge]
(Go, go, go, go)
Ain't no problem, you can go
I will find somebody else (Go, go, go, go)
It's alright, I'll move along
You got the green light so you can go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, red light, green light
I gave all I could give
My love, my heart
Now we're facing the end
From what you did from the start, my love
You're holdin' up traffic, green means go!

[Chorus]
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
(Give it to mama)

[Outro]
(Go, go, go, go)
Ain't no problem, you can go
(Go, go, go, go)
I will find somebody else
(Go, go, go, go)
So why not move along?

You got the green light so you can go

Go, go, green light

[Intro: Female]
I miss you (I miss you, I miss you)
Where you been? (Where you been?)
It's been months and I haven't heard from you, I need you

Come back, I need you in my life (Come back)

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
What's up baby? (What's up baby?)
It's been a while (Been a while)

I've been around (Uh)
Different girls (Where?)
Different towns (Yeah)
To keep it real (Keep it real)
You missing out (Uh)
I’m on board, next city (Onboard, next city)
Random call, text with me (Random call, uh)
Like, I missed you so much, have sex with me
Not right now, look you know I got the ex with me
She like fuck that (Fuck that)
I don't care Dom (Care Dom)
So selfish and that really isn't fair Dom (Fair Dom)
Meet me here, where Dom? (Meet me here, where Dom?)
Get undressed, yeah, Dom (Uh)
Yeah, Dom, what you need?
Some bomb head? A bag of weed? (Bomb head, yeah)
Good food? Japanese? (Yeah, yeah)
That's me on page forty in that magazine
Dom Kennedy, you need that
She said nobody come close, I agreed back (Uh)
I'm the nigga who used to help her pull that weave back (Yeah)
And she need me, believe that (Yeah)

[Chorus: JaVonte]
That girl is smoking
And can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What's up love? (What's up love?)
It's been a while (Been a while)
You been good? (Been good?)
I've been around (Uh-huh)
Remember dinner dates I was late? Mr. Chows (Uh-huh)
Truant like a student, you the principal (Alright)
Schooled me on timing, we was both shining (Alright, alright)
Like the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond (True)
I was Your Highness, you was my queen (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
You got over him when I got in between
Watching Martin on TBS as it was tedious
For us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished
But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
Every time I put the head in you would panic
And come right down like an avalanche
Make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants
Baby how that sound? Kosher, no sir
Wake it back up, Folger's holsters
By my waistline, shot for your heart
And you called it a hate crime, say you want me back
And your girl wanna date Dom, that's high school shit
401K, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that?

[Chorus: JaVonte]
That girl is smoking
And can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on

[Verse 3: MURS]
I upped and walked out, now she crying 'cause
She need me, I got that Jon Brion love
Had to find love, we called it punch-drunk
We was a two-piece, she was a one-punch
You know, a knock-out, and if she was to walk out
My heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out
There we go again, what the fuck you talking 'bout?
We used to fuck all the time back at my momma's house
Smoking beedies, laying on the futon
Memories I got saved up like a coupon
And we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed
I was broke then, couldn't cop the best weed
Then she would just leave in a black hatchback
Homies from the hood used to ask me if I'd tapped that
I would say, "Yep," smiling so freely
That was back then, but I bet she still need me
She need me, she need me
She need me, she need me
I would say "Yes," smiling so freely
That was back then, I bet she still need me

[Chorus: Javonte]
That girl is smoking
And can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on

[Chorus]
To all my ladies, think it's about time
'Cause there's just one thing that's on my mind
Your body, your body
To all my ladies looking so fine
There's just one thing that's on my mind

Fresh I am (Yes), yes, I am (Yes)
Skinny jeans on (Oh), I wear them (Yes)
I'm such a little kid, get my high chair then (Haha)
But look at my watch and what's under my chin (Yep)
So icy (Uh), your girl like me (Yes)
True Blood but I told her don't bite me (Nah)
Forget the club, let me see what you liking
She said she wanna just do it like Nike (Check)
Well okay, let me put it down (Yeah)
I turn into a freak when nobody's around ('Round)
When you under the sheets, I know what's going down (Down)
Down, down (Uh, yeah)
And she don't wanna leave me though, she keep coming back (Yeah)
It must be the Louis bags and them hunnid stacks (Oh)
Or I make her cum fast like she runnin' track
Magnum, Jimmy hat

[Chorus]
To all my ladies, think it's about time
'Cause there's just one thing that's on my mind
Your body, your body
To all my ladies looking so fine
There's just one thing that's on my mind
Your body, your body (Yeah, let me try once more)
I want you, girl (Ha)

[Verse 2]
B-R-E-E-Z-Y (Y)

Private jets, nevertheless, I travel the globe (Yeah)
I'm ready to go but first let me call my P.O. (Hah)
Aha, baby, take my hand and (Yeah)

[Chorus]
To all my ladies, think it's about time
'Cause there's just one thing that's on my mind
Your body, your body
To all my ladies looking so fine
There's just one thing that's on my mind
Your body, your body

[Intro]
Uh, haha (Hey, hey, hey)
Go and ride with me, get high with me
You lookin' fly with me, go and ride with me (Uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 1]
Hey, they say, "It's so funny, you're nobody with more money"
And the hoes love me, yeah, these other kids don't touch me
Full contact rap, no rugby
Pretty boy flow, why your girl so ugly?
My bitches don't want anybody but me
They puff trees, sip liquor, and suck D
Got a lot of people worried about the things I say
And a lot of different haters that they bring my way
I let 'em grill though, they can watch the money pile
While these groupie hoes run and try to hunt me down
Now every day feelin' like the best day ever
Heard it's a long road, but it get way better
A little money in my pocket, but my eyes on a million
Got these doubters listenin', surprised when they feel him
Ballin' like Jordan, you ballin' like Wilson
Feelin' like a kid again, chillin' watchin' Gilligan

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think they want to interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night
I don't think they want to interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night

[Chorus]
They tell me I'm the shit, I'm like, duh?
Girls on my dick, I'm like, duh?
Gettin' stupid in this bitch, so wassup?
Wake the whole damn world, homie, I don't give a fuck
Young, rich, and famous, thanks for askin', how are you?
Party every night, that's exactly what I do
Gettin' stupid in this bitch, so wassup?
Wake the whole damn world, homie, I don't give a fuck
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up (Oh)
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up (Oh)
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up

[Verse 2]
Hey, hear the alarm, time to start the day
Rub my eyes, light some weed, send my mind on its way
I'm gone, somewhere to my own dimension
I, show these hoes no affection
Just party every night, gettin' so demented
At that time, I'm lookin' in the mirror, seein' no reflection
Got me wonderin', why don't they get it?
Spend the night with me, I'm sure you won't regret it
Got some liquor on the way, the weed is twistin', you should stay
You still listen when they say the kid is spittin', gettin' paid
But my differences in age got me shittin' with a rage
'Cause what's written on the page straight sicker than some AIDS
I came to get fucked up (Fucked up), I, I came to act wild (Wild)
You, you came to prepare for the future, I live for right now (Now)

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think they want to interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night
I don't think they want to interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night

[Chorus]
They tell me I'm the shit, I'm like, duh?
Girls on my dick, I'm like, duh?
Gettin' stupid in this bitch, so wassup?
Wake the whole damn world, homie, I don't give a fuck
Young, rich, and famous, thanks for askin', how are you?
Party every night, that's exactly what I do
Gettin' stupid in this bitch, so wassup?
Wake the whole damn world, homie, I don't give a fuck
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up (Oh)
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up (Oh)
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Said I'm a fuckin' monster, a massive attack, I haunt ya
I mastered the rap, then fucked up the monitors, mastered that
After that, I went for thermometers, popped 'em all, then popped in the
Jaw of Tracy Veronica, holla back, they promised us
No pajamas, insomnia, will attack, I attack like piranha does
Hit your block like a comet- blah! And you all know what time it is
2012, mark your calendars, calisthenics and silencers
Exercisin' that trigger strap, rock with us, Metallica
Competition no talent, hmm, in the jungle, what's wild enough?
Just might stumble upon a pack of lions
No lyin', my soldiers dyin', this is Iraq, alliances
Lining with stars and bars of a prison rep, my science a-
-pplyin' pressure, her stretcher is needed, pay the proceeds
Or you live in debt, y'all soft as a giga-pet, you niggas can't see me
Unless you watchin' the TV or ultra huggin' my silhouette
My flow got the ceiling wet, I spit 'til I feel my breath
Who sinkin' my fuckin' chest? She fuckin' the fuckin' best
Mean my dick is the dick of death, mean I'm killin that pussy
Like Spike whenever that Jerry slept

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, Dre
Me and Andre the Giant, 6'7 and climbin'
Whether you storm to your climate, whether you're beat makin' or rhyming
Bumpin some Phyllis Hyman, hand full of diamonds like Jay fans
On a island with Ray Bans, glasses palmin' asses
That probably came wit' a great tan, hehe
I be the motherfuckin' mecca of this hub city spectrum
Where they at? I will dissect them like a fucking frog's rectum
Why you wreckin' with irreputable? My worst flow incredible
They probably call the federal after I slaughter several
Etcetera, etcetera, Bentley passin' up Celicas
They tellin' us about shit, HiiiPoWeR in your mouth, bitch
And Top Dawg can vouch, bitch, nigga, what you 'bout?
About face with army outfits, the general's here
That mean the hustlers and the criminals here
Penitence reachin' pinnacles of life and despair
And me I solemnly swear to handle mine like a Taliban and die for it
Only difference is I ain't never askin' Allah for it
Only difference is I be spazzin' and still a proud poet
Put me in a category, I don't know what's a sadder story
Guts and glory, your pain bore me you ain't really lived it
I take you to a block where they crippin'
Or Piru that 5'2 gun bigger than the torso of Pippen
Bitch, I been doin' it
Before you niggas ruined it, show me somethin' different
You either kissin' dick or givin' me distance
You live in a district of dimebags and dummies, I know your statistics
Who your boss? He more like my assistant
Get lost, have a egg and a biscuit
Break fast when we aimin' them biscuits
Pay cash when your chain come up missin'
Q! Q!

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Ah!
Double up, shit, what the fuck?
Get me some my promo poppin', setbacks droppin', soon they watchin'
I just lock and load explode, target flowed, I'm somewhere blowed
Marriotts and Swisher Sweets, L.A. nigga pro'bly east
Cheerin' for the ragin' beats, X O henny scrape the keif
Bangin C, I'm bangin', B, put them niggas next to me
Stop and focus, get the lead, I'm here now, let the hardest speak
Ya all them dudes got ovaries, period, run on sentence
Still I'm ventin', air conditionin', coolest breezes, ill diseases
Grip my penis, shoot my semen, still I'm comin', miles a runnin'
I was learnin' gettin' knowledge, head is throbbin', she's a goblin
We be mobbin' over bitches, stick and miss and she the business
Get a witness, pussy frenchin', just a mission
Poppin' off like on a mission, proposition, gettin' money, drop a nigga
Rush a nigga, stomp a nigga, crush a nigga, dust a nigga
Copperhead gon' thrust a nigga, heatin' up the winter, nigga
Somethin' to remember, nigga, hella sick, I got a spit
Curse with a verse like God told me kill the shit
Load the clip Heckler & Koch, the hoover king
Bada bing by the ding a ling, natural hoover
Fing ring with a vision clearin' it with Visine, asian from Beijing
Money make her cum, she cream- feed the weak, that's Wing Stop
At the start with rain drops, autobot
Space shuttle shittin' on your car lots- boy, stop!
Could at least got a saturn, huh? HiiiPoWer see our patent, huh?
Workin' on tracks like we never been free, 22 squezze niggas shootin' off C’s
Please thought a nigga shot 16’s
Rhyme sixteens- bada bing, bing, bing, bing.... bing

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
If you want to be from HiiiPoWeR
Please come to friend zone
But don't wowwy
You will not suck on my dick tonight

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I’m so fuckin dumb I wear diamonds on my thumbs
There’s a diamond on my dick so there’s a diamond on her tongue
I can’t feel you baby cause I'm romantically numb
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come
There’s nothing under God's sun that I haven’t done
I got a lot of problems, getting pussy just isn’t one
Girls are like buses every 15 min they run
Now they like potato chips I just can’t have one
And I might like you for a minute
But I don’t like your friends in my business
And I feel like you don’t deserve a visit
Cause you ain’t in the kitchen when you want a whipping

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don’t believe you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, ok I’m all about it, all for it
I’m all star team Jordan, small forward
I’m never putting up a shot unless it calls for it
No hesitation so I’m shooting if I draw for it
Pow, Pow, fuck is up, naw man I’m in this ho
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show
Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I’m in it for
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree
Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me
Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me
Wondering if I’m the best, Well-I-am, no Black Eyed Peas
Girls wanna fuck you, niggas gotta wanna be you
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to
So you can say whatever girl but we just don’t believe you

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don’t believe you

[Verse 3: Sean Garrett]
Ain’t that your girl
Ain’t that your money
Ain’t you the same nigga that say she want you that you funny
Ain’t you a gangsta, yeah funny
You gave em funny, gave you to you, fucking dummy
Classic line, bitches run like buses
Gucci say niggas asking why, why you with my girl
She let me get it nigga
She ain’t stupid, go turn up your radio
I’m the next young Lionel Richie
I gives a fuck about doing a fucking cameo
We don’ love em, we don’ love em, we don’ love em, NO!
They just love us, they just love us, cos we stack them O’s
Cos we whip it, watch her whip it when she whip it all
Thats gon hit, once they mention catching feelings two word don’t go

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don’t believe you
Yeah, Lupe
Commissioner, Chi-Town, F and F, collaboration
Do it like this here, that's right, that's right
Come on, yeah, come on come on
Come on come on, yeah

Now I ain't tryin' to toot my horn but look what I'm on
Man, look what I bought here, look who I taught here
Look how I fought here, For what I sought here
For everywhere I go, though, they be throwin' salt there
But it's cool though, I'mma keep it cool Joe
I'm as cool as cool Joe
Now look at my shoes, Joe
Now look at these shoes, yo
You can't find that
Unless you flyin' to Singapore
Homie you ain't buyin' that
All I'm tryin' to do is bringin' that time back
It was written, man, bring those rhymes back

Life after death homie, bring those lines back
Malcolm X, too tryin' to bring that shine back
It's my thing, I spit it like Sean King
It's more than just rhyming, I'm doin' 'bout nine things
The aforementioned executive board
Sittin' representin' the world famous
Grammy Award-winnin' (F&F?)
That's right, homie, Grammy Award winnin'
Could have been puttin' it in your face
But that's the poor in 'em
See, what I gotta front for
Who I gotta front for
Everythin' you doin', homie, is over and done for
But you can catch Lu chillin' in his one off's
If y'all dont know what that means, homie
Then y'all understand thats mean, homie
That means, homie, these jeans on me are only pale
After sewing machines, homie

Yeah, I'm just showin' you're mean, homie
Like a dictionary
Just listen clearly to the clean, homie
And this ain't fair, I'm barely on my lean, homie
I put my all like into a washing machine, homie
Double loader, you just watchin' me clean, homie
Wait til' I sod you in dirt
Oops, I spilled some 1st & 15th on me
And that stained Maine
You can try Canada Dry
Or you can try pouring Oxy Clean on me
Homie, it won't work clean
Chicken head resistant
Lady, you can't curse
God willin', we got the album comin' out, though
Ha ha , church

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Rose red and my diamonds blue (Remix)

And I'm ballin' like never before
My bitch super bad, she can never be yours, no sir
Walkin' in with a Glock 17 on
You fuckin' with the real like karate kings
We in club livin where trippin is big business
If we messin' 'round Rozay, it's bottles without a limit
Got they bar if they can catch me or take me like it was in it
That new Panamere tinted can't see who in it
Wiz at the club tryin to teach me how to dougie (Dougie)
Took her to the crib she told me, "Teach me how to suck it"
She cheated one for me cause she know I get that money
I don't know what that bitch thinkin', she can't get a dollar from me

[Hook: Meek Mill]
R-R-Rose red and my diamonds blue
R-R-Rose red and my diamonds blue

Aye, aye shit they catch me out in Philly
On Suzukis, poppin' wheelies with my nigga, Meek Milly

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'mma sing until I feel it, I'mma go until it’s done
I don’t need to say wassup and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody shoulda told you
I'm on one
You know I'm on one, yeah
I said I'm on one
You know, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink, it could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that ish, money that we got, never get that ish
Cause I'm on one, yeah
You know I'm one one, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You know what I like
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You just need to listen, I teach you how to fix it
Cause you're the only one cause I don't trust these women
I don't, I don't trust these women cause they might have me slipping
You're the only one
I don't trust these women cause they might have me slipping
Cause you're the only one cause I don't trust these women
I don't, I don't trust these women cause they might have me slipping
Cause you're the only one

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah, trust issues
Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Drake]
(Oh yeah, let's call up one drink and let's all get wasted
One drink and let's all get faded, yeah)

Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfucking North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more, guess that they don't really make em like me no more
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell them all leave their cell phones
On the table where we see them
I'm all day with it man, A.M to the P.M
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, that's that ish that drives me crazy
And that's all I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you

[Chorus: Drake]
Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah, trust issues
Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Let's call up one drink and let's all get wasted
One drink and let's all get faded, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Call up one drink and let's, let's call up one, uh

[Intro]
Hey ladies, I know you gotta feel me on this
You see there's something that's been worrying me and I need to get it off my chest
See when you got you a good man at home, don't you do him wrong
'Cause I'ma tell you what he thinking oh, ho, ho, whoa

[Verse 1]
It's 8:30, I know my baby kinda worried
I said I'd be there, said I'd make it in a hurry, well I ain't even on the way no, no, no
She thinking home is so perfect, but I guess it's 'cause her vision kinda blurry
She don't realize she do me so dirty and she don't recognize the things that she say
Things you say can drive a man so crazy, make him wanna leave your ass
Got one foot outside the door, I can't take no more, sometimes I wanna
Walk away and find another lady 'cause its so hard to please your ass
'Cause all the things I do for you, getting tired of the

[Chorus]
Things you do to make me wanna cheat on you
All I go through, make me wanna cheat on you
When you act a fool, I just wanna cheat on you
And I know it ain't cool, but I'm gonna cheat on you

[Verse 2]
You ain't worthy, you see my love, you don't deserve it
Can you take it, you can dish it, you can serve it, but when the tables turned on you, I'm wrong
When every man deserves happiness hey, I'm a dog, when you're the reason that it happened all along
And I try to look past it, oh but its the, its the, its the things you do

[Chorus]
Things you do to make me wanna cheat on you
All I go through, make me wanna cheat on you
When you act a fool, I just wanna cheat on you
And I know it ain't cool, but I'm gonna cheat on you

[Bridge]
Hey ladies, I know you gotta feel me on this
Uh it's, it's the things
Things you say can drive a man so crazy
Make him wanna leave your ass, woo, oh

[Chorus]
Things you do to make me wanna cheat on you
All I go through, make me wanna cheat on you and find another lady
When you act a fool, I just wanna cheat on you
And I know it ain't cool girl, but I'm gonna cheat on you
Things you do to make me wanna cheat on you
All I go through, make me wanna cheat on you and find another lady
When you act a fool, I just wanna cheat on you
Oh I do so many things for you girl and still you wanna act a fool
And I know it ain't cool, but I'm gonna cheat on you

[Outro]
Ooh, oh, dang
Yeah
Still at it
Villematic
What a life we chose
I'm sending this out to those
Who fell down, but then rose
I'm hot, I'm hellbound
With these flows, Cole
And when my story's told
Let it be know I'd never fold
I took my time
I gave my soul
I watched you shine
But me I glow
So, I'm coming for what I'm owed
You know?

[Intro]
Yeah, hey, Cole world

[Hook]
Hey, I gotta dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So if it's 'bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

[Verse 1]
Cole, walk with a nigga, I give you my pain
So much on my mind, I wonder how it fit in my brain
Scattered thoughts, dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart
Life can't get any worse, Stevie with his glasses off
'Cause I still don't see hope, lookin' for a quick fix
When everyone I see is broke, get lost in weed smoke
Knowin' it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably
Barely trustin' niggas, over a decade they been knowin' me
Shit, life at the bottom, nobody but God got em'
They say he wouldn't leave me, yet I'm fallin' like it's Autumn
Tell me, what do you do just when you're on your last dollar
And the stress of this mess you in can make your ass holla?
Do you fold, grow bitter and grow cold?
No longer fightin', now the only thing you grow is old
Or do you flip that fuckin' dollar to a dream?
Whether a scholar or a fiend, watch a pawn become a king
Cole!

[Pre-Hook]
Young nigga with his jeans low
Nice guy, just got a mean flow
Never seen rich but he's seen poor
Mr. Dollar and a Dream in case she know

[Hook]
That's all a nigga got
So if it's 'bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

[Verse 2]
Yeah, armed and ready, you niggas strung out, you spaghetti
Ya paper, confetti, small time, y'all on one, I'm on mine
You logged off 'cause I'm online, small talk from small minds
I wanna buy the mall but there ain't shit in this small town
This where I get my dough
My niggas make sure the money right and then I rip the show
I run the town they tried to call me underground
I spun around like, you wish
Homie my backpack Louis, now watch just how I do this
I got the nerds rappin' hard shit, dummies rappin' smart shit
Mozart meets Humphrey Bogart with this from the heart shit
Play your part, life is but a dream for me
I get a flash of nightmares when niggas scheme on me
It's hard to see my enemies, who infiltrated my team
I take a step back and notice that things ain't what they seem
That's when a nigga refocus, yeah I turn on them high beams
I got that red dot waitin', I'm wastin' your whole regime
I wish a nigga would, boy you can't out-smart me
I let you feel like you the shit, but boy you can't out-fart me
Ya never have it, I know you want what I got
But nigga you ain't me, but you are what I'm not
And that's a phony ass, lonely ass, Cole is what you know me as
But we far from homies, if you know my mama, you know me
If ya don't then well I'm sorry, you should get to know Kay
Man she been workin' too hard, I should send her a bouquet
My goal this year is a real one, gonna stack a million
And as soon as I do, Mama that 9 to 5 is through
And I know I ain't been callin', but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
And all the shit that you been through
My girl and then my brother too
'Cause this life gets hard on this road, yeah it's true
I don't never tell you how much I be stressin', but I do
But I suck it up for who? My fans and my mans
Who probably never ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans
Hoppin' in and out of vans, on the buses, on the planes
Gettin' brain from a bitch and thinkin' "Goddamn, what's her name?"
Sometimes I just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame
And then my other side kick in like, "Bitch, don't be so fuckin' lame"
Dang, what a life, another day, another night
At times this shit is all blurry, pray and hope that God heard me
Just for those prayin' for me, man I know that y'all worry
But I ain't never failed and you can bet I never will
Cole!

[Pre-Hook]
Young nigga with his jeans low
Nice guy, just got a mean flow
Never seen rich but he's seen poor
Mr. Dollar and a dream in case she ain't know

[Hook]
Hey, I gotta dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So if it's 'bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

[Outro]
Hey, 'cause nigga that's life, and trust me I'm livin'
Look what a nigga made out the shit that I was given
Look what a nigga made out
Look what a nigga made out
Got a dollar and a dream
Three

[Verse 1]
I put my heart and soul in this game, I'm feelin' drained
Unappreciated, unalleviated
Tired of comin' up short—fuck abbreviated
Want my whole name spelt out, my own pain spilt out
No pain, no gain, I blow brains—Cobain
Throw flames, Liu Kang, the coach ain't help out, so I call my own shots
I'm David Blaine, I'm breakin' out of my own box, you stay the same
But homie if you change, may you change for the better
Back when Martin King had a thing for Coretta
Wonder if she seen all the dreams he was dreamin'
Did she have a clue of all the schemes he was schemin'
Still loved him just enough to put up with the cheatin'
Months go by and only see him for a weekend
I say a prayer—hope my girl ain't leavin'
We all got angels, we all got demons
As you fall through the club
Bad bitches down to do all the above
Money come fast so bein' hungry don't last
Till you look in the mirror and you saw who you was
Cole World—it couldn't be more clearer
The time is now—couldn't be more here-er
My reign gonna last like 3-4 eras
Say hello to the real, I can be your hero

[Chorus]
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'ma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

[Verse 2]
Up in 1st class, laugh even though it's not funny
See a white man wonder how the fuck I got money
While he sit at coach, hate to see me walk past 'im
Young black pants sag, headphones blastin'
Know what he askin', "how did he manage?"
"With all the cards against him, he used them to his advantage!"
Slang we be speakin' probably soundin' like Spanish
Then I fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners
Some New York niggas thought it was funny callin' us 'Bama
Laughin' at the grammar cause they didn't understand us
Must've thought we slow, but little do they know
I came up in here to take advantage of that shit y'all take for granted
Opportunity that I would kill for
Lookin' at rappers like "what the fuck you got a deal for?!"
When I was assed out with my funds low
It's nice to know I had the whole world at my front door

[Chorus]
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'ma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

[Verse 3]
I made it to the rock, even though they tried to box me out
I got the key to the game, they tried to lock me out
But what they don’t understand is this is all planned
It’s a bigger picture and you can’t photoshop me out
Some nigga ask me why Jay never shout me out
Like I’m supposed to give a fuck
Don’t you know that I be out in France
Where the fans throw they hands like Pacquiao
Not cause my looks, cause my hooks could knock Rocky out
And my lines is designed from the heart
Young Simba been a lion from the start
Dumb niggas, y’all been lyin from the start
My life like a movie, truly
And these niggas is dyin' for the part
But, you’ll never play me like LeBron vs. Jordan
Twenty years, wonder who they gone say was more important
Both changed the game, came through and made a lane
Who’s to say that who’s greater, all we know, they ain’t the same

[Chorus]
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'ma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

[Intro: J. Cole]
Hey, huh, Cole World
Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, everybody got a bad side, drop, let me see that shit
What you say? "Cole ain't hot," what?
Where you read that shit? You believe that shit?
All cause some lame nigga tweet that shit?
Have you seen my shows? Have you seen my hoes?
If I wasn't hot, would they be so thick?
Guess not, got the game in a headlock
I'm blasting that, I'm laughing at you old niggas, Redd Foxx
Don't mind me, boy, I'm red hot, aw, nigga, they not
I'm over here, I'm over there, I'm everywhere, they not (I said)
You'll never play me, nice try, balling in a nice spot
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch
You don't want no problems, put yourself in a tight spot
So, you can look, but don't touch
I stay on my toes like the White Sox, cause

[Chorus: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no you can't make that back
So let's ball while we here, let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I'll make that back, fuck it, I'll make that back, go
Ugh, nice watch (turn up)
Ugh, nice watch (I know)
Ugh, nice watch
No more Mr. Nice Guy
Hello, Mr. Nice Watch

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Stack on black, I ain't never been a high-roller
Now it's racks on racks, never thought that I would ride Rover
But I'm back on track, add to the fact that I never really drive sober
Cole World, but I'm hot as shit, do that mean that I'm bipolar?
Young, black and gifted, I rap like it's Christmas Eve
Coach wouldn't let a nigga off the bench
Now wonder why I didn't quit the team, but
I'm cut from a different sleeve
Cole World 'til the wrist'll freeze
Hurry up wit' your pictures please, I gotta make history

[Chorus: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money, but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no, you can't make that back
So let's ball while we here, let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I'll make that back, fuck it, I'll make that back, go
Ugh, nice watch (turn up)
Ugh, nice watch (I know)
Ugh, nice watch
No more Mr. Nice Guy
Hello, Mr. Nice Watch

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Yeah, I got a Hublot, I call it Tebow
I strap that bitch with a gator band
Y'all niggas ball half-time, y'all niggas like the Gator band
Y'all niggas need a time out
Who got these niggas all wound up?
Cocksucker, I'm 730
Y'all know where y'all niggas gonna wind up?
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch
Only but a matter of time 'fore I hit y'all niggas with a nice shot
Y'all niggas better not call the law
Get no blood on my Audemar
Meaning y'all better not waste my time
When y'all ready I take you all to war
Meanwhile I'm just choppin' off doors
Put the front on the back, 'cause I'm back and forth
Put the front on the back of the 'Bach like a boss
So I'm frontin' on niggas when I'm backin' off
Uh, what up, Cole? It's your time, let's these niggas know
Adjust your Rollie on these motherfucking hoes
Whenever you ready, go

[Outro: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Ugh, nice watch)
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Ugh, nice watch)

[Intro]
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night, a hell of a night
So we could do whatever you like (Like, like, like...)
Hey, hey!

[Verse 1]
It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that's flattering, but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact, y'all need to practice that more
See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight
I said nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all
Money was an issue, but now that that's solved
I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantle
Dog my shows be off the handle
Take the proceeds go to gamble
Ha, bet it on black and pray, I quadruple my salary
If I win, maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealin' with some real-life shit
She be askin' "When?"
Bitch! When I feel like it

[Hook]
Cole World (World), Cole Life (Life), Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy! Ha, ha, ha!
I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here, hey!

[Verse 2]
Uh, turn up the 808's for me (Woohoo!)
Back when I was starvin' no one made a plate for me (Woohoo!)
Now I do it big and that's my day to day story (Woohoo!)
I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry
Bitch, I made this in the crib, watchin' Belly
Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck the niggas tell me
They say I'm takin' long, I tell em patience is a virtue
I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew
See, when you're spittin' so real
Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal
Got em' feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal
Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell
At times I watch the news and see they talkin' 'bout diplomacy
And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see
Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be
I think they scared of me, and they should be

[Hook]
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy! Ha, ha, ha!
I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here, hey!
Hm, ok, we're outta here (O-o-o-key-key-key)
I think it's safe to say we outta here
(We outta here, we outta here, we-we-we)
We outta here
I think it's safe to say we outta here

[Outro]
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night (Night, night, night)
A hell of a night (Night, night, night)
So we could do whatever you like (Like, like, like)
Hey (Hey, hey, hey...)

[Intro: J. Cole]
Hey, oh yeah
Uh, Cole world
Uh, oh yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look, Mama, we made it
Your son out in Barbados, cheese, eggs, and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like Plato's
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' 'bout girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls, and vandalizin' her curls
Sweatin' her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killin' niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey, Cole heatin' up like that leftover lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue 'bout the same thing
And tell me, why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing
Well

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat, Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, ay

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Oh yeah, to my college girl: Take the weekend off and come home soon
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room
But that thing tight like Fort Knox
So I call you when the tour stops
But baby, where your roommates?
Did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together
Smoke a little weed but her shit together
Now that I'm on I can pick and choose
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
Yeah, I heard the stories 'bout different dudes
Her man on campus, but it's fine by me
She say she only fucked like four–five niggas
So you know you gotta multiply by three

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat, Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, ay

[Intro]
Yeah
Hm, hm, hey
Wha's up, girl?
Hey
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Angel eyes, long hair, I see you cryin'—what's wrong there?
He did what? He fucked who? We know the story—what's new?
See I could probably rush you, tell you that he shoulda loved you
Take advantage, fuck you, tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do
But the truth is, we all the same, on different teams, but it's all a game
The objective, tryna score, you got a wife, you find a whore
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers, pull up her pants, you find the door
You drive her home, she mop you off, you bust again, and drop her off
Then repeat like an episode; why we cheat, I'll never know
Is it cause we rap? Heavens no, lotta niggas rap though, never blow
Like heterosexuals, girl you fine, from head to toe
Could it be cause my father let me know that he cheated and somehow
I never told, I never told

[Interlude 1]
Father: Hey you wanna be a man?
Son: Yeah I wanna be a man
Father: A man don't run and tell his mama everything he see
Son: I ain't gon' tell
Father: Alright, alright then man, be a man then
Son: Alright

[Verse 2]
Ok, that's what it is, I see the game, the hoes come, the seasons change
The hoes go, we rearrange, fuck up her life, she'll never be the same
The OG's that beat the game, forever young, Peter Pan
35? Still playing; Child support? Still paying
Juggling, bill paying, been running round, field daying
Wine and dine, meal paying, with hopes that she'll lay in
The bed and, get wet then, give head then, you bet man
The same girl who said we just met man, game colder than the fucking dead man
One night stands, no best man, no bridesmaids or Reverends
'Cause Wolverine's depressed and don't wanna be your ex-man
'Cause Cupid aims and throw the darts, there go the sparks and broken hearts
Who wanna build Noah's Ark just to have that shit torn apart?

[Interlude 2]
Wife: You know what? I need to talk to you
Husband: About what?
Wife: I don’t think this is uh, working out for us
Husband: Why?
Wife: I mean, I need some space. I mean no, I just wanna find myself, that’s all
Husband: What the fuck?!”
Wife: You know?

[Intro]
Raindrops from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds do fly

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ooh girl, I love you so
Good lord almighty, I’m in love with a whitey
I call her Aphrodite, I call her when I need her
And she give me good love 'til my nose start bleeding
Life is just like moving mountains
When I can’t cope, I’m hittin’ that slope
That great white hope, and it ain't no pressure
I can’t feel nothing, but I never felt better
Hmm, but you were just no good for me
Killin’ me softly, that girl is poison
Huh, I had to let you go, take things slow
Just so you know

[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
I’ll do it all again if I had the chance
Don’t feel the pain (Don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (Like novacane)
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Don’t feel the pain (Don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (LIke novacane)
Like novacane

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You used to make me feel so good
Like I was on top of the world
I'm sorry that I gotta stay away from ya
But that's what the doctor prefered
My friends told me leave you alone
And I just told 'em leave me alone
It's sad our thing had to end
The relationship was short and sweet, Nia Long
And I see her in the streets
But I can't bring her home
Man, I was on her line all day, no phone
Hah. No Arm & Hammer in my Tony Montana
And truth is—

[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf & Lil Wayne]
I’ll do it all again if I had the chance
Don’t feel the pain (Don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (Like novacane)
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Don’t feel the pain (Don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (LIke novacane)
Like novacane

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Sweet sugar hill, yeah I used to climb her
I never imagined she'd turn out to be but a cheap thrill
That sweet turned to sour, she gave me power
The world was ours
I used to feel invincible on that flour
But I had to change, Yeah, I had to change
So I left her for a bitch named Mary Jane
Now everything's cool, everything's fine
Girl, I'm moving on, I done left you behind
Every now and then you pop up on my mind
I might fuck you one last time, 'cause—

[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf & Lil Wayne]
I’ll do it all again if I had the chance
Don’t feel the pain (Don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (Like novacane)
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Don’t feel the pain (Don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (LIke novacane)
Like novacane

[Outro]
Raindrops from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds do fly

[Verse 1 - B.o.B]
You may not know my name but by the time I leave
You'll remember the B to the O to the B
And every single dot that's in between
And every time I hop up in the scene
I'm feelin' like I'm better than before
I'm ready for whatever if you feel me let me know
Cause I just wanna flow
I got up in this game tryna prove than I'm better than before
But I don't even sweat it anymore
I get up in the zone as I coast
As I take flight gravity better hold me tight
Your relativity don't mold me right
I'm every single kick, every snare, every line
Please don't compare niggas to me cause I'm HAM on the mic
I'm down for the gamble like a red pair of dice
You scared of the fight
When you lay down and prepare for the night
I be in the air on a flight
I don't even care what the time, high in the days of my mind
Every single face that'll say "Hey Bobby Ray" I say "Hi"
You livin' the craziest life
In a pair of shades I'mma bathe and the spotlight rays
Makin' every night club jump like raves
Braves, braves, home of the braves
Eastside Atlanta, that's where I stay

[Hook]
Yeah, I'll take you higher
Higher than you've ever been
See things you never thought
You thought would never exist, higher
Higher than you've ever been
Where we go we won't fall, we'll stay there
Cuz there's a place with no walls
It's been ages since we've gone
Get away, so long, levitate
Higher than you've ever been

[Verse 2 - Playboy Tre]
Yeah, what am I to tell you?
Streets never gave a drunk nothing but double shot of Hen
Couple friends in the pen, do a couple years come home
Year later, nigga locked up again
Man, calls on the phone, nigga what the biz?
God damn ya'll doin' ya'll thang
If life is a game, Tre, play that shit for your folk
Come home with the ring, champs
Do it for the hood, do it for the camp
Passport livin' nigga do it for the stamps
Do it for the deck 'til there ain't nothin' left
Beat a bitch back like a trunk full of amps
Trunk full of amps? Trunk full of amps
Posted up drunk on the street like lamps
Everybody high, but a word to the wise
Don't try my clique cuz they might get amped
So this for my niggas locked up who call
Said they want beats and the show's on the wall
Know every time that I hit that stage
I don't do it for myself man, I do it for us all
This for my niggas locked up who write
Take it through you, try and live my life
Fuck what they say, nigga get your pay
They wanna go high, so watch me fly

[Hook]
Yeah, I'll take you higher
Higher than you've ever been
See things you never thought
You thought would never exist, higher
Higher than you've ever been
Where we go we won't fall, we'll stay there
Cuz there's a place with no walls
It's been ages since we've gone
Get away, so long, levitate
Higher than you've ever been

[Bridge]
Higher (Higher than you've ever been)
Higher (Higher)
Higher (Higher than you've ever been)
Higher (Higher)

[Verse 3 - CyHi Da Prynce]
Okay, higher than you've ever been
Just when you won't find a better medicine
Now I highly recommend that you smoke it in a sweet
As me where I got it and I'll say I met a friend
Police at the door, I would never let them in
Everyday I wake up and try to set a trend
Thomas Edison with whatever I invent
Now I'm in a country that you ain't never been
Netherlands, doin' more interviews than David Letterman
I don't know too many niggas better than
Prynce CyHi, so who want a better Benz?
Vanilla, or yellow skin
Big booty bitch, call her Evelyn
Vegetarian when it comes to the green
Get your dog shot like a veterinarian
Tool in the seat
Fly young nigga keep it cool in the heat
Calmer than the farmer cuz I'm used to the beef
Got more soul than the shoes on your feet
Still a nigga free, then I move it to the east
She probably your girl, then she cute and petite
She said she got a man, what you doin' with a geek?
Fuck him baby, come and chill with the king

[Hook]
Yeah, I'll take you higher
Higher than you've ever been
See things you never thought
You thought would never exist, higher
Higher than you've ever been
Where we go we won't fall, we'll stay there
Cuz there's a place with no walls
It's been ages since we've gone
Get away, so long, levitate
Higher than you've ever been

[Verse 4 - Bun B]
Feels so dandy, comin' out candy
Grippin' on grain in a clean 'Lac
Go jump in the slab, put your seatbelt on
Then adjust your position and lean back
It's Bun B and B.o.B and we be all about them greenbacks
And we ain't farmin' no mean mugs
Or no lean thugs cuz we mean that
Represent, Lone Star State and Crush City, home of the Astros
Where them boys on the porch
Smokin' on kush, in a cigar, straight from Castro
We in the kitchen makin' all them fires
Gettin' that dough with havin' to pass go
And if you in the way of me and B.o.B gettin' this pay
We gon' let your ass know
That we the chosen, while you in time frozen
We go straight ahead
They sayin' he ain't this and he ain't that and he can't rap
Well man, fuck what a hater says
I keep on rollin' like a bald tire
With a bad broad out of Vogue, fire
Underground King, go to my empire
Cuz they might be high, but I'mma take them higher

[Hook]
Yeah, I'll take you higher
Higher than you've ever been
See things you never thought
You thought would never exist, higher
Higher than you've ever been
Where we go we won't fall, we'll stay there
Cuz there's a place with no walls
It's been ages since we've gone
Get away, so long, levitate
Higher than you've ever been

[Bridge]
Higher (Higher than you've ever been)
Higher (Higher)
Higher (Higher than you've ever been)
Higher (Higher)

[Intro]
Up up and away
Up up and away
Up, up up and away
Up, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm about to go, up up and away
Dick in your mouth, fuck what you say
You sweet as pie, a muffin or cake
Dick in her mouth, I'm fuckin' her face
Live for the night, sleep in the day
Get high as fuck, sleep it away
I am a dog, you sheep in the gate
Pussy, mmm, how sweet is the taste
Gun to your head, what you keep in the safe?
Weezy, bitch, I'm deeper than space
Floating away like a leaf on the lake
I'm gone, like delete and erase
Talk that shit, I walk that shit
Pills, weed, all that shit
If the bitch is bad, I'mma call that bitch
Get pussy, ass, all that shit
Umh, what they talking about?
I go hard, they soft as a couch
I'm running 'em in and walking 'em out
Cars so cold I parked in the house
Flows so raw, this beat is pregnant
Flow so tight, it's yeast infected
Kill 'em all when they least expect it
Money tall, Lisa Leslie
YMCMB connection
Rappers is what I eat for breakfast
Woman up in my sheets is sexy
If she ain't fucking, she can exit
Gun tucked in the waist, I'll bust in ya face
I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away

[Chorus]
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days

[Interlude]
Weezy (Yeah) Where ya going? (Up)
You're going a little bit too far (Haha)

[Verse 2]
Ain't this a bitch
I just saw my bitch kiss a bitch
You're lucky I don't kill your ass
But you can still get pistol whipped
Sharper than a pencil tip
Bitch don't even fix your lip
40 cal' with the extended clip
Ain't gon' be no incident
Skinny jeans, red Vans
Skully on, money long
Her mouth is like my house
So I guess you can say I'm coming home
You're wyling out then we're riding out
Now your hiding out, honeycomb
I'm laughing to the bank
Like I just broke my fucking funny bone
What's really good five?
I'm over here smoking that really good fire
Eyes so low I look blind
But the stove on my waist cook fine
I be with niggas that took lives
And niggas that'll take it outside
And niggas that'll take it to your crib
Take the baby out the crib and rape the housewives
I'm gon' get so wasted
They gon' have to carry me out this bitch
I took over this rap shit
These rappers are just my hostages
Let's cut to the chase, my bitch no habla ingles
But I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away

[Chorus]
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days

[Interlude]
Weezy (Yeah) Where you going? (Ha)
You're going a little bit too far (Up up and away)
Up up and away (Up up and away)
Up up and away (Up up and away)
Up up and away

[Verse 3]
Fuck with a nigga, if you fuck with a nigga
Fuck with me, good luck to the nigga
Straps on deck, so fuck that nigga
Leave you looking like lightning struck that nigga
Racks on deck, I'm rich as shit
I'm calling my bitch the shit
Walking around on my fuck it shit
I done did everything on my bucket list
Fuck that shit, I'm Superbad
I don't give a Hoover damn
Man, I son all these niggas
They should have a stupid tan
Ha, President Carter, vote for Lil Wayne
Sit your five dollar ass down 'fore I make change
I'm pumping your brakes, I'm jumping the gates
And I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away

[Interlude]
Weezy, where you going?
You're going a little bit too far
(Up up and away)

[Outro]
Up up and away (Up up and away)
Up up and away (Up up and away)
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days
Come here, I might need you
You're gonna have to tickle me or something
I need to smoke a cigarette

[Hook 1: T.I.]
Hey shawty toot that ass up for me while you back up to me
Make it stand up for me let's go, yea
Shawty lift that ass up drop it, got it standing rock solid
With this money in my pocket here you go

[Intro]
Bring the beat in

[Verse 1]
Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me, I just melt away

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts) But I know
(It's gonna take a little work) Oh
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first

[Chorus 1]
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, I can feel the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
Boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts) But I know
(It's gonna take a little work) Oh
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first

[Chorus 1]
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you (It's you)
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top

[Chorus 2]
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you (It's you)
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you, baby, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I always call
When I need you, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're the one that I need
You're the only one I see
Baby, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're the one that I need
You're the only one I see
Baby, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top

No tellin' what I'm gon' do
Baby I would rather show you
What you been missin' in your li-i-i-ife
When I get insi-i-i-ide

[Pre-Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
Girl what you drinkin'? Gon' let it sink in

Couple more shots, you open up like a book

Shawty I ain't trippin' (I just wanna please ya)
I'ma take a shot of Nuvo, shawty then you know
It's going down, we can go and kick it like judo (Judo)
You know what I mean
Shawty got drunk, thought it all was a dream
So I made her say "ah, ah-ah"
Now she got her hand on my leg
Got my seats all wet in my ride (All wet in my ride)
All over my ride (All over my ride)
She look me dead in the eye, eye-eye
Then my pants got bigger, she already knew what to figure
Had her lookin' at her boyfriend like, "Fuck that nigga!"

If you lookin' like a model, when them broke fellas holla

[Intro]
Gotta be cool baby, ya know what I'm saying

[Verse 1]
Jump out your car in the middle of the street
Open up your trunk, let the bass beat
Go ahead
Go ahead
You gotta walk up in the club bare-footed
I like that booty, you know where to put it
Go ahead
Go ahead
Now Mama, you look so professional
I'm following you, sweating you
I can't believe I'm doing what I'm doing
What is wrong with my head?
Go ahead
Cuz baby I like how you working it
I'm watching you, you twerking it
I'm trying to get you out of this club
And get you up in my bed
Go ahead

[Hook]

Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty work
Booty work, booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty work

[Verse 2]

Black car, black rims
Black shirt, black Tims
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Holy moly, look at her
She got the boots, with the fur
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Now mama, I can see that thong on you, the DJ played the song for you
I'm trying to drive my stick shift... all over them curves
Say word
If you keep playing with my fitted we gone get it, get it, get it
Girl, I represent the Nappy Boy clique, so I know that you heard
Say word
(Nappy Boy)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Girl, it must be a crime to be as fine as you
You know exactly what I'm trying to do
You see me, I'm trying to keep it jumping
Girl, I got a Chevy with hydraulics and you reminding me of it
Up and down, up and down, girl you know what's happening
Round of applause: keep that booty clapping
Them other girls lacking what you packing
And you got them embarrassed by what you got from your parents
I'm trying to see them shorts, spread apart
I ain't coming up short, Kevin Hart
Now take off
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Take off
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Move your feet, cut a rug
Put your hands up if you're the baddest in the club
Take off, come on baby keep on doing what you're doing
Girl I'm tryin get you next to me
But first you gotta let me see that

[Hook]

[Now let me see that booty work, booty work

[Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek
Show off, show off, show off, Boom!
Show off, show off, show off, Boom!]
Gimme that '94 Puff shit, Ali
I'm so appalled, Louis Vuitton draws
The shit, a booth for me is a bathroom stall
If you're not fond of me, you're comedy, Little Duval
I have a lot of flaws, I'm human before all
I wake up in the morning smell some coffee, then tell your bitch to get off me
Mos Def, word to every autopsy
Man that boy bad, man that boy spaz
'Til he crash like Sandra Bullock and Luda on the ave
He changed his name, he a conscious rapper
Naw mutha'fucka I'm just Compton's rapper
I might spit some intricate shit for retards not to get
But really I'm just as rude as Marshall Mathers
Is that a contradiction? He contradicting himself again?
Of course that's a contradiction, the fuck you think life is?
We not like like Christ is
We all want ices and devices to make the bitches say I like this
People don't understand why I went southpaw
I looked in the mirror and said I can't be like y'all
I can't be like Game, I can't be like Eazy
To get in this rap game, I know it won't be easy
Cause my shit different
I know
He from Compton, where he from, have he killed before?
Truth is, I ain't the most ruthless, but I'm not cupid
Before she had two kids my momma worked two gigs
To get out Chicago
To move right back to another ghetto, on Sante Fe playing the lotto
I used to want a champagne two door Tahoe
Until I seen that same truck shot by five-o
Dead with his eyes closed, y'all should've seen him
Off a gallon of cough syrup, but rifles had leaned him
That's why these tough rappers man I don't believe 'em
Y'all wanna be 'em, I wanna grab bats and beat 'em
So they can feel the pain of the blocks I'm from
Where my heart turned numb
And the powder and the shells come up off that gun
Come up off your chain, or come up off your life and have a fatherless son
It's the syllabus for the ignorant militant mind
'quivalent crimes for jail sentencin'
No one preventin' this war
You sure, you sure
Sure as the edges on every ocean, now let's explore
The Kendrick Lamar LP I been promotin' for 'bout a month
Don't worry its comin' soon, like a fast nut
I never be gassed up, some labels they passed up
Now the industry crashin', I guess they got bad luck
Your bad, you don't write neither? There goes another fad
Shit I write ether
I get it in like the Vanna on Wheel of Fortune forcin' your forfeit
With the strength of the prime forces of four fork lifts
This is very extra necessary
This extra scary, this is Amityville
This the Exorcist on ecstasy pills
And if I can't do it my integrity will
Head dog wishes, every Compton bitch is
I mean this shit is
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
They all got a fat ass but lower case titties
Now I gotta mix and match, jungle fever, white and black
Double D, Brittney, Becky get your mouth intact
Reg call 'em Jabberjaw, she gon' hop skip and jog
Just to read my twitter blog
Man these hoes pitiful
And to you bloggers that say I'm weak
You know how long I took to chop this fuckin' beat?
Y'all don't 'preciate shit
All y'all do is hate shit
And if I don't say shit y'all still say I ain't shit
And that's ridiculous
I mean that shit is
Fucking ridiculous
Ocean gang bitch, crank up the volume
Yo bitch on my dick, she suck me like a vacuum
What the fuck you talking bout

Niggas getting mad, i’m like the third ring on saturn
Causing up disaster, it’s tragic when I swerve hard

Niggas getting mad because I make it look so easy
Niggas cannot see me, I call them little stevies
Riding thru my trap, and I see niggas wanna be me

Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way to far away

[Verse one]
T.V light blue and white

Move over to the space where you should be
Even after you seem so far
Over mountains and diamond stars
Everybody has their own way home

[Hook]
Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are

The picture and the thought of you
Getting all the love that you deserve

Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms

If home is where you are
Home is way too far away

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Do you remember, that October night
The twenty ninth, I almost lost my life
Call myself being a hero trying to guard your heart
No matter how hard I fought, it was over before it started
I thought that we were

[Pre Hook: Frank Ocean]
On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
I guess what we have doesn't matter

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love, I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
All I ever did was just try to play my part
Try to be the man who would not let you get taken advantage of
But you let it go on, and every time I see you with him
I wanna crack his dome, (t-tell me that I'm wrong)
But I thought we were

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
Guess what we have doesn't matter

[Hook: Frank Ocean & James Fauntleroy]
You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]
You have me dying
Fighting, every night
Dying
Fighting, every night

[Hook: Frank Ocean & James Fauntleroy]
You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
On the same side of the battle, oh....

She might not be the one you see in a magazine
She might not be the one you fantasize in your dream
She’s the only girl left in the world that can guarantee what you need tonight

[Verse 2: Akon]
With my G's and we riding in a magnificent car
And we rollin' with the baddest chicks and you won’t see a flaw
Booty riding up so perfect, badder than my Audemars
And I pound it up so perfect it'll hit her 'til tomorrow

[Chorus: Akon]
Watch her crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up

[Post-Chorus: Akon]
She might not be the one you see in a magazine
She might not be the one you fantasize in your dream
She’s the only girl left in the world that can guarantee what you need tonight

[Refrain: Akon]
With my G's and we riding in a magnificent car
And we rollin' with the baddest chicks and you won’t see a flaw
Booty riding up so perfect, badder than my Audemars
And I pound it up so perfect it'll hit her 'til tomorrow

[Chorus: Akon]
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up

[Bridge: Akon]
She’s trying to make me fall in love again, yeah
The way she moving I can tell you she’s almost there, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Akon]
She might not be the one you see in a magazine
She might not be the one you fantasize in your dream
She’s the only girl left in the world that can guarantee what you need tonight

[Chorus: Akon]
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up

[Verse 1]
My best friend
What was cooler than us?
Whole school already knew what it was
Kiddy crushing, puppy loving, no
Ah, you are my high school wifey
College made it different
I stayed at home and you didn't
You got a scholarship to Michigan State
Drove my heart two-thousand miles away

[Pre-Hook]
And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

[Hook]
Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her
She won't say hello, hello, hello
She won't say hello, hello, hello
Nah, nah, she won't

[Verse 2]
My best friend, wish I could have went with her
Can't afford to visit her
Let alone stay
But I wanna, I really wanna
Oh, we did everything together, now I'm missing all the silly shit
The way she bit her bottom lip after we kissed
I'm x-ing off the calendar days
I'm praying, oh, you come back again

[Pre-Hook]
And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

[Hook]
Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her

[Bridge]
My baby (baby), what am I to do without her?
Whoa I've been losing patience calling her

[Pre-Hook]
And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

[Hook]
Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her
She won't say hello, hello, hello
She won't say hello, hello, hello
Nah, nah, she won't

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G]
Another day in the ghetto
One look outside I'm already upset yo
It look about a hundred-and-two
It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nuttin to do
Uhh, I'm intrrupted by a phone ring {*brrrrring*}
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfuckin thing
"Hello hello? Can I speak to Biggie?"
Yo who dis? "Taisha" Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don'tcha hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team
I seen a honey with a butt looking butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sitting all thick, with the ruby red lipstick {*SMACK*}
That's the one I gotta get with

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G]
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I'm tryna get with ya girl, I ain't even going stunt
Miss Fat booty, man I seen it from the front
I mean that shit was pumped, had me fiending from the jump
And that ass was right, shit would make a fag look twice
So I approach like “shawty , whats good with cha?”
Nigga was hopin’ to go back to the hood with ya
And yeah I see them other niggas tryna look at cha
Wouldn’t slang the thing right even if they could get ya
Me I’m from the Ville where we learn how to mack well
And you gon’ yell when I hit it from the back well
Take you to the crib and throw on a little Maxwell
Grab a condom know cause, shit, I don’t know you that well
Haa, was fucking with that
Far from hater but see dem brothers was wack
So don’t you worry bout them mean muggin’ girl
I’m tougher than that
And niggas mad cause this light skinned brotha is back
I’m sayin’ though

[Hook & Interlude]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Stripes on the Polo
On the late night, fucking your wife on the low low
My pipe like a pogo stick, no homo
No ice but I’m cold though
Cologne on my nuts in case she might wanna go low
I’m from the Ville where niggas fight for the dolo
So think twice or take the same advice from the fo’fo’
Me running to PoPo and muthaf-ckin’ no go
A Carolina nigga, I’m the muthaf-ckin logo
Shit, fly as hell on my ozone shit
Disrespect me nigga you could get your cornroll split
And that goes for you too, I’m on my Bono shit
Niggas got no delivery thats that Digiorno shit
I got porno chicks callin’, I still neglect them nigga
I’m about my money like a bill collector
For you slow niggas I put it more in laymans
If you ain't talkin’ money its a foreign language
But uh, shawty can I get wit cha

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G]
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

[Chorus]
What up cousin, how're you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
So, what up cousin?

[Verse 1]
How you been, homie?
What it is, homie?
Without you here, your family feel lonely
But it's all good cousin, we gone carry on
Although it seems so unfair you're gone
People nowadays never focus on the positives
Cause life now only good when the guap is big
They talkin' shit, hatin' for no reason
And haters is stupid
Baby my flow, leave 'em
So confused cause they all up 'bout this dumb shit
Lisa said she love it and the other shit is rubbish
So I'ma make my time here worth it, real good for you
Lookin' back like there's nothin' I couldn't do
And there's nothin' that I wouldn't do to bring you back
Poetry, heart and soul singin' rap
I've been thinkin' that I found my passion
Rappin' 'bout the future in an old-school fashion

[Chorus]
What up cousin, how're you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
So, what up cousin?

[Verse 2]
They say my style ain't different
I'm just like e'ry body else
They say my pitches gotta change up
But all those people is just hatin' cause they don't know how to love they-self
Mad when someone bring my name up
And it's unfortunate cause I'm just here comin' from the heart, shit
I'm just tryna find somethin' for the market
And I ain't sayin' that I'm from the worst hardships
But my life ain't no walk in the park
It's been a shark pit, dark with no harvest
Drivin' in a car but can't find a place to park it
I got some people that I really need to ball with
That musta been what got this shit started
There's been some people that I hadn't said goodbye to
But my life gotta go on, and it don't mean that we forget
Because we dedicate our lives to, that's why I wrote this fuckin' song

[Chorus]
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
So, what up cousin?

[Verse 3]
Shit's real out there, ain't nobody playin' round
I got some bangers and some druggies that I hang around
E'ry body do they own thing
And you can find me on the corner makin' money when it's snowing
I sell a lil' weed, get my pockets fat
But I talk to cats who be movin' lots of crack
It ain't the good life, it ain't the bad, it's just makin' the best of what we have
I'll put the dollars down and move into the lab
That's how much I want this music shit to last
And some days I feel it's movin' too fast
Schools gone pass, not remembering a class
Suddenly before you know it's time to grow up
Focus on the real, try not to get ya' hopes up
So far I've had some hard work and a lil' luck
Once I make it to the money, I ain't gon' give it up

[Chorus]
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
So, what up cousin?

[Verse]
I'm on The Come Up
Chill nigga, don't run up
A yellow nigga, finna rise and shine like the sun up
My mind on that paper, I ain't trying to wife the slut up
I'm dying for this cake and I ain't trying to wipe a crumb up
They ride with the gun up, kill you and light the blunt up
Uh, don't shed a tear if a nigga might get done up
But, just say a prayer if a nigga might confront us
'Cause his life is summed up, the medics wipe his lungs up
You coming to the 'Ville? You need to get a license from us
City on my back, I feel like I'm holding Big Pun up
No pain no gain, my nigga, I just numb up
I blow brains, Cobain a nigga if he jump up
With no shame, don't blame a nigga if you shot up
This is cocaine on flame, baking soda and water
And if you feel that then I guess I sell crack, get it?
Fall back, man, a nigga feeling crazy
Shitting on niggas like a nigga was still a baby
Carolina nigga shout-out to the 'Ville that raised me
So many hoes whipped, you would've thought we still in slavery
And niggas still sleepin' they feelin' lazy
Uh, a killer maybe, you make me I will
Cheat me on my scrilla, I send you to meet Dilla
From them NC streets where the beef they deliver
And the clip is on E 'cause your chest got a fill up
While a nigga like me is just getting head like a pillow
Bread like gorillas getting bred
So long as my momma and my niggas getting fed
Fuck what a nigga said, man, I'm Fayettenam bombing
'Cause hatred is flattery you bitch niggas is charmin'
Who the fuck you harmin'? Boy, ya'll niggas is charmin'
And I'm armed and waiting for a target
You fucking with the best like Carmen
Aw shit, pardon a nigga for departing
I'm just getting green like a yard or a garden
A nigga finna blow while you niggas is false alarmin'
And just think, man, I was raised on ramen
Chicken noodle soup, now I'm filet mignon-in'
I promised my momma I was coming to make this money
And I swear I'm going to kill the nigga that try to take it from me

[Outro]
Yeah, that's real talk, nigga
It's J. Cole, nigga
Therapist whatever the fuck you wanna call him, it don't matter
You know, I'll make y'all niggas understand man
I know you can't believe yourself right now
You thinkin' this niggas from the south, hahaha
He can't spit, how the fuck is he so good?
Open your eyes motherfucker, can you see? Niggas on top
Yup, we on top

[Hook]

[Verse 1:Trey songz]

Still...

Whipping the chevy, still getting my tipped licked
When I'm ready I still fall off intheparty like confetti
It's still mad rappers, D. Dot Angelettis
Still just as skinny as you met me
Still keep it real, never will let another disrespect me
For real, til deep in peace they rest me
Still smoke cess cause I swear that they stress me
And when I'm home a lot, keep the chrome a lot
Cause even when I'm home I'm knowin' there ain't a lot of dudes
That don't like the fact I'm blowin'
Like some running shoes on the track I'm goin'
Tell these other dudes they slack I'm sewin'
Don't get hemmed up, I think Timmed up
Cause in my mind it's the winter time all the time
I'm a grind
Tell em I'm a rhyme, told em that this sing got me signed
Try to put me in a box I will not stay there
And if I fall I will not lay there
Grown man, this is not daycare
A big boy game, they do not play fair
But I still keep it trill and I got this chair
Still uncomfortable if cops is there
My fam still dysfunctional, we not repaired
Still got rhymes out the asshole
Still wonder why are they mad for
Cause I'm in the hood like the crack-ho diesel
Ask yo people, Trey still do it for the people
Ride with some inter straps your whole fucking car is illegal
Still pick good over evil
Still play the Jesus and it's wild cause I'm still sinning
Addiction still weed-puffin, giving it to women
It's still my brain ready to bust up out my skull
To the mic, cause my mouth to be saying shit right
They saying shit like, I don't be killing it
You niggas is ridiculous, eat a dick or some syphilis
Die slow, still I done sucked it up
Drake tell em what the fuck is up

[Verse 2: Drake]
I used to cut the porch lights on
And now I cut the Porsche lights on
Just to let em know their foresight's wrong
Where this nigga going with that obscure ice on
He a lame, I'm tryna get my mature life on
I asked what happen, or whats hattenin', hattenin'
Hop up out the passenger and help me back the phantom in
Damn, I never got to use that in a convo
Never got the chance to put you back in a condo
And, and, it couldn't be more true
I always meant to get you that villa in Corfu
Women I pass off, and money I tore through
Now all I really need is the number before 2
Is it over, tell me it isn't over
They told me it was easy as I get a little older, yeah right
And this is what my life outro sound like
Even though Dre did it this shit don't sound right
I was, born to do it, born to make bomb music
I flow tight like I was born Jewish
Well, actually I was born Jewish
I guess at this point you could say I was born foolish (ha)
Yea, what about the grammy's and the bubbly
What about all my fans that be loving me, I
Used to chill in them spots where the trouble be
But never ended up in that menage at the Double Tree
What about that girl Rita down in Basque
In L.A Swear I would of never cheated on your ass
But you ain't give me yo number cause them niggas got to fighting
Situation got me thinking and that's when I got to writing, hmm...
Change these hundreds for me cashier
Cause I ain't made it but I'm better off than last year, yeah
And what it look like hun'
I never got to make it rain but it look like fun
And, uh, a king is what I'm fit to be
I don't get these niggas, they a mystery
I mean they talk so quiet as if it its private
And they don't ever bring that shit to me, but
Man I ain't live life so wrong
I said fuck a couple dudes, cause I ain't like yo song
Least let me tell you why I'm this way
Hold on...

[Chorus: Etta James]
Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Yes I can, doubt better leave, I'm runnin' with this plan
Pull me, grab me, crabs in the bucket can't have me
I'll be the president one day
January first, oh, you like that gossip?
Like you the one drinking what God sip—dot com
Now I got a word for your tongue
How many rolling stones you want?
Yeah I got a brand new spirit
Speaking it and it's done
Woke up on the side of the bed like I won
Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun
G5 dealer, U.S. to Taiwan
Now who can say that? I wanna play back
Mama knew I was a needle in a hay stack
A Bugatti boy, plus Maybach
I got a feeling it's a rap, ASAP

[Chorus: Etta James & Flo Rida]
Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
The mountain top, walk on water
I got power, feel so royal
One second I'ma strike all you
Diamond, platinum, no more for you
Got adrenaline, never giving in
Giving up's not an option, gotta get it in
Witness, I got the heart of twenty men
No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever, can't hold me down
A hundred miles gunning from the pitcher's mound
Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee
No trick plays, I'm Bill Gates, take a genius to understand me

[Chorus: Etta James]
Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

Let's get it, let's get it
I know you got the good feelin'
Let's get it, let's get it
Gotta love the life that we livin'
Let's get it, let's get it
I know you got the good feelin'
Let's get it, let's get it
Gotta love the life that we livin'

[Chorus: Etta James]
Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah

[Hook]
I got a couple sweets rolled and whole 'nother O in a Ziploc
They see the pockets on swole while the light hit the stones on the wristwatch
Don't gotta ask who run it, man it's easy baby they know my name
All the cash that we blow on some weed smoke - they say, bro it's a shame
Boy, you know it's a shame

[Verse 1]
Pockets bulky like Pop-eye
And I'm pimp all the hoes call me Papa
Gucci, Chuck Tays, I don't fuck with no Prada
Fresh off the plane and I'm smoking like High Times
It's better to be a star
NY - I'm copping them weed jars
LA - my hoes got medical weed cards
And my swag through the roof
I hit the mall a boutique and tear it down
See what I got on you want to wear it now
Think I'ma trick on her, but she get nothin'
Married to my money so bitch think I'm taken
She keep beggin' me to creep
I heard your song I can do better in my sleep
All my niggas rumble, some better with the heat
Better keep the peace (might wanna do that)
There's ink everywhere you see
And I only smoke good weed
Only wear designer man
If I fuck with baby girl, gotta be a 9 or 10 (swag)

[Hook]
I got a couple sweets rolled and whole 'nother O in a Ziploc
They see the pockets on swole while the light hit the stones on the wristwatch
Don't gotta ask who run it, man it's easy baby they know my name
All the cash that we blow on some weed smoke - they say, bro it's a shame
Boy, you know it's a shame

[Verse 2]
Last night I made a bitch forget all about her man
The reason for them guts in your garbage can
I roll expensive spliffs
She fuckin' me for free, but for you she's one expensive bitch
Keep blowin' up my sidekick, know I'm at the studio
Another couple thousand, every time I do a show
That meaning I'm really eating
And everyday of my life is like the weekend (swag)
I wake up to good weed and new clothes
Go to sleep with more money and bad hoes
One of my 3 phones buzzin' through my sleep
I know you heard of my name
I'm buzzin' all through the streets (Yeah)
And I be with bosses
Get your shit together nigga or count your losses
And in case you ain't get the portrait
I'm a make it clear: motherfucker it's star year (swag)

[Outro]
Yeah Man, It shouldn't be no surprise for y'all niggas
Swisher sweet flickin'
Chavo Chasin, Taylor Gang, Heavy Hustle

[Hook]
I got a couple sweets rolled and whole 'nother O in a Ziploc
They see the pockets on swole while the light hit the stones on the wristwatch
Don't gotta ask who run it, man it's easy baby they know my name
All the cash that we blow on some weed smoke - they say, bro it's a shame
Boy, you know it's a shame
I been young, I been old
I been hurt and consoled
Heart of cold, heart of gold - so I'm told
I been lost, I been found
I been taken by the sound of my own voice
Voices in my head

[Hook]
I can't help it if I fall in love with you again
I'm calling just to let you know it dawned on me

Every night is a test
To the east or the west
The sun rises and sets
That's the sun at its best

I forget that I know
I regret letting you go
Sometimes I can't believe how dark it can be

[Hook]
I can't help it if I fall in love with you again
I'm calling just to let you know it dawned on me
So on and so forth
And again I will start to begin at the end

[Hook]
I can't help it if I fall in love with you again
I'm calling just to let you know it dawned on me

[Verse 1]
No, I froze
I can't be so far away from my wasteland
I'll never know when I might ambulance
Or hoist the horns with my own hands
Almost
Almost

[Verse 2]
I heard a faint old age true love
But I had other ways to hurt myself
Like calling I could open up my heart and fall in
And I blame it all on dust, art of almost
Almost
Almost
Almost

[Verse 3]
I hold it up, shake the grail
Dissipate across the waves, tomorrow
I have all the love I could ever ache
And I leave almost with you, art of almost
Almost
Art of almost
Almost
Art of almost
Almost

[Verse 1]
I was always right
About the morning
Okay, I'm an old shoe

Danced above the blaze
Never stopped crawling
Over the black dunes

[Chorus]
And I'm waiting for you
Waiting forever
Are you awake now too?

[Verse 2]
I'm always one
Without a warning
Old days re-appear

Lift away, past the gate
Desert keeps forming
Underneath the black moon

[Chorus]
And I'm waiting for you
Waiting forever
Are you awake now too?

[Verse 1]
I loathe the sun
Sometimes I don't
Know how to love
Anything myself

It's hard to become
Hold on to it all
But I kill my memories
With a cheap disease

[Verse 2]
To the sails, fail
To the bird and the whale
Remove my misery
It's all or nothing I see

I don't wanna lose this fight
I don't wanna end this fight
Goodbye

[Verse 3]
I loathe the sun
Someday I know
I'll learn how to love
Anymore is enough

I don't wanna lose this fight
I don't wanna end this fight
Goodbye

[Verse 1]
Capitol city, skyline photo
Skyscrapers shine, the sun's so
Low in the sky
Secretaries at the hot dog vendors
Cabs honk at the bicycle messengers
Rolling by
I can't call with a subway token
Anyway, the phones are all broken
I wish you were here
Better yet I wish I was there with you

[Hook]
You wouldn't like it here
You should stay right there
Breathing that country air
You wouldn't like it here

[Verse 2]
Capitol towers radiate a steam vent
Scream along with the clarinets and arguments
Echo down the hall
I can't sleep, I can't wake up
Shaking up, maybe we should break up
I wish you were here
Better yet I wish I was there with you

[Hook]
You wouldn't like it here
You should stay right there
Breathing that country air
You wouldn't like it here

[Verse 3]
Capitol city, skyline photo
Picture postcards, sad and lonesome
Low in the sky
I can't smile when my heart's still broken
Far away, in love and unspoken
I wish you were here
Or I was there with you

[Intro]
It's simple, so simple

[Verse 1]
These hands that I pray with for just one more chance
They also took off the dress of that woman
I'm a simple man, got some simple problems
A simple, simple mistake
Simply made it so hard for you to love me

[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

[Interlude]
My mother said "son, don't break her heart
And staying in love won't be so hard, it's simple"

[Verse 2]
These same lips that once said I love you, I do, I do
Admitted, they kiss her over and over and over
Simple man, couple simple problems
One simple, simple mistake
Simply made it hard for you to love me

[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

[Bridge]
I wish I could've simply say I'm sorry, baby ooooh
I wish you'd say you simply can't fall out of love with me
Then maybe we could move one (cause I really can't)
Move on (I gotta)
Get on (I gotta)
Get on with our hearts
With ours lives, cause they're simply too short
Without love

[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

[Intro]
(Aheee, ahee-iya-iya-iya-eee-e)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Worldwide stunner, oh man, I'm a
Reign on the game, make it storm and thunder
Grab an umbrella bitch, and go stand under
And bundle up, it's gonna be a cold ass summer
Uh, you niggas so last summer
On to the new, on-on to the new shit
Jigga wouldn't even take my CD when he seen me
Two years later bitch we made it on, on to the Blueprint
Now how's that for persistence?
Cole World comin', call back up assistance
Same broads used to hang up on my walls
Now they come up out their drawers, how's that for a mistress
Hell bent, heaven sent, Lord I repent if I ever sinned
Now I know I ain't the richest, but I still wanna ball
Put money over bitches, but we still underdogs

[Hook]
Did you miss me? No I don't know where I'm goin'
But I'm goin', now is you comin' with me (With me, with me)?
Up, up and away (And away, and away)
Hey, do you trust me (Trust me, trust me)?
If I was on my last dollar, dead broke, assed out, would you love me (Love me, love me)?
Then it must be (Must be, must be) a match made in heaven (Heaven, heaven)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
God's Gift, (Get up, get up, get up)
God's Gift, (Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
God's Gift, (Get up, get up, get up)
Mothafucker this is God’s gift

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Pussy my passion
Man I just can’t help it I see a cookie, I grab one
Lookin' for some nookie, I’m tryna scoop me a bad one
Every verse I spit it just like it could be my last one
Ever since I got on
I’ve been on a mission to fuck the bitches I missed out on
Ex-cheerleader, hollerin' what’s up
Now her nigga beat her, damn that’s fucked up
What type of little fuck boy hit a
Woman, bet he wouldn’t put his hands on a nigga
Ha, I ain’t bitter boy that’s all you
Ha, plus I just fucked her fore she called you
Ha, dry your eyes baby, I’ll drive you home
Older hoes sayin' "My how you’ve grown"
I came up, fucked the game up
Show my momma I’ll survive on my own

[Hook]
Did you miss me? I don't know where I'm goin'
But I'm goin', now is you comin' with me (With me, with me)?
Up, up and away (And away, and away)
Hey, do you trust me (Trust me, trust me)?
If I was on my last dollar, dead broke, assed out, would you love me (Love me, love me)?
Then it must be (Must be, must be) a match made in heaven (Heaven, heaven)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
God's Gift, (Get up, get up, get up)
God's Gift, (Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
God's Gift, (Get up, get up, get up)
Mothafucker this is God’s gift

[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, oh, baby

I know it's been so long
And girl, I hope you miss me
Cos' you know i've been missing ya baby, missing my baby
Yeah we talk on the phone everyday
But that just don't do it for me
I need you around yeah
I can't do without you
Shawty, my plane just now touched down
I'mma send a car to come get you from your house
So be ready in an hour
Just be ready

[Hook]
We only got one night the suns gon' be setting in a while
(Be ready, be ready)
We still got moonlight I'm down for whatever right now
(Be ready, be ready)
Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
Sweet love we'll be making, oh

(You ready, you ready?)

[Verse 2]
Open up the door
Girl you got me throwed off
Cos' when you came to kiss me yeah
Can you feel my heart beatin', oh
Look into your eyes pretty hazel brown
If you only knew what I'm thinkin' bout
But now you're right here, oh
And now it's so real
Shawty my plane leave at nine A.M tomorrow
But between then and now we can go far
Oh

[Hook]
We only got one night the suns gon' be setting in a while

We still got moonlight I'm down for whatever right now

Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
Sweet love we'll be making, oh

[Bridge]

Oh, I know you've been patient
Been waiting on this moment

We only got one night the suns gon' be setting in a while

Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
Sweet love we'll be making, oh

[Outro]
Hey yo, we got one
Yo, we got one
Yo, we got one
Hey yo
Hey yo, we got one
Yo, we got one
Yo, we got one
Hey yo

[Chorus]
More liquor when we ride
Toast niggas, we alive
Golddiggers look inside, I ain't in the back
Me? I’m in the front seat, driving like I’m 1 deep
If you want to come see, you know where I’m at
Go-getters on tha rise, toast niggas we've arrived
Old niggas step aside, ain't no coming back
Big thangs on my mind, switch lanes and recline
Get brains from a dime, how you love that?

[Verse 1]
Alone in my zone, tell me don’t it sound stunning
Been fucked the world but she just now coming
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground running
I ain't never been the one for fourth down punting
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I’m crown hunting
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks
So I lockpick just to lock shit back
I want "Money, Power, Respect" since The Lox said that
Better stay up on ya toes, this is not tic tac
Yeah, I’m a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here
Balling like a Laker, you should pray for next year
Cause I’m repeating and I’m 3-peating
And I’m knee-deep in the game
It's quick sand and I keep sinking
The label heat seeking, nigga ain't sign me
What the fuck was he thinking?
They say I killed the game, that was only preseason

[Bridge]
I’m heavy
Lil' nigga I’m heavy
I’m so heavy, I’m feeling heavy
Carolina I’m heavy
In New York I’m heavy
Out in LA I’m heavy
I’m so heavy

[Chorus]
More liquor when we ride
Toast niggas, we alive
Golddiggers look inside, I ain't in the back
Me? I’m in the front seat, driving like I’m 1 deep
If you want to come see, you know where I’m at
Go-getters on tha rise, toast niggas we've arrived
Old niggas step aside, ain't no coming back
Big thangs on my mind, switch lanes and recline
Do you love that?

[Verse 2]
No album to my name and I’m already hot
You can say I’m pre-heated
If money talks, mine telling yours be seated
Cut my leg off I wouldn’t be defeated
Illest nigga in tha game bitch and you can retweet it
Email that shit, make sure you CC it
For these fuck niggas who don’t want to believe it
I'll be in the airport damn near barefoot
Security hollering out, Cole we need it
Getting high as fuck and I don't even be weeded
No point drinking I can’t even be faded
Real recognize real like they related
You ain't no fucking G boy, your style G-Rated
Hatred is flattery I’m glad to be hated
Fucking bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just glad that he made it
My money was running late now it’s happy belated

[Outro]
I'm heavy
Nigga I'm heavy
Hey, I'm so heavy, I'm feeling heavy
Lil' nigga, in New York I'm heavy
Queens, I'm feeling heavy
Fayet-nam nigga, I'm so heavy
I'm feeling heavy
Lil' nigga I'm heavy

[Verse 1]
I have heard the war and worry of the gospel
Ferry fast across the void
I have married broken spoke charging smoke wheels
Spit and swallowed opioid

I am the driver at the wheel of the horror
Marching circles at the gate
Mine eyes have seen the fury
So flattered by fate

[Verse 2]
Tonight, I'd rather count the warm fuse internally
Subtract the silence of myself
I would rather choose the middle mind of mystery
Reverse a riddle for my health

I'll unwind strange rinds overpowering
Toss the chimneys in the sea
I believe I've seen
The finger divine extremity

[Verse 3]
Please come closer to the feather smooth lens fly
Sadness is my luxury
Will you weather, join the cold, come before I die
More aware of it than me

The valves are blowing stone
The kids are unabashed
Loneliness postponed
Mine eyes deceiving glory
I was born to die alone
Alone

[Verse 1]
I will throw myself underneath the wheels
Of any train of thought
Running off the rails, I'll sail you through
The rogue waves of your brain

If I could bring a light to shine
Upon the dark and disobeying
Night so young but I still say
We're too old for clichés

[Hook]
Oh, I can only dream of the dreams we'd share
If you were so inclined
I would love to be the one
To open up your mind

[Verse 2]
I could base my whole existence
Upon the cherry-strands of your gold hair
I would ask, almost insist
Upon treating you kind and fair

[Hook]
Oh, I can only dream of the dreams we'd have
If our hearts would be entwined
If you would let me be the one
To open up your mind

[Verse 3]
I'd still be myself beneath the banks
All broken beside the stream
Ready to return your thoughts unlearned
So it goes, so it seems

[Hook]
Oh, I can only dream of the dreams we'd share
If you weren't so defined
I would love to be the one
To open up your mind

[Outro]
If you would let me be the one
To open up your mind

[Chorus]
Is the whole world gunnin for me
Or is it just all in my mind?
If you want it, come and see me
I ain't got nothin but time
One day youre gonna set me free
But first you got to let me shine
Niggas ain't high as I be
See, look mama I’m flying

[Refrain]
To Neverland, Neverland, Neverland
I’ll probably never land
Neverland, Neverland, no, I’ll never ever land

[Verse 1]
Check my fortune cookie, it say Cole World
Could that mean it's meant to be?
So much drive a nigga could've been a chauffeur
This life is fuckin with me mentally
Fake niggas try to act like they're a friend to me
I treat you lames how I see you lames, enemy
My good girl say they want to know the inner me
My bad girl saying "fuck all that, enter me"
Double shots, Hennessy, bring out bad tendencies
Try to cut somethin, need a volunteer, Tennessee
Anything to take my mind off
I logged on and made them motherfuckers sign off
I got them on my dick, they’ll never climb off
I switch watches yet I never took time off
I don’t know what's worse, fake friends or fake fans
Both kissing ass for the chance to shake hands and damn

[Chorus]
Is the whole world gunnin for me
Or is it just all in my mind?
If you want it, come and see me
I ain't got nothin but time
One day youre gonna set me free
But first you got to let me shine
Niggas ain't high as I be
See, look mama I’m flying

[Verse 2]
I’m sortin' through this
Organized confusion to get my thoughts together
This shit is soundin' like a movie you can watch forever
I got to make it to the top, it's either now or never
These other niggas can't adapt because they're not as clever
The shit they talk is more expensive but I doubt it's better
She let that nigga make it rain but guess who got it wetter?
Cole World, snow flurries in the hottest weather
And so sick they can’t fix this with modern medicine
We at your door and she's got to let us in
It’s what you want, I whet your appetite
Cole hit the scene now I’m what everyone rapping like
Shame you feel you have to bite
Still ain't nobody snapping right
Pedal to the metal as I’m speeding through the traffic lights
Bitch I got to catch a flight, come on already
Still fight like I’m the underdog, I’m on already
Got a few niggas we about to prove wrong, y'all already already

[Intro: DJ Drama]
In My Zone, oh, Breezy
And like that, we gone

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Shawty, come here
I wanna grab your body, lay you on the sofa
And as I pull your hair
I'm gonna stroke your body, make you bend over for me
And you've been waitin' patiently for me to break you off
And, girl, your clothes still on, but I'ma rip 'em off
With my teeth, yeah, yeah, yeah
And, girl, I'ma whisper this into your ear
How deep do you want me to go?
Do you want me to speed it up, speed it up, or go slow?
Start from the bed, now we out here on the floor
Girl, you're really in for a treat now, but don't fall in love 'cause

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall]

Lookin' at my baby sleepin' like a baby
Body so amazin', drive me crazy
I'm about to wake you up
Girl, I wanna sex you up
I know how to go about this
'Cause I gotta do somethin'
Kissin' and the touchin'
Ain't no rushin' when it comes to sexin'
Slow and easy does it

Girl, you can thank me in the mornin'
When you wake up feelin' hella good
Feelin' like you want me
I didn't realize how much I made you scream, yeah

When we have sex (Girl, when we have sex)

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
It's gon' be the best
Best you ever had
I can promise that, baby
I lay you on your back
In between your legs
I can make 'em spread, baby (Baby)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall]
We just havin' sex (Yeah)

When we have sex

[Outro]
Gangsta Grillz, bastards

[Intro]
(Roll Sloppy Love Jingle Sequence 1. Action!)

Bartender!
"Yeah I hear your wise ass, give me a minute."
I'm trying to get this round over here
"What do you think I'm just working for you here?"
Actually, will you, will you send a drink, to the lady at the end of the bar? Yeah that one right there
"Here you are miss."
Yeah, yeah. It's on me. Tell her it's from Travie
"It's from this guy over here."

From the second she shimmied in
I was intrigued by her essence
And my first instincts to make sure that my presence was felt
Simple and plain
I'm probably jumping the train
But all I could see was my name engraved on her belt
Hit the pause button
Damn!
I don't even know this girl
And I'm already practicing my sweet-nothings
But that's a classic trait of a soft-spoken, heart-broken, fellow like my self best believe (pussy)
I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve
But that night the Jagermeister had my sleeves rolled up
Wait a minute, hold up
I think she caught me grillin' now I'm spillin' my drink (don't look don't look)
I knew our feelings were in sync so now she gave me the wink
The only problem is, I'm not your ordinary, average Romeo
A Cyrano de Bergerac (shut the fuck up)
In fact, I remember back in fifth grade
I tried to read the book of love, but sadly
The introduction didn't grab me
So I left it on the shelf and kept moving
Assuming that this planet rotates
I'll just procrastinate until the day I bump into my soulmate
Who would've thunk I would be pissy ass drunk when time came for collision
So I made the decision to just keep my composure (cool cool)
Until she started getting closer
And then I felt this weird feeling underneath my left shoulder, and then I
Slipped, tripped, busted my lip and fell in love
The minute that she stepped in the door
The type of girl I'd have to make a couple mix tapes for
To me she equaled MC squared and everything else was mathematics
I never took the time to practice

[Intro: Lauryn Hill]
Refugees up in here
Booga Basement style
On the John Peel show
Giving you a little reggae, a little R&B, a little hip-hop
Stevie Wonder style, you know how we do
Buss it

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
Where has my love gone
How can I go on
Is peace not here for me to see

[Wyclef]
I'll be gone to November
I'll be gone to November

[Lauryn Hill]
Where is my spirit
See I'm nowhere near it
It seems dear love has gone away

[Hook]
So I blame it on the sun
The sun that didn't shine
I blame it on the wind and the trees
I blame it on the nights I never was in love
I blame it on the times that could not be
But my heart blames it on me

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
Yeah I'mma tell you a little story Pras
It went like this, bust it
You see I loved hard once
But the love wasn't returned
I found out the man I'd die for
He wasn't even concerned
In time he turned he tried to burn me like a perm
Though my eyes saw the deception my heart wouldn't let me learn from, umm
Some dumb woman was I
And every time he'd lie, he would cry and inside I'd die
My heart must've died a thousand deaths
Compared myself to Toni Braxton
Thought I'd never catch my breath
Nothing left
He stole the heart beating from my chest
I tried to call the cops
That type of thief they can't arrest
Pain suppressed
Will lead to cardiac arrest
Diamonds deserved
Diamonds but he convinced me I was worthless
Bust it

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
Wish I could tell you what I am feeling
But words won't come for me to see
What I want to know is
Who poured the love out
What made this bitter doubt
Is peace not here for me to see

[Refrain]
So I blame it on the sun
The sun that didn't shine
I blame it on the wind and the trees
I blame it on the days that ended once too soon
I blame it on the nights that could not be
But my heart blames it on me
Bust it
But my heart blames it on me
But my heart blames it on me
Blames it on me, on me, on me
Who poured the love out
What made this bitter doubt
Who poured the love out

Yo yo see cool it down, MC's should slow it down
Ohh, watch out
Before they lose control
Yo yo see cool it down, mc's should slow it down
Ohh, watch out
Fugees is on a roll
We just looking for the love today
Where's the love at
All the peace mc's settle the violence
Play more music, make more phat beats
Leave all the violence some place else

Where is the love
Say where is the love
Where is the love
Where is the love
Where is the love

Walked up to him put the pistol to his tank
Pussy nigga faint
Pick that pussy up
Naw let him lay
Where I'm from we see a fuckin dead body everyday 

[x3]

Hammer in the draws
Hammer in drawers
And ya'll ain't nothin but nails in the wall
Posters, holsters
Empty like a muthafucka
Off my hip, clip empty like a muthfucka
Hehe, ok simply I'm a bug- lover
It's fly carter, duckin the fly swatter
Simply, I'm a muhfucka
Pimpin' ain't dead, because I'm pimpin like a muhfucka
Now where ya ho at?
Wipe ya feet on the door mat
I'm a bring in, no back
Like em to go with no back
I'm a-go forward, the top can get lower, them hoes 'gon get cut
Like a sword, I know it
You ain't gotta tell me
I already smell it
You pussy niggas eatin' peanut butter and jellys
Ya los' like angeles
But you can find me in the white tan Ellis
Just like Van Halen
I'm a rock out bitch
I'm a wear that Glock like a fucking outfit
I don't care what you know
You ain't no nothin' 'bout this
And I hope your ass choke when you suck my dick

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
Ok, I’m strapped up
Im strapped up, downtown many acts straight jackets ain’t strapped up
And scrappin we could do, see scrappin what we do
And I’m like let me at em! Call me Scrappy Doo
Hazardous to scrap with you I ain't lookin stupid
You beat me? Too bad, bitch, I’m comin back shootin!
Fool I’m a fool, I do what I do
It’s like fixing broke cars, which tools i'mma use?
Tha Tech or the Uz, the Mac or the Rug
Catch you when it’s just you, You’re like “it wasn’t just you!”
I guess i’m just to real for niggas to adjust to
Fuck me? Naw bend over nigga, fuck you
See I know what’s what, who’s who, and who is you
Move you lose you move an inch and more ligaments that you could lose
I’ll put you on the 10 O'clock news
One, two, buckle ya shoes
Here come the Kid who
Ooo gloves Uz will fill up your old wounds
Dudes using more tools than Tim from Home Improve
Then I play it cool, smooth as James Brown shoes
Don’t play with him cuz shoot he’ll shoot
I’m loose as a goose on that goose with them hoes
I’m playin duck duck goose, boy I’m slick like mouse
I’m tha truth not a fluke I’m a murderer, Fuck you!
Put niggas on mute like

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Aight, John Record, Easy Mac
Ill Spoken collectin' lines
Yeah, ha

[Pre-Chorus: John Record & Mac Miller]
(Yeah) When we reminisce
(Yeah) When we reminisce
(Yeah) When we reminisce

[Chorus: John Record & Mac Miller]
Let the smoke signal guide you back home like Indians
And lend a spliff, and bullshit with my kinsmen
The Yuengling coolin' me down from the heat on the streets (Yeah)
Take me back to those times of peace
Let me see those leaves turn at Frick, and kick flows, that's sick
And think back to chicks who loved my magic stick

[Verse 1: John Record]
When you look back, Malcolm (What's good?)
Never forget, never regret the outcome
Never tear or spend a year askin', "How come?"
Lookin' for love, 'cause you found some
Never let a dime infiltrate your mind
She has no right questionin' McCormick design
Never quest for beef, always be cordial in rhymes
Never bored with your time on this planet Earth
Take a nap, take a snap, but when you take it for granted, it hurts
Try to be thrifty, so you manage your worth
Expect the best but plan for the worst
Never take advice from those who never question themselves
But your mental health should never be menaced by doubt
MM, I'm your MC Mentor
There for sure when things go south
I'm out, en route to beat back the nookie (Ha)
She says she loves me, what she want, half a cookie?
Never contemplate life when you're higher than giraffe pussy

[Verse 2: Mac Miller & John Record]
Met Rec, the rest is history (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause him and me, well, we hit the weed in-between the misery
We spit for free, we had dreams of gettin' cream
But things don't always go exactly how they seem
The big kids, they talkin' 'bout they big guns
But I just chill, lay back, hear the kick drum
Boom kak, boom-ba-boom kak
Around and back, now I'm gettin' off track
And I saw rap as a way to get away
From everybody tellin' me today is not my day
My day, my week, my month, my year, my tears
Held back, confronted by my fears
This endless intelligence, my mind can expand
As high as I am, chill, I'll be fine with a gram (Ha)
'Cause I'll be bumpin' through the speaker box, tryna bust a flow
At first an outcast lookin' for the love below
But don't mistake my terminology for philosophy
Screamin' 'til I get what I want, like a toddler be
Urban mythology, the words of the prophecy
The prodigy, see deep inside your mind like psychology
Taught to be verbal, passin' purple in the circle like we pass a word
Savor the mind but you 

[?]
Attack 

[?] happens fast and your ass'll swerve
Got a question, ask it first
Pass the purp and mash the verse

[Chorus: John Record & Mac Miller]
(Yeah)
(Yeah, Easy Mac, John Record)
Let the smoke signal guide you back home like Indians (Yeah)
And lend a spliff, and bullshit with my kinsmen
The Yuengling coolin' me down from the heat on the streets
Take me back to those times of peace (Where you wanna go?)
Let me see those leaves turn at Frick, and kick flows, that's sick
And think back to chicks who loved my magic stick
(Yeah, Easy Mac, John Record)
Let the smoke signal guide you back home like Indians
And lend a spliff, and bullshit with my kinsmen
The Yuengling coolin' me down from the heat on the streets
Take me back to those times of peace
Let me see those leaves turn at Frick, and kick flows, that's sick
And think back to chicks who loved my magic stick

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, Pittsburgh
I like that

[?]
Ha, yeah

[Intro]
One, two, three, four
Hey, hey (Forever)
Hey, hey (Forever)

[Verse 1]
It's you and me, moving at the speed of light into eternity, yeah
Tonight is the night to join me in the middle of ecstasy
Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music
Around you, around you (Oh-oh)
I'ma take you there, I'ma take you there (Oh)
So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby
We can go anywhere, go anywhere (Yeah)
But first, it's your chance, take my hand, come with me

[Chorus]
It's like I've waited my whole life (Oh) for this one night (Oh)
It's gon' be me, you and the dance floor
'Cause we only got one night (Oh, oh)
Double your pleasure, double your fun
And dance fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Fore-e-ever, forever
Fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Forever on the dance floor

[Verse 2]
Feels like we're on another level, oh
Feels like our love's intertwined
We can be two rebels
Breaking the rules, me and you, you and I
All you gotta do is watch me (Watch me)
Look what I can do with my feet (My feet)
Baby, feel the beat inside
I'm driving, you can take the front seat (Front seat)
I just need you to trust me (Trust me)
Oh (Girl), oh (Girl), oh (Girl)
It's like I've—

[Chorus]
It's like I've waited my whole life (Oh) for this one night (One night, oh)
It's gon' be me, you and the dance floor (Dance floor)
'Cause we only got one night (Oh, oh, one night)
Double your pleasure, double your fun (Yeah)
And dance fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Fore-e-ever, forever
Fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Forever on the dance floor

[Bridge]
It's a long way down, we so high off the ground
Sending for an angel to bring me your heart
Girl, where did you come from? Got me so undone
Gaze in your eyes, got me saying, "What a beautiful lady"
No ifs, ands or maybes
I'm releasing my heart and it's feeling amazing
There's no one else that matters, you love me
And I won't let you fall, girl (Fall, girl), let you fall, girl, oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
I won't let you fall, let you fall, let you fall, oh, oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
It's like—
It's like I've waited my whole life (Oh, whole life) for this one night (One night, oh)
It's gon' be me, you and the dance floor (Me, you and the dance floor)
'Cause we only got one night (Oh, oh)
Double your pleasure, double your fun
And dance fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Fore-e-ever, forever
Fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Forever on the dance floor

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Forever, ever, ever, ever
Forever, ever, ever

[Intro: Tyler]
Hey guys (Golf Wang!)
I'm Peter Rosenberg, super-underground
You know me, uh, you see my laptop, yeah, I mean
Apple is pretty mainstream but I have underground stickers
So it levels out..

[Verse 1: Domo]
Y'all niggas got it twisted, we ain't the Misfits
We the sick shit, make the competition slit wrists
Bodybag, beats get rapped like it's Christmas
Popping tags, I stay in Dior cause I'm Christian
Nigga listen: I been killing shit since I was the
Age of the face that R. Kelly pissed in
In the booth, I'm brawling to be like the Pistons
Only smoke flight, you can't hit if you ain't pitched in!
And bitch stop talking, let the marijuana sink in
And when that chauffeur roll up, you better get in
You and your 6 friends, even your big friend
Got a gang of wolves that slay hoes like henchmen
O.F. kill someone, yeah nigga we shipped it
Local ass nigga, we overseas on you dipshits
Walking flex tweet, motherfucker take a Twitpic
Kidnapped the game and it won't quit bitching

[Verse 2: Tyler]
Duct tape, bow knife, now I’m breaking in homes
And now I’m in the closet with Kelly, we’re watching The Throne
And 'till I get that mothafucka I'll be watching ya home
And gonna tryna go harder than me hiding a boner
With lights on it, see I was the loner
Now I got a bunch of fucking Lindsay Lohans
That don’t even know me, tryna get me that old hand
Job, fuck that ho blow me
The G.I. Joe of O.F. is slowly
Solely running shit his toes is swollen
Goblin left the bridge, no more patrolling
Stick my finger in any hole I can find, fuck bowling
I’m making that bread, jabronni, and the green shit that’s growing is stuck
My Bank account is molding
Me and Wanda Sykes was holding hands 'till I eat her cooter
Like a fresh bowl of Ravioli, Chef Boyar-T
On tour, had to make a couple pit stops
Ended at this fucking hipster club called the Pin Drop
Where they said they hated on me and Odd Future kids
And how much they really love underground hip-hop
We don’t give a fuck like a virginized dick cock
After being tickled by a couple Eddie Bishops
Young niggas OF, got this
Come to my show and see niggers in the moshpit
Cat on my cotton, zebra print 5 panel from Jebbia
Now I’m flyer than an ostrich
VMA nom, yes! Video my set
Harder than Nakel not nolling a nine set
Thrasher, billboard, cover of them issues
Boy flow colder than O'Shay stuck in an igloo
I'mma fuck the game till my herpes-covered dick's bruised
As my mind drift and then split
Like the middle of a spliff, I begin to catapult off
The cliff of the unknown
I got a feeling in my funny bone that we're not the same
Just antonyms of another age
My soul flock with the carefree
Words of the wise, I spoke a hundred times like a gold D
Haha LMFAO
I hate y'all but I spread love like mayo
Then spread slugs
My brain matter is a brain phantom
See my vision, or my vision'll stare at ya
This is the future if I say so, you copping fitted caps
I'm about to go and cop a halo
The God of rap and I mean it, and I play football with Mars
And marbles with Pluto and Venus
Witness the genius, I interact with the inner city villains
That enters your system like a computer hack
Then give you dap

[Intro]
Who dat who dat?

[Verse 1: SD]
Back up on my 1, 2, 3 metaphors
I'm rhyming with CD, you would think I'm in stores
And y'all know me, I'm D-O-P-E
Screaming skins all day, no MTV
I see a girl giving out blows like a prize fighter
I'm on top of the words: call me a highlighter
Oral sex in the morning: that's a head start
Words like bullets, yeah I'm shopping at a Lead Mart
State of the Tar Heel, fuck how y'all feel
Young but I'm good, I got that fuckin John Wall feel
While y'all pissed off, I sit and sip Cristal
Hornet's nest flow, I assist like Chris Paul
Flow like a quick river, lines like a stick figure
So many drinks, I'll probably borrow someone else's liver
And I'm warming up just like a fireplace
I know I'm an acquired taste, go ahead and try to hate
But I'm just a brainiac who don't know where his brain be at
I'm smoking Huckleberry so I guess I'm Mark Twaining that
They told me I was insane, in fact
I'm tryna get my train on track
So you should probably counteract
The fact that you attacked the Datt

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Who dat who dat? You know what you been waiting for
I mean, the game was all bad just a week ago
Rappers was bullshit - listen, I ain't hatin', no
Now a brother, hot enough to fuck with one of satan's hoes
And she can't tell the difference, I been through hell conditions
Wishing for air conditioning
Feeling god would never listen
Now I'm on television, and did I fail to mention
Your bitch is tired of missionary, boy you failed the mission
Man, just look at how I elevated
Real niggas celebrate it, finger fuck whoever hate it
My life accelerated, but had to wait my turn
Then I redecorated; that means my tables turned
Live life, might as well, only way to learn
Just try and fail, clientele the only way to earn
So if you're selling crack or if you're selling rap
Make sure it's mean so the fiends keep on yelling back

[Chorus: J. Cole & Childish Gambino]
Who dat, who dat? Bitch, I got that- hey (Yeah)
Who dat, who dat? Bitch, I got that- hey (Whoa)
(Sup, Spence) Got that flame
So don't worry 'bout my motherfuckin' name, Spence

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
I won't steal your girl? Test me
I stay Childish, watch me breast-feed
Grandfather ran numbers a criminal in Harlem
The only thing he used to make was trouble and my father
Father had me, said "Stay away from cocaine!"
Blood stained gangster, my swag screams dope game
I talk real nigga, this is what you ask for
I shit green like vegetarian assholes
Louder than Wayne's pants at the VMA's
"Stick to what you good at nigga" Oh, everything?
Niggas want me everywhere, I'm yelling out, "Sorry!"
There's only one of me like white girls with black Barbies
Niggas mad that I ain't do shit too
I got a fly Asian bitch, that's a Shih Tzu
Throwing out your jazz man, but you don't look like Uncle Phil
Fucking girls from TV shows, my DVR is on the pill
Shake it on YouTube, yeah that's a VEVO ho
Black guy wit' a white voice, Cleveland Show
I don't know, all I wanted was different things
Hope these hood niggas don't blow me off when they're listening
All I do is wear what white guys wore in the '50's
And for some reason these white people think that it's interesting
Too many girls, that's still not enough for me
I love pussy like that old lady up the street
Everything I spit is compilated and best of
Black nerds run shit, go and ask Questlove
I'ma hit it twice, retail
I got a package like a gangsta, G-mail
Google and a penis reference, same sentence, goody-goody
I love my dick so much they let a nigga host the Woodies
Got a whole barbershop like, "Oh man, this shit is tight"
Solid shit, one wipe

[Chorus: J. Cole & Spencer Datt]
Who dat, who dat? Bitch, I got that- hey
Who dat, who dat? Bitch, I got that- hey
Cole World got that flame
So don't worry 'bout my motherfuckin' name, Spence
They sayin', "Who that? Who that?"

[Outro: J. Cole]
Cole World, nigga
Uh, SD, nigga
SD, boy
Yo, this is J. Cole, Cole World. Spencer Datt, who that? Who that?
Rest in piece, brother. Big shouts. Cole World

[Hook:]
I'm in the air
All I want is the money and I see it so clear
Weed in my grinder
Mind on a million
Taylor Gang on The Planes
You know we over the building
If they ask me how fly
I'mma tell ya
If you recognize game I should be looking familiar
If they ask me how fly
I'mma tell ya
If you reconize a g I should be lookin familiar

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Party and chillin and fast livin how im suppose too
Not the choices given I chose too
Leave the club with a couple of hoes who
Love to smoke trees
Rolling in e-z wider papers
Maintain a low speed
Now should I proceed
Come from a city where niggas ain't got a lot
But got it locked
So I be low key
Money hoes clothes is all a nigga knows
Don't bring a nug
I blow it by the O
I hit the road
Cause shit is exactly how it seems
While cats been sleeping on me I been livin out my dream
The marijuana is loud but my sorroundings are serene
I'm laughin and smoking hoping my camera catch the scene
Fresh up out the plane
Flick another paper
Shorty wanna ride with me
As bad as I wanna taker her
Put you in demand
Bitches taking flicks with the planes
And send them to their friends
Weed to grind mind on a million
And we over the building

[Hook:]
I'm in the air
All I want is the money and I see it so clear
Weed in my grinder
Mind on a million
Taylor Gang on The Planes
You know we over the building
If they ask me how fly
I'mma tell ya
If you recognize game I should be looking familiar
If they ask me how fly
I'mma tell ya
If you reconize a g I should be lookin familiar

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
And I'm livin like a balla loc
I'm having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
Did we just become best friends with these hoes on a boat
Well probably so
But we don't love them no
Only can cake causes my heart to palpitate
Darling
Clean that money
Keep this dirty ball revolving
No pausing
I get too high to have downtime
No matter what your watch say nigga it's my time
I hear them critics right now
"All them fools make is weed songs" blah blah blah
You sound like a sucka
Tune ya out
As I'm tuning up my chevelle
This weekend I'mma pull it out
Lay some rubber down slanging rocks everywhere
People mad as a mothafucka
But he jet connected so they know they can't touch em
Airborn from here on been sworn in
Fat pockets cause I took chance even when they were slim

[Hook:]
I'm in the air
All I want is the money and I see it so clear
Weed in my grinder
Mind on a million
Taylor Gang on The Planes
You know we over the building
If they ask me how fly
I'mma tell ya
If you recognize game I should be looking familiar
If they ask me how fly
I'mma tell ya
If you reconize a g I should be lookin familiar
Mr. Rosenberg presents
I got the fresh baked clam
Rockfeller Center, keep it to myself
I ain't trying to be a Yenta
Sour raviolli herb oil the inventor
? hit recline on the Sentra
Long road traveled all alone
Crying on the phone when they said that you were gone
Couldn't utter, but I heard it in your tone
Well now you know I got to get the chrome
We spent the mortgage at the steak house wyling with the creeps
Way before this rap shit, driving in a jeep
Forest green Cherokee, bad bitch and she ebony
Problem is she's smoking all the celery
ZZ Top beard like a lion
Leonidas body, smoke until the cows come
? sandwich, mustard with the cow's tongue
Dr. Brown, net worth about a thousand
You know the blunt like a Barry Bond bag
Smoking bombazzy, fuck ya Sean John hat
Baking out the car, ? contact
The red sen sunset long short hat
We queens bread like a baker in the morning
We getting money while you snoring
About to start the touring
I'll leave an orphan out in Florence
Elephantitis in my pockets, shit's enormous

[Verse 1: Akon]
If your eyes could speak, they would tell me
What you see when you lookin' at me
And if your hands can talk, they would tell me
What you feel when you touchin' on me
And if your feet can see, they would show me
How far you've gone just to kick it with me
And these are tall tell signs that shows that you are mine
It's how your body translates to me

[Hook: Akon]
I wanna be the one that you can rely on
I wanna be the one that you can rely on
And give you everything, give you everything
You need to set you free
And give you everything, give you everything
You need to set you free

[Verse 2: Akon]
Cause if you didn't want me, you would tell me
Face to face that I'm not just your type
And if you didn't love me, you would tell me
To pack my bags and get out of your life
But instead she told me, not to worry
I'm the one man worth her sacrifice
And these are tall tell signs that shows that you are mine
It's how your body translates to me

[Hook: Akon]
I wanna be the one that you can rely on(can rely on me girl)
I wanna be the one that you can rely on(you can rely on me girl)
And give you everything, give you everything
You need to set you free
And give you everything, give you everything
You need to set you free

[Verse 3: Akon]
Cause I wanna be there, when you lonely and stressed
Wanna be there, when your car goes bad
Wanna be there, just to show you I care for you
You know I care for you
Cause I wanna be there, when you lonely and stressed
Wanna be there, when your car goes bad
Wanna be there, just to show you I care for you

[Hook: Akon]
I wanna be the one that you can rely on(rely on me babe)
I wanna be the one that you can rely on(you can rely on me babe)
And give you everything, give you everything
You need to set you free
And give you everything, give you everything
You need to set you free

[Intro]
She's gone again
She's gone again, no no

[Verse 1]
Every time she leaves, it's my heart that she taking from me, oh
And I don't know if she's gone for good or returning in the morning, oh
And I wait through the night 'cause I can't help the tossing and turning
I want you to know that our bed, our sheets, our pillows getting lonely, on

[Chorus]
Yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side, yo side
It's lonely on yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side
It's not the same without you here on yo side of the bed
All night I hold your pillow
It's lonely on yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side
It's so lonely there
And I don't wanna sleep if you ain't here, no

[Verse 2]
I just wanna breathe your air, watch you when you wrapping up your hair
Gazing at the mirrors up there, I'm reaching while imagining that you're there
I wait through the night girl, tossing and turning and tossing and turning, oh
Our bed, our sheets, our pillows getting lonely on

[Chorus]
Yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side, yo side
It's lonely on yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side
It's not the same without you here on yo side of the bed
All night I hold your pillow
It's lonely on yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side
It's so lonely there
And I don't wanna sleep if you ain't here

[Bridge]
Play on, that's what you gotta do sometimes
Let it play baby
Uh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
So lonely there

[Chorus]
On yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side, yo side
It's so lonely baby, on yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side
When you come home, girl, you should know your pillow's waiting girl
On yo side of the bed
On yo side
'Cause this bed ain't the same without the love that we made
And the sound of the springs, no
And I don't wanna sleep if you ain't here

[Outro]
Sleep, she's coming back
Sleep, she's coming back

Jumping off the roof, god damn, where's my parachute?
Pretty boy goons, all we know is money and the loot

Fuck the F.B.I. and fuck all the Army troops

And my hand gripping wood behind the 2012 van
Man I pulled up in the truck, and my goons duffled up
Got the bricks and the kush and the loud pack, what?
Man you know what's going down when I pull up in the drop
And everybody on me 'cause the album just dropped
Man the Juice mixtape got the hood on fire

And I'm posted in the back of the coupé, I'm on fire
If a nigga think he got me, he's a goddamn liar
And I'm posted on the wall like a goddamn fly
I'm a young pretty goon, you can see it in my eye

[Verse 2]

Walking like a walking lick, talking like a chicken coupé
Running 'round the city and my goons are on the fucking loose

God damn I'm on fire, pull up in the Benz
And I shitted on the world in the year 2010 woo!
The most songs in the rap game nigga!

[Verse 1]
See a nigga well known for switching states
Macking broads, getting cake
Glock and mad, cock and blast
Thrown a bitch nigga for a quick escape
I move with dudes that be dishing weight
Smooth with the uz that will hit your face
Came in the game and I'm changing the game
With a flow that will run around the crews that hate
This guy is a pimp and you know his fam
I don't hold the grams, I'm a colder man
And I do it for the youngers and the older fans
Niggas whippin in the kitchen just to hold their grams
I don't play around, lay em down
For the lil' homie wanna' play the clown
I'm casing pounds, spraying rounds
Follow the leader cause it's going down
Money in the rubber band slangin' crack rock
Try and find the man in the flat top
Ask anyone in the streets
Everyone around knows Wiz a beast
And I'm killing the beef you can chill in the team
Pull the steel and release, I’m up in your brain
You bet on me taking the loss, you better be upping your change
See this guy here is a nuisance, you talk fire and you can't prove it
You just lie up in your music, send my guys to come and shoot shit
Duke I ride and this is true as you would die if niggas pulling
I don't know what you fucking see
When you know as well you've been fucking me

[Hook]
I'm on the move so if you get in my way then
I'ma ride ride till I die and it should be no suprise
We paper chasing man, messing with my cake or fam
Imm ride ride till they die fuck us try
I'm gonna ride for me ride for me
Die for me die for me
Bust your 45 for me, face the judge and lie for me
Ride for me ride for me
Die for me die for me
Bust your 45 for me, face the judge and lie for me

[Verse 2]
P. I. T. T. S. B. U. R. G. H. represent to the fullest
And I'm putting cowards back into place when I'm rapping the taste
Yeah crack in the place, laugh in your face
Lay up and chill after you safe that's a mistake
Cause I'm moving with a gang of ill guys looking like
The last of the day but why you say
Cause my nigga I could die today lock down
And never see the light of day
Kidnapped trapped in a hide away
So I never get the cat to ride away fire inside of
May the kid move with da fools that try to take
The game back to the rhyming days payback
For the fact that your guys a fake and I can't even believe
You can spit shit to the people like it
Chips and just leaves you with kids, that leaves
You see through you pricks, hand my shit an overdose
So you wrote and sold some coke, move some crack
How true is that. Front on my cats and you'll lose shit back
Haters get stacks when I'm through with rap
And I'm filling my tracks with truth and fact
Kill em on wax and I'm moving cats
When they crew in all black yeah I'm doing that
I gotta flavor that will flow and taste
And I'm doing it till I'm blue in the face
I'm thinking bigger then any nigga that think
He cool in the place which gives me reason
To but a tool to his waist

[Hook]
I'm on the move so if you get in my way then
I'm a ride ride till I die and it should be no suprise
We paper chasing man, messing with my cake or fam
Imm ride ride till they die fuck us try

Die for me die for me
Bust your 45 for me, face the judge and lie for me
Ride for me ride for me
Die for me die for me
Bust your 45 for me, face the judge and lie for me

[Verse]
So high, what's beneath me, I can't even call it, high
Like ticket holders when the season started
It ain't much to say when actions speak for themselves
So just the fact that I'm in this motherfucker means I'm balling
So next time you take shots keep an extra cartridge
Niggas handcuffing hoes like the police department
You think you flying but you really falling
You just ain't hit the concrete yet nigga, you're stalling
They say pop means being popular to the population
So excuse me for being the topic of your conversation
I just keep banging verses and rocking your mama's braces
What you blaze in a week, Psh that's what I start my day with
My checks worth more than your net worth
I got a network about the size of the next earth
I'm laid up, so much head that my neck hurt
I'm living a dream, I never once went to bed first you dig
So what should I do with so much hate?
Fuck it, I turn crabs in the bucket to a buffet
And beef to a filet that's a full-course entrée
And girl I turn that avocado to some guacomole
So Spanish girls Ole, we can skip the foreplay
Roll up some good haze and stay high for 4 days
We can do it 4 ways, left right, up down
My cup runneth over but I won't put my cup down
You haters cheer leading while I'm out here running touch downs
But I won't be ran down, I run shit, you run down
Frantic blowing whistles like "Please get sun down"
Meanwhile I'm globetrotting from sun up to sun down
But still I'm straight, penthouse took all kinds of space
No time to play 'cause I know they don't want me on top: Anchovies
But still I'm blaze, so many trees don't need no shade
Living that stamp life, I think my passport need more space

[Outro]
Haha, it's B-o-B-o bitch!
So don't, don't get mad when your girl come up to me in public like...
Just keep it movin' brah
All you hater, I don't even wanna hear no
I don't even know why I gotta smoke for man
It's like I just can't even get (high), not even a little bit, (high) at all!
But still man, you know how I do it
Grand hustle in the building
Tip coming home soon so you know it's a problem!
I'm gone... I'm finna go get (high)
You speakin my language

Verse 1

If you decided that you should go....
Chorus
You speakin my language

[Chorus: Lily Allen & T-Pain]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there (Ugh)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (Ugh)
And I pretended I was sleeping (Ugh)
And I was hoping you would— (Ayy)

[Verse 1: T-Pain, Lily Allen, & Both]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it, 'cause you've been waiting on me
Since I said that I was hitting in the club
The Sun be coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause you be sending me texts-es
Like, "Boy, just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love"
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come on time, she—
Might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (Ah-ah-ah)
And then ask me kindly— (Ah-ah-ah)
Do I want her to go crazy? We do this every night
And then, we always wake up singing the same song

[Chorus: Lily Allen & T-Pain, Both]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning (Yeah)
Conversation got boring (Talk to me, girl)
You said you'd go in to bed soon (Let's go)
So I snuck off to your bedroom (Come on)
And I thought I'd just wait there (Wait on me)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (I won't let you stay lonely)
And I pretended I was sleeping (All right)
And I was hoping you would creep in (Goodnight)
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
The conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping (Oh, oh-oh)
And I was hoping you would creep in

[Verse 2: T Pain & Lily Allen]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and you calling
And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head, like
"What is he doing?" (Oh) "What is he doing?"
'Cause I keep checking my cell phone and these missed calls
And you texting me, like, "I'ma kill y'all
If you don't get your ass up out of that club
And do you know what time it is?"
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) Ooh (Ooh)
Well, my bad, girl
And this Nuvo got me tripping, and I know that you mad, girl
But you ain't got to worry about nothing (Worry 'bout nothing)
Girl, I got you (I got you), girl I got you
She might come and find me-ee (Nah-nah-nah)
And then ask me kindly-y (Oh, no, no)
Do I want her to go crazy? (Crazy) We do this every night
And then, we always wake up singing the same song

[Chorus: Lily Allen, T-Pain, & Both]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning (Yeah)
Conversation got boring (Talk to me, girl)
You said you'd go in to bed soon (Let's go)
So I snuck off to your bedroom (Come on)
And I thought I'd just wait there (Ooh, wait on me)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (I won't let you stay lonely)
And I pretended I was sleeping (All right)
And I was hoping you would creep in (Baby girl, goodnight)
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
The conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping (Oh, oh-oh)
And I was hoping you would creep in

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa, Lily Allen, & T-Pain]
Oh-oh, and you ain't got nothing on
But the T-shirt that I left over your house the last time I came and put it on ya
Too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to leave here with one of them—that's why I call her
And you'll be right at home, waiting for me
IPhone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at 6, left around 4:30
Yeah, so by the time I'm at your crib—
(It’s 5 o' clock in the morning) And you yawning
But I’ve been drinking all night, and I feel like performing
With you in the bedroom, floor to the dresser
Dont want nothing less 'cause I’m sure you’re the best, you’re the one
So I let you—that's how you show me love
And when we finished, you like, “Damn, babe, you woke me up” (Whoa, oh)
I like you way you put it down, like it's for both of us (Oh, oh)
The sun ain't the only thing that's coming up (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus: T-Pain & Lily Allen; Wiz Khalifa]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning (Hahahahaha)
The conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in
It's 5 o' clock in the morning

[Verse 1]
You a-go tired fe see me face
Can't get me out of the race
Oh, man, you said I'm in your place
And then you draw bad card
A-make you draw bad card
And then you draw bad card

Propaganda spreading over my name
Say you want to bring another life to shame
Oh, man, you just a-playing a game
And then you draw bad card (draw bad card)
A-make you draw bad card (draw bad card)
A-make you draw bad card

[Chorus]
I want to disturb my neighbor
Because I'm feeling so right!
I want to turn up my disco
Blow them to full watts tonight, eh!
In a rub-a-dub style, in a rub-a-dub style
In a rub-a-dub style, in a rub-a-dub style

[Bridge]
Because we guarding the palace so majestic
Guarding the palace so realistic!

[Verse 2]
Them a-go tired to see we face (oh yeah!)
Me say them can't get we out of the race
Oh, man, it's just a big disgrace
The way you draw bad card (draw bad card)
The way you make wrong moves (make wrong moves)
The way you draw bad card (draw bad card)
A-make you draw bad card (draw bad card)
A-make you draw bad card
In a rub-a-dub style, rub-a-dub style
In a rub-a-dub style

[Chorus]
In this life, in this life, in this life

[Verse 1]
It's you, it's you, it's you I'm talking to
Well, you (it's you), you (it's you), you I'm talking to now

[Verse 1]
I catch z's at work now
So they're gonna fire me soon
But I've been dreamin' of our love
I wish my new day job was you

[Pre-Chorus]
But they say my checks come from the bank
And not your heart (not your heart)
And not your heart
They tell me think with my brain like I'm sane
And not my heart
And not my heart

[Chorus]
But if my job was only to love you, yeah
There wouldn't be no recession
Be no recession, ain't no depression, depression
If my job was only to love you, girl
There wouldn't be no stressin'
Be no stressin', ain't no pressure
'Cause it pays way better babe
It pays way better baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
My boss works my nerves, girl
If you knew him you'd wanna quit too
I just know he's jealous
Cause he's lonely and I've got you
(But what I'mma do)

[Pre-Chorus]
But they say my checks come from the bank
And not your heart (not your heart)
And not your heart
They tell me think with my brain like I'm sane
And not my heart
And not my heart

[Chorus]
But if my job was only to love you, yeah
There wouldn't be no recession
Be no recession, ain't no depression, depression
If my job was only to love you, girl
There wouldn't be no stressin'
Be no stressin', ain't no pressure
Cause it pays way better babe
It pays way better baby, yeah

[Outro]
If I left this place today with the love that we made
I'd be paid for the rest of my life, rest of my life
I love you the rest of my life, oh
Be paid for the rest of my life
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
It’s not about lyrics anymore, it’s about a hot beat and a catchy hook

[Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and ABC it
Then so be it
Cause nowadays these kids, jeez
Don’t give a shit bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and thats it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ’s playing them hits
Oh this my jam, this my shit
We dont know a word to a verse
All we know is the chorus
Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the songs ginormous, the whole formula’s switched
Cause we don’t know anymore, what are hits
Is it the beat, is it the rap
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When 13 year olds control the remote
And Ashley’s got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-phasis on our syllables

[Jay-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc isn’t the beat
Than I’m gon feature EM and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Rove
Cause everywhere I go they love the bling bling flow
Bang bang look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing’ cost ya man lot of dough, oh
The fuck am I busting my brain for?
Its just the way the game go, oh, it takes two to tango
You call this a lame flow
You bought the shit
I guess you to blame too
I just found the angle
No more reality flow
I’m tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
Cock the Mac 11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist tell her “we in press heaven”
No one gives a shit except some kids who just got into sex on the internet
So you want the chat room or the house of Malibu Em?
Your emphasis is on the wrong Syllable

[Dr Dre]
They said 30′s the new 20
Funny, must mean 40′s the new 30
Interesting cause ever since then it’s been in a sense
An extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
Of the shit coming out right now
Its all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it’s his last and 50 and Em
Then what? Detox drops what we got then
So now our whole camps is running around scrambling over what to do
Gambling everytime we put a record out
Just looking for that hook

[Eminem]
(Wait Dre look)
Shorty I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be cause shorty
You love me
And I love you too
And I promise I’ll be true to you

[50 Cent]
Go shorty, its your birthday
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
Its the kid that flip flows who used to flip O’s
And run G for days used to see how I get hoes
I’m international, I get my dick licked round the globe
I’m sick right into show, riding on lolo’s
Puffing on coco, my bitch in Manolo’s
Don’t fuck with the dodo’s, I sling for dumb hoes
I playing, I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked
Look, its not a game, me B, I ain't playing
Beep behind me player, so you here anyway
You don’t hear what I’m saying
Me fin-nini-na
Fee-fi-dididee-yay
Just give me my check and I’ll be on my way
Sunny bunny money and funny
You ain't even listening and I just took your money

[GR Lynch]
This ain't top 40 or hit list shit
Not for TRL, no Rick Dees' picks
This is straight GRL ski mix bitch
Call me Strasburg when I pitch this shit
I leave these other rappers so tongue-tied
They just local, GR's worldwide
You sound like cabbage, ya wilted outside
I spit tomatoes straight from the vine
Leave these other artists lookin all sundried
A bunch of little stains, to them I'm Tide
Keep a stain stick in my Subaru ride
Glass all black can't see us igniting
Paint white out like you fucked up writing
Mount baker bout to get a boost in style
In the parking lot they can't help but smile
Ma'am please cover the eyes of your child
Gunz come out you know bumpin 50
Subie 2 shes covered with bitties
Snowpants blue like the sign for thrifty
So baggy what are those a fuckin size 60?
Burrito legs bitch, call me big shitty

[Verse 1]
If I had 20 million dollars in the vault somewhere, baby
It wouldn't matter anyway, yeah
Cause the doctor told me that I'm dying slowly
So I guess I gotta love you while I'm here baby
Did you know ?

[Pre-Hook]
News said that the sky is fallin'
The globe is warmin'
My country's warin'
The leaders are lying
Time is runnin'
Lower and lower babe, lower babe

[Hook]
I know we just met
But baby could you love me quickly, quickly
I want you to love me like ya know the worlds about to end, baby
Quickly

[Verse 2]
You told me I don't even know your name
I said well then we might as well make ours the same
What you think, baby?
(No time)
Vegas might as well be lightyears away
So we better lay under the stars
Before they crashin' down
Cause I heard

[Pre-Hook]
News said that the sky is fallin'
The globe is warmin'
My country's warin'
The leaders are lying
Time is runnin'
Lower and lower babe, lower babe

[Hook]
I know we just met
But baby could you love me quickly, quickly
I want you to love me like ya know the worlds about to end, baby
Quickly

[Bridge]
That's right baby kiss me like the earth is quaking
Like the Earth is shakin'
You got it baby
That's right love me
Feel me like our time is sprinting faster
Running out on us

[Hook]
I know we just met
But baby could you love me quickly, quickly
Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end, baby
Quickly, yeah

Barely know me baby
But you gotta love me quickly, quickly, oh
Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end, baby
Quickly

Gotta love me baby, quick now
Gotta love me baby, quickly now
Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end, baby
Quickly

[Outro]
Lou said the sky was fallin, yeah
Lou said
Oh na na

[Verse 1]
What the fuck do y’all niggas really want?
I went with realness instead
But all the "real niggas" I know either crazy or dead
Yeah, I dropped the free EP for these other kids to feel a lot
Niggas keep asking on whether this dude’s for real or not
I’m not trying to come hard, I’m trying to come me
That’s why these older songs that I used to make I’d release free
What’s the point of rap if you can’t be yourself, huh?
That’s why I come first like my cell phone
I’m a role model, I am not these other guys
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly
I know it’s dumb, that’s the fucking reason I’m doing it
So why does everyone have a problem with talking stupid shit?
Or is it real shit?
‘Cause sometimes that stupid shit is real shit
Like when you make out with your best friend’s baby sis
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit?
(See, that’s not even right)
You with a different girl like each and every fucking night
And kiss her while she’s sleeping and sneak out the front to catch a flight
That’s not life, dude
It's just making up for fucks I missed in high school
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one
’Cause I ain’t Mumford, I ain’t tryin’ to have sons
All I wanted was some more like Ashton
I ain’t the coolest but I know I got passion
I got passion!

[Hook]
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find

[Segue]
I said, “Baby, I’m okay”
She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
I said, “Baby, I’m okay”
She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
I said, “Baby, I’m okay”
She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
I said, “Baby, I’m okay”
Said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”

[Verse 2]
Am I serious? I don’t even know
Are you hearing this? This shit is laughable
I ain’t trying, I’m doing, these other rappers are foolish
I got fame, my A&R’s a computer
Is there room in the game for a lame who rhymes?
Who wears short shorts and makes jokes sometimes?
My nigga like, “I’d get you MTV if I could, man
But Pitchfork only likes rappers who crazy or hood, man”
So, I guess we gon' see
I ain’t Curren$y, but if there ain’t money in my name please murder me
Sometimes I feel like I ain't supposed to be here
Sometimes I wake up, I don't want to be here
My mom loves to text me Psalm verses
She don’t look at me like I’m the same person
I used to be the sweet one, but things change
And I don’t want them missing a son like Bon’s last name
And all my uncles alcoholics, shame on me
I drink whiskey till I’m grounded, no TV
I wanna go inside the club with no gold piece
And walk in with no idea and No I.D
No matter how far the hood seems
We all still got hood dreams
I always wanted to get picked on the cool team
But alone is exactly how I should be

[Hook]
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
We need to find
We need to find

[Notorious B.I.G.]
And ya don't stop, hit it!
Mumbling and whispering is what I hear
When B.I.G. appear on the scene niggas get scared
Why? I'm not the stick-up man
I don't want the rings on your hand, I don't understand
When I come thru the avenue I must know voodoo
Cause all eyes are on you know who - huh!
And my so-called friends beg for ends for me to lend
But this bankrolls they won't spend
I don't need 'em, let the welfare feed 'em
When it come to 'wassup' the peace sign is how I greet em - uh
Sometimes they won't get that, sweating me for some chit-chat
Bite my lyrics like kit-kats
Open your eyes, realize ain't no sugar in my tank
Out of all my friends, there's just one I want to thank
My man Big D taught me a lesson that was great
That good things come to those who wait
And we've waited through the suffering and pain
And bitches ride the dick like the A-train
That's why I flip
Keep a burner to my hip
Take a hooker to the crib, you know she got to strip
Stay dip, take out of state trips
Don't drink a lot of Hennessy, I only take a sip
I'm a skipper, like a captain, rapping is my specialty
And the best is me, so the rest will see
B.I.G. don't need to practice
I'm like a sharpshooter shoot the needle off a cactus
Only thing I lack is stage fright and conceit
I completely defeat the weak - uh
Even the strong don't last long
Cause I'm Brooklyn born, bay-bro
I'm not a paper gangster of no sort, don't smoke Newports
When I get stressed I grab my vest
Put a MC to the test quick specially if he talk slick about who we flipped then whipped
I tripped the competition, stepped across the step to the big boss
You know, of course, they took a loss
Steppin to big and a hitman 50 grand
Like sinkin' in quicksand, ya need a hand my man
Damn, tried to give you the warning sign
When I said chill, I wasn't sayin' LL rhyme
I was telling ya not to flare up
He's about to tear up, I'm telling you not to erupt
Cause he just as corrupt as a DJ should be - huh
50 Grand, and I'm the BIG
Mister Cee..

[Mister Cee]
Yo, here we go here we go here we go here we go here we go motherfucker here we go
Can ya withstand this kind of a man
Gettin in your ass like sand
But this ain't a date at the beach lil each
And every mc in the place check the speech
And i'll bet the dough from my show they can't get wit
Mister Cee on the flow till I get bit

[Notorious B.I.G interjecting]
Nah nah nah nah nah love. you can't do it like that love. you got to ride that motherfucker you know what I'm sayin? you got to riiide that motherfucker

Try to get props on the brother, that pops the most
And clocks the most, drops the most shit like a pigeon
Listen, to the words I'm slippin' through saliva
Ain't a MC liver, I'm the rap MacGyver
Doin' tricks with my lips so quick
If you blink you would miss the great style of Chris
Don't try to diss, cause I dismiss, dissaprove, dissapoint
Rappers that think they the joint
Huh, they'll get the point quicker
Faster even, MC's I'm leavin' until you can't breathin
You call it a homicide, I call it a suicide
Try to battle me boy ya deserve to die
Punch ya in your eye, before I blade ya
To let ya know that I can fight before I slayed ya
Call me Chris, this I insist
Anything different will lead to closed fist
A wrap up. you don't wanna get tapped up

[Lupe Fiasco]
I set it off
Yeah, I let it off
Uh, uh, uh
You wearing off
Your effects on the industry is fading
And Lupe be great
Fiasco is playing
I'm blazing, and stepping through the scene so heavenly
And they so not ready for me
Readily, I come through and break the game down
Yeah, I take your name down
As well I'm graffiti artist writing over your name
I feel like slam, feel like damn
I be the man so exactly, practically
Rapping over everything that's spat to me
You could see it coming, if you don't, if you don't then that's bad
But L-U-P make the whole game feel sad
Make the game go mad so insane
I'm filming
Feel like illegitimate children building
Uh, and see I do it hard
See my flow naked as the WorldStar girls are
Play it, and we can do it big
And Semtex blow it up
And Lupe is the kid
And Sway is the homie
You got nothing for me, if they try
Either back up, clack up, clap up, pull the mac up and clap up
Anybody try'na pull the strap up get dapped up
Or might just get wrapped up in the carpet
And thrown down the hill, for real
And L-U-P sure got skills
But take off the "S", I kills
And put it on the end
And begin, you'll never win stepping to them
The tag team duo, Nuo
You should've do that 'for you came through
Uh, I'm so fluid like fluoride in the water make you dumb
And we can do it like, E-40, say shorty
They don't want none and they ain't got nothing for me
Don't step into my party unless you got a vest on
Cause I'm throwing shots from the DJ booth
And taking off my roof in my Ferrari when I step through
Yes you, you could try it if you want
God bless you
I hope that you don't die after this freestyle
And I'll be rocking out in the meanwhile
Uh, see I feel like OGs now
Uh, and I used to be a YG
Rest In Peace Esco
My brother much love
I hope God bless you up above
Uh, see I'm stepping like a cuz
And I'm walking like a Crip
But I'm feeling like a Blood
Yeah, but I'm like a GD
Feeling like a Vice Lord
Players can't see me
And I don't wanna be Big Meech or Larry Hoover
I wanna be Martin Luther King, Jr
Yeah, see that's BMF Freestyle
Revamped we the champs
We stamp through like elephants
Intelligent rap is so irrelevant
See we don't deal with the nonsense
We constant
Constantly bombing over things that we bring constant
Conscious, championship rapper
Feel like were
I'm feeling like Tottenham, like a hot spur
And you could get a hot splash in your face
Uh, bring it from the blast off the waist
From my blast in the pace
L-U-P in the piece
Peace

[Sway]
I need a peace of the beat
It's Mr Sway DeSafo, I never meet defeat
I'm here with Lupe - happy birthday
Lazer drop, it's gonna be their worst day
It's Mr Sway DeSafo, keep moving
Every freestyle I say I keep on improving
But I ain't gonna freestyle all of the of the head, I gotta hit them with a verse too
Mr Derrick Safo, all of his splendour
I don’t smoke kush but I'm quick to forget ya
I remembered, I am that kush and you other rappers couldn’t get a puff if you were Skepta
Listen, I'm only hired by the best star
I got your boss behind a desk like "guess what?"
Call me the hit man, I'm lining up the red dot-dot-dot-dot-dot-dot et cetera
Ha, you little dames ain't gonna head nah
Nah ain't like a doc-doc-doc, I'm a professor
Welcome to my lecture
You will be here forever, cause my books of raps is way too thick to get past
Something like Cee-Lo in a narrow alley
No Bruno, but the flow is out of this world, forget Mars
Sway, the way I'm shock-shock-shocking them
I should'a been signed to Electra-zzz
Super Swah, you rappers can't see me
Bar Lupe, bar Drake, bar Weezy
See I'm an African, I got my own language
Give me mulla mulla - that’s some Swahili
I said beats, I double them easy, burn them easy, got the burner and hate to copy those CDs
Ah shoot, I mean sue
I don’t promote violence but F with DCY will have you in a 3 piece-piece-piece
Take this opportunity to say, Lupe’s got an album on the way; retweet
The freestyle games revolting, I go so in it's insulting
And to throw salt in the wounds
True stories, I rap of the head like sultans
Welcome to Agrabah, cause I am Jafar, it’s about to go down
Deeper than Billy's ocean but I will never drown
And I think you’ve found the next seal, mark my face
But I ain't kissing no roses, unless it's Roses Gabor
I went off track, I'm trick
Now watch me bring it back, Pac Shakur
I think I was talking about Guns 'n' Roses, and Seals - that’s it
I'll make the Mac pack push off, Postman's back, you don’t want it like Shador
Ill let the letters box you that’s how I back my tour
They come at me with bull but I'm El Savador
I'm a lion, you’re a pussy - that’s a different cat-tegory
I'm comfy in my seat, they coming for so
Comfortably I read, it's DCY - they're telling me sell shares
But man is only known by the company he keeps
I'm my boss, it's time to find a Mosque
Pray like a prophet, so I can recover my loss
Going out to all the haters thinking I'm soft
You need to keep your distance cause you’re a mile off
Figure how to box Semtex, pass my gloves and a cloth
Just in case I need to wipe some smiles off
I take them in twos, I Ant and Dec, yeah breaking the rules and
Taking their papers stripes off
Damn right man, you're right, it ain't the twos

[?]
It's Mr Sway and Lupe and we’re out here and we doing it all-time, every single year
S1 extra, ain't 1 better
Mr Sway DeSafo
Semtex selecta
Jaime Foxx
I swear I always fall for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type

CrookTheKidd
I see you walking girl please tell me what your name is
I heard about your past, but trusting rumors can be dangerous
Girl dont play if you love me than just let me know
Lets go to school pen and paper girl check yes or no, yeah uhh
Or maybe if you prefer we can talk about your life and how you dream to see the world
I take you there if you agree to let me in your heart
Ill love you down forever girl will never fall apart
Dont worry bout your man girl he ain't gotta know
But soon your gunna have to tell that man that he has gotta go
Loving you is hard work but girl im ready
Cause being single fun but im just trynna hold it steady
Thats why ima take a chance with these feelings now, falling for your type
I feel alota times before, this time I hope its right
Dont let me down love me down hold me tight dont let go
Sex is cool love is great but for now lets take is slow

[Intro]
Ha, yeah

[Verse 1]
They say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, "Damn, really? Even Rosemary? Even Leann Sealy?"
They said, "Fucking right, they were the first to go"
It's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With "I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you"
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like, "Why you even give a fuck, you not even here?"
Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home

[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

[Verse 2]
I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home

[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

[Verse 3]
My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say "What up, though?"
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love
'Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home

[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

[Outro: Bob Marley]
Well, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know?
But, it’s not copy do it, it’s the feel, you know? It carry a feel
Well, you ask plenty musicians – them know it, but them can't do it
Some people still searching for this truth here

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama, she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama

[Refrain]
She never knew that there was  anything more than poor
What in the world, what does your company take me for?

[Verse 2]
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', "Baby, what you gonna—?"

Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]

I love my baby to death

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release

Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say, say, say

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a-gunnin' for the quota

It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]

If you feel like

And make it okay
I swear I'll behave

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
You wanted control, so we waited

Maybe it's hard, when you feel like
You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
That I've got the key

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you wanna steer, but I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here (Oh, yeah, yeah)
And it goes like this, uh

[Intro: Rick Ross]
Tat my name on you, girl, so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tell a bad bitch "Girl, let's go hang"
You know me, Rolex, gold chain
Fuck with my young niggas, XO Gang
Get so drunk you forget your name
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches
Voodoo Child to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it back so I'm all in with these new flows
New flows, got new flows, rap is stress but it pays great
Pimp flows and Screw flows, my shit is sounding like grey tapes
Now, let me gon' hit that cup, one time 'fore a nigga hit that road
These days keep going by too fast, so give me anything to make shit go slow
Yeah, money in my safe but I'm living dangerous
They told me shit would change but I don't really see no change in us, oh, no

[Chorus: Drake]
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune
I play with her mind, she masturbate in my Porsche
It's simple love, simple math
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass
Puffing purple hash, welcome to my power circle
Sucker-free, no snitching and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rolling, rose-gold Rollies
MBA accountants, amounts, they get unholy
My momma still praying for her Rubberband Man
When them wheels land, Travis Barker, drums playing
Tap-dance to my drum roll (Uh)
I love a bitch that know how to keep me one rolled

[Chorus: Drake]
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?

[Verse 3: Drake]
I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for one more
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you there's no side-effects, I'm sure
Went from driving up in some old shit to drivers opening doors
This is my town, if you need something, just ask for it, it's yours
Yeah, ask for it, it's yours, if you ask for it, it's done
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come
You'll meet everybody I know, at first it might seem like a lot
But they all playing they role, put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man, I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my set
I just give everybody a piece of this and make do with what's left
Yeah, I do this shit to the death, yeah, I do this shit til I'm gone
Yeah, I told you it's our world, you foolish thinking I'm wrong, ooh
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let these niggas know it's real
What's up?

[Chorus: Drake]
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?

[Post-Hook: Taio Cruz]
Oh yeah, they tell me I’m a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there

[Pre-Hook: Taio Cruz]
Look at her go on the dance floor
She’s amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it goin', girl, like I got an encore
You got me saying...

[Hook: Taio Cruz]
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl

[Post-Hook: Taio Cruz]
Oh, yeah, they tell me I’m a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there

[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]
Shaking her ass from the left to the right
Moving it round just the way that I like
I wanna see you move like a movie on flight
You got it how I want and I want it all night

[Pre-Hook: Taio Cruz]
Look at her go on the dance floor
She’s amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it goin', girl, like I got an encore

[Hook: Taio Cruz]
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
She done got my heart jumping
And my adrenaline pumpin' and gunnin'
Like ain’t nobody ever seen
(Seen, seen, seen, seen, seen, seen)
As a matter of fact, I’ve seen this woman all up in my dreams
Whippin' and flippin' and stackin' and slappin'
I’m attacking after she back it up and make it drop
After I meet her I tell her David Guetta’s on the track
Baby girl, don’t stop
Keep it goin', you never know when somebody’s gonna throw a couple dollars
Got a pocket full of hundred dollar bill’s
Ludacris, Mr. Make-a-Woman-Holla
(Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing)
And every night on the floor putting on a show
(Show, show, show, show, show)
Everybody in the club, there’s a little something you should know

[Pre-Hook: Taio Cruz]
Look at her go on the dance floor
She’s amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it goin', girl, like I got an encore
You got me saying…

[Hook: Taio Cruz]
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl

Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl

[Verse 1: Drake]
People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down

[Chorus: Drake]
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh, baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 2: Drake]
They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
There's things we might discover
'Cause you got a past and I do too
We're perfect for each other

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down

[Chorus: Drake]
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh, baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
'Cause to her, I'm just a rapper and soon, she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow, we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don't wan' be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her
And she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I wan' know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
See, I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last, Tunechi

[Chorus: Drake]
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Shower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name, you throw that ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote bad bitches work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in a corner
Like a lab rat, nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind 'cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in a Boise state
Can't see a play or the team, 'cause
Everybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't, souls will later on say to them, "That ain't true"
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you, baby
"Someone Like You," more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh, what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful, bitches got the rabies

[Verse 1]
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad 'cause he ain't like me
Oh, you mad 'cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah, I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now, that's me
That's me
And the voice in your ear, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always gettin' faded

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
A shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
A shot for me

[Verse 2]
Okay, look, I'm honest, girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says, "I know you changed
I never see you 'cause you're always busy doin' things"
I really wish she had a different way of viewin' things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends tellin' you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your Mr. Perfect
I could tell that you been cryin' all night, drinkin' all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
A shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
A shot for me

[Outro]
Yeah
May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you
And Heaven accept you

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Box
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and, and fall asleep, I, I fall asleep
'Cause, 'cause, 'cause you, 'cause you are the death of me
'Cause you are the—
If you was in a pine box, box
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and, and fall asleep, I, I fall asleep
'Cause, 'cause, 'cause you, 'cause you are the death of me
'Cause you are the—
The, the death of me, you, you, the death of me

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Lookin' in the mirror, I'm embarrassed
I'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man, arm wrestlin' hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it, I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar
Women love when you're my type
And you're winnin' from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all 'cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein' read
I'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat, capitalize that
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin' device on your used 5 Series
I don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say we in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors, all that nigga was missin' was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality livin' in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin'
Then he said that he was the same age as
Myself, and it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO
The reason why I'm breathin' all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend say she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why the highlight was when he said
You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
Full of fame and bury yourself alive, then I died
Jay-Z:

Turn the muthafuckin music up

Yeahhh

Yeaaaahhh!

I got these niggas Weezy!

Heheheheheheheheheheh....

You might cop a watch like mine, homie, but this a different BEZel

You wanna BATTLE dog? Fuck that, lets compare catalogs...
Compare bank accounts, compare travel logs, compare passports, n THEN have a talk
Niggas think they got bite, jus cos they have a bark
Cos the niggas who ain't got cars will tell you they rather walk...Haa!

Yall niggas is avatars....to be honest, I ain't even mad at ch'all
You pour ya cup n mafuckas jus rather grab a straw.....
They like fiends, the way they rock back n forth

Niggas can't act mature.....
N everybody think they TU-pack Shakurs
Niggas brave after two packs a Coors, Two packs? OF COURSE
Triple entendre you bastards off

Soon as our mafuckin paths have crossed
Who you tryna renegade? You just a Asher Roth
Never pushed out the game due to lack a force
Plus my nigga Wayne jus adds support....HUH
Lil Wayne:

Classy-ass women, fresh-ass linen (Yeah)
Hot summer days with a pool I can swim in (Cheah)
A good spot to kick it (What?), a case of 40's
Them homies always havin' good stories (Yep)
The beer bottles with the twist-off caps (Uh-huh)

I love days I can sleep in (Sleep in), four day weekends (Weekends)
Hoes puttin' they clothes back on, you peekin' (I see you, haha)
Blunt rides, with a mixtape bumpin' (Uh-huh)

And when the hip-hop legend tour comin' to your town (Comin' to your town)

Hoes walkin' in the halls and you reach for they ass (Sup?)
Fast food lines when they movin' so quickly (What? So quickly)

Street performers, warmin' up the corners
Sellin' by the ounce, then pinchin' by the quarter (Gimme that)
When some kicks on sale (Uh-huh)
Wakin' up in the mornin' with a shitload of mail
The wake up, the bake up, chillin' while you face blunts
Goin' in blowed for your shape-up like, "Say what?" (Say what?)
Blog put your tape up, get a good review
When dumbass people tell you what you shouldn't do (Fuck y'all)
When she rub my head while I'm between her knees, haha
Gettin' love from the people overseas (Ciao)
Haters tryna hate, but they got nothin' to say (Yeah)

Heavy Hustle Gang
Swisher Sweets with the jacuzzi
Probably fucked your girl
You don't like it, nigga sue me
Shawty from the hood
But in the club she actin' bougie
Body like a centerfold
Boy look at that loody
My ink got her gone
Wanting to know who tattoos me
Head game righteous
Said she'd like to ride, yeah
DJ play my song
When it come on she get excited
Before I leave the club
I put her number in my Sidekick
Swagger on some different shit
She tell me that she like it
Watch her break it down
I ain't playin' around

[Hook]
Yeah it's goin' down, it's goin' down
Watch her hit tha flo', watch her hit tha flo'
Yeah it's goin' down, it's goin' down
Watch her hit tha flo', watch her hit tha flo'

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
I hate when, I hate when people say they feel me, man
I hate that shit
It'll be a long time before y'all feel me
If ever
For real

[Verse 1: Drake]
You won't feel me 'til everybody say they love you, but it's not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fuckin' hates you and your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend ass keep gettin' thicker than the plot does
And when you forget her, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop, but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit right up your alley
Yeah, you see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It's feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
'Stead of gettin' a pat-down, they just keep on sayin' that they feel you, nigga, yeah
It's been too long
Been way too long

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I've been faded too long, ooh
I've been faded too long, ooh
I've been faded too long, ooh
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? Ooh, the ride

[Verse 2: Drake]
You won't feel me 'til you want it so bad, you tell yourself you're in it
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mother's debit card so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503, some couches and paintings
Where you record with two others that want the same things
Yeah, it start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you gettin' close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you 'bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Tellin' stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on tellin' you they feel you, nigga
Yeah
It's been too long, man

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Drake]
I've been faded too long, ooh
I've been faded too long, ooh
I've been faded too long, ooh
Why won't it stop? (Yeah), the ride
Why won't it stop? (Uh), ooh, the ride

[Verse 3: Drake]
I haven't been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long
I'm drivin' right up to it now, make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold, especially after summer's rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking what's good at home?
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I should've known
My young niggas poppin' M's and sippin' dirty Jones
Problem children that all be reppin' October's Own
Brand new girl and she still growin'
Brand new titties, stitches still showin'
Yeah, and she just prayin' that it heals good
I'm 'bout to fuck and I'm just prayin' that it feels good
I really don't know much, but, shit, I know a secret
They say more money, more problems, my nigga, don't believe it
I mean, sure, there's some bills and taxes I'm still evadin'
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazin'
Young money-maker, season-ticket holder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches, still scorchin' as if I didn't notice
You niggas gettin' older, I see no threat in Yoda
I'm out here messing over the lives of these niggas that couldn't fuck with my freshman floater
Look at that fuckin' chip on your nephew's shoulder
My sophomore, I was all for it, they all saw it
My junior and senior will only get meaner
Take care, nigga

[Outro: The Weeknd]
Ooh
I'm still faded, faded, faded (The ride)
I'm still faded, faded, faded (Why won't it stop? Ooh, the ride)
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? Ooh, the ride

[Intro: Choir & Rick Ross]
And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh)
And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh)
And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh)
And I know the sun will rise with me (All we wanted was an opportunity)
Just Blaze (Lord knows)

[Verse 1: Drake & Rick Ross]
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffa and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas, they want no problems
Bought 'em sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing
I'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields, they makin' the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real (Woo)
Places they say they've been, we actually goin' for real (Woo)
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rappin' (Woo)
I'm going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things (Huh)
With my new bitch that's livin' in Palm Springs
Young-ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin' fun at
Never the flow, though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendant of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out 'cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson, boost the rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch, all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Huh
You know I love this
YOLO, you only live once
I'm going so hard, my nigga
I swear, homie
Every day is another opportunity to reach that goal
(M-M-Maybach Music)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fell in love with the pen, started fuckin' the ink (Huh)
The hustle's an art, I painted what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica (Woo)
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival Cruise
And these niggas talkin' like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss (Huh), came to buy the bar (Huh)
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car (Woo)
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double-R (Woo)
Headlights flickin', lookin' like a falling star
Every day, them hammers bang, whippin' yay like Anna Mae
I run the game, but the ladies think I'm runnin' game
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate
Rozay and Drake, I'm getting cake, nothin' short of great (Huh)
Let me hold that beat, though

You see, I'm simply complicated like a free throw
You so not my equal
You love her but I'm fucking her. I repo the freak ho
My bitch bad. Badder than yours
I'm big shit, nigga - Elephant turds
I give a fuck about whatever you heard
Cause dumb fucks speak irrelevant words
You say you're fire but you never get burned
Got now and next so its never your turn
I swear you silly motherfuckers gonna learn
It's likely your man, like me, is gonna earn (urn)
I want my money like the nigga Big Worm
Nightmares that the rubber bust send my dick burns
Thats why I be talking to hoes so stern
You see you gotta set them straight, no perms
Stallion bitch. Might throw her in the barn
No bullshit like I'm cleaning up the farm
I'm so heroin - needle in the arm
You so Marilyn. Get up off my John
F. Kennedy. Eff enemies
Small things, I should spend less energy
After all, we all know they are just Mini-Me's
Ay say, Trey, where the bitches and the Hennessy?
Your negativity's such a bad tendency
His baby-momma saying, "Let your baby swim in me." (For real?)
Fraud nigga; I don't know how to pretend to be. (Nah)
Expect what you accept. Respect what you regret
Give your best and nothing less, (Yes)
Even when you dealing with stress
If there's one thing that I bet
I'm talking about with a blank check
I'm rich but I ain't bank yet
Money on my mind but I ain't think yet
I'm balling but I ain't dunk yet
I'm buzzing but I ain't drunk yet
All I do is shit you never did, but I still ain't done shit yet
Fresh until my death
I'm getting right, move to the left
I smoking loud. Ya'll niggas so deaf
I got a bad bitch with a bad bitch. I'm a savage
Pussy on they breath
Sweat. camera set
My life is a movie and I do be camera fresh
I'm over-overdosing. My mentals overloading
If the link is overloading, baby, you just hit refresh
I met with the future last week and they said you won't be there
I figure I should tell you now so you won't be scared
I kill a rapper and I ain't sentenced so it don't be fair
I got bars. Heavy sentence and I want the chair
You rocking Pumas. I'm at Zuma eating lobster rolls
All the model bitches with me strike an awkward pose
Lyrical drugs cracking reefer, call it rock-n-roll
Niggas say they on my heels soft so they Dr. Scholls
No physicians perscription is worth submitting for this, um, sickness I'm spitting
Just listen. I'm Charles Dickens
Now if a pretty woman, I'm stickin my large dick in
Dreams of Rihanna and Nicki Minaj lickin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'. I never fall off
Hey shout to all the red bottoms that's really all dough
Or even faker. They bake cause I just fuck her but he date her
He's a sucker. Now he hate a motherfucker cause I'm greater
You niggas vanilla wafers. I gobble your whole squadron
My unborn sons never made it cause she swallowed them
Then as she hollering she thinking about some collagen
Injections, suggesting I'm investing in the semen she gargling
She think she's my bottom bitch; Hillary Rodham-ish
Keep the green growning. Hoes digging in my garden, shit
(Hoes digging in my garden, shit. Wooo!)
My flow murderous. I should tell Jada to kiss 'em
Kill the rapper. Make the nigga tell Biggie I miss him
Energy fuel bodies. Niggas that envy me do
Many of you do have the tendency to
Mimic my moves. Isn't it true
In him is something that you wish was in you
No stop button. Won't pause for nothing
I ain't spitting, I'm throwing up cause you niggas disgusting
These bitches is lusting. You niggas is cuffing
You young and flashy nigga. I feel like Dash and Jigga
'96. So glorious
Or Puff Daddy and Notorious
In '95, before he died
My hustle grand. I'm T.I.P. and Dro
I need a TS chain. I'm Pun and Joe
I just fuck a lot. I'm not a player
Hold up, yea. So like Pun and Joe, oh
I paved the way for 'em
Lay away. Floor'em
Your whole style borrowed
Bring my shit back tomorrow
I'm what you mens ain't
Just keep it Ben Frank
You ain't getting the picture, get your lens changed, get's your lens changed
Sometimes I feel like the devil's behind me. I'm running fast
God bless a nigga. Angels got my back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
That into it, spitta so intricate
If they ain't feeling him they get the boot like Timberland
They still hating, I reboot 'em like computers
And let them know that your boy on the ball no hooping
But from downtown like a three-point shooter
To uptown they feel a nigga deeper than masseuses
The truth is I does this, spitting like I was toothless
Coming to you clearer than blueprints, I move in
They sleeping on me man and I ain't sheets
Bloodsuckers so I'm calling 'em leech
I gotta eat and I'm hungry like I skipped breakfast, where's the ketchup?
I'm tryna cop the Benz or Lexus for winter time
So I ain't gotta go head up to Enterprise
Just to get my ass up in a ride
But nigga's can’t see me like they born with tinted eyes?
To me you little so to see you I got squinted eyes
And I'm just tryna show all of y’all I'm a soulful dude
Compared to me you got about as much sole as shoes
And soul is food, to prove this ask your chick
She all on my dick cause I push it like a pool stick
Who is this you’re asking?
He’s cold as Alaskans, I'm on point like assassins
Y’all as common as Jasmines and Ashleys
And if you ask me you’re never gonna pass me, sheesh, I’m good

[Hook: Big Sean]
Yeah, you really wanna talk about good I'm good
You r-really wanna talk about good I'm good
Just a nigga out the hood
With dreams of being, dreams of being, dreams of being rich

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
At a instant, fresh out the trenches
Putting competitive nigga's back on they benches
I make that money my apprentice
Cause it lift me up like benching
Your baby girl wanna trap me like a prison but I can see through her like prisms
After I'm hitting I'm dipping, banana split 'n gone
And I'mma throw it to you harder than a quarterback
Working with a dime I'm just tryna get a quarter back
Whipping up that crack music, you should order that
Every 16 is a quarter that you need to hit
Well that's cool, I'm the number one pusher
If a nigga want heat I'm the number one cooker
If a nigga want beef I'm the number one butcher
I-I-I wrap around that green like a Swisher
My intention of ends getting is hella high
And y'all ain't getting your groove back like Stella di'

[Verse 1: brandUn Deshay]
I got that Alexander the Great type imperial flow
Butterfingers, I’m droppin’ bars like my signal was low
A car full of Os, looking like the cereal bowl
You hear me everywhere
(I'm everywhere)
But I ain't stereo though
I heard they waiting on my downfall
They talking again
Shit, I tell em' "fall back" like it's autumn again
I know they waiting for my reply, but that's all they'll get
I got my mind on bigger shit
Tell them adios then
I'm doing this for the niggas before me
Life's a bitch but god forbid that bitch divorce me
Fucking with these and one hoes they quick to cross me
They found out the hard way I guess they lost me
I'm feeling quite bossly now
I don't need love
Walking on air with my feet up a thousand feet up
I've been telling those to speak up because the money talking
It's hard to hear with all these hundreds talking
Everyday I be shining ask the weather man
Now it's girls on my jock like a Letterman
I just do it the best
If that means I'm doing better than
Then fuck it, whatever then all day
BrandUn DeShay

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
I'm chillin' with the homies
Real talks, real conversations
Most of y'all speaking on what girl that nigga dating
I only speak to her and she say she facing
I hope she ain't got braces
Make her keep going til' I tell her she amazing
Casey keep spittin got these haters walking mazes
I used to play games now I'm playing for the payment
Born in '93 with my girl from the '80s
I just say it again to them
Lotta niggas try to stop me but I ran through them
Lotta niggas didn't believe I wave my hands to them
Now everybody know exactly what the man doing
Ro-man music pump it loud, go ahead and make it grand to it
I just grab my pen and pad and let my hands do it
It's Odd Future til' I stop you heard my first music
Now when you come and see me rock bring a hurse to it
You niggas

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Ignorant, Atheist, sound like a fucking monster
Tall, skinny, lanky, buck it, fuck it, badass posture
Copped some angel wings in Hell, where they discounted
Mounted with the devil, he was formal with some Polo and some Dockers
Dancing with him, playing vintage Cindi Lauper
With some Crips in all red, like they playing Red Lobster
My bitch is white Italian to be exact, mobster is her father
And he'll kill me when he finds out I'm reading her Harry Potter
Fuck him, I'm a demon, fill your daughter up with semen
With Supreme embroidered logos, making fun of homos
Cause it's funny
Tommy rugby Hilfiger, screaming nigga with a cluck
I'm a fuckin' Nazi with a condom, barely give a fuck
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Fuck Lame, 91'
We hockey fuckin' awesome, hit you with the Wolf Gang puck
Trucks thunder, now she's in the trunk
Wondering why she's 'bout to get raped and chopped up, lumber
He said write a sixteen, well she was seventeen
And I'm only eighteen and that's statutory rape
And if you fucking snitch on me I guess I'll make the great escape
To have a date with your dead body and I cannot be late
Might do a Ted Bundy, I can consider ya'll some haughtys
If they find me at my home, guess I gotta fucking roam
All alone in the streets, gotta hustle drugs for food
Gotta sell beats for clothes if I really wanna eat
Fuck you, O.F.M. Bangin' on your mothafuckin' FM
Fuck Tammy
Fuck Tammy

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
When I walk on by, girls be looking like, "Damn, he fly"
I pimp to the beat, walking down the street in my new LaFreak
Yeah, this is how I roll, animal print, pants outta control
It's Redfoo with the big afro
And like Bruce Leroy, I got the glow, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body (I-I-I work out)
Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body (I-I-I work out)

[Chorus]
When I walk in the spot (Yeah), this is what I see (Okay)
Everybody stops and is staring at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it
Show it, show it, show it
I'm sexy and I know it
I'm sexy and I know it

[Verse 2]
Yeah
When I'm at the mall, security just can't fight 'em all
And when I'm at the beach, I'm in a speedo trying to tan my cheeks (What)
This is how I roll, come on, ladies, it's time to go
We headed to the bar, baby, don't be nervous
No shoes, no shirt, and I still get service, watch

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body (I-I-I work out)
Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body (I-I-I work out)

[Bridge]
Check it out, check it out
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah, yeah
Do the wiggle, man, I do the wiggle, man
Yeah, I'm sexy and I know it
Ay, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, look at that body

[Outro]
I'm sexy and I know it

[Hook: MC Chris]
I am the awesome
You see me flossin', watch me walk upon your face
Make that incision
I leave you itchin' just to join my monster race
Say I'm just messin'
Yea well I'm pissed and I can keep an even key
You think you know me
But you can blow me cause you don't know how I feel

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
It's Childish Gambino, ho
What you know about that?
Niggas 'fraid to go outside, they some house cats
Cause if they see me, they might have to act right
I'm livin' life right, like I got a past life
Boy I got a flashlight
Check my fuckin' hoodie skin
Like God was makin' light and threw my hoodie in
Bambi, naw nigga that's my pseudonym
Call me Elroy
Nigga we some hooligans
And just in case, I keep a million in the glove box
Blast this shit from in your car to make the hood rock
Ice cold, bright colors, like a juice pop
And if you try to touch my shit I'll make your juice pop
Yes I get a two spot just for fuckin' showin' up
Boy it's me, T.N.T., boy I'm blowin' up
Nigga throw it up
Boy, I am the awesome
Call me Elroy
Or Mr. "Hey, how much it cost him"

[Hook: MC Chris]

[Verse 2: MC Chris]
Okay!
Rackin' 'em, stackin' 'em, packin' these ballers
Bleedin' These hoes I carve ‘em with a big carver
Stiff Like Barbara's
I pack a punch like a bunch of starbursts
Back up ma, let me celebrate your suit
Like five toes cuz you gonna get the boot
Like five guys cuz you're gonna get the boot
Underground sound I reiterate “Roots” what the minute men lose, what the little man grew, his crew while they wrestle in the nude, can’t handle the truth, I prefer my own coop
With my hand on the mic and my mind on the move
Cryin’-on-The-View, Ridin' the wave, I'ma take a step that you bothered to save
I can get crunk in a couple of ways

[Verse 1: Carl Wilson]
She belongs there left with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She laughs and stays in the one, one, wonderful

[Verse 2: Carl Wilson]
She knew how to gather the forest when
God reached softly and moved her body
One golden locket, quite young and
Loving her mother and father

[Verse 3: Carl Wilson]
Farther down the path was a mystery
Through the recess, the chalk and numbers
A boy bumped into her one, one, one, wonderful

(Laughs and Sounds)

(SMiLE Version Lyrics - "Alternative Verse 4")
All fall down and lost in the mystery
Lost it all to a non-believer
And all that's left is a girl
Who's loved by her mother and father

[Verse 4: Carl Wilson]
She'll return in love with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She'll smile and thank God for one, one, one, wonderful

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Ha, hot damn, you look so appalled
My girl is the shit, your girl has no ass at all
Her booty super thick, but her tummy super small
And when she dancin', the booty swallow up her draws
Yeah buddy, in the club I do my Dougie
Bottle in my hand, mean muggin' like I'm ugly
Only models in my section, get them uglies 'way from me
And when they be like, I just play dummy
In the party got them white girls rollin' like whoa
In the mornin' they be like, "Where the fuck are my clothes?
Please don't tell nobody cause I don't really do this"
Sure, what you think I'm stupid?
I told her just to call me dada
But shorty Spanish so she wanna call me papa, or papi
Never met a nigga like me
I swept her up, so I guess she had light feet

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
Can we make this an after party?
'Cause your body, all on me
And my heads spinnin' 'round and 'round
Can we make this a nasty party?
'Cause I just want your body on mine, body on mine
And take me down, take me down, down

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Ha, look, Vans on, so I get my dance on
She said she fucked the whole crew, I put my mans on
I threw my money on the table, told her dance on it
I pulled that monster out, she put her hands on it
Pool party shawty goin' gnarly
Only fuck with rock stars and them boys who's ridin' Harleys
Bitch, I'm on your camera, no not iCarly
When she turn 21, I'ma drown her with Bacardi
Mmhm, one-fifty-one
Heart beatin' like a drum and my face is kinda numb
Stop that shit, where the hatin' comin' from?
Oh. you mad 'cause I got your girl face full of ***?

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
Can we make this an after party?
'Cause your body, all on me
And my heads spinnin' 'round and 'round
Can we make this a nasty party?
'Cause I just want your body on mine, body on mine
And take me down, take me down, down

[Hook]
Ooh, aah, oh yeah
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Ooh, aah, oh yeah
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Fallin' out, ooh, down
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Oh, fallin' down, oh yeah
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind

[Verse 1]
I turn ‘em like Tina, I don’t tote ninas
But a nigga walked up and get served like subpoenas
And I ain’t broke neitha, I got a in-between
So when I say about a million what I mean is bitch fiend
I gotta keep grinding, my name Tony Hawk
‘Cause I grind with my boys sometimes at the park
A heavy-ass kid, easy on the cake
Until I got to New York and I started losin’ weight
And when I say “weight,” I do mean "weight”
Now I'm thin like the line between love and hate
Cause I used to go skate
Nigga I’m paid, this kid don’t play like a high-top fade
I don’t get laid, I’m back at the studio
The closest girls get is watchin’ old Derrick videos
Girls don’t get it, say I work too much
Pass boo the cell phone and say, "Girl, be in touch"
But we won’t be in touch, I know that for sure
You ain’t in love with me, you like my décor
Christian Dior, pastel and Jack
If it’s in hot pink then it’s on my back
I’m young and I’m black and the world is my oyster
Watchin’ Top Chef on my European sofa
These niggas so fake like an old toupee
So clear call this shit Blu-Ray

[Hook]
Ooh, aah, oh yeah
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Ooh, aah, oh yeah
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Fallin' out, ooh, down
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Oh, fallin' down, oh yeah
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind

[Verse 2]
Take me to a hospital, call me Ebola
And a nigga flow sweet, so I spit Coca Cola
And my boys sold boulders, but I gotta do it my way
We grindin' the same, but we usin' different pathways
Gotta make ends meet, a means to an end
And I hate seein’ niggas usin’ “grind,” for pretend
Cause this ain’t pretend, and I ain’t pretendin’
We eatin’ out late like I hang with the gremlins
Call David Geffen, we about to switch places
The game is a hold, got a pocket full of aces
Boy, I’m a phenom, I can’t be stopped
Had my RA pager on my first day at 30 Rock
Headed for big things like I’m runnin’ Salma Hayek
Four Seasons plus no more work at the Hyatt
I’m fly and I’m high like a pilot
But you can’t see me like an eyelid, vibin’, uh

[Hook]
Ooh, aah, oh yeah
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Ooh, aah, oh yeah
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Fallin' out, ooh, down
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Oh, fallin' down, oh yeah
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind

[Intro]
Uh uh uh uh uh
Yeah
That’s what I’m talking about
Lemme clean my glasses
Lemme wipe off my sneakers
Lemme tilt my hat
You understand

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Calm down, shorty, the alpha dude’s up
They don’t wanna touch ‘em they alpha dude touch
Just when they think they getting slick I lift
Switch my altitude up
Drop a little jewelry down
Pick my valuables up lay my tomfoolery down
They like the way I Converse
They alpha dude Chucks
But these Taylors here are tailor-made for me
The Geminis the Pros and the Sh-Shayla Gs
Yeah, a four-man squad that’ll play your league
Play you four-on-forty, give you a hundred-point lead
Then we still pimp the game like it’s Hunter’s point, please
Homie (Homie) Y-y-ya know me (ya know me)
You might see me down Stoney Island, Ridin’
Madison-Travelin’, Michigan-Visitin’
Roosevelt-Rollin’, Home and Roamin’
Halstead-Walkin’, Jeffrey’s-Joggin’

[Chorus]
Yes these problems, didn’t you know? (echo)
He’s here!

[Verse 2: Shayla G]
I’m right behind ya man
Who you think better than
I’m over ya heads like Excedrin
I keep telling them
I’m coming
Keep pumping me like a veteran
I do it
Part in confidence just that my jargon’s number one in my conference
I take state, raise stakes while joggin’
We take nationals no bargains
I’m barging through the door
I’m tired of knocking my knuckles are sore
It’s nothing no more
FNF hot like TNT pop D and D not
Disturbed revenge of the nerds
I told you vengeance this hurts
Time to get my grown woman on like bees and the birds
Me and my squad like peas in a pod
Haven’t you heard (echo)
Homie (homie)
Y-y-ya know me (ya know me)
You might see me ‘bout Stoney Island
Ridin’
79th

While while hundred stallions
State Street grinding that’s who I am
Didn’t you know (echo)
He’s here!

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh,You’re now Hip Hoppin’ with the better
FNF
I do it for the letters
Track tripping pimping
I do it for the cheddar
I chat different listen
I put it all together
Wonder how I remain cool
When I’m pedaling the fire
When niggas got littler than a sweater in the dryer
Homie I was a pusher of medicines for hire
So I can walk through the cookers without sweating my attire
Get through the drought without sweating my supplier
Without giving out my connect to the buyers
I hope I get it correct
Before the sun rises in the west
And god sends his Messiah
And then he wakes up the tired and is done
Homie (Homie)
Y-y-ya know me (ya know me)
You might see me down Stoney Island-Ridin’
Madison-Travelin’
Lakeshore or State and
Lake Street pacin’
Harvey-Hoppin’
Alden-Poppin’
K-Town-Creepin’
South Shore-Shufflin’
While while wanderin’
Housin’
Hustlin’
Hometown hero
Chicago’s tomorrow
West side hanger
Yes he’s danger
Didn’t you know? (echo)
He’s here!

[Intro]
Hey now

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh
Sneakers beep a heater underneath the seam
On the jeans every time I hit the scene
Like Mira
Look at me crook I be
Like ya neck when you slept wrong the American dream
Don’t step on the block that I run
Block that I brung the first beamer that they’d ever seen on these
Wit with the rocks I sling like David
Fee Fi Fo Fum
By nature I’m a hustla
Move pack like I move and I’m packing
Y’all niggas move back on the come up like elevator action
Welcome to the action-packed world of trapping
Where we tip into Chi-Town if you cook a key you will see
If you chop the nickels that you can get a drop and a box of pistols
Have to get it cooked so you can not get little
Fast (echo)
Money (echo)
‘cause all my habits important
I kept the illest hoopers in high school and Jordans
Kept the illest rappers in the hood recording
See I keep it real no I no bluffin’
I got money but I no puff them
I re-up, remove weight like liposuction
Now follow a playa as I go hustling
For that fast

[Hook: Guitar Wayne]
Fast money baby
Money (echo)
Fast as it comes or faster
When the closet close
Then you’re on your own check
Can you dig it baby?
Woooohooo!

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh
Now let’s see what happens when a little mackin and a little Cadillacin’ get it crackalackin on the scene like shush
Rings gators on seen the suits when I sneak
Man I pack shit for a king
Such as I
Uh, uh you try
See haters try to touch they uh, uh deny
This is not for the weak of heart like John Q
You’re just a John to that blonde who wants you
I’m cut from a finer cloth
See it’s pimpin’ in my blood
Know how much that vagina costs
If a playa suspect the game gon’ reject him
Welcome to the world’s oldest profession
We running game in the Chi-Town
Most niggas lame cuz they can’t accept it
They can never understand so they can’t respect it
They can never feel my pain cuz they can’t connect with it
Fast (echo)
Money (echo)
Pimps up hoes down
Why you trying to get that ho to swallow
If you get a brain then the hoes will follow
Uh, I keep it real see I know simpin’
I tell them what they want cuz I know women
They better have my cash or I go tripping
Now follow a playa as I go hustling
For that fast

[Hook]

[Hook]
Uh, they call me the rocker
Uh, yeah, uh-huh, uh

[Verse 1]
They call me the rocker
I get down like 2Pac and Big Poppa
Some say he too birds, you can't stop him
Niggas got too much beef like two Whoppers
Look at my clockers, it's about time
For a nigga to mature like a glass of fine wine
Ain't no nigga alive can outshine
I get sneaks, but don't pay like I'm crime
I run this bitch, cause I'm Will Smith
Cause I am legend and you just Hitch
Naw, I'm Hitch
Cause I get bitches
Well, I got more than one so call me eight Hitches
We ain't got riches, just some nice kicks
So call me Bruce Lee who's dressed in nice shit
Haters think I'm lame and girls think I'm sick
But both of them groups is riding my dick

[Hook]
Yeah, they call me the rocker
Call me Mr. Gambino

[Verse 2]
Uh-huh, check this out
I'm fly like birds and I spit real shit so my flow like turds
And my words absurd so I turn it all around
So my mouth is my ass and I sit when I'm loud
And I'm black and I'm proud
And I'm white and I'm rich
So fuck it, I'm a martian, I'm Lilo and Stitch
Niggas say I sound like Weezy and shit
Well he the best in the game so what's wrong with that?
Are you trying to tell me that my rhymes is phat?
Call me Usain Bolt cause I run the track
Nigga I'm sick of that
Stop comparing me to people
I know my voice funny like my name John Heder
And I'm out of this world and I'm hot like space heaters
And my girl top down so I call her two seater
My iPhone blast like TNT
I text back to home girl, "What you know 'bout me?"
I'm in NYC or in ATL
And my wallet stay fat like Kenan plus Kel
Nigga what's that smell, cause my shit don't stink
Cause my shirt bright blue and my shoes hot pink
And I finish this drink that I call a Twin Tower
Two Bud Lights and a whiskey sour
Where I fall down, that shit is ground zero
Little kids saying, "There goes my hero!"

[Outro]
Hahahaha
They call me the rocker, nigga!
Uh, they call me the rocker
Yo I'm out man

[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey (Just a display of rhyme skill, man, that's what it is)
92 'til infinity and beyond and beyond
Aight, look (Muhfucker still rap, biatch)

[Verse 1]
Hey
When I was fifteen, it was my dream to work with Preem
He believe in what I do, so now he's makin' this beat
And I'm writin' these rhymes, makin' sure that I kill it
Shinin' like I'm acrylic, the government can't conceal it
My style, they try to steal it, 'cause people startin' to feel it
I'm goin' on these adventures, somethin' like on a field trip
And now I'm growin' up, lookin' around this planet
Some shit be goin' on and I just can't understand it
No need to panic, gotta expand this (I, I, I)
A million downloads, I'm takin' over your bandwidth
Moments all candid: Kodak
Reminisce and go back
Life real good, want y'all to know that
Don't have no deal and no half a mill
Just on my Gang Starr shit with some Mass Appeal
Go platinum independently, incredibly dope
Ya need a telescope to come and get at me
The naked eye could never see and label my identity
They see my middle finger, shut the fuck up and let me be
That's how it's always been and how it will be
Filthy ass rhymes, makin' money, but I'm still me
Flippin' the mics, spittin' this nice
Never could get everything that I liked
Now I can cop it no matter the price
Fuck it, forget it, I'm rappin' for life
Can't tell me shit, I got my own mind
Six in the mornin': that's go time

[Chorus]
Face the facts, you got to understand, ain't no stoppin' me
Face the facts, but all—all you gotta do is keep it real with a playa
Face the facts, you got to understand, ain't no stoppin' me
You know how the story goes
And—and—and if you do what I do, then go and follow

[Verse 2]
Hey
Had to take the beat and let it breathe, usin' up the oxygen
The kid, he go and rock and there ain't nobody that stoppin' him
Poppin' up, bars on bars, you see me stockin' up
Workin' every second of the day is still not enough
Not on that cocky stuff, want y'all to acknowledge us
If you don't suck my dick, bitch, esophagus
You probably just go all on the internet
See a conversation, then you feel the need to interject
I ain't finished yet, you don't think this kid a threat?
I'm on a 

[?], ain't find me supervision yet
You a MP3, I'm still in cassette, vintage yet
Futuristic with some shit that split your deck
My cadence complex, rhyme without a concept
Atomic rhymes, you just a stupid fake bomb threat
Six in the mornin' and I'm writin' these rhymes
Workaholic, so you know that every night is a grind

[Chorus]
Face the facts, you got to understand, ain't no stoppin' me
Face the facts, but all—all you gotta do is keep it real with a playa
Face the—the facts, you got to understand, ain't no stoppin' me
You know how the story goes
And if—and if—and if you do what I do, then go and follow
(Maino)

Yea, yea, yea yea, like photos in my mind, you the vision in my dreams, and what I see is perfect, I picture you my queen. staring at your
Finger got me picturing the ring, you my 50 inch plasma the picture in my screen, but something ain't adding up, my math ain't equaling, you looking for the love, im selfish with my feelings eh. pushing for commitment im running from commitment, scared to open up and you wonder why im distant, trying to push away, youre the only one that knows me, feelings in the air. im afraid you might expose me, I don't mean to leave you heartbroken sleepless but im scared to give you my heart and you keep it

(Alicia Keys)

Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me
And all the time you were tellin' me lies

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed
Lonely, on me nobody ever shut down it down like you
You want a crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me
Near me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me

Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me
You know that I'll always be in love with you right til the end OOh

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's bound to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
We'll just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
What you lookin' for, baby?
I know why you want love in the middle of the night
Don't be lookin' all scary
When you been lookin' for this for long, long time
Come on over here, baby
You can love me in the dark, you can love me in the li-i-ight

You can call me your daddy
I'll be your lover or whatever you like
Girl, let me look at it
Don't you make me have to ask twice
'Cause I'm up in your city
And I'm only in town for one more night
You ain't the only one here, baby
So many girls in line, goin' crazy outside, let's go

Uh, take the roof off the Aston, pull the top off the Bellview (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And we can do whatever you tell me, you smell me? (Oh-oh, oh)
John V. Cologne, on yachts out in Colombo
When I'm home I'm Rambo, Sylvester Stallone (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And she know that, picture us like Kodak
Red vines, red wine, listenin' to Bobby Womack
And it's a throwback, me and CB, tell 'em to hold that
And if you see a couple dimes, show 'em where the boat at

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Eva Simons, The Game]

[Domo Genesis]
Coming for glamour and glitz, my plan to get rich
And turn the table, I'mma get the upper-hand on this shit
Fuck if it's quick, we eventually get to the shit
Don't need a co-sign, I'm knowing that my shit is legit
Shit getting ripped, yeah this as sick as it gets
I picture this shit, now it's looking as sick as my clip
Full moon warriors kicking down the fuckin doors
Crazy world, so we stuck on the grass, like herbivores
And if we moving, know that there's cash involved
I guess this what Nas meant when he said "The World is Yours"
Get out the way children, go do your chores
I'm a dog tryna get the bullshit up off my paws
My crew's small but the minds all strong
So even if one fall, we don't really take a loss
Maneuver like a boss, I pay the cost when I get the bread
Guillotine flow, keep getting sharper, I'mma stay ahead
Sleeping on me? Eventually you gotta make the bed
Cause all my shit hot like somebody tryna escape the Feds
Wild child, killing my wild style
Ambush, pow-pow, put my medal style
Gold chain and OJ's is what we about now
And when it comes to smoking, I'm your highness, so bow down
Coming at you raw live and rugged
Bitch niggas hate it, real niggas gon love it
Under the Influence but stay over the oven
Mixing drug music for your fucking crackhead cousin
I was that nigga back when you niggas said I wasn't
And now I make gold: every single thing I'm touching
Disgusting, allergic to the lame shit
Location and numbers change but, I be up on the same shit
Shout out to errybody who gave me all the patient
Odd Future fucking Wolf Gang, I bank shit
On and on, and on, and on, we still under the influence

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

[Chorus 1]
And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

[Verse 2]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

[Pre-Chorus]
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

[Chorus 2]
And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
La, la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la, la-la-la, la-la
So lying underneath those stormy skies
She said, "Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh I know the sun must set to rise"

[Chorus 3]
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 3]
This could be para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh...

[Kendrick Lamar]
My turbulence put a burden on young herds
And once it's cracking it's a chain reaction
Minus Young Berg
Killing with no excellence
X-amount with no excellence
To X em out with these words
Panoramic views be tumbling out my mind
No panoramic views, bullets tumbling out no nines
Big AKs like Alicia Keys abbreviated
And nowadays, niggas stand behind em like Clive Davis
Clyde Drexler, before the hook I dribble niggas
On the stretcher. A understatement to say
That K Lamar was under pressure
Don't press your luck when you pressed for time
Cause when the press get this verse
They're sure to press rewind
A president's prayer, can't say what's in my cul de sac
Codeine, crack and codiac
Enough violence to keep the Devil smiling while we
Wyling on the corners with the ? rats
Niggas build a trap house, hope that Gotti
Don't run his trap. See the fans that tap out
That's wrestler shit. Don't rest your case
With the gaze just cause you wrestled your bitch
We catching bodies and catching fades in the hotel lobbies
Fuck the security and that's at the Ritz Carlton
My impurity is probably your best asset
Spit ass, hit your block and chrome and your address
Leave em stagnant
This is torture when I scorch ya
Or escort ya out the building with ex-convicts
And all sorts of criminal handshakes
Your man can't stick to the script
With handpaint. Poppin your lip, then poppin the clip
Then poppin your van, wait
I want the peace. But keep the piece
That I was Malcolm to your belief, wassup

[Verse 1]
She was lost in so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
There but for the grace of God go, I

[Chorus]
I found Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria

[Verse 2]
I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down

[Chorus]
You are my Heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria

[Bridge]
Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hit you and then you realize
It's out of your hands, baby, you got to understand

[Chorus]
You are my Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Ave Maria

[Intro: Ludacris]

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had?
Was it everything that you were looking for?
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I'd be looking for
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
Cause Lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Oh Oh Ohhhhh

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Luda
Every time I see you I squeeze you like you my teddy bear baby
Got ya hand on the wheel and ya peddle to the metal
Pretty woman you drive me crazy
Got you by my side and I really can admit that I never thought you would go
I might of did my thang on the side with some chick but I never thought you would know
What was I thinking I must have been drinking trying bring that drama
Hanging out at all times of the night with the fellas and disappear just like Osama
Running like Obama, I'm a liar I should've been ashamed
Playing it like the station this is just real life this is not a game
And I'm insane for ya
I feel the pain for ya
Stand all under my umbrella
I'll shield the rain for ya
Drop Drop drip-drip shed a tear
Cause I'm right here and I'm a lick it off
Tock Tock tick-tick the clock goes
Unbutton your clothes and I'm a get em off
Get it off real quick Get it off real quick
Ludacris let me make it up to ya
Every time we hug we kiss we touch
Makes me wanna make love to ya

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm keepin' it raw, illegal like Malik and Jamal
Cause I don't believe in the law, like I'm Steven Seagal
Flippin' off the police while I'm leapin' a wall
Take some Tylenol, then fall asleep in a mall
I got ya little son, you'll be receivin' a call
You lucky this little punks still breathin' at all
Fuck the world, this how I get even at y'all
Pop shit, get rolled up and leave in a ball
I hit you in your mouth and sink ya teeth in ya jaws
You won't be able to eat shit, not even a malt
This lethal assault, is givin' you a reason to stall
I'm cockin' this deuce deuce and I'm squeezin' it off
At the first burp, fart sniffle a sneeze and a cough
Get your arm chewed off like you was teasin' a dog
I'm cold enough and hot enough to freeze and unthaw
I'll kick my girl out, in 10 degrees in her bra
You faggots turn yellow like the trees in the fall
I'm shittin' on rappers, (Where's Shady?) he's in the stall
All that's left of your niece is a piece of her doll
And all that's left of her puppy is a leash and a paw

[Intro: Jay-Z]
There's a nigga right now somewhere
He at the table with a bowl of Apple Jacks
And he's reading the back of the cereal
And in between eating the Apple Jacks he's writing some shit
And he wants my spot
I'mma find him though, I'mma sign him..
I don't want no problems

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Like we always do at this time, Cole blowin' your mind
Hey dummy, this no accident, all of this was designed
T—t—t—took my time, c—c—crept from behind
And I opened up your blinds, rise and shine, Cole World
Same nigga used to drive around with yo girl
In my mama's Civic, now I'm out here tryna get it
I ain't like you lame ass niggas, boy I spit it how I live it
So when you see me in the streets, man I ain't gotta mimic
'Cause I ain't got an image to uphold, this real shit
I ain't got a gimmick, I just flow, the niggas went nuts for
The boy that set fire to the booth
In a game full of liars, it turns out that I'm the truth
Some say that rap's alive, it turns out that I'm the proof
'Cause the ones y'all thought would save the day can't even tie my boots
The ones y'all thought could hang with me can't even tie my noose
Let these words be my bullets, nigga, I don't rhyme, I shoot, bang!

[Chorus]
Before I wake, uh
I pray to the Lord, uh, my soul to take, uh
My soul to take, uh, my soul take, uh
My soul to take

[Verse 2]
Lord I been dreamin' bout the paper, get rich 'fore I see my life taper
Hope my mama get to see Jamaica before she meet her maker
I hoop was never good enough to ever be a Laker
But these words I record got me ballin', Jordan
More than a rapper, this a natural disaster
Boy, I'm meaner than Katrina mixed with Gina, "Shut up, Cole!"
This is for my niggas back home, homes, what up, bo?
This is for the bitches that played me, what up, ho?
Nah, I ain't mad, it's sad, you went from bad to real bad
Two kids that don't even know their real dad
Real sad, baby girl I wish you still had it
Then maybe you could get a taste of livin' Villematic
Is Cole still at it? Y'all be talkin' about the same shit
That's how I feel about it, mama was a real addict
That's why I don't respect that lyin' ass white shit you talkin'
Cole's planning funerals, you might fit the coffin

[Chorus]
Before I wake, uh
I pray to the Lord, uh, my soul to take, uh
My soul to take, uh, my soul take, uh
My soul to take, hey

[Verse 3]
Uh
Get on your job lil mane, this ain't Saturday
We in two different lanes, you can't navigate
We in two different games, you playin' patty cake
Brother you're lame, you're Shane Battier
You out of shape, my mind run a mile a minute
The sky's the limit, I'm so high, I'm divin' in it
My rides is tinted, my knob's gettin' slobbed up in it
She hollerin' God, man you would've thought that God was in it
But it's just a nigga God invented
The best out, foolish pride'll make you not admit it
But if this shit ain't fire nigga, why you noddin' with it?
The hate in your blood can't stop your soul from vibin' with it
Now you all conflicted cause my flows is wicked
And my hoes is thicker and all of yours is pickin' me
Cause they know a star when they see a star, nigga
Ain't even got to fuck him to know he a raw nigga
I got her in my bedroom, but cheer up, nigga
You saved so many hoes, you a hero, nigga!
Medal of honor, I'm feelin' on top like Pac
When he slept with Madonna, hey, this is death before dishonor
Get arrested and forget to tell my mama
She got enough to stress about, my niggas gonna get me out
Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors
No criminal record but I'm makin' criminal records
Isn't it ironic? Isn't it iconic?
Jacket so expensive you wouldn't even try on it
But it fit me perfect, I purchase it if I want it
The city on my shoulder, so no girl, you can't cry on it
When you make a list of the greatest aye, am I on it?
Maybe not yet but bitch I got the clock set
It goes tick-tock, game on lock
Son gon' shine but the reign won't stop, oh no

[Outro]
If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take
My soul to take, my soul to take

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Look, I just shed tears homie and no I ain't too proud to admit it
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
When I say a minute I mean years man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam
'Cause as I left 'em I reflected on my younger days
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, ‘cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it 'cause I ain't know no better
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of letting my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame ‘cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowing through our veins is the same
My mama left you and it may be that anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
On why you only called monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury
Maybe I should be telling you “fuck you” ‘cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help but...

[Chorus 1]
Break down
I break down
Can't help but break down
I break down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit, man
It's fucking with her body, now she sick, damn
I wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?
Quicksand is what this life feel like
That shit these rappers kick is nothing like real life
You made a milli off of serving hard white? Yeah right
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shooting niggas
I swear to God, wish I could bulletproof my niggas
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruiting niggas
We trying to stand tall when it get too crucial niggas

[Chorus 2]
Break down, we break down
We break down, we break down
Break the break down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, he's serving time, locked down
And she don't want nobody to know
His daughter 25 pounds
By the time he get out, she gon' be 4
Now will his girl stay down?
Ain't no doubt she love him, yeah that's for sure
But temptation stays round
And if she strayed, how could he ever know? Never know
And so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freaking, but them niggas holla, but she never speakin'
But tonight I see the devil creeping
'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in seven seasons
Damn! She doin the best that she can
Her mama tellin' her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinkin' tonight
Maybe she's right, but please

[Chorus 3]
Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Please
Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Don't break down
Yeah, don't break down
Don't break down
Don't break down
Uh, break the break down...

[Outro]
Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down...

[Skylar Grey]

It’s so loud Inside my head
With words that I should have said!
As I drown in my regrets
I can’t take back the words I never said
I can’t take back the words I never said

[Verse 1:Lupe Fiasco, Rilo]

(I really think the war on terror is a bunch of bullshit)
That’s right Lupe people that don’t think that they’re just foolish
It don’t matter if you’re black white Christian maybe jewish
I’m here to do something to your mind you think that school did
Nah. They’re just there to keep you
Cause in the future they might creep up on you and say they need you
For reasons thats so dark inside its not exactly see through
Freedom is my calling card and I’m speaking for the people
Yeah
I may be speaking bout the same thing
Segregation makes the nation hostile where do you hang
In the mist of the war smoke or in the lies like your pope
The worlds unfair cause everybody's lazy
Everybody's on there ass talking bout maybe
Well maybe if you act on facts there may be crazy aftermaths
If you're looking for the answers I’m the teacher for you after class
Think about the words that I say and don’t believe what the media plays
Stop thinking in radio waves
The future could be saved if you listen to your brain
And don’t be know as just the same

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco, Rilo]

(Now we can say it's not our fault, if we never heard it)
But think about the situation, is it really worth it?
You’re thinking bout the better, while everything is worsened
You’re thinking bout the change that you’re never really earning
Listen to the cries at night the souls of people burning
Don’t worry bout letting out truth even if the gov is at your door
We could be resting in the lead just put the message on receive
And don’t believe the fucking message on the teeeve
We take a step an then we leave which is why the gov is on your beef
You think that things are true cause you hear them from your peers
But did you know the cure for cancer been here many years?
Doubt you do cause doctors tell you that were almost there
Now tell me some thing does that even sound a little fair?
You pay your taxes and you think there’s no more loans to pay
Little did you know
(They can take your home away)

[Final Verse]

(I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence)
We think that things are hard when we never even tried it
(We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth)
I’m only here to help you through I hope that I’m not failing you
We gotta make them scared of you and make it so they can't refuse
(Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few
My screams is finally getting free, my thoughts is finally yelling through)

[Verse 1]
I guess it felt a little bit better when we were still arguing about it
Cause in the words I could still hear love
Somebody still cared
And I would rather sleep on the sofa as long as you're still in our bed
At least I'm sure that you're at home and you ever left me yeah

[Hook]
You said you know my heart is good
But you'd hate me if you could
If I would allow you to you would
You could, you should but don't

[Chorus]
Try to leave me
Try to stay
Giving up
Is harder baby
Don't try don't try
Don't try to leave girl
Try to stay
Try, try

[Verse 2]
It's breaking my heart to see you there
Sickening I hate standing at that station
It's a picture that I don't wanna frame
Tears in your eyes
Luggage at your side

[Hook x2]
You said you know my heart is good
But you'd hate me if you could
If I would allow you to you would
You could, you should but don't
You said you know my heart is good
But you'd hate me if you could
If I would allow you to you would
You could, you should but don't

[Verse 3]
You ain't gotta work too hard
Tryna break my heart
But don't try, don't try, don't try
You ain't gotta work too hard
Trying to move on ohh oh
Try to stay
Try to think

[Chorus]
Don't try to leave me
Try to stay
Giving up
Is harder baby
Don't try don't try
Don't try to leave girl
Try to stay
Try
Try, try
Just try

Caught a couple cases, went to jail, but I ain't going back—
Free Tip!
It's only fair to warn
I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella to Mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar
With your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your vein feeding you liquid Darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To Receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants
And given a less than 20 percent chance of living
Have a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in Grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you
While you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired an arson to set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment

[Intro]
I am go-going home
I am go-going home

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yea, Ice Cream hoodie, Bathing Ape tennis shoes
No time for pictures, no time for interviews
I'm gon' get the money, snowstorm or sunny
Try me and I'm coming out my coat arm with somethin'
Note on the table, pay me or they go
You can't get the cash then pay me in yayo
Save me the drama don't go run and snitch
If that's your mama then I'll murk you right in front of that bitch
Im a Young Money, Cash Money, Universal soldier
Watch out Ms. Sylvia, I'm kinda feelin' ya, ha
I'm a headache, but they love the pain
I ask a bitch her name and tell her go board the plane
I'm so sure I know more, I'm so more than Wayne
I know whores that know whores that's always with some more whores
You owe whores, I show whores, I grow whores
I know what's at the store cause I go more, I go forth and so forth
Mami say she so bored with old boy, uh oh
I leave that pussy so sore, that's right no doze
Bitch get lost in the current how the dough flows
Niggas call Maybachs lo-lo's
Nigga got the Glock in a choke hold, I won't fold
To the cops, to the po-po's, ya'll hoes
Shout to my stompin' ground, Hollygrove
Fuck with them New Orleans niggas, funeral
Uptown, Uptown's where I rose
Yea, welcome to the real outdoors and of course
That chopper that I tote will split 'em like a divorce
Then the spiritual force, take 'em way up North
They say the end is comin', I'mma stay up for it
I'mma chase that money, you can wait up for it
I'm a kick to the snare, I'm a boom to the bass
What more can I say? I can't feel my face

[Verse 2:Juelz]
Deal up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind
I'm a dealer, dealer, I bring it back all the time
That coke, that hard, that crack, oh God
You get caught, you can't give back no charge
Nigga mouth slow-leakin', air him out, no charge
That's free, no prod, that's "G code" ya'll
So, no more slow-leakin, now he just got a flat
Flatline laid on his back flat, halftime
In the crib playin EA sports
They in the streets till the D.A. see they corpse
Plus the chickies know I stay fresh till my tippy toes
Hit the sneaker store and say two words "gimme those" (gimme)
Gimme those (those) Gimme those (those)
Matter fact gimme those whole three rows
I hit the Saks like gimme that (that) gimme that (that)
Gimme that, matter fact gimme that rack
Cash laid, tab paid, I'm out
I'm off to the valet, where's my car? thank you
Who's better than me? You? Never! I abuse cheddar
Playboy, Hugh Hefner
The two next up my dick yes uhh
I buy a car just because I like the smell of new leather
I'm young, I'm fly, I'm black, I'm rich
I let my nuts sag, I drag my dick (ya dig?)
The whores know I let my balls sag also
Off they drawers go, I'm all in they torso (Oh)
She can't take the dick, I tell her put a sock in it, bitch take the dick
Stroke, stroke see if she can take the dick
Now see if she can take the brick, you on the team now
Meanwhile, I'm in the kitchen doin' my daily routine
Scale a few things, cook a few O's, let my bitch bag 'em
Give it to my workers, let the strip have 'em
Fiends go berserk for the work I'm chefin'
Fiends go to work after the work you sell them
They know they gotta buy more, they head hurt they eyes sore
You're selling that cheap rock, sheet rock, dry wall
They don't want that, they come back for more
But they come back to me, they don't come back to y'all
I be chef, the chef you neva have to re-chef
When I chef, comprende? rewind, reset, replay, action
I be chef, the chef you never have to re-chef
When I chef, comprende? (Aye)

[Outro: Juelz Santana]
Yea, Santana, Dipset
Weezy F.Baby, Cash Money
I can't feel my face, nope I can't feel my face Aye!
"I just wanna grip yo body" (Go Head)

It's B.o.B! (HaHa)

[Verse 1]

Well gone and grip it
I get that thing wet like I'm bout to get the dishes
I've got positions but you must be physically conditioned (yea)
And how far I bend you all depends on your fitness (ooo)
But to be specific, I get things moist, call me Spongebob
If I use my tongue she'll be like, "Well done Bob." (uh huh)
I'll let it rip till she like, "Man I'm done Bob" (Aww)
Are we finished? Uh?... Naww

[Hook]

Cause I want to grip your body and I like it when it's real real sloppy
She looked me in my eyes and she said
"I just wanna grip yo body" (Ha) "Oh"
"I just wanna grip yo body" (8x)

[Verse 2]

HaHa, Is that so?
Well we can make arrangements girl I'll take you back home
I've got a nice soft comfy mattress in my room
And don't you know I'll swoop you off your feet just like Broom (ooh)
If you a freak I'll go deep, until you count sheep like Little Boe Peep
And when you wake up from your sleep, I promise
You gone be like Bob got the Deep (Yea)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

It's B.o.B!
Lookin at your thighs off rip
I can tell that your love muscle got a real nice strong (Grip)
I ain't playin, If you really bout maybe we can make plans
And I can be your man, while you feelin on my (body)
So keep on doin what you doin with your (body body)
Here's a more accurate description
I'll be your pole, you pretend that you strippin

[Hook]

Like a bird, like a plane, this body-ody insane
This body-ody insane so jump, jump, jump, jump

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Now I'm gon' take it to the roof
Everybody with me got they own parachute
You ain't scared of heights when you sippin' on Goose
Party all night like I'm flyin' JetBlue
You ain't never seen nobody get this loose
Shawty actin' naughty with her body, what it do?
Jump to this man, bump to this man
Stomp to this man, crunk to this man, got another hit, man
Hold up, I wanna go up, don't wanna throw up
My clique pour up, and every bad chick know us
Dance, the boy got us all feelin' high
Nasty, shawty, I'm a astronaut
High rollin', baby like I'm chokin' on pot
Super Bowl pimp Goodyear on tire
Could I be a bird? I gotta be fly
Butterfly and spur, and I got a couple words

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
When I say jump, you say how high
I ain't never seen nobody-ody get so high
Like a bird, like a plane, this body-ody insane
This body-ody insane so jump, jump, jump, jump
When I say jump, you say how high
I ain't never seen nobody-ody get so high
Like a bird, like a plane, this body-ody insane
This body-ody insane so jump, jump, jump, jump

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
When I run up in the club, jump in, then I gotta be there
Check it out, shawty like Nike Air
Up, up and away, take it off like mere
NBA ballin', I don't care
Now what do you do when you see you
A shawty and she make it bounce in the room?
Hey, girl, come on, baby, you a fine sexy lady
Can I get on your hot air balloon?
Sky high, still clubbin' like I'm part of the mile high
Ears poppin', Bubbalicious, help me get right
Keep poppin' in position after midnight
Moese? Fried chickens up in NY
Jigga what? Don't it feel good?
Houston, we gonna jump ship, all aboard
Come around me, and we'll parlay, we're throwed
Cali is jumpin', hit the switch on the 64

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
When I say jump, you say how high
I ain't never seen nobody-ody get so high
Like a bird, like a plane, this body-ody insane
This body-ody insane so jump, jump, jump, jump

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
Come on and jump, jump, jump
Come on and jump, jump, jump
Come on and jump, jump, jump
(All my ladies) Get down, get down, get down

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]

[Outro: Flo Rida]
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg]
I was walking through the city streets
And a man walks up to me and hands me the latest energy drink
"Run faster, jump higher"
Man, I'm not gonna let you poison me

[Chorus 1: Andy Samberg]
I threw it on the ground
You must think I'm a joke
I ain't gonna be part of your system, man!
Pump that garbage in another man's veins

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg]
I go to my favorite hotdog stand
And the dude says, "You come here all the time. Here's one for free."
I said "Man, what I look like? A charity case?"
I took it...

[Chorus 2: Andy Samberg]
And threw it on the ground
I don't need your handouts
I'm an adult! Please!
You can't buy me, hot dog man

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg]
At the farmers market with my so-called "girlfriend"
She hands me her cell phone—says it's my dad
Man, this ain't my dad!
This is a cell phone

[Chorus 3: Andy Samberg]
I threw it on the ground
What you think, I'm stupid?
I'm not a part of your system
My dad's not a phone! Duh!

[Verse 4: Andy Samberg]
Some poser hands me cake at a birthday party
What you want me to do with this? Eat it?

[Chorus 4: Andy Samberg]
Happy birthday to the ground!
I threw the rest of the cake, too
Welcome to the real world, jackass!

[Bridge: Andy Samberg]
So many things to throw on the ground
Like this, and this, and that, and even this
I'm an adult!

[Verse 5: Andy Samberg]
Two Hollywood phonies try to give me their autograph

[Chorus 5: Andy Samberg]
Ground!
Nobody wants your autograph!
Phonies!

[Verse 6: Andy Samberg]
Then, the two phonies got up
Turned out they had a taser
And they tased me in the butthole
Fell to the ground, the phonies didn't let up
Tasin' on my butthole over and over
I was screaming and squirming
My butthole was on fire

[Outro: Andy Samberg]
The moral of the story is
You can't trust the system
Man!

[Chorus]
Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well
My Michelle
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

[Verse 1]
I love you, I love you, I love you
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand

[Chorus]
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble

Oh, what you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean
I love you

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
I want you, I want you, I want you
I think you know by now
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do I'm telling you so you'll understand

[Chorus]
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

[Outro]
And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
My Michelle

Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
You see me babe? You see me babe?
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA

[Verse 1]
I'm on my ish, call it
I watch these haters take they shots like they were alcoholics
"What is he wearing? Somebody jack that fool's steeze"
If I'm a faggot, spell it right, I got way more than two G's
Nigga I'm amazing, I'm a phenom
I'm assassin, I'ma kill y'all
I'ma say ma-ma-sa, ma-ma-ma, coo-sa
And this shit's closed now cause I ball too hard
And I'm cumming on her face, have I gone too far?
I don't know, who cares, I don't love that broad
And it's funny how these fake niggas always act hard
I'm a black star in a black car with a black card
They wanna knock me out
They tryin', nigga
Realest motherfucker in the game like Tron, nigga
Forget these white girls
I need some variation
Especially if she very Asian
She got an ugly friend? Roll solo
Can I stay at your place? No hobo
Not my fault, man, these ladies love me
She's an overachiever 'cause all she do is succeed

[Chorus]
I'm on my ballin' each and every day
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
You see me, babe? You see me babe?
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA

[Verse 2]
Send me naked pics, I’m gon' Tumbl' that
I’m the shit, been the shit, fuck a humble brag
Yeah we pushin’ that, and her pussycat
I got swag out my ass so I’m usin’ that
Texting with Olivia Munn, hopefully, she’ll give me some
Or some Rosie Jones, man
Hoes is hoes is hoes, man
Racks on racks on racks, man
All I got is tracks, man
Sorry for my accent, but I’ve been practicin’
Everywhere ya go niggas blastin’ that Gambino
Niggas be like, "You ain't know?"
Bitches be like, "You ain't know?"
Met this fly Latino
Hope that she eighteen though
If she not, I’ll say that I got deep throat in Heath-row

[Chorus]
I'm on my ballin' each and every day
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
You see me, babe? You see me babe?
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA

[Verse 3]
Told me I was shit, but that shit couldn't stop me
Nigga still hungry, black Kobayashi
When I talk about you I hear a "Who?" like Horton
I was born for this shit, you a rappin' abortion
Can we hear the N-word one day and not get upset?
Can we try something new and not be suspect?
I don’t really know, we fucked up bad
You don’t wanna see my dudes when they get mad
I got a bunch of jackanapes at the back of me
That’ll lacerate anyone in the back of a matinee
And laugh while they masturbatin' all over your beaten body
Sick Boi forever, that Suburban Illuminati
Nah nigga, yeah, we never stop
No period like menopause
No period like, "Oh shit! Am I the only one you sleepin' with?"
"Am I the only one you sleepin' with?"

[Verse 1]
I’m knocking on your door, and it's cold, yes it's cold
But I brought your favorite flowers, teddy bear and a card
Cause I know that loving me is a chore, it’s a chore
But I won’t stop loving you that’s for sure, that’s for sure

[Hook]
You could open your window baby
And ask me to go away
But there’s no way, no how I’ll stop loving you
It’s non-stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
It won’t stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
This love is gonna keep going, it ain’t gonna slow
It’s non stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
I sat down in my car, not to leave, just to park
I’m still not losing hope, though the sky's getting dark
I wish you’d just peak out the blinds to my heart
But you turned your bedroom light on
Well at least that’s a start

[Hook]
You could open your window baby
And ask me to go away
But there’s no way, no how I’ll stop loving you
It’s non-stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
It won’t stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
This love is gonna keep going, it ain’t gonna slow
It’s non stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Bridge]
Said I’m sorry, oh baby
But the love won’t stop, no no, nah uh
Take me back, oh love, Take me back
Cause the love will keep flowing on
The love will keep flowing on

[Intro]
Initiate radar
Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh ooh-ooh
Da do da do da do

Your eyes say it all... all
They're fixed upon an object of desire you can't control
No (No), but gravity compels you to ignite and explode
Ooh (Ooh)
'Til our time and space combine, you'll fantasize the unknown
Ohhhh
Girl, it's taking off the ground
You know how I put it down
Have you seeing stars, baby

[Chorus]
This is the big bang, so unpredictable
Sex, love and drama, who's in control
Mars vs. Venus, yeah
(But when the worlds collide)
This is the big bang, step into the ring of fire
Sex, love and drama, who can tame desire
Mars vs. Venus

[Verse 2]
Seduce and analyze, yeah
Objective is to conquer deep in kind... make paradise
Girl, it's taking off the ground
You know how I put it down
Have you seeing stars, ooh

[Chorus]
This is the big bang, so unpredictable
Sex, love and drama, who's in control (Ooh, ooh)
Mars vs. Venus (Ooh, Mars vs. Venus, Mars vs. Venus)
(But when the worlds collide)
This is the big bang (yeah), step into the ring of fire (Fire, yeah)
Sex, love and drama, who can tame desire
(Know that I'm winning)
Mars vs. Venus (Oh I'm gonna do it, baby, haha)
This is the big bang, so unpredictable (Got a love thing, no)
Sex, love and drama, who's in control
Mars vs. Venus (Mars vs. Venus)
(But when the worlds collide)
This is the big bang, step into the ring of fire
Sex, love and drama, who can tame desire
Mars vs. Venus

[Bridge]
Oh, pitch black, lost amidst the galaxy between the sheets
Want that only you and I generate when we collide
Hold that, don't make my emotions peak
If I let go, then I'll be weak
Your control is my defeat, I repeat
Never, never, never, never will I give up
No, no, no no no
(I ain't giving up, no, ooh)

[Chorus]
This is the big bang, so unpredictable
Sex, love and drama (so unpredictable), who's in control
Mars vs. Venus (Mars vs. Venus)
(But when the worlds collide)
This is the big bang, step into the ring of fire (She on fire)
Sex, love and drama, who can tame desire
Mars vs. Venus (Yeah yeah, yea-yeah, ooh)
This is the big bang, so unpredictable (This ain't a love thing, nooo)
Sex, love and drama, who's in control
Mars vs. Venus (Mars vs. Venus, if you wanna feel it)
(But when the worlds collide)
This is the big bang (Ooh, catch it in orbit), step into the ring of fire
Sex, love and drama (Ooh), who can tame desire
Mars vs. Venus

[Outro]
(But when the worlds collide, who, will, win?)
I don't know if I'll win
But I know that I wanna do it again, yeah
(Mars vs. Venus)
I don't know if I'll win
(But when the worlds collide, who, will, win?)
But I know that I wanna do it again, yeah
I don't know if I'll win (Worlds collide)
But I know that I wanna do it again, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-yeah, love and desire)
I don't know if I'll ever win (Desire)
Mars vs. Venus

[Intro]
You're a hard man to reach, Willie Dynamite
I wanna rap
Go right ahead

[Verse 1]
The girls ask me for that Willie D, that's how I know they feelin' me
It's simple, see, the pimpin' be what got these bitches clipped to me
You may be at the game, I guarantee you we in different seats
I seen you in the nosebleeds, but where I'm at, that isn't cheap
In the Benz, in a Jeep, make a million in a week
Takin' off her clothes 'fore I begin to speak like, "Gimme cheeks"
Been to London, been to France, go there if you get the chance
Been to Amsterdam, hit the club, hell no, I didn't dance
Rolled around a little, smoked the weed, seen the red lights
Ain't fuck a prostitute but the head nice, get right
From here on to the next life, relax and sip that Red Stripe
Way I spend this money, you would think I had a ex-wife
Bitches love the lead pipe, the 'Burgh, word to Ken Rice
New place every day, what I would give to just have 10 nights
Yeah, right, 'bout to drop an album, hope to blow your mind
Tryna reach a level where no music is put over mine

[Chorus]
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
What does it mean to keep your pimp hand strong?
Live it up 'cause you don't live that long
Or am I wrong?
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
What does it mean to keep your pimp hand strong?
Live it up 'cause you don't live that long (How about another one?)
Or am I wrong?

[Verse 2]
Hey
It's young Macintosh, tell you 'bout that sabotage
Travelin' through Germany, word to David Hasselhoff
Back up off me, kill 'em softly, bitches like to fuck 'em doggy
Prolly off some molly, got me turnin' into polygons
On and on, DJ's puttin' on my song
People say I talk too long, killin' every single track the God is on
They cheerin' with their pom-poms, buyin' what I got on
Straight gold, find me fuckin' Silver with my Long John
Tom Tom, direct me to that money please
Square sponge, fuckin' dumb, yeah, your grades is under C
And I know, "In God we trust," but how much do they trust in me?
Enough to be a fuckin' beast on beats, yeah
Shit is so disgustingly amazin', bitches out the playpen
You fuck your hand, askin', "How much money can I fit into this rubberband?"
Hustlin', throw your ass right inside a rubbish can
Excuse my French, that's just how I'd talk if I was Russell Brand
Know that I'm the fuckin' man, play my shit for three days
"All I make is hits, call me T-Pain!"
Sicker than if she gave me AIDS, plus some teeth decay
Then she stole my condom, try to auction it on eBay
Talk a little shit, man, probably thought he dissed me
Bitch, please, I just ate out Monica Lewinsky
Yeah, I taught her 'bout some slaughter, had her cryin' 'bout her father
Then I busted in her face while she told me, "It's an honor"
Bob O'Connor, we just politickin', finger-lickin' on my chicken
Got a way with words, words, words, word to Charles Dickens
I wrote this on the shitter usin' toilet paper
Then put your head inside the waters, enjoy the flavor, heh

[Interlude]
Yeah, bitch!
Nah, Jerm, don't cut me off, man!
Fuck you!
Ha-ha

[Chorus]
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
What does it mean to keep your pimp hand strong?
Live it up 'cause you don't live that long
Or am I wrong?
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
What does it mean to keep your pimp hand strong?
Live it up 'cause you don't live that long
Or am I wrong?

[Outro]
Seven women in the palm of his hand
Willie D (Willie D)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, her mind is on a different level
Plus the teachers couldn't reach her, always been a rebel
Hit the club, watch out boy, you dancin' with the devil
She fuck, she suck, she swallow, man, it's like a triple double
Can see it in your eyes, you look for trouble
Just because they fuck ya girl don't mean them niggas love ya

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Don't preach to me nigga, hold up
Is that a bottle on your table, well if so then pour it up"
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"
She said, "Daddy, what you think?", "Little girl, you're growin' up
Growin up"
Hey, take a couple of shots and it's on
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy what you think?" "little girl, you're growin' up, growin' up"
Hey, listen baby girl they playin' your song

[Chorus]
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Can I get a witness, this is Sade mixed with Shawty Lo
Ey, Jezebel, why you be up in every party for?
You lost to lookin' for a savior, I ain't Mario
I got no cape, but I can't wait to give you cardio
Work you out, you call me daddy, ain't my daughter though
Make me wonder where your father go?

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Don't analyze me, nigga, hold up
Is that green on your table? Well if so, then roll it up
I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy, what you think?" "Little girl you growin' up, growin' up"
Hey, and blow a couple sacks and she gone
Said, "I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said, "Daddy what you think?" "Little girl you growin' up"
Hey, listen, baby girl, they playin' your song

[Chorus]
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
I wanna smoke the very best
Like no one ever does
To roll it is my real test
To smoke 'em is my cause
I will travel across the land
Smoking all the strains
Tried to get all the THC
All up in my brain

Smokemon! Gotta smoke 'em
It's you and weed, you know it's my destiny
Smokemon! Oh, you're my best friend
In a world that's full with feds
Smokemon! Gotta smoke 'em, our hearts so true
Smoking and you'll roll too
You smoke me out, and I'll smoke you
Smokemon gotta smoke 'em all, gotta smoke 'em all

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Live from the city of jealous niggas and bourgie-ass bitches
Where you ain't gettin' love 'less you swimmin' that riches
Check who weather the heat and still standin' in the kitchen
Caught all attention, just consider this my premonition
Back when niggas was stunting, I would just stand there and listen
Made a switch in my position, now look who you fend to mention
Approach with such a position, just lookin' like lounge mode
Put yourself in my shoes and you get room like clown toes
Since I been winnin' it's been daps and pounds, yo
And everybody wanna come creepin' around so
I play it like a veteran, stayin' in my element
Haters are irrelevant, I'm better than I've ever been
Wolf Gang in every fuckin' facet that I represent
Loiter at the door to success until they let us in
Bitch, I'm in the booth mixin' up the medicine
Make a mess of the track, send litter life lettermans
If I left, then I'm back, but I don't think that I ever did
Was on the road, doin' shows, I was gettin' gella grip
Pimp hand strong on these hoes, I ain't never slipped
I be out in every fuckin' city that you never in

[Interlude: Domo Genesis]
Holdin' mine down, I won't be back until I'm very rich

[Verse 2: Tyler the Creator]
I'm from the city of niggas that get grizz-ills and bitties
With really shitty cosmetically hit titties
It's, dope is what I been spark, second then my pen start
Bringin' back that crack shit like Amy Wine's skidmarks
Now sit it in a pamper, Yonk went viral
Price up a 'Preme camper, now I got a buncha
White bitches, tour bus lookin' like a fuckin' hamper
Dick went postal now my passport is stamped up
See if white kids in fuckin' Europe understand him
Radical's the anthem, turn the fuckin' amps up
Hot shit, it's mosh pits, stage dive, crowd surf
Lookin' like I'm throwin fuckin' tantrums
Thanks to label crackers now I'm ballin' like it's cancer
Cause being broke is uncool, buddy, get your aunt fucked, Golf Wang
(Goblin was a disappointment) Yeah, right
Shit dropped, I bought a house that night
While you was at home leavin' comments tryna pay ya bill
I was on tour makin' some grands, findin' time to kill
Wakin' up in different countries sayin' "Yo, this is real?"
Yes it is, awesome, got another fuckin' check again
Crossin' that mainstream border man I am such a Mexican
Now my exes be textin' me up to give me neck again
But I'm too fuckin' busy with the rap game, pregnant
Evident, that I need my muthafuckin' medicine
But I don't spend all my fuckin' money on a therapist
Ever since, my fuckin'.. I don't wanna talk about it
No, leave me alone, I don't wanna talk about it, it's too personal

[Chorus]
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
When this shit end, man it's gon' get ugly
Real real ugly, your grandmama love me
And your mama love me, little sister hugs me
Even got a few homegirls that wanna fuck me, uh
Soon as this shit end, forget about it
You been stayin' in my crib, you gotta get up out it
'Cause if you layin' in my bed, let's admit about it
One time fuckin' and we no longer upset about it
'Cause when this shit ends it's either all or nothin'
I thought you loved me, how the hell you gon' call ya cousin?
You know the diesel ass, half slow, evil ass
Nigga in that Honda showin' up with that drama
On my mama, we been through it all
From the goods to the bads, rise to the fall
You done seen me at my best, seen me at my worst
So when this shit ends, know it's gon' hurt
You can't say we didn't try though, huh

[Chorus]
I tried, you tried, we tried (You can't say we didn't try, hey)
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try)
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
They say we won't last
I know you suspicious, but you don't ask
And I don't tell, that's where we both fell
A good nigga gone bad
Good chick, alone, mad as fuck, she done had enough
I be out here tryna raise my status up
But success bring bitches, and they bad as fuck
Ass fat as fuck, with a little ol' waist
I ain't want the whole meal, just a little ol' taste
Should have looked both ways 'fore I crossed you
I guess I never thought I could've ever lost you
Now I'm out stuntin' with this bitch, who ain't about nothin'
While some nigga learnin' all the shit I taught you
Damn, guess you deserve that, a new start
But deep down you know we grew apart
Long before I broke your heart
If I lost your respect, I'm just hopin' you don't look at me as you somethin' you regret
Can't say we didn't try though

[Chorus]
I tried, you tried, we tried (Can't say we didn't try)
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try tho, can't say we didn't try, hey)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I got your message I been meanin' to respond, know it's been a while
Apologies, I ain't been around
I wanna kick it, but I know that shit is different now
And times have changed
Let me know if I'm out of bounds, are the lines the same?
I mean ya, lookin' good, yeah you still got it
Been reminiscin' and I'm not sure how I feel 'bout it
Now we can say that all good things come to an end
But we know each other way too well to pretend
We went from friends to somethin' much more
To breakin' up to makin' up and fuckin' once more
Second chances, we gave enough
'Til finally, we gave it up
But some days I be wakin' up and wantin' one more
But what for? Maybe it's just the weather
We break each others heart's, so maybe it's for the better
Holler whenever, 'cause you always got a friend in me
And nothin' lasts forever, least we got these memories
You can't say we didn't try though

[Chorus]
I tried, you tried, we tried (Can't say we didn't try, hey)
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
I tried, you tried, we tried (Can't say we didn't try though)
(Can't say we didn't try, hey)
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever

[Verse 1: Honey Cocaine]
Bitch, I’m Honey Cocaine bout to bring in some pain

[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I been looking under rocks and breaking locks
Just tryna find ya

5 steps behind ya
Tell them other girls, they can hit the exit, check please
'Cause I finally found the girl of my dreams
Much more than a Grammy award
That's how much you mean to me

[Chorus]
You can be my it girl, baby, you the shit, girl
Loving you could be a crime
Crazy how we fit, girl, this is it, girl
Give me 25 to life
I just wanna rock, all night long
And put you in the middle of my spotlight
You could be my it, girl, you're my biggest hit, girl
Let me play it loud, let me play it loud like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud, let me play it loud like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud

[Verse 2]
You can't help but turn them heads, knocking 'em dead
Dropping like flies around you
If I get your body close, not letting go
Hoping you're about to
Tell them other guys they can lose your number, you're done
They don't get another shot 'cause you're love drunk
Like a TV show playing reruns
Every chance I get, I'ma turn you on

[Chorus]
You can be my it girl, baby, you the shit, girl
Loving you could be a crime
Crazy how we fit, girl, this is it, girl
Give me 25 to life (hey)
I just wanna rock, all night long
And put you in the middle of my spotlight (hey, yeah)
You could be my it, girl, you're my biggest hit, girl
Let me play it loud, let me play it loud like (hey, yeah)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh, yeah)
Let me play it loud, let me play it loud like

[Bridge]
Can't seem to stop you from running, running
Through my, through my mind, mind
Just keep it coming, coming
'Til I make you mine, mine
You've got that something, something, I wanna be with, girl
You're my greatest hit, girl, just say this is it, girl
Hey, baby
Don't you know you're my it, girl?

[Chorus]
You can be my it girl, baby, you the shit, girl (ooh, woo)

Everybody in the crowd let me hear you singing like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
This is it, girl

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that’s flattering but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y’all need to practice that more
See my man Nate, ask me if I gained weight, I said nah
My pockets got fatter, that’s all
Money was an issue but now that that’s solved, I ball, I ball
Like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantel
Dawg my shows be off the handle
Take the proceeds, go to gamble, ha
Bet it all black, and pray I quadruple my salary
If I win maybe then I can pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealing with some real life shit
She be asking when, bitch, when I feel like it
Cole World, Cole life, Cole blooded
I be on my shit and look at all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club staring at me
How that feel? Very happy (very happy)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Cole World, Boy, check the degree’s
These lil niggas is trash go and get the Febreeze
That’s why I blew up on you sucka’s all thats left is debris
One soldier’s all that’s left is fatigues
Act like you know me boy, I’m Kobe
How the fuck you gon step in my league
Rapping bout bullshit, your message fatigue
Played out, phoney nigga probably only got arrested for weed
And out here talking that dime shit
Dom Perignon shit
Not gon cut it like some scissors on my lawn shit
Grown cause I own shit
This is what you won’t get
Game so cold, bring the blizzard to the Palms
I’m a wizard, I’m a don and I put this on my mom
I’m offended, I’m appalled
If y’all ain’t bowing
Claim you a monster but y’all ain't growling
Claim you a beast, why y’all ain't howling?
‘Bout as sweet as a jumper on the gay Ray Allen
I’m ’bout fucking hoes like Ray J wylin’
Killin’ niggas like K K K violence
I guess it’s why they pay homage
Momma I’mma be BIG and I put that on the late great Wallace
Christopher, check my temperature, nigga my integers..
Whatever man

[Beat Change]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Alone in my zone, tell me don’t it sound stunning
Been f-cked the world but she just now cummin’
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground runnin’
I ain't never been the one for fourth down puntin’
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I’m crown huntin’
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks
So I lock pick just to lock shit back
I want Money, Power, Respect since the Lox said that
Better stay up on your toes, this is not tic tac
Yet, I’m a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here
Ballin’ like a Laker you should pray for next year
Cause I’m repeating and I’m 3-peatin’
And I’m knee deep in the game its quick sand and I keep leakin’
The label heat seekin’, nigga ain't sign me, what the fuck was he thinkin’
They say I killed the game, that was only pre-season

[Break]
I’m heavy
I’m heavy
Man these niggas get exlusives
Hey, hey

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Man, I’m already hot, you can say I’m pre-heated
If money talks, mine telling your’s “be seated”
Cut my leg off I wouldn’t be defeated
Illest nigga in the game bitch and you can retweet it
Email the shit make sure you CC it
For these fuck niggas who don’t wanna believe it
I be in the airport damn near bare foot
Security hollin’ out, Cole we need it
Getting high as fuck and I don’t even be weeded
No point drinkin’ I can’t even be faded
Real recognize real like they related
You ain't no fucking G boy, your style G-Rated
Hatred is flattery I’m glad to be hated
Fuckin’ bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just happy he made it
My money was running late now, now it’s happy belated
I’m heavy, nigga I’m heavy

[Verse 1]
Now you've been bad, and it goes on and on and on
'Til you come home, babe, 'til you come home
You taste best, the poison I've learned to love is gone
I'm all alone, baby, I'm all alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
And then I give a little more, ooh baby, oh
Give a little more, ooh baby, oh

[Chorus]
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby, oh
Get a little more from you, baby

[Verse 2]
You were wrong for turning me on and on and on
And on and on
You make it so hard

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change (If it'll ever change)
And then I give a little more, ooh baby, oh
Give a little more, ooh baby, oh

[Chorus]
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby, oh
Get a little more from you, baby

[Bridge]
I have no defense
I know you're gonna get me in the end (Gonna get me in the end)
And I cannot pretend
I never wanna feel this way again, oh

[Chorus]
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love (Not falling in love)
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby, oh (Get a little more)
Get a little more from you, baby, ooh (Get a little more)
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love (Not falling in love)
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby, oh (Get a little more)
Get a little more from you, baby (Get a little more)
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Wake up in the morning check the mirror like I got it
Money, Power, Respect, Nigga what you know about it
Surrounding myself with niggas who only concern is profits
So if you ain't talkin' money then you speakin' off topic, Nigga stop it!
I been hot since Jordan was in gym socks
I'm Kobe with the fro or Ron Artest when he pissed off
I get off a travesty these niggas mad at me
Game in a sleeper and I ain't even had a damn release
My plan to be everything that you niggas demand to see
Smoking tree until I kick the can and leave, Damnit B
I got my mind right, these niggas scared of me
Chilling cause I know whats up ahead of me, Destiny

[Hook]
Sunlight could never shine
Like this love of yours and mine
The stars and the moon above
Could never outshine our love...
Shine... shine...shine,shine,shine
Baby, this love of yours


And mine is gonna shine

Shine shine

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
One for the money and two for the G's
But not really cause there ain't another nigga like me
I stunt, So I'm knowin' niggas don't like me
They know that livin' like me is so un-like-ly
I rock an ambush chain and a fuckin' white tee
And the adidas I got from that commercial with Mike G
It's lookin' real good, Ashley Sky
I'm bout to flex tweet, don't ask me why
Cool niggas ain't extinct, we the last alive
Winners circle small ya'll niggas maximize
The effortless approach of a mastermind
Cause you know it ain't swag if you had to try

[Hook]
Sunlight could never shine
Like this love of yours and mine
The stars and the moon above
Could never outshine our love...
Shine... shine...shine,shine,shine
Baby, this love of yours and mine is gonna shine shine shine
Please, no pity for a G
I got a son that I barely get to see
I see him for an hour, and then he got to leave
On top of that, I only get to see him once a week!
Yeah, right, lucky me..
Well fuck ? and whoever disagree
I learned a valuable lesson, indeed
But I'm just trying to be the best father I can be
Apparently I'm an unfit father
Cause all I know is dope and all I got is dirty dollars
But I'm selling dope to help my family get farther
Cause no 9 to 5 is gonna prevent us from starving
As I was saying, I don't get to see you like I want to
I just want to let you know I want to
If the court grant me visitation, I'm going to
But you're too young to understand what we going through..
And your mama low-down
She just doing everything to hurt me right now
Why? Cause I don't love her like I used to
So to get back at me, she knows she gotta use you
And I don't know what else to do
She don't understand that this siht will bruise you too
And now I gotta take a bitch to court
So either way, it's a lose-lose

[Hook - Cee Lo]
Bringing the love to my baby
Bringing the love to my son
Tell em ? baby
But it's not over, it's not done
I told your mama I don't love her
And made her ? now she gone
So I'mma be the bad one
But I just wanna see my son..

I tried talking to the bitch
But she keep using you as a bargaining chip
And I am not the one to be bargaining with
That makes me wanna go and put my paws on this bitch
I swear this shit ain't even right, bruh
I ain't even got the chance to change your fuckin diaper
This is what I get for going raw when I piped her
Thinking that I loved her when I shouldn't have even liked her
But I do not regret my child
Stupid bitch, I just wanna see my child!
Do what you may, but you will never make me bow
Fuck child support, bitch! Take me to trial
Why you want this shit? Cause I ain't reaching no vowels
Bitch move on me, and you ain't working out
So what it matter if I move the work out?
As long as i provide and put food in his mouth

[Hook - Cee Lo]

Now the fact I'm in school right now
In case the music don't work and I can put the work down
My mama say this shit sure to work out
All this bullshit I'm going through
To see my first child
See his first steps, see his first smile
Hear his first words, teach him how to count
But I guess I been counted out
Seeing as the bitch don't want me around
When I speak to him, he don't recognize the sound
The sound of my voice, so he just looks around
I know she enjoy it, so I suck it up and smile
But fuck this stupid bitch, I just wanna see my child!

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Fuck what niggas talking 'bout boy I'm on my grind
Pursuit of happiness so money on my mind
People say duty calls and if it's on my line
I get a two minute warning bitch you on my time
Heard it through that vine
That I ain't kicked it and that minute they was missing me
Hold the trap, had to give ‘em raps for their misery
Every snap I smile, the bitches make a GIF of me
I'm laughing out the bank on my way to the dispensary
Get my hair cut, my nigga Kenny do that shit for free
The amenities of living life like a fucking G
When will they understand that niggas can't fuck with me
And I don't need the throne just seat me in the lap of luxury
I'll be smoking grass till it's grass that I'm underneath
Chilling at the pad with a bad one for company
I make the haters mad with the cash I accompany
I know you think I'm spaz but this only what I've done for free

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Check my bank account and it was at like 53
Thats pretty solid for a young nigga born in '93
Never had problems pulling young chickens so she sticks to me
That is what often make my mind want to skip a beat
Stay focused you in the gray mode and
Just make more dope shit, you got to stay golden
As much I love to swim she got a gray ocean
And I can spice it up if I use 8 motions
Talking 'bout life's a bitch thats why I stay pokin'
And I'm all in her friend, thats who I lay low with
Ever since I could remember I've been winning, 18 and 0
Saw my self at the top and started grinding off the dreams and hopes
Went to buying expensive, getting here by expeditions yo
Forced me to believe all this shit I got ment for show
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
Young expressions with ambition, n' most importantly the vision
(Chorus)

Yeah, yeah
Yuh, jets nigga now where haven't we...
Bitches, I 'Taylor Gang' that
Yuah

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Yuaah
How fly, uh?
The backseat is for newborns
Homie, I'm grown
I'll hop in front and drive this bitch on my own
Out the driveway windows half raised
Bumpin' Ma$e or some Sade'
Chuckin' the deuces to my neighbors
Like them Houston players
Got the two door Caprice
Black and red, like a Sega Genesis
Password first pimpin' or you can't get into this hangar
Access denied, you can't fly you a lame
Spiderman tangled in a web of lies
Global travel, red eyes
Plan plots, strategize
Double XL, now I'm after The Source and the Vibe
Only magazines yet to recognize in 2009
Nigga worth it, he deserve it
He ain't perfect, but he workin' on that second album
Dropped the first one with Amalgam
Digital dollars, afford flights
Where the massages will be provided
By my down ass exotic dancing Italian goddess
The planes got it
That's why she's ridin' with the pilot
Find Spitta smoked out in the same crowd
Where Waldo was spotted
Orange rectangle boxes in my pockets
Niggas on a quest like Jonny and Hadji

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Haha, yeah
(jet set, now where haven't we been yet?)
How fly?
The mixtape it's officially done
This is it, right here
Haha, yeah, uh

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm back better than ever
No hiatus, just weed crushers
Rollers, and one and a half wide papers
Catch me and Spitta smokin' up
You got trees? Nigga, light it
I heard this is a weed friendly environment
Seen 'em at my shows front row, gettin' excited
They all smoke and memorize my lines
Say I'm the tightest
Know bitches who rep the gang hard as niggas who do the same
And don't support the bullshit they only do the planes
In every city we smokin' like a train
They heard I'm swingin' past now them bitches gettin' gas, octane
Not a name to compare 'em to
I can skydive, no parachute
With just a dope pair of shoes
Zig zags and hella tattoos
Put you in a mindstate
That this is my movie
Put you in it too
The bomb weed make it critical
Sit with the vampire in his interview

[Intro]

I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back

[Verse 1]
Tell them haters, call your army, bring your tanks
I'm a big boy with a big boy bank
Self-employed, independent, once you start, don't take no breaks
Work until I get it, I bet it's gon' take a second
But once I start up my engine, I'm gone, too fast to catch him
I'm Lennon mixed up with UGK, maybe try that purple drink
What I'm on is strong, yours weaker than seven days
You sweeter than crème brûlée, presidential head of state
Dopest mothafucka since before I hit the seventh grade
Elevate, Buddha shit, cooler than what coolest is
Slick without no lubricant, bullshit, you just full of it
Stupid bitch, keep on hatin', I'ma keep on doin' it
Spend a day as me, boy, you couldn't get the shoes to fit

[Chorus]
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back

[Verse 2]
They used to tell me I was fake, they would hate, now they on my dick
Most Dope is my family, have respect for my conglomerate
Rollie on my wrist, I ain't rich, but I'm still coppin' shit
Jerm is on the beat, he got that heat, hold up, drop it quick
And bring it back
I could change the world with just a single track
Underage table in the back, smokin', drinkin' yak
Pittsburgh, let me show the world just where my city at
On the map, illest city out, I guess that's just a fact
I'ma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball
After all, only get one life, so there's no time to stall
I'ma do it, stupid dudes with all exclusive shit to move with
Just a few kids tryna bullshit, still my boys I straight up grew with

[Chorus]
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back

Yeah, eh-hahaha
Oh, you already know what we gon' do
Eh-hahaha
Hey

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Well, if you guessin' it's me, you guessed correctly
I just stay with a stallion, you would swear I was an equestrian
And um, I'ma hit her with that pipe, call that Nancy Kerrigan
Stay on the greenest greens, call us vegetarians
You be on that minor league, but we smoke professionally
I do my job exceptionally, on point like a decimal is
The way I ride on the beat, man, I beat every street
It's done so effortlessly
Yeah, so these niggas can't sleep on me
There's no Inception in this

[Refrain: B.o.B]
Bitch, I'm top chef, you top ramen, I'm top shelf
No last call to the bartender, "What you got left?"
Pour it up, don't stop there, hold your cup, take a shot, yeah
All night we celebrate 'cause we everywhere and you not there, ha

[Chorus: B.o.B, Lil Wayne]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up all night
All you see is strange clouds (Strange clouds)
Strange clouds (Yeah)
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do) (Haha!)
And all we do is light it up all night (Yeah, yeah)

Kick back on that Glock, call that Jiu Jitsu
Hello world, I'm with a yellow girl, number two pencil
These rappers is washed up, spin cycle, rinse you
My nigga, all day, all night, half-pipe
I dive in that pussy, ya, I belly flop, I jack knife

I'm Decatur 'til I die (Yeah), yes, I rep that definitely
They say I'm a celebrity, what the fuck's a celebrity?
I guess I must invest in the proper form of protection
And I say it's a curse, but it's been mostly a blessin'
To a nigga from the hood, tryin' to aim for the top
I didn't even need no directions

[Refrain: B.o.B]
I just wake up and then I roll up the purp
But these niggas wake up on my dick
At least have some breakfast first (Hey)
Nigga, keep your nourishment first

[Chorus: B.o.B]

All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up all night
All you see is strange clouds (All you see is, all you see)

[Verse 1]
I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
I'm crying

[Verse 2]
Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long

[Chorus]
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen
I am the walrus, goo goo a'joob

[Verse 3]
Mister City p'liceman sitting, pretty little p'licemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying

[Verse 4]
Yellow-matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crab a locker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down

[Chorus]
I am the eggman, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo a'joob

[Bridge]
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan from standing in the English rain

[Chorus]
I am the egg man (Now good sir, what are you?)
They are the egg men (A poor man, made tame to fortune's blows)
I am the walrus, goo goo goo joob (Good pity)
G'goo goo g'joob

[Verse 5]
Expert, textpert, choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
(Ho ho ho, hee hee hee, ha ha ha)
See how they smile like pigs in a sty, see how they snied
I'm crying

[Verse 6]
Semolina pilchard
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

[Chorus]
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen

[Outro]
Umpa, umpa, stick it up your jumper
Everybody's got one, everybody's got one
“Villain, take my Purse
If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my Body
And give the Letters which thou findst about me
To Edmund Earl of Gloucester: seek him out upon the English Party
Oh, untimely death, death–”
“I know thee well, a serviceable Villain; as duteous to the Vices of thy Mistress as badness would desire”
“What, is he dead?”
“Sit you down, Father; rest you”

[Verse 1]
Recently it seem like everywhere we go
The drinks stay cold when we coolin', coolin'
And being broke starts to get a little old
My money had to get some fine tunin'
Tonight might be the night I make it
So let's live it up and don't regret it at all (No)
All these faces, different places
People hit me up but I'm forgettin' to call (Haha)
Get away to California when the weather gettin' colder
My honey's by the pool and umbrellas in mimosas
Chillin' at the beach house, loungin' on the sofa
Ridin' with a chauffeur, on my way to blow up, stoner
Roll up, fishin', champagne sippin'
Five-star chef stay cookin' in the kitchen (Haha)
But makin' only the good shit (What?)
See the way I'm living, they like "Oh my goodness"

[Chorus]
I tell 'em I'm fine (Hey, hey)
I ain't got a damn thing on my mind (Hey, hey)
And, baby, all we got is time (Hey, hey)
Let's just watch the clouds go by (Heh)
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 2]
And there ain't a need to panic
Girl, we can lay up on this hammock
No need to pose here, everything candid
Livin' in the moment, feelin' so splendid
Bottles on me, you can put it on the debit (Uh-huh)
I'm just tryna have fun tonight
So everybody wang chung tonight (Haha)
Girl, you can fall in love tonight
'Cause trust me, I'ma fuck you right
Got my Louis shades on, ain't a damn thing wrong (Nah)
Fillin' up cups 'til the bottle all gone
We just coolin', coolin' (What?,) feel the breeze
Decided to give you something you could sing off-key, like
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
(La, la-la, la-la, la-la) Uh, I puffin' that
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
(La, la-la, la-la, la-la) Hehe, 

[?] yeah

[Chorus]
I tell 'em I'm fine
I ain't got a damn thing on my mind
And, baby, all we got is time (Hey)
Let's just watch the clouds go by
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Outro]
Yeah
Haha
That's that smooth shit, Jerm
That pimp shit, dude
Oh yeah
Thumbs up
Haha

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Ridin' with the window down, rollin' through the city
Got the weed goin' 'round and the Most Dope with me, hey
Simply gettin' high like it's 1969
I'ma be grindin' 'til the kid a-hundred-sixty
New York, Atlanta too, flyer than Santa's shoes
She bring her camera through, I'm playin' Crash Bandicoot
This be the bitch, got some cock to serve her
I'ma rape the game, no Roethlisberger, hey
Above the clouds, seein' stars like L.A.
Have your girl always comin' back like Elway
I'ma be rich, that's what they tell me
So let me start workin' with this paper like an essay, hey
Athleticism, workin' game when I'm gettin' women
The freshest linen, like I'm spittin' through your television
In a daydream, livin' while these minutes pass me by
Lean back and hang these Nikes out the ride, just

[Chorus]
Roll the windows down, turn the system up
We just tryna ride around, 'cause we don't give a fuck
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey, let's just hit the road
Roll the windows down, turn the system up
We just tryna ride around, 'cause we don't give a fuck
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey, let's just hit the road

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Rockin' khaki colored jeans and a plain white tee
Nike watch, POW! chain, spend a day like me, hey
Every day like a movie scene
Smokin' weed, eyes glued to the computer screen
I'm super duper skeed, ridin' in the Civic
Just got some speakers, now I'm tryin' get it tinted
Every dream vivid, talk it how I live it
Uh, up in the air playin' Quidditch, bitches
This is once in a lifetime
They gon' put me in a flight, no Priceline
Used to want to be in Marvel, fightin' crimes
'Til I realized the boy had the nicest rhymes

[Chorus]
Roll the windows down, turn the system up
We just tryna ride around, 'cause we don't give a fuck
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey, let's just hit the road
Roll the windows down, turn the system up
We just tryna ride around, 'cause we don't give a fuck
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey, let's just hit the road

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
This is me thinking at 4:43 AM, June 6th

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money now
Like should I start trapping?
If what I write down don't collect this very moment
Then I'm on it, no question
In the streets, my niggas is well connected, let's see
Do I cop a pound of kush, promethazine or push some E?
Oxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when I sleep?
This is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beat
I be in spots, chopping the rocks like Flintstone feet
This is me, frustrated, battling my own evils
Finna saddle up that work across Ohio in a Geo
Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip
And hope one day it flourish to a kilo
Track record of a hustler
Rather records on the needle, making music
Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing
My nigga, what you doing on these corners whipping?
"I thought you had a show?" Well, my nigga, I guess I didn't
I'm tryna get this dough, and easy money sounds tempting
Especially when your homies pushing V8 engines
Twenty-two on twenty-sixes, Range Rovers rolling up
Three-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enough
This industry calling my bluff, I need a new solution
Curb-serving, or I might be in your store boosting
Two-elevens with Mac-11s like fuck hip-hop
Don't wanna be Pun, don't wanna be B.I.G., don't wanna be Pac
Just give me your funds, A.K.A. everything that you got
Or everything getting shot, for nothing
Leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
Watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
Moving grams like relocating your mom's momma
Then expand to the Hoover Dam, water, sherm
Contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
Fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds
I disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic down
And pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
You'll know I always had a passion for riddling, writing
But lately, I've been thinking 'bout taking chances to brighten
My future financially, so please don't be mad at me
I gotta do what I gotta do, no shit
So I tell my nigga, "Front me, let me put it on the strip"
Then give it back when I think about the consequence
Shit...

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
There are times, when you need someone
I will be by your side
Oh darling, cause there is a light that shines
Special for you, and me yeah
I-take-I-take-take my chances-chances-chances
Before they pass, they pass, they pass
Pass me by, oh darling
You've got to look at the other side

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
R.O.T.C—Right On Time Conscience
Started off dreaming, ended up balling
I got my ass up when I heard that money calling
I had to switch the line on them niggas that were stalling
Now I'm back to put that whack shit up in a coffin
California marijuana got a nigga coughing
Ashtray full of regrets and no problems,and still they can't solve them
Confidence: they can't take it off him. I'm awesome
Opposition slept and I lost them. It cost them everything
All this shit's ahead of me
Most of you will fold but I just approach readily
Shooting for the stars gotta hold the Glock steady
Not a chance I'mma miss like a lay-up if you 7'3"
Ain't no turning back, my pride will be the death of me
I do so many wrong everybody's second guessing me
See I gotta win, but that shit just doesnt pressure me
I'm all about the challenge, take a chance bitch step to me
Kill them all, Kill them all, thats the only mission
They told me I would fail, I was too broke to pay attention
Proceeded on my way; to have it all was my intention
Now look how far I came for someone who didn't listen
Single parent home but my situation different
I've got to help my mother, cause my brothers autistic
So when I say I need it every word is authentic
Get the fuck up out my way if you ain't got the ambition, bitch
Killing shit, and ain't to much as real as this
I'mma move in silence, while you niggas on that silly shit
Perfect blueprints, you are witnessing me building it
But you never keep your mouth shut; nigga zip it like you thrilla' fit
You can try to mimic but you'll never get as sick as this
Far too disciplined to get caught up in that gimmick shit
Ain't this shit ridiculous? I'm reaping all the benefits
Of Odd Future records fuck your contract imprisonment
Fuck the industry, I'm in the street that I'm living in
Making shit work, tired of waiting finna get it in
I put my hope in all the real niggas feeling this
Belong at the top but just give me a little bit
Got the floor plan to have me sitting on the ceiling bitch
And I'm forever loyal to the people that I get it with
As long as I'm alive I'mma ride getting high
I hope to God when I die my soul rise to the sky
Real talk, and real niggas feel it
G's fly high haters sink like dishes
In a cold world it's survival of the fittest
If you're feeling how I feel then I'mma see you at the finish
When I say it's mine it's just a promise I'mma get it
For if it don't last at least I can say I did it
I had it for a minute, I split it with my niggas
I focus on my mission, wish you all could see my vision

[Verse]
Fuck it, aye
Do or Die, new arrival
Holla at my niggas
You survive you's alive, yo
Now either you follow me and ride, or you's a rival
The difference between you and I is you a model, you posing
But who am I though?
The mulatto out for that lotto
Money coming soon, the newest model
Your crew is hollow
The type of niggas gobble dick, chew and swallow
Your girl told me shoot in her face, she suicidal
Oh shucks, you niggas is closed, you fold up
I'm from the Ville, niggas get killed over four bucks
Thank God we made it, my niggas, we grown up
Now we crazy over that bread, call us the "dough-nuts" uh
More sluts once the money blows up
But them hoes stop if the dough drops
I won't stop though, a chip off the ole' block
I'm from a city where niggas hold Glocks
Leave you looking like old socks, damn
Cops patrol blocks, spotting on us
The boys is rotten, I know they want us
Probably arrest a nigga, get a bonus
You kill a nigga, get promoted
Shit is crazy, girls getting babies before they get diplomas
So much I just go nuts
Niggas telling me slow up
Never that
I'm tryna get where that cheddar at
Y'all don't hear me
Always somebody that don't want you getting cheese, yo
This whole bullshit is like Tom and Jerry
I'm kinda very raw, niggas can't deny facts
If you black they sending you to jail or Iraq
Honor is something you can't sell or buy back
Niggas don't like bragging, they 9-11 fly cats
Hijack niggas, "Get up out your whip nigga, strip!
I want it all- ice on your wrists and the kicks, "
This shit happens, I ain't just rapping, believe it yo
They got streets in the city police won't even go
Peep it though, uh
It ain't no secret, niggas beefing 'cause my ego so big
It got me speaking like I'm diesel, like I'm devil, oh
Niggas know my style though, I ain't tweaking, I am lethal though
Have your daddy looking for you
This ain't Finding Nemo though
Let me slow it down, dumb it down, y'all borin'
The son came up out that womb, yo, a star is born
If real recognize real, y'all are foreign
My team run a play on your bitch and we all scoring, yea!

[Verse 1]
Back through the door, bag full of smoke
Sit back, relax and max with the hoes
Chat with my folks, laughin' at jokes
I’m hard to the core and she bad to the bone
Ask her to bone, chats on the phone
Her three friends with her just'a tagging along
As for the flow, back to the song
Flashbacks only bring me back to that thong
Cause we been getting, we’ve been getting high all week
Smoking, drinking, I’m her drug and she get high off me
Now I’m back to the store
Blunt wrapped, full of 'dro
Roll it back in that Backwood
Pass it and smoke
Want to get her high so I pass her the most
She want that bread and butter so I pass her the toast
That A$AP motto is "party, get high"
We back to the future
That Marty McFly

[Hook]
Sometimes I think about the past
Seems like the time is flying fast
So how my presence always last
The future’s always going back
La la la la la la la la la
Back to the future, that Marty McFly

[Verse 2]
Back through the door, back from the store
Back to the wall with my back to the wall
Rollin' up a blunt, passing it off
Ass on the floor, cash back on the floor
Mack with the broads, chat to the whores
"There go my niggas" dap to my dawgs
I prey on that pussy, chat with the Lord
Seem how it seems like I had it before
I think back, way back ran with my memories
We was getting high, sippin' on Hennessy
Now it's like lean
Thinkin' back seat
Way back riding on something clean, knamean
Twenty-tens
We don't do the teens now it's twenty-eleven
Let me know something take her back to my session
Back to the pad, now I’m back on that ass
Back to the future, back to the past

[Hook]
Sometimes I think about the past
Seems like the time is flying fast
So how my presence always last
The future’s always going back
La la la la la la la la la
Back to the future, that Marty McFly

[Intro: Drake]
I feel good
Got some time off, Girl it's been so long
Did you have fun?
Cause I'mma need a cab just to get me home
Maybe you could call in sick
Bring it to the crib and get all this, all this
I know I'm blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Probably one of my realest loves ever, four page letters
In time it’s all better, ‘cause time heal whatever
I'mma need a moment cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, females are on regular
What’s the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
I’d rather stay friends with benefits 'til we ready
Now ready, Chandon got me feeling heavy
She like one more chance, more problems, no Biggie, ah
It’s all good, don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or give each other space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that
Tell your friend they can fall back
Ain’t even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?
I'm like...

[Hook: Drake]
I feel good
Got some time off, girl, it's been so long
Did you have fun?
Cause I'mma need a cab just to get me home
Maybe you could call in sick
Bring it to the crib and get all this
I know I'm blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?
Well you should know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still…

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ain't nobody like you
Heard you got a ballplayer
But he don't excite you
I ain't the one you gotta lie to
Lay down, relax, climax, let me bite you
Still a superfreak
You know how I be when I'm rolling in the streets
Enough about me, I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Ginuwine cause I'm the same Ol' G
We was young, full of insecurities
Grown up now, all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies, arguing in Barney's, fly shit
Too much pride to say sorry
Shit, problems running like half the day
Number 24, let it fade away
She gotta leave but she wanna stay
She like "how you feeling babe?"
Like, shit

[Hook]
I feel good
Got some time off, girl, it's been so long
Did you have fun?
Cause I'mma need a cab just to get me home
Maybe you could call in sick
Bring it to the crib and get all this
I know I'm blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?
Well you should know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still…

[Verse]
Don't even know my schedule, levels reachin' several
Rose petals deliver, make you feel special
They thought the money should've changed it
Slide's still blue, why the world keep tryin' to paint it?
When the life around you changes, try to keep your sameness
Try to keep your brain maintainin' through the lameness (Lameness)

[Chorus]
Sometimes I just wanna go
Back to Blue Slide Park, the only place I call home (Home)
I hope it's never all gone (Gone), don't think it's ever all gone (Gone)
Sometimes I just wanna go
Back to Blue Slide Park, the only place I call home (Home)
I hope it's never gone, forever long (Forever long)

[Intro]
Blue Slide Park
(It's Blue Slide Park, man)
Uh (It's fuckin' Blue Slide Park)

[Verse 1]
Hey, I got these Ray-Ban shades
Kinda look like somethin' Lennon would rock
It seems like now I got a couple bags whenever I shop
Louis shoes, Polo socks, some name brand dumb shit
Logo never make a man, but I'm still blowin' thousands on it
No clue what I'm callin' my album
Fans be at my van screamin', callin' me Malcolm
Never knew the outcome be this much cash now
Bank account lookin' like a George Jung stash house
Young and actin' out, the topics that I rap about
Be varyin' from politics to bitches pullin' asses out
That's exactly how I do this as a rapper
I'm nuttin' in her mouth, you tongue kissin' her after
Daughters' moms kinda want me neutered
But they also want the kid to cum right on they cooter
Have the music soundin' better than guitar tuners
Plus I'm doin' shows daily, call me Jon Stewart
So who you know that's iller than Mac Miller and company?
It's like I planted money seeds right underneath the fuckin' tree
Now I got a hundred G's, so none of y'all can fuck with me
Yeah, I said it publicly, so run and tell your mother, motherfucker
I said run and tell your mother, motherfucker

[Interlude]
Hold up, Jerm, let me spit the second

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I breeze past haters in the E-Class quickly
In deep, did a hundred songs and that’s this week
Shit keeps goin' on and on
We just tryna go bananas like it's Donkey Kong
Yeah, on my grind, always need to work
So I be eatin' good, you be eatin' dirt
If you talkin' shit, you gon' see me smirk
While the DJ be scratchin' 'til the needles burst
A couple screws probably loose in my head
Holler at my girl, tell her bring that doobie to bed
I'm a regular guy with an irregular life
Except I'm a Lamborghini if it's racin' a bike
Who knew that I can turn-turn sound into somethin' so cool?
Fresh kids, see me, I'm bustin' the moves
Comin' in soon to a theater near you
Creep in your kitchen, start eating your food
Girls tryna fuck, I don't be in the mood
No time for pussy when money in the room
Ooh, I switch flows, switch rhythm
Sick spittin', unlimited ammunition, hey

[Outro]
Blue Slide Park

[Produced by ID Labs]

[Intro]
Yeah, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
I think—, I think I see where you're goin' with this one, E

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey
Been around the world and back, yeah, I did that
Still kick raps that cause impact, so where my kids at?
These mu'fuckers hatin', soundin' funnier than Sinbad
I'm ill as the pills that they give you when you collapse
This, that, the other, kiss your mother with that mouth?
We the assholes that she warned you about
We just storm in your house, open doors through a cloud
Got an assortment of style, just be sure that it's wild
6:30 in the mornin' and there still ain't signs of slowin' down
Twin sisters gettin' wasted, so they both are down
It's goin' down, I thought I told you, man
If you tryna party, let me see you raise your hand

[Chorus]
There's a party on Fifth Ave. (Party on Fifth Ave.)
Hit me if you tryna go (Hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like twenty, I'ma honk it and come runnin'
'Cause we gotta hit the road (We gotta hit the road)
Make you sure you got a clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes (New shoes)
Or just hitch a ride there, you choose (You choose)
There's a party on Fifth Ave. tonight
And that's what I'm tryin' to do

[Verse 2]
Hey, what's the difference 'tween me and you?
When no one believe in you, I'm flyer than Beetlejuice
Don't count on the sheep to snooze, I'm fucked up off weed and booze
I party then sleep 'til noon, what every day people do
So haters see me improve, just give me a week or two
See when you read the news, my bitches all sleepin' nude
My rhyme talent is why my album is fly
Your favorite record, you gon' put it aside
This that old school shit, soundin' good in the ride
And fuck ten, I'm only countin' to nine
Said this that old school shit, soundin' good in the ride
So let's head out to the party, I'll drive

[Chorus]
There's a party on Fifth Ave. (Party on Fifth Ave.)
Hit me if you tryna go (Hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like twenty, I'ma honk it and come runnin'
'Cause we gotta hit the road (We gotta hit the road)
Make you sure you got a clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes (New shoes)
Or just hitch a ride there, you choose (You choose)
There's a party on Fifth Ave. tonight
And that's what I'm tryin' to do

[Bridge]
What's goin' on? There's a party
Hope the neighbors don't mind us gettin' loud
Homies to the left, all the ladies to the right
We came to get down, we gon' do that now
My light up shoes on, my light up shoes on, my light up shoes on
They love the way my kicks flash
This ain't a time to just sit back
'Cause there's a party on Fifth Ave

[Chorus]
There's a party on Fifth Ave. (Party on Fifth Ave.)
Hit me if you tryna go (Hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like twenty, I'ma honk it and come runnin'
'Cause we gotta hit the road (We gotta hit the road)
Make you sure you got a clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes (New shoes)
Or just hitch a ride there, you choose (You choose)
There's a party on Fifth Ave. tonight
And that's what I'm tryin' to do

[Verse 1]
Hey, ten thousand dollar hands, million dollar plan
My fam's still the only people that really know me for who I am
Damn, got me askin' when I got this fly
The type to change because of fame, I'm just not that guy
Still sippin' on my 40 when the cops drove by
When I go, gotta tell my girl to stop, don't cry
See, I-I-I been buyin' these diamonds
All designer clothes and a Benz just to drive in
Autograph signin' must've got to my head
Fuck that, I've been the same lil' mu'fucka
Always down to share my shit, melody with snare kick
So I don't give a fuck about some lames I rode the ferry with
My larynx is imperative to live, music's what I need, boy
Destroy all of these fake me's, they decoys
Everywhere I go, these companies give me free toys
These random strangers just treatin' me like we boys

[Chorus]
Ayo, Pennsylvania nights (Nights), 9:30 flights (Flights)
Thinking to myself, where does all this go? (Go)
No time to care (Care), got more I can share (Share)
By now, this life is all I know
So this is all I know (Know), this is all I know (Know)
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight (Took flight)
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit (Bullshit)
So make a toast to a good life (Good life)

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, ten thousand dollar hands, billion dollar plan
Listenin' to jams while I'm sittin' in my van
This is who I am, wrote these lyrics on my DNA code
Happy as hell, MDMA, yo
Fuck a job, there ain't no one that I call my boss
We just tryna work so we can blow up like a Molotov
And it kinda wake me up like a coffee shop
Thinkin' 'bout my people who was murdered in the Holocaust
Got me thankful just for life by itself
And there's way more people here I should be tryna help
Am I wrong for spendin' money how I do? (Prolly yes)
It's just funny old people see the logo on my chest
You got ya thumb held high? We can be friends
Other people pretend we hang out on the weekends
These fuckers lil' bit creepy, so we just leave them
Say, "Get some rest," when I die, I'ma sleep in

[Chorus]
Ayo, Pennsylvania nights (Nights), 9:30 flights (Flights)
Thinking to myself, where does all this go? (Go)
No time to care (Care), got more I can share (Share)
By now, this life is all I know
So this is all I know (Know), this is all I know (Know)
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight (Took flight)
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit (Bullshit)
So make a toast to a good life (Good life)
Pennsylvania nights (Nights), 9:30 flights (Flights)
Thinking to myself, where does all this go? (Go)
No time to care (Care), got more I can share (Share)
By now, this life is all I know
So this is all I know (Know), this is all I know (Know)
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight (Took flight)
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit (Bullshit)
So make a toast to a good life (Good life)

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, I bet it must be nice, chillin' every day
Not really doin' shit, a couple million in the bank
I'm workin' all the time, never gettin' me a break
But fuck it, that's fine, not a minute go to waste
I just wanna be a legend, every second I gotta be goin' in
A part of me wanna chill, but a part of me wanna win
No college payin' my bills, I'm sayin' just what I feel
'Cause haters be lookin' stupid, when you just keepin' it real
I got too much on my mind, to care about the internet bullshit
Or them people comin' up say I'm forgettin' who I am
Just because they random dudes I went to school with
I'm cool with chillin' with some buddha smoke
I always do it big like a Jewish nose
Cadillacs, I'm tryna get a few of those
Fuck stress, everything'll be okay, like...

[Chorus]
How did you know (Know)
I was feelin' so under the weather (Weather)
This evenin'?
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)
And they say they love you (Love you), but they kiddin'
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)

[Verse 2]
Do you believe in fairy-tales, dreams come true?
One day you gon' make it
If they gave you a handout, and you were down bad
Would you take it?
I found that bein' famous in reality, well, it ain't shit
'Cause you could have the world in the palm of your hand
But it don't mean a thing 'til you change it
Listen, baby, I'ma be great now
We can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late
I'ma make my way to the top, every day I get closer
When I was young, they told me to wait until I'm older
They turned a cold shoulder to me
And now they want tickets to my shows for the free
"Hey, Mac, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?"
Bitch, suck my dick

[Chorus]
How did you know (Know)
I was feelin' so under the weather (Weather)
This evenin'?
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)
And they say they love you (Love you), but they kiddin'
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)

[Bridge 1]
Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm ridin' by
I know it sucks with a nine to five
But everything'll be alright
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm ridin' by
I know it sucks with a nine to five
But everything'll be alright

[Bridge 2]
Under the weather, shit'll get better
Under the weather, shit'll get better
The hate ain't gonna last forever, so
I just smile, it's whatever
Under the weather, shit'll get better
Under the weather, shit'll get better
Don't let nobody say you can't
Heart beatin' like a 808

[Bridge 1]
Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm ridin' by
I know it sucks with a nine to five
But everything'll be alright
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm ridin' by
I know it sucks with a nine to five
But everything'll be alright

[Chorus]
How did you know (Know)
I was feelin' so under the weather (Weather)
This evenin'?
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)
And they say they love you (Love you), but they kiddin'
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)

[Intro]
Uh, looks like I wrote this song on paper
First time I did that in like three years
My handwriting is—, is horrible and I can barely read this
Hmm

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, don't even know what's in my head anymore though
Uh, figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso
Fuckin' girls, but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of all the drugs that enterin' my brain
All of a sudden, every legend keep on mentionin' my name
All that does is show me that my life will never be the same
Police tryna figure out how to get me locked up
I tell those cops, "Suck dog nuts," haha
Arrivin' to the party in a chariot
Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit
I'm very sick, yes, very ill
Eternal Sunshine, Jim Carrey feel
At the amusement park, scared of heights, Ferris wheel
Double dare me to kill?

[Chorus]
Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere you go, these people hate on you
It's déjà vu, déjà vu (One time for the grind)
A little soul like De La do
They say I'm new, nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere I go, these people hate on you
Déjà vu, déjà vu

[Verse 2]
Wind chimes, sick rhymes
Been high on this incline
Tryna get my money stackin' tall, 6'9"
Have some caviar, sip wine
Sacrificin' sanity, sacrificin' normal
Purpose is for people in the plural
Form never formal, an art form, not a mural
Work four bars that are tighter than your cornrows
See a girl that's lookin' horny in the fourth row
Ha, I just put it in her mouth, ortho-
Dontist, manipulatin' phonics, put 'em into sonnets
Let me put you on this, nastier than Nas is
Bubonic plague, bacteria that's tryna find a way
Spread, like yolk of a broken egg
Talkin' shit? You just diggin' your grave

[Chorus]
Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere you go, these people hate on you
It's déjà vu, déjà vu
A little soul like De La do
They say I'm new, nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere I go, these people hate on you
Déjà vu, déjà vu

[Verse 3]
Hypothetically of dope, I kick incredibly
Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy
No methamphetamines, hot, a hundred-ten degrees
Visually stunnin', gotta see it on the LED
When I was seventeen, I thought I had it figured out
Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route
It's crucial, three new schools, life with a spoonful
Of sugar, yeah, I need my medicine
Fuckin' Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president
Represent all these fuckin' people that I never met
Some expect me to be the greatest ever
Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever
Now I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations
I'ma be the best, have some patience
You thought that it was great, then poof
It was nothin' but some déjà vu

[Outro]
Haha, yeah

[Intro]
Maybe I can get a little more high

[Verse 1]
(Haha) Come and talk shit, who the boss, bitch?
Moon the crowd now, Randy Moss shit
Sharks swimmin' in the water you'll get tossed in
And fuck a first class, I'm in the cockpit
It's obnoxious, it's bumpin' out my car
Bass'll shake your dinin' room table from afar
Down the street, they can hear me pretty clearly
Makin' in a night what your daddy pull in yearly
See a little style, I got mine's patent
Always rock a smile, never a distraction
Brand new Mercedes, cameras when I back in
Fuck with Single Ladies, yeah, I did a little actin'
Love me on the weekend but hate me when I'm workin'
Overly dedicated and overly medicated, for certain
Buy her a brand new purse and it's gravy
I ain't talkin' Slim when I say these bitches Shady

[Chorus]
Chicken sandwiches and turquoise beads (Yup)
Tattoo sleeve, pair of Levi's jeans (Yup)
Never get no sleep (Yup), you know all about me
Come and meet my team, bitch (Yup)
Meet my team, meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup)
You know all about me, come and meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
Bitch, meet my team, you know all about me (Yup, yup, yup, yup)
Come and meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup)

[Verse 2]
And if you see me, I'll be with my team (Team)
Got my homie Billy, probably in Supreme ('Preme)
Jimmy or Will be sellin' shirts to the fans
While TreeJay, Clock, they got you raisin' your hands (Ayy)
Then you got Q, that's my right-hand man
Shout out Little Dave, sittin' shotty in the van (Van)
Everyone I came with, travel like a gang, bitch
City after city, everybody speak our language
We just flex (Flex), get bootlegs checks (Checks)
Got all these people askin', "What's next?" (What's next?)
Success and a dumb fresh life
Takin' bets, you tryin' to lose a little money tonight?
I'm on top of the stage but under the lights
We invadin' your crib and fuckin' your wife
So have a ball, no sports, no Spaldin'
Poppin' champagne, gon' spray it on her awning

[Chorus]
Chicken sandwiches and turquoise beads (Yup)
Tattoo sleeve, pair of Levi's jeans (Yup)
Never get no sleep (Yup), you know all about me
Come and meet my team, bitch (Yup)
Meet my team, meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup)
You know all about me, come and meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
Bitch, meet my team, you know all about me (Yup, yup, yup, yup)
Come and meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup)

[Outro]
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
What happened to that shit you was talkin' before?
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
What happened to that shit you was talkin' before?
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
What happened to that shit you was talkin' before?
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours

(Hey, hey, hey) Fill it up, fill it up

[Verse 1]
Let me get another cup, please
I ain't drivin' home, so you can have my keys
Got a bunch of tricks all hidden in my sleeve
So I'ma get drunk, won't be leavin' 'til three
Yeah, I got a reputation of gettin' wasted
Everything in sight, homie, we ain't tryna save shit
Leave the spot dizzy, so nah, I can't see, bitch
Sexy bartenders always get a really mean tip
Life's so good, please enjoy it
End of every night when your head's in the toilet
Yeah, we party hard, give a fuck about employment
Kill the whole bottle, we'll be spinnin' like a coin flip
Yeah, we ain't goin' home no time soon
I'm on shot number four, times two
Stand by the keg, let the hoes find you
Gettin' nice, I'll be up all night

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
Head starts spinnin' and my legs get wobbly
Every mornin' wake up, liquor in my coffee
Yeah, I'm tryna party, find a open house crib
Screw the law, we just some motherfuckin' kids
Never listen to nobody who was tryin' to tell me "No"
'Cause I got no problem bein' way outta control
Got these ladies goin' crazy at every single show
But you ain't drunk enough until you takin' off your clothes
Not me, you can do you
Do some crazy shit that's poppin' up on YouTube
Finna rock out, I ain't talkin' U2
Passin' out, wakin' up without shoes
Live life on the edge, sharper than a razor
Like my liquor straight, I don't ever need a chaser
Have a good time, ain't no reason we should fight
Party with me, we stayin' up all night

[Chorus 2]
(Hey, hey, hey) We stayin' up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow

[Intro]
Ayy
Turn my beat up a little bit, yeah
For real, I was—, I was—
Oh, it's gonna get louder?
A'ight, cool

[Verse 1]
She keep on gettin' played like it's recess, break her heart's a reflex
She wanna hit the beach and show her titties down in Key West
Someone leave her cryin' all the time and now she finally outta Kleenex
Sick of dudes not givin' her the respect
'Cause really she a genius, a CEO
Tryin' to be on top alone, she don't keep them close
She been waitin' for the opportunity to be a boss
Tough bitch, probably would've thought she played lacrosse
Sick of bein' soft with her heart broken all the time
Want some money too, fuckin' dudes
And fallin' all in love with who, was nothin' new
Only comin' through to bust a nut or two
She just need her family like the Huxtables
And now she on the road, left them home to takeover
Get rich and have her crib made over
But she gon' do it partyin', with her cup full
Ain't gon' trust you, but she gon' fuck you, haha

[Chorus]
She wants diamonds, she wants gold
But she's scared to let you get too close
'Cause she's been high and she been low
But now she finally on her own
And they’ve been lookin', so they been findin'
'Cause she ain't runnin', she ain't hidin'
Until she find her way back home
And then she's finally all alone

[Verse 2]
She gon' be rich, as fuck
In high school, they were callin' her a slut
But now she comin' up, Louis Vuitton, and Juicy on her butt
See the bitches that be hatin' like, "What’s up?"
'Cause they ain't doin' nothin', and she out here stuntin'
Middle finger to them hoes, all them bitches had it comin', haha
Yeah, on top of the world, she lookin' down
Invite you to the crib, let you look around
Just a fuckin' tease, tryna get your cheese
Invite you out to dinner, 'cause she wanna eat for free
She could pay it if she wanted to, she won't though
Go home, she got more dough, haha

[Chorus]
She wants diamonds, she wants gold
But she's scared to let you get too close
'Cause she's been high and she been low
But now she finally on her own
And they've been lookin', so they been findin'
'Cause she ain't runnin', she ain't hidin'
Until she find her way back home
And then she's finally all alone

[Vocalizations: Unknown Woman]

[Chorus]
She wants diamonds, she wants gold
But she's scared to let you get too close
'Cause she's been high and she been low
But now she finally on her own
And they've been lookin', so they been findin'
'Cause she ain't runnin', she ain't hidin'
Until she find her way back home
And then she's finally all alone

[Intro]
Hey
It's like

[Verse 1]
Long days, longer nights
You keep startin' fights, think you always right
Call you up to tell you I ain't comin' home tonight
Say you wanna leave me, it's just talkin', but I know you might
Now get along, I get along, I go
You sing along to every song that you know
You play your part, I'm playin' mine
You breakin' hearts, ain't breakin' mine
Since growin' old is takin' time, I'm actin' like I'm eight or nine
Tryin' to move on, talkin' to my old friends
See me, say what up and I'm actin' like I don't know them
Causin' so much problems, why you doin' that, doin' that?
Rippin' people's hearts out, you too cute for that, cute for that
I been on the same shit (Same shit)
We run into each other and it's like we don't even speak the same language (Language)
I guess people always goin' through changes (Changes)
Didn't think I would lose you once I got famous

[Chorus]
Said, "Baby, I got missed calls and e-mails all goin' into detail
'Bout how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave
So go (Go)
I'll be fine on my own" (Own)
Said, "Baby, I got missed calls and e-mails all goin' into detail
'Bout how you used to love me, I keep changin' like the leaves
Hell, go (Go)
You'll be fine on your own" (Own)

[Verse 2]
She tell me, "You an asshole, superficial douchebag
Wishin' that you knew that, you could have these shoes back
All of this perfume back, necklaces and jewels back
All the shit you buy me," she said, "I want you back
I can't be seen again with you and none of your friends
It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when
I thought you used to be the one, I guess you don't have time
'Cause all you do is grind and it's got me losin' my mind
You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to
Think I'm 'bout to lose you
I'ma end this now before things just confuse you
Kept breakin' promises you said you'd keep
So you can leave a message at the beep"

[Chorus]
Said, "Baby, I got missed calls and e-mails all goin' into detail
'Bout how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave
So go (Go)
I'll be fine on my own" (Own)
Said, "Baby, I got missed calls and e-mails all goin' into detail
'Bout how you used to love me, I keep changin' like the leaves
Hell, go (Go)
You'll be fine on your own" (Own)

[Verse 1]
Boy a fool, wonder what's cool
Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about
I heard your mans ran cryin' to his mommy and his daddy
When the cops drove by his house, so who you tryin' to dial?
If you lookin' for a answer, you probably gon' find it now
And to the man in the hat standin' lookin' at his watch:
Motherfucker, well, the time is now
Go and clap your hands, let me hear you say, "That's the jam"
See, I wouldn't be shit if I ain't have no fans
Can't sit down, kids, you have to stand
Just put your hands up, you don't have to dance
Here, we get it poppin' like it's Pakistan
Iraq, Iran, I have them sayin', "Mac's the man"
The maximum, comin' through to pass you bums
So if you ain't got no money, better ask for some
Hey, we came to get down, have a good time
Bring the champagne out and the good wine
We gon' be sippin' and whippin' the sickest whips
Spittin' the illest shit that's sicker than syphilis
Comin' in the back door, yellin', "Fuck a list"
Fans takin' pictures while I'm tryin' to take a piss
We came to party, didn't come to give a shit
Now sing this part, it goes like this, hey

[Chorus]
All my people in the front
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
Everybody in the back
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you're feelin' that funk
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you like it like that
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
All my people in the front (Front)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
Everybody in the back (Back)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you're feelin' that funk (Funk)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you like it like that (That)
Go and clap your hands (Hey), go clap your hands

[Verse 2]
H-h-h-h-hold up
Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up
I show up 'cause fans will go nuts
Tell the girls, "It's cool, look but don't touch"
I'll be home soon as I can, I don't rush
'Cause girl, you're baby, girl, you're good, just don't fuss
I wanna hear y'all clap, just like that
Keep it goin', I'ma bring it all back
H-h-h-h-hold up
Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up
I show up 'cause fans will go nuts
Tell the girls, "It's cool, look but don't touch"
I'll be home soon as I can, I don't rush
Baby, baby, girl, you're good, just don't fuss
I hear these couples fightin' all the time, not us
We have a good time, like to get fucked up
What? What? Goin' hard tonight
Under 21, but find me at the bar tonight
Hey, drivin' 'round in my car tonight
Makin' music that ain't hard to like
I got the heart to write
A couple bars, I might go do
Somethin' crazy, I may be lazy, love me or hate me
You know it's the same me
And it goes a little somethin' like this...

[Chorus]
All my people in the front
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
Everybody in the back
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you're feelin' that funk
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you like it like that
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
All my people in the front (Front)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
Everybody in the back (Back)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you're feelin' that funk (Funk)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you like it like that (That)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands

[Outro]
Boy a fool, wonder what's cool
Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about
I heard your mans ran cryin' to his mommy and his daddy
When the cops drove by his house, so who you tryin' to dial?
If you lookin' for a answer, you probably gon' find it now
And to the man in the hat standin' lookin' at his watch:
Motherfucker, well, the time is now (Time is now)

[Verse]
Everybody wanna ask where I came from
Young kid who bang drums, money, don't you worry, I'ma make some
Somebody changin' the world, it only takes one
Never scared of death, but I ain't ready for that day to come
A million people in the world, I don't hate one
Even them dummies robbin' people with some fake guns
Make mistakes, young boy, that's just what I heard
And you don't ever figure out what you don't wonder first
I got another verse, invincible and nothin' hurts
A hundred words, comin' up with what'll have your bubble burst
We can just fuck, you don't need to take my number first
Gettin' right to it, I ain't really tryna cuddle first
I used to try everything with her, but nothin' worked
Got her backwards like she heard the thunder first
These are the days of our lives, and I ain't lyin', kid
Bein' free, tell me what kind of crime that is
It said it can't let me spit a couple sentences
Always good penmanship, make sure you all remember this
You just entered into Blue Slide Park
The place where dreams comin' true, that's where you find heart
Up until the sun come up, yeah, my crew grind hard
See me out throughout the day, but you won't find me in the dark
Say I'm smart with remarks, such remarkable bars
Who knew this music would get me a couple cars
That just sit in park 'cause I'm out somewhere travelin'?
Mackin' on the preschool honeys, you were somewhere tattlin'
Mac has been known to always spaz again
Every single track with him, "Oh, he's just so talented"
Dream of countin' money 'til my fingers get some calluses
King with many palaces, a fuckin' golden fork to eat my salad with
I observe, askin' what did he design
I see an artificial future for a digital mind
Muhammad Ali, yeah, I'm him in his prime
Just that normal kid in class you was sittin' behind
Didn't really pay attention to him spittin' his rhymes
But now you see his car, try gettin' inside
No, hell no
Haha, I wanna go back home

[Outro]
Keep it, hold up (Can't remember what the day's like)
Late night, can't remember what the day's like
Reminiscin' on stop signs and brake lights
'Cause it seems that I'm always on the move (Move, move)
When they gonna let me back home?
Yeah
I wanna go back home
I wanna go back home

[Intro]
Yeah!
Or should I say yeaaaaaah!
Shout out my nigga, Sledgren, my nigga Artie

I must have coughed my damn lungs out
Still smoking everyday nigga, cause I'm strung out
Fly the fuck out, this what all the fuss bout
Niggas got dumb clout and we took the fun route
Lounging niggas despising every move
But the wolves is out and everything is looking edible
With easing all of the pussy up on the pedestal
Send em back woozy from smoking all of the medical
Peeping in my rear view I'm just so far ahead of you
It's looking like the future from all the raps that I'm telling you
Raps like crack It's like my situation federal, I'm telling you
Sick need a whole gallon of Theraflu
Cliche, yeah, but the bitches think it's susceptible
They tell me Domo ain't no real niggas left except for you
You kill it every single time you get a chance to
And I reply, Ain't that the damn truth

[Hook x2]
All of this money and all of these hoes
All of these bright lights and all of these shows
All of these wild nights, life on the road
Is all the shit I was dreaming before so lets smoke
On a high end hiatus I went retail ridiculous
Bought to get a grill, so I can act mad niggerish
Six Hundred for a belt, still sag all ignorant
Bitch I'm from OddFuture obvious I don't give a shit
Young niggas gettin it
Make sure you hearing me
Trying to get paid, banks stupider then Hilary
And all these hating niggas talking down be killin me
I promise to never be lame as the niggas dissin me
Same nigga I just handle biz a lil differently
Outdo who? I run shit little nigga please
Compare to my averages you Little League
Kicking brag raps at least gotta have a little cheese
I'm fenna be the most outspoken
Hey your favorite nigga out, I'm so focused
But in the meantime I'm a chill and roll this and be the very best thing smoking, Closin

[Hook]

Domo Genesis, Under the Influence

I Don't know I'm too high for this shit dog, I ain't really got it in me, No Homo

[Intro]
So tired, tired of this drama
You go your way, I go my way
No more, no more
I'd rather be free
So tired, tired, tired

[Verse 1]
Broken heart again
Another lesson learn
Better know your friends
Or else you will get burned
Gotta count on me
'Cause I can guarantee that I'll be fine

[Chorus]
(No more pain)
No more pain
(No more pain)
No more pain
(No drama)
No more drama in my life
(No more in my life) No one's gonna make me hurt again

[Verse 2]
Why'd I play the fool?
Go through ups and downs
Knowing all the time
You wouldn't be around
Or maybe I like the stress
'Cause I was young and restless
But that was long ago
I don't wanna cry no more

[Chorus]
(No more pain) No more pain, no more pain
(No more) No more game
No more game messin' with my mind (No drama)
No more drama in my life (No more in my life)
No one's gonna make me hurt again
No more (No more tears)
No more tears, I'm tired of cryin' every night
(No more fears) No more fears, I really don't wanna cry
(No drama) No more drama in my life (No more in my life)
I don't ever wanna hurt again
Wanna speak my mind, wanna speak my mind
Go 'head

[Verse 3]
Ooh, it feels so good
When you let go
Of all the drama in your life
Now you're free from all the pain (Free from all the pain)
Free from all the game (Free from all the game)
Free from all the stress (Free from all the stress)
So find your happiness
I don't know
Only God knows where the story ends for me
But I know where the story begins
It's up to us to choose
Whether we win or lose
And I choose to win

[Chorus]
(No more pain) No more pain, no more pain, tired of hurting
(No more pain) Tired of your playin' games with my mind
(No drama) No more drama in my life (No more in my life)
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more
(No more tears) No more tears, no more cryin' every night
(No more fears) No more waking me up in the morning
With your disturbing phone calls (No drama)
Leave me alone, go ahead (No more in my life)
Hey, yeah, oh, whoa (No more pain)
No more time (No more games)
No more games, I'm tired, I'm so tired (No drama)
No more, no more (No more in my life)
No more, no more
No more, no more, no more

[Bridge]
No more drama
I'm tired of all this drama (No more drama)
Go 'head, go 'head
You demons get out of my face (No more drama)
Go get out my life (No more drama)
I am 'bout to lose my mind
Lord, help me, help me say
No more drama (No more drama)
No more drama
No more drama (No more drama)
No more drama
Oh, help me sing, I need a peace of mind
No more drama (Peace of mind, peace of mind)
Yeah, I need a good night sleep (No more drama)
I need to know that you won't creep

[Outro]
Oh no, oh no
No more, no more, no more drama
No more drama in my, in my life
I'm so tired (I'm so tired, so tired)
Tired, tired of all this drama
Of all the drama

[Intro]
Gotta get my groove back, you know?
It's been a little minute
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Verse: 1]
Label me greedy, but see me finish what Petey started
From Carolina where niggas spray like graffiti artists
The south nigga, niggas used to think we retarded
And slow as hell, but well well, now we regarded as the niggas (yea)
I fuck with non rapping niggas, non clapping niggas
Niggas is real, y'all is action figures (Ha)
Ain't into acting bigger than I really am
Ain't no two ways around it, motherfucker I'm the man
Where the beef at?
Back in the days I ain't even go out for recess
A nigga don't play, man, I been living okay
Been up in Queens where they 'rid of those foes
And niggas GATs got bodies like video hoes
It's J.Cole, you not fucking with just any old flow
I'm like the '95 Penny, you like Penny '04
No disrespect to my favorite player
Niggas praying a nigga never see the day a nigga rich
So I'm slaying niggas, yeah

[Chorus]
This is for my niggas tryna make it
Watch out for them evil ass niggas tryna take it, uh
They love to see a nigga dead, up in jail
Living in a world where we set up to fail
But I'ma get it, nigga, I'm finna get it (Uh)
I'ma get it, nigga, I'm finna get it (Yeah)
I'ma get it, nigga, I'm finna get it (Yeah)
I'ma get it, nigga, I gotta get it

[Verse: 2]
Yeah
Niggas in the streets know
Nigga bless beats, I got that priest flow, heavenly
You gonna cross over if he reach for the rock
Just a figure a speech for the Glock
From the Ville, where police know the heat flow a lot (Yeah)
Like a beach, yo, it’s hot, niggas laid out
Caught a fake nigga centerfield, it's 'cause they played out
Watch our boys fade out, niggas tryna hate
If he only knew my dick's in his dame mouth
Just made out, came out the woodworks
Now they tryna peep a nigga footwork
I'm getting real green, y'all niggas playing on some good turf
Fake money, scared money, never make money
And a nigga never fear nothing but God, fuck a facade, I'm just
Focused on stuffing my pockets up with them wads and shit
Hundred thousand dollar deposit shit
Been dreaming 'bout millions since a nigga was five or six
And so I strive, I'm the God, this some bible shit
Nigga I
Yeah

[Chorus]
This is for my niggas tryna make it
Watch out for them evil ass niggas tryna take it, uh
They love to see a nigga dead, up in jail
Living in a world where we set up to fail
But I'ma get it, nigga, I'm finna get it (Uh)
I'ma get it, nigga, I'm finna get it (Yeah)
I'ma get it, nigga, I'm finna get it (Yeah)
I'ma get it, nigga, I gotta get it

[Verse 3]
Tell 'em visions Geppetto, my niggas in ghettos with Scarface dreams
On the block with the hard hate, that's all they seen
Niggas killing niggas in broad day on all they screens
Watching cops loving car chase scenes
Niggas arrested
Treat us like roaches, the prison's nigga infested
They hate to see the day we ain't slain, niggas invested
All created equal looks like equal to a less than
Depending on your race, or depending on your address, man
I've been blessed, was given less and but still progress, man
I hate to see the position my niggas left in
Sling dope or nigga you slave for minimum wage
Ashamed
But we living in the cage, so nigga get paid, shit
How could I tell a nigga not to hustle?
Yeah, it's a better life my nigga, but it's not for us though
Instead they wanted us to break, they never wanted us to make it (Yeah)
To my niggas: smarten up until we smart enough to take it, nigga

[Intro: DMX]
They do it every time man
Every time
Every time they do it to me

[Hook Adreena Mills & DMX]
I gotta make it out and move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
Bet this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope, (The Champ!)
Won't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the frontlines with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 1: DMX]
Damn, I went through it again
After telling everybody I wouldn't do it again
I kinda feel like I let my people down (yup)
But to get them right, I got's to pick myself up (come on)
When I heard this beat and hook, it was so raw (uhh)
Looked in the mirror, didn't like what I saw, (uhh)
All I could say was: ahh man shit gotta change (forreal!)
Either get it right or take one to the brain (blam!)
But y'all know the pain that I went through daily, (woooh)
Tryna stay sane through the rain, y'all hear me
I'm slippin', fallin', can't get up
But this time I'm outta control, I don't give a fuck!
For the thugs!, I'm the last hope for the team (come on!)
I'm the reason why some niggas, gotta hope and a dream (come on!)
These cats know what's good, I am the hood (Aii)
I ain't hoping that they don't, I wish a nigga would (come on!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: DMX]
I gotts to do it for me, or do it for them, (yeah)
I ain't playing with this shit, Im'ma do it to win
Know I can do it again, (come on) cause I did it before
With little to no effort, and y'all niggas knew the score (for real)
First album dropped in May, second in December
Over platinum in one year like, y'all don't remember, (come on)
Only nigga who's first 5 albums debuted at number 1
And you wonder why I call you son (my son)
I just begun, to get started, with the hardest part of it all
Is to climb a slippery wall and, still don't fall
Break down and call up to God, when it gets to hard
I know you ain't gonn' let me go now!!(please) You brought me too far
Showed me I was as a star, all my life
I know it, all it right, before I, call it a night
I'mma thank you for it all, the blessings and the curses
And I hope you listening, there's a lesson in the verses
Yeah

[Hook]

[Outro: DMX]
Does it bother me?
Yeah off course it bothers me
Cause it's not who I am, I'm not you know, the person the media portrays me to be, ya mean?

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
There's somethin' about my ego, tell her back up, Tim Tebow
Got Tivo up in the ride, I'm leanin' back and my seat low
You need hoes, I just sex 'em, bend the ass like Beckham
Undress 'em, respect 'em
Just for the night, then after that I forget them
Neglectin', I'm sorry, girl, turn the house into a party world
Probably gonna get herself played, Atari
No time for tears, if you cryin', call Maury
Got girls by the army, feelin' kinda horny
Love it when I'm on a Benny Blanc beat
Talk cheap, but I spend big
'Cause I

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right, then aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away
And make it okay
I swear I'll behave

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now I'm naked
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Maybe it's hard, when you feel like
You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
That I've got the key

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you wanna steer, but I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here (Oh, yeah, yeah)
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine & (Christina Aguilera)]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)

[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
I'm a rich bastard, Mick Jagger say I got them moves
Always rollin' stone, girls call my phone
Let it ring, I'm way too cool
Get a little bit of dome when I'm in arenas
Messin' with these hoes who be so eager
But no need to tease her, I'ma go with Christina, uh

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera & Adam Levine]
So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh, baby, rub me right
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Christina Aguilera]

I must be nuts, that's what they asked me

My heartbeat loud as my sixers, sixers
Guys pull me over and then they ask me
If I know I'm breaking the law
I said yeah she got my air
And I'm running, I'm running low
Where my driver go? Man I don't care
I got the keys, so I'm driving alone

[Hook]
And try to be ready when I get there

[Bridge]
On my way, I'm coming

Traffic killing me, barely can groove but I coming, yeah I'm coming
Phone dead, can't talk to you right now
But I'm coming to get you, coming

[Verse 1]
Okaay!
Always had a crush on you that you wouldn't even know was there
Let me introduce myself, they call me Young Khalifa man (okaayy)
Young Khalifa man, call me Young Khalifa man
Next time you're home takin' pictures, call me if you need a hand
I'll be everything you want, spend time alone and be you're friend
Pick you up from lunch and shit, I'll probably beat you to the crib
You gon' have me doin' shit, just solely off them snapshots
I'll lick you from head to toe, go down and eat the snack box
Came home from the studio, seen you with no t-shirt on
And couldn't help but feel like this, I hope that you don't take it wrong
Ain't seen you in person, so I figured I'd just make a song
And anyone that feel the way I feel will probably sing along
You look good with them jeans on
Wasn't for this night I'da never knew you had them rings on
I don't know him, but whoever stole your mack
When I see him, I'mma pat him on the back

[Hook]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gonna live it up
And when the day's gone, I look her picture up
And I say the same thing every single time
I think of you undressed, think of you undressed
Think of you undressed, think of you undressed
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had, when I think of you undressed

[Verse 2]
Future sex love, I be on that Timberlake shit
I be there to download em, everytime you take pics
Everything tatted, so they call me Young Travis
We ain't gotta go to the shop, we already matchin'
Paper through the roof, but baby money ain't the topic
I can put it on you til you pray I never stop it
Go through everyday just to get some shit accomplished
But I can't help but think bout them pictures of you topless
Like a nerd with no Macbook
Look how purty that lil cat look
I see them nine lives pokin' from the back
And I'm tryin' to kick the habit, but you gotta nigga crack-hooked
Yeah just know my album is a classic
And out of all the flicks, my favorite pictures when you grabbed it
Standin' with no towel on, wish I was where your hand is
That ring up in your nipple make a nigga think of marriage

[Hook]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
(Well y'all probably done it pretty big
But I got more than money girl)
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gonna live it up
And when the day's gone, I look her picture up
And I say the same thing every single time
I think of you undressed, think of you undressed
Think of you undressed, think of you undressed
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had, when I think of you undressed
Okaay!
I hope you don't take this in a disrespectful way
This how I do, young Taylor Gang)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Chevy, please let me roll this weed up
This the main event so watch the people pull they seats up
Bottle of some gin, let's just hit a couple freaks up
I'ma take one home and have her singing like the Glee Club
Never on no cheap stuff
Here we got expensive taste
Green lights, never press the brakes
You can look at us roll
All the kush that we blow
You know I’m at the shows looking good for these hoes
Got they man on patrol
Shorty wanna live it up
Playing hard to get but she wanna give it up
Yeah, you smoking good but I'm probably smoking better
151, taking shots with no Beretta
Know me homie, I'm the king
You could watch me do my thing
With a drink getting drunk, having one night flings
This is Pittsburgh, home of the six rings
We getting money now, all we hear is, "Chi-ching"

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
And we do anything to get this paper
So they follow everywhere we go
So for the bullshit, we ain't got later
'Cause we out here on this road
And we do anything to get this paper
So they follow everywhere we go
So for the bullshit, we ain't got later
'Cause we out here on this road

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Cool ass, fly around, chillin', young fool
Gin cup sipping, that's me, that's what I do
I got the gang in my bloodstream, strong how I'm living
And I'm G'd up so they just throw away the kitten, it's real
I swear you hella bad, the youngin Mac tell me about you
But we cool, if you stuck up, we can go without you
We on the money, he schoolin', you know I be the block
I swear the homie got a gift so he don't need the block
Zig Zag papers, king size
Smoking, chilling, in angry cars, mean rides
Pops was a hustler and Moms ran track
So tell me what you get in me when you mix that
I just sit back, light mines
And middle finger you suckers with my nice rhymes
So whether home or on the road
We getting dough it follows us everywhere that we go

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
And we do anything to get this paper
So they follow everywhere we go
So for the bullshit, we ain't got later
'Cause we out here on this road
And we do anything to get this paper
So they follow everywhere we go
So for the bullshit, we ain't got later
'Cause we out here on this road

[Verse 1]
They say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby, give me one last hug
There's a dream that I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality
And when you hold my hand
Then I understand that it's meant to be
Cause baby, when you're with me

[Chorus]
It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
Cause when I stare in your eyes, it couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh no, so
Let the music blast, we gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all
Cause this life's too long and this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure that I'll never let you go

[Verse 2]
I got my favorite girl
Not feeling no pain, no fear
Don't have a care in the world
Why would I when you are here?
There's a moment I've been chasing
And I finally caught it out on this floor
Baby, there's no hesitation
No reservation by taking a chance and more
Oh no, because

[Chorus]
It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
Cause when I stare in your eyes, it couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh no, so
Let the music blast, we gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all
Cause this life's too long and this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure that I'll never let you go

[Breakdown]
It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
Cause when I stare in your eyes, it couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh no, so

[Bridge]
Take my hand, let's just dance
Watch my feet, follow me
Don't be scared, girl, I'm here
If you didn't know, this is love

[Chorus - Shortened]
Let the music blast, we gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all
Cause this life's too long and this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure that I'll never let you go

[Outro]
So don't fear, don't you worry 'bout a thing
I am here, right here (I'll never let you go)
Don't shed a tear
Whenever you need me, I'll be here (I'll never let you go)
Oh no, oh no, oh
I'll never let you go
Oh no, oh no, oh
I'll never let you go

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Down town to underdogs who
Put their favorite artists on the walls and
Can never get enough of one song
So what plays and it plays all day long
Cause all the pain outside they don't wanna see
So they write songs constantly
Cause a doctor or a lawyer they don't wanna be
And I ask do you really have grow up just to be what you wanna be?
So shout out to the mc's and the divas and the singers and the prom queens
And the folks who don't ever get invited to the party
But somehow be the first on the scene
To the folks who just wanna be free
Took all that age you too young you can't see
Ask them when was the last time they had a dream
Cause every river leads to the sea, to the sea

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
Hope is a river that runs random, a stream of floating desires
Casting your fears away, as it flows above the skies, the skies
Where your worries will drown out
You imagine how it would be right now
Casting your fears away as it flows above the skies, the skies
Hope is a river, hope is a river, hope is a river
Hope is a river, hope is a river, hope is a river
Hope is a river, of dreams afraid to be real, real, real, to be real

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
He yo world, and I pray for the good days, for the world to be a better place
Cause I know one day will be a better way, everyone could have a getaway
When we go into a place where there's love in ours now, ours now, ours now
And I know that one day will be a way from the gun play
Cause somehow all the pain got a sudden change
Take away all the pain and the hate to this love now
The world is a big danger, we're leaving right now

[Hook]
Hope is a river that runs random, a stream of floating desires
Casting your fears away, as it flows above the skies, the skies
Where your worries will drown out
You imagine how it would be right now
Casting your fears away as it flows above the skies, the skies
Hope is a river, hope is a river, hope is a river
Hope is a river, hope is a river, hope is a river
Hope is a river, of dreams afraid to be real, real, real, to be real

Niggas know I spit that real shit to these fiends
I'm a mothafuckin king, like a fell out a fuckin dream
R.I.P Eazy E

[Hook: Akon]
Most stared up in the club, just swagging doing my thang
Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
Partying so hard, the ladies don't want it to end
They looked at me and said, "I heard that you're a heartbreaker"

Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker
Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker
Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker
Baby I'm a troublemaker

[Verse 1: Akon]
See, I'm that type of guy you won't love
I'm that type of guy you won't cuff
I'm that type of guy your daddy won't let you go out
Cause he thinks I sell drugs

I'm that type of guy that will save ya
I'm that type that will call you later
Won't be around to give you that time
Gotta get on the grind and get to that paper
That I can do
Gotta keep my baby girl laced in the latest and the fliest suits
Never one for none, let's stay caked up, hold it down, that's all you gotta do
Then I walk up in the place, with a pocket full of money, my brother like I are the dude
Stepping out with the finest suits, look at me now

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Akon]
See I'm that type of guy that like kissing
I'm that type that will pop the clip and
I'm that type of guy that put you in your place
If your bougie just start tripping

I'm that type that will let you go
I'm that type that will let you know
That everywhere I go I can find a pretty ho
But there ain't too many know how to get that dough

That's the type of girl I want around me
Even though I'm a with her, make a man feel free
Roll with the fellas, even hold my cheese
Look like something you would see on TV

She don't mind climbing up that ladder
Similar to the words, it don't matter
But this time they wanna see us together
Look at us now

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Akon]
You're not for sure
Even though I wanna take you everywhere I go
Because of you, all the girls is staring, taking notes
And I realize being with you girls bring more girls
And that's just what I'm attracted to

And I'd rather go all the way
Love her long time, till the break of day
I won't let her ever leave my bed
Till she sees the color purple like Anna Mae
Now she wants to start holding on me, like whatever she's smoking on
I'll be long gone before you can say, "Look at me now"

[Hook]

[Intro: Lil Wayne, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
Bitch!
The Aphilliates, nigga, holla at your boy
Uh-huh
DJ Drama!
My lip all fucked up
You probably could hear it, like, on my P's and my B's, but it's cool, fuck it
Gangsta!
Get 'em!

[False Start: Lil Wayne, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
Shooting 'til my motherfucking hand fall off
You're track stars; the gunshot ran y'all off (Gangsta!)
I pop like a soda, watch the can fall off
I can kill y'all and y'all boss (Gangsta Grillz, you bastards! Oh!)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
Shooting 'til my motherfucking hand fall off
You're track stars; the gunshot ran y'all off
I pop like a soda, watch the can fall off
I can kill y'all and y'all boss (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
Shotguns, handguns, louder than a band drum
You fucking with the drum major, let me play you the anthem (Oh!)
Bang-bang-bang-bang, call it heavy metal
I say, "Bang bang," bitch, I make you feel every letter
B-A-N-G, B-A-N-G
G-A-N-G, we spray then leave
We play when we—no, we play N-E-
V-E-R; C-P-R
Doctor Carter, are you the disease, boy?
Young Money, motherfucker, *these* these boys
Bitch is you crazy? We's retards
Watch Nina, Mac, and Tommy have a brief ménage
Like: (Gangsta!) (*bang-bang*, *bang-bang*)
Hehe! Like: (*bang-bang*, *bang-bang*) (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
Hehe, yeah! Soulja Boy on the beat
But you can call me Chef Boyardee
'Cause I'ma heat this shit, and I'ma eat this shit
Planet Earth is my toilet, you're beneath this shit
Then I flush and wipe my ass; gunslinger like a pass
I cock back and throw a bomb—now, Hail Mary
You tale-fairy, fairytale, very frail
And yeah, we got them hammers, tryna hit every nail
Let them sail up the river with that ho shit
Or leave them face-down in the fucking ocean, yeah
I ain't on no other shit, bitch, I'm on some more shit
That, "Hello, how you doing? I am at your front door" shit
That, "Aww, naww, he got a gun! Oh shit!" ... shit
Shit

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Okay, it's Young Money, what you know 'bout it?
The semi-auto'll rip open your body and tear the soul out it
And all that fronting shit, nigga, I don't know about it
Call me Master Jae, bitch, I'm so 'bout it
Even my ho 'bout it, and don't doubt it
'Cause we both a-be Angelina-and-Brad'-ing
Spazzing and blasting, blasting and ratatat-ing
And nah, I don't cook, but like potatoes, I a-mash 'em
I don't give a fuck about your money or your fashion
Shots through the window of your brand-new Aston
You get out, try to run, now your chest where them bullets crashing
Pine box niggas, no crutches, no casts, and
No wheelchair, just the two-door, long, black wagon
Flowers on the side, and four wheels to steer
I ain't never scared, and I ain't never care
So fuck what they doing over there, I'm doing it here
You're nothing like me, fuckboy, don't be outlandish
We gorillas in the mist, y'all just some "Kung Fu Pandas"
Sweet like Fantas, ha
My blood is the same as Bruce Banner's, hit record on the cameras
Motherfuck all the bullshit and antics
They saying, "He ain't gotta get a clearance from Wayne"
That's a disadvantage
Being broke is a foreign language for me, like Spanish
Musically, I direct thrillers, call me John Landis

[Break: Jae Millz, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
Hahaha
Gangsta Grillz, you bastards!
Fuck that nigga in the red jacket, nigga
Gangsta!
Gangsta Gri-Zillz!

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
It's the 5-0-4 slaughterhouse bloodbath
Lil' nigga stand tall like a gi-raffe
One-man gang, animal, cannibal
Eat rappers for dinner, my nickname "Hannibal"
Guns for days, I show you what this cannon do
Hit you and split your motherfucking man in two
I grab the chopper southpaw, that’s how I hold the toy
I aim and crank that bitch like Soulja Boy
I’m in the streets one-deep, I can hold my own
And shit, it’s only one seat, and I control the throne
Look, bitch, I’m on my crazy-ass shit
You see the gun poking out like Sheneneh lips, yeah
Watch your lips when talking
'Cause I be on your grave, nigga, leaking in your coffin—
Rest in piss! When I die, let me rest with clips
Rambo, I’ma go on my Sylvester shit, bang!

[Intro: Drake & Voyce]
It's Drake (Oh)
VO (Yeah)
Amir (Hmm)
Hahaha, Voyce talk to 'em, man

[Chorus: Voyce]
Hi, I see you sitting at home
Nobody's calling you on the phone
Your girls out making a night on the town while you're sitting there all alone
I suggest you come with your crew
Y'all are looking for something to do
'Cause I understand pain is love and that's exactly why I wrote this little something for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ladies up north represent representing
Ladies down south represent representing
When the mic is in my hand I'm never hesitant
My favorite jam back in the day was Eric B For President, it's evident
She spend her summers in Jamaica and I love that
They say that she should be a model she's above that
She had a rapper break her heart, had to open her
So she don't even mess with rap, only spoken word
Well, I'm a poet so you know it's get her to going down
And after all this is my city I could show you round
I understand that the shit you facing is crazy
Let me hear your views on the situations in Haiti
Or sit back relax, vibe with ya man
Chill we could talk about Tribes in Sudan
'Cause you gotta understand if I said it then I meant it
I understand that you Afro I'm tryna get to your centric
That's why I got a bottle of Champagne and then I sent it
Over where you sitting, noticed, pretend you didn't
Along with the bottle was a note attached
Here's some tickets to my show you should go to that
And it's a shame money's something that you barely need to knock her
I'm tryna treat her right 'cause she barely treated proper
But you showed up regardless of late choices it's clear
You really came to kick it it with Drake, Voyce and Amir like

[Chorus: Voyce]
Hi, I see you sitting at home
Nobody's calling you on the phone
Your girls out making a night on the town while you're sitting there all alone
I suggest you come with your crew
Y'all are looking for something to do
'Cause I understand pain is love and that's exactly why I wrote this little something for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you

[Verse 2: Voyce]
'Cause love (Love is in the air)
You know that love is in the air (You see that girl over there, I'm tryna make her smile you know what I mean, we gonna try and make a video later)
I should feel it everywhere
So smile ('Cause she fly, I think I see her friend over there too, you know what I mean)
So smile for me one time and I guarantee we gon have a good time ('Cause ever since rewind we get full of girls like this man, it's just not even a thing...so uh)
'Cause love (Hey girl won't you come here, I got a suggestion you know what I mean)
So smile (Why don't you and your friends, Get with me and my friends, maybe we could be friends you know what I mean, we could do this every weekend...maybe love is in it's self know what I mean, uh)

[Intro : Childish Gambino]
It's Childish Gambino, y'all know who it is, how it is and what it do
Mr. Jens Lekman on the track, ladies and gentlemen
For those of you wondering for whom the sample is
Alright. Let's do this. Uh-huh

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
I'm the sickest Nigga ever, go and tell your ma!
And I got a little liquor like a St. Bernard!
Niggas hold onto Cliffs, like Phylicia Rashad!
Cause I'm always on the edge, but I don't fall off!
I's a boy in the hoodie and a hat to match!
And the shit bright orange like a pumpkin patch!
And they call me Guy Ritchie cause I work with snatch!
And I'm rich, and a guy. Whatch'all think of that?
And the cops stay on me cause I'm young and black!
And the boy stay crazy like a pound of crack!
And I'm all that jazz like my name was scat!
College dudes like me too love my name Borat!
And I like my girls thick like chocolate, fat like my wallet
I'm tellin' y'all the truth, like a prophet
And if Gambino on the track, you should cop it
And all y'all Niggas totin' guns need to stop it

[Hook]
I'm so focused. Yeah
I'm so focused. Yeah. (We don't play around like that. Listen.)
We ain't scared a you! Tell them other mutherfucker we prepared for you! Ungh!
We ain't scared a you! Tell them other mutherfuckers we prepared for you! Ungh!

[Verse 2: Truff Syrum]
Before you even know how long this song lasts
You'll be reelin' and feelin' so flabbergasted
Like a fast pass that you can't catch, I'll leave you blasted
Lambasted, like I doused you in acid
I could be takin' some comedy and I'm makin' that tradic
Like I spin, cause I hocus, I focus, I'm flippin' it back and now it's magic
And the beat go from cool, like plan is to janet, to dammit!
Cuties cute in to inspect my go-go gadget
Why? Cause I spit in split time. It's a sign of a double wear prada I'm reachin'
I'm teachin' 'em for a while that you can't deny I'm alive
So existential, my rhymes are quinessential
I'm an educated black and that's a fact. I'm presidential
One riff, and I'm siftin' through niggas lies
Got a gift to keep my eyes on the prize, you best move to the side
Cause I'm goin' for the gold, I'm a stone soldier
Gambino told you Jokers that I'm so, so, so foc- I'm so FO-cusssssssed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
I'm all grown up, but I'm still Childish
It's crazy to think that all them days is behind us
I remember when niggas tried to stop us
Now them same niggas on my dick and try for profit
This is what I asked for. It comes with the territory
This isn't a cry for help, ain't no Pinocchio story
I'm in it just for the glory - I'm in this to win it, babe
Sorry that I came home late

[Verse 1]
I've been lookin' for a driver who is qualified
So if you think that you're the one, step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangsta lean

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

[Chorus]
Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night
'Cause I'm zero to sixty in three point five
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)

[Verse 2]
I've got class like a '57 Cadillac
Got overdrive with a whole lot of boom in the back
You look like you can handle what's under my hood
You keep saying that you will, boy, I wish you would

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

[Chorus]
Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night
'Cause I'm zero to sixty in three point five
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)

[Bridge]
'Cause your Maybach, ain't got what I got (Get it, get it)
Don't stop, it's a sure shot
And your Ferrari, huh boy, I'm sorry
I ain't even worried, so step inside and ride
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride)

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

[Chorus]
Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night
'Cause I'm zero to sixty in three point five
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive)

[Video Intro: Agyness Deyn]
It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

[Chorus: Rihanna]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

[Chorus: Rihanna]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

[Chorus: Rihanna]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

[Chorus: Rihanna]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

[Verse 1]
Memories consume like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Verse 2]
Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Bridge]
I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity
To show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Chorus]
I like my rosé red and my diamonds blue
Plus I keep I dime chick like 5 times 2
Ro-r-ro-r-rose

[Verse 1]
I said my chick look like a barbie, closet ferrari
Horses everywhere man I stay fresh like it's a party
I be I be I be kickin' shit like it's karate
When I tell her suck my dick I say make sure you do it sloppy
She said copy she got me say need me say prolly
Keep Louie on my body zoomies on that Mazarati
With that toolie on the side me try to do me you get bodied
My flow so crazy baby ride that beat like a Bugatti
If she don't sucky sucky then we don't fucky fucky
If I ever ate your pussy shorty you must just be lucky
100 thousand in that tuckie all I know is get this money
I hurry up and throw that paper make it back all on a monday

[Chorus]
I like my rosé red and my diamonds blue
Plus I keep I dime chick like 5 times 2
Ro-r-ro-r-rose

[Verse 2]
Uhh she's a 5 x 2 I like my rose red and my diamonds blue
And she was always on my dick before I met or even knew her
I'll be shitin' on all these hatin' rappers like manure
Spit on it sit on it get on it shift on it
Shorty do some shit on it it's like your life depend on it
I be killin' everything and I don't put the pen on it
And it ain't 'bout a damn thing if it ain't 'bout a benjamin
Bad like Trina got an ass like Serena when he asked me I seen her
Said I passed her to the team I ain't see that ho again
Goin out im goin in and if I think that pussy good
Well likely ima go again

[Chorus]
I like my rosé red and my diamonds blue
Plus I keep I dime chick like 5 times 2
Ro-r-ro-r-rose

[Verse 3]
Yeah red bottles she got red bottom
Them niggas ain't gettin money why I care about em
We get money and ride hard why dare try it
I throw like 50 on your head that'll bedrock em
A young nigga but I ball hard and tippin those 4s like Paul Wall
I be changin' all them hoes in my call log
These rappers hopin' and prayin' that I fall off
Bottles in the air come and make a toast with the hottest of the year
Yeah hoes see me stopin and they stare
Cause they know I get that money and I'm flyer than a Lear

[Chorus]
I like my rose red and my diamonds blue
Plus I keep I dime chick like 5 times 2
Ro-r-ro-r-rose

[Hook]
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go

[Verse]
Childish Gambino
I'm trying to hold my liquor
A vomit stain on my t-shirt
A sick boy but getting sicker
I don't really wanna take another marijuana
But I do it 'cause I'm stupid and it hits me I'm a goner

[Hook]
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go

[Verse 1]
Fairy-tales come and take my hand
Turn the page and help me understand
Maybe, I'll fall in love again
If I know how the story ends
Her song has me
Looking for traces of my melody
And I slowly hum, sing the simple phrase
And not another she can deny
Caught in the sound waves
She can feel my every line
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
For her, yeah

[Hook]
So ohh in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the song she loves
And I never thought I'd say this baby

[Verse 2]
Found a way to whisper in her ear
Everything I wanted her to hear
Said I would catch her every tear
Hold her through the many years
So long I've been looking
For chances of this heart in me
Now I know that she's the lyric and the tune
That explains the meaning of life
There is no music
Without her to give it to me
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
For her, yeah

[Hook]
So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the song she loves
And I never thought I'd say this baby

So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the one she loves
And I'm hoping that she plays me

Ohh in love

[Verse 1]
I got skinny jeans on, so I got my swagger
I got new kicks and embarrass my niggas
A skinny tattoo with a paintball space
So a nigga got bounce like a pinball game
I got housewives like my name was Bravo
The dude is Bueller, the world Chicago
I'm hard to follow, ya boy's sick
I'm Adam Sandler so fuck ya clique
I hang with dogs like Michael Vick
And ya girls get wet like a glass of quick
Cause your boy stay fresh like a bunch of mints
And I fight this flow like a pacifist
A barrel of monkeys, a house of chimps
I'm way more fun than your boyfriend is
He need new jeans like a accident
Cause your boy right here where the action is, ah!

[Hook]
Don't talk about it
You can live without it
You don't even need to go down ?
Don't talk about it
You can live without it
You don't even need to go down ?
Cause you were hollerin', hollerin' "Oh!"
Hollerin', hollerin' "Oh!"
Hollerin', hollerin' "Oh!" girl
Cause you were hollerin', hollerin' "Oh!"
Hollerin', hollerin' "Oh!"
Hollerin', hollerin' "Oh!" girl

[Verse 2]
I said these niggas mad at me like Baby Mammas
These niggas slept on me like old pajamas
You niggas stay soft like Jon Secada
And this nigga stay lit like a candelabra
And even if I didn't have a million dollars
I would still have cream like Beard Papa
Girl I ain't playin' I'll treat ya proper
I got no limits like Silkk the Shocker
You look too sweet like Betty Crocker
You could ride in the front, you could meet my partner
My boy in the back, you could meet my partner
But he ain't got a girl so you should bring your partner
Ya boy got books like he made of lockers
The girl got legs like a pair of Dockers
Tito chip like empinadas
You should shake that shit 'til you got maracas

[Hook]

[Bridge]
If we're together
Can do whatever
I'll make sure that you're close to me
Cause baby girl it's a fantasy
As long as you are here with me tonight

[Hook]

[Outro]
Cause I want ya
Cause I need ya girl
Cause I want ya
Cause I need ya girl, yeah

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
People say I'm crazy, I'm loony, I'm psycho
I like it
I got my shit checked like Nike
Doctor said he'd never seen anything like me
Chances of recovery are nil to not likely
Boy so crazy make your baby mama look sane
Kicking thoughts around like he got a loose brain
I got a whiskey sour, sober
Until I fall down like it's mid-October
Young young Hova
Boy I say, for goodness sake
I'm in my prime like I'm standing on my dinner plate
You niggas innerspace cause you come up Martin Short
I'm so fly I don't need a right wing from Drudge Report

[Hook x2: Childish Gambino]
Ah! Stay wildin' like me!
My name Bam-B!

[Verse 2: G.E.T.H.]
People say I'm angry
But if you're happy, you're crazy
I'm violent, so I've got a blue belt from Renzo Gracie
Read the news today, oh boy, some kids are dead
Pulled the covers over my head and went straight back to bed
Cause even my good days are generally bad
At my happiest, I'm just slightly less sad
And I get mad if you're glad to be alive
Cause I had a chance at a happy life
Good mom, good dad
Seriously trust me, you wouldn't wanna be me
The best days of my life involve leftovers and TV
I got almost no friends and I don't know how to handle this
Even the friends I do got are all moving to Los Angeles
Even I'm tired of my whining
Even I don't want no more of me
I whine more than a 3-year old multiplied by Morrisey
Every time I meet someone who wants to be my friend
The first thought that I have is, "Yo what the fuck is wrong with them?"
I go through life with my fists up
But trust me my fists are all
Full of handfuls of Wellbutrin and Risperdal
I'm depressed y'all
Someone please help me (Please help me)
Seriously (Seriously right now)
Help

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
I'm good with the N
No not the Nina
Mean I'm good with the hammer so I'll fix your broke heater
And not your bro Keeter
I don't tote guns
I never had white so I never needed one
And the hood respect me, I rose from the ashes
They call me the phoenix in the clear rim glasses
They saw me work with all that work
Now I got my own enterprise, call me Kirk
And I'm born on an air force base, so I'm fly
Move out to Decatur, that's Atlanta's Bed-Stuy
I got that pink like pussy
Got that pussy day and night so they call me Kid Cudi
Bitch!

[Hook x2]

[Intro:]
Hold on, let me light my blunt, man
This shit too easy

Yeah!

I'm well ahead, thoroughbred, You just horse shit
Flow out of this world, I'm in orbit
More chips, So them hoes chase me like Norbit
I'm more sick, No anidote
High like Manigault
Flow crack & it's dope
Only talk money, homey I don't understand the broke
Take something from me Niggas come & bust yo canalope
I'm out here grindin', Like a pair of old brakes
Ho, ain't nothing changed, Na, I rep tha Burg all day
Walk it how I talk it so I talk it how I live it
And if you hear me flowin' You should know it's not a gimick
If the topic real shit, You should know they count me in it
Your girlfriend want me in her mouth, Like I'm her dentist
The icing on the cake
I'm like the glaze, or a finished
Marijuanna scented, Windows up, truck tinted
You better

Skinny nigga and I'm tat, tat, tatted up
Run up on me and get rat, tat, tatted up
That's a promise, not a threat I'll back it up
Pockets gettin' like the old Star Jones, Fat as fuck
Got my swagga up, come at me the wrong way
Like what the song say, it'll be a long day
To pass me, you can't see, Got a long way
And even seein' first and I'm comin' 'round that home plate
Come out to the Burg and you'll see that I got it poppin'
If you real, you fuck with me you ain't got an option
See my chain they like "how did he get all them rocks in? "
Want me on your song? I'm a need alot of gwuap then
Breeze home and he said he going choppa shoppin'
So if you got a problem to look to now to stop him
That Pistolvania shit, I'm on it
And I don't run the Burgh, I own it
You better
Be Easy x2
Or it will be a long day
Be Easy x2
Or it will be a long day
Be Easy x2

(Go 'head & get ready to kill yourself, man)
I'm out her slangin' Rollin' with these hustlas
Tryna get rid of all you hatas & you bustas
Blowin' my smoke, I get right to it
When they play this, everybody in this bitch get stupid
I mean they just lose it, wildin' like they pissed off
Find you wrong place or wrong time, you can get lost
Lotta niggas mad, but all the hoes love it
Yea, the young'n super bad, you can call me McLovin
I'm gettin' it good, Makin' my spread
And na, I'm never stingy with a plate, I break bread
My niggas break heads and we 25 deep
I see you tryin' hard, nigga but you not me
I'm fuckin' young star there's no question, I be
Hit hard and then I dance on them like I'm Ali
I'm a certified "G"
So don't think that I'm just rappin' to you
Homey you don't really want something happen to you
You better
Be Easy x2

And I still don't know what led me to you
But I know this, this was meant to be
And girl in your smile I see my everything

[Hook]
But if the words I say
Make the tears roll down
And they find their way to make your heart go down
Your lips can say enough
The tongue controls my mouth
And all that is me is found
In the corners of your mouth

Sometimes I can't believe the things I say to you
But baby every word is true yes it is
And when you kiss me it's all over
You put me under I didn't know that love can hurt so good

And girl in your smile I see my everything

[Intro/Hook]
When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Cause I've been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
Fell into lust, where is the love?
My independency got tendencies of lack of trust
I look at the street corners as my new woman
Seductive as she want to be, hands all on my garments
And luckily, being in denial ain't the case
Cause I know she's unfaithful
Instead I'm grabbing her waist
And every part of her is tasteful
I know you're feelings hating
In fact, you think I'm ungrateful.. I know
Selfish as I wanna be and every time you under me
I get the vibe you might need some time to grow

[Hook]
When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me

[Verse 2]
Cause I been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
And every time that I think of your touch
Adrenaline pump, give me that rush
I'm going like a thief inside the wind
Lord forgive me for my sins
I know she want me more, but I fiend for benjamins
She said I found the root of all evil
And lost a friend
Lost in the world of a young boy from Compton
That never knew love because love was never promised
I know.. selfish as I wanna be
And every time I'm under you, me too
Need time to grow..

[Hook]
When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me

[Chorus]
Make it nasty, make it nasty
Drop, drop it on the bitch make it nasty
Make it nasty, make it nasty
Pop, pop it on the bitch make it nasty

[Verse 1]
Ah, yeah bitch make it nasty
Tongue down the throat while the other bitch gaggin'
Bottles in the basket pills in the plastic
She gonna do drugs but we don't do acid
Fuckin' on the mattress, hear the bed spring
Ain't nothin' better, it's the best thing
Got a China bitch, straight from Beijing
Pussy so tight all she do is scream
Oh, bend it over make it touch your toe
I like how she merry go round, round the pole
Hoes, ah, open close I like when my bitches don't wear no clothes
Is hot up in this muthafucka' re- re- reload
Gangstas in this muthafucka we got this sold
T, T, T-Raw when I walk in the door
Bitches they know, yeah bitches they know, ah

[Chorus]
Make it nasty, make it nasty
Drop, drop it on the bitch make it nasty
Make it nasty, make it nasty
Pop, pop it on the bitch make it nasty
Make it nasty, make it nasty
Drop, drop it on the bitch make it nasty

Pop, pop it on the bitch make it nasty

[Verse 2]
Ah, yeah nigga I'm a star
Stacks on black you can use the black card
Pull up, hop out, valet the car, 'bout to go big got bitches galore
Tippin' on this bitch, just drop it to the floor
I like blowjobs she could be my employee (back it up)
And I put it in her back door now it's lights out (lights out) like Roy (Roy)
Jones, Jr., T-Raw the ruler, slicker than a gold patch gold chain cubic
Poke til it's bruisin' dick on punta gimme gimme chocha kill it like OJ, ah

[Chorus]
Make it nasty, make it nasty
Drop, drop it on the bitch make it nasty

[Intro]
Only if I could

[Verse 1]
Money on my mind, so these haters in the way
Having conversations with that paper every day
I ain’t talking short bread, girl I'm with that major K
Plus I spend it, I can’t take it when the Lord take me away
With my lighter, with my lighter, hey Sissi, fill my drink up
Ain’t no purple, ain’t no pink up in this red cup but I’m fucked up
Staring at your body, God damn your sexy body
I’m Trey, I came to play and I wanna use you as my hobby, girl
Seen so many faces in these unfamiliar cities
Bright skylines got a nigga kinda dizzy
They tryna take my spot well they gon' have to come and get me
My crib is at the top, ain't nobody rolling with we

[Chorus]
If I could, I would bring the whole hood to the top of the world with me
Here's my world, for free, I'm tryna give you what you came to see, yeah
If I could, I would bring the whole hood to the top of the world with me
Here's my world, for free, I'm tryna give you what you came to see, yeah

[Verse 2]
You say you’re working harder, then I swear that you’re a liar
They swear they hot as me, but they ain't never felt the fire
And if you’re talking money, boy you preaching to the choir
And I be in her brain, she can’t think of nothing flyer
For my niggas in the hood, looking at these other niggas like, "I wish a nigga would"
'Cause it ain’t all good, if I could I would, reach out my hands
To everybody that’s suffering, push you down, get up again
Play by my rules, so fuck the plan, it's
Money on my mind, so these haters in the way
Having conversations with that paper every day
I ain’t talking short bread, girl I'm with that major K
Plus I spend it, I can’t take it when the Lord take me away

[Chorus]
If I could, if I could, I would bring the whole hood to the top of the world with me
Here's my world, for free, I'm tryna give you what you came to see, yeah
If I could, I would bring the whole hood to the top of the world with me
Here's my world, for free, I'm tryna give you what you came to see, yeah

[Verse 3]
Lately I'm smokin' more
Yeah, do it for Virginia, every time
Yeah, lately I’m smokin' more, but still I’m focused more
I live today 'cause see, tomorrow, I don’t know for sure
You who I wrote this for, oh yeah, you dope for sure
Oh yeah, you’re raw, so get it cookin', let ‘em know you pure
I prayed for this, so I’m made for this
These niggas just pot holes in the road that I paved for this
Obama tryna turn this motherfucker 'round
And look, they’re tryna put that motherfucker down
Women, please check for somethin' more than stilettos
And young girls, make these little niggas respect you
If I was your father, I’d never neglect you
So a nigga like me probably never had met you
Probably somethin' special, and I’m happy I met you
But you really wanna know me, I just wanna sex you
After you wanna cuddle, I don’t want, but I let you
You made me promise, and I’m honest, try not to forget you
Bond growin' stronger with the brothers that look up to me
It’s more important than whatever that they fuck with me
Luckily my angel speak to God, like what’s up for me
My heart beat for the people who carry the love for me
Left my feelings in the past, you can’t get in touch with me
If he want it, I give 'em cash, I do it reluctantly
But that’s my nigga, I’ma put him back up on his feet
And if he fall, he can still come right back to me

[Outro]
Wish I could take everybody, nigga, on top of the world
Everybody can’t go though, I try my best, if I could then I would
Everybody can’t go, give you what you came to see, yeah
I’ma take who I can, only if I could

[Intro]
I blow it by the O
Yeah bitch
Cudi wassup nigga? We should smoke after this. Real shit

[Verse 1]
Uh, quality weeds in it
They tell me you don't get to die twice, so the high life, we livin'
Throw parties wit bad bitches, the cribs so foggy its hard to see in it
Got girls that wanna go places, scared to show up wit me
They say I'm bad for they image
Oh well, I roll up another L
You thinkin' you got the bomb, a real smoker can tell
Only drink Gin when I fucks wit the liquor
And only smoke joints, I don't fuck wit the swisher
Stayed the night once, now she done smokin' swishers
And I ain't passin' shit, I don't fuck wit you niggas Cuz
I'm smokin' by my lonely
Everyone else tired, high
I'm rollin' up watchin' Family Guy
Finna call Spitta, He the only nigga that can smoke how I smoke
Known as Mister blow it by the O

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I never hold it
Puff, puff, pass
And keep the roach if you smoke it last
A nigga loaded, lookin for another joint but I already rolled it
Chop show me that
And nigga my credit good in every neighborhood
Loan me dat
You probably be where the lames and them phonies at
Poor thing, I'm used to rollin up and smoking the whole thing
Them otha niggas claim and sayin that they get high and leave it wit all kinds of seeds
Probably why you hit it and get the smoker face
This ain't loud, this a noise complaint
Smoke like I got a point to make
That's why everytime you see me got a joint to bake
Tell me dog bring his own in case you need a reminder, mister blow it by the
O-O-O-O-o, o, o, ooooo
Yeah bitch

[Intro: Big Boi]
Ye-yeah
East point in the house like this here

From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails down to the toes
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, we love these hoes
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, we love these hoes
From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails down to the toes
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, we love these hoes
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, we love these hoes

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Don't lie you love them
If you don't you like them hoes a whole lot
Just like your mama Sunday cookin', turkey necks in the pot
You ready to drop your load like prop planes, be dumpin' that cocaine
You ready to turn your 'fro, from natural straight to a cold wave
Dat ho name Betty Big Shoez, she wore them Herman Munster heels
Popped a pill, now she's in your Coupe De Ville, passenger seat
I made her eat my meat while I was rubbin' her coochie
Injection in her top and bottom lip straight from her booty
So Do Re, blow me, Fa So La Ti Da Ha I'm tellin' the truth
You suckin' your tooth you treatin' her like a star boy
From a Figueroa to a Herringbone
From droppin' her off to takin' her home
She tried to pull my rubber off with her pussy muscles that was wrong
The bitch is no good like lesbians with no tongues
You fucked around and knocked her up and now you say she the one
Nigga you dumb, you should have pulled it out and squirted on her eyelash
And let her face be holdin' the baby, now she after yo ass!
Yeah, I told y'all niggas
About god damn takin' them hoez to the Cheesecake Factory
Lettin' them hoez order strawberry lemonade and popcorn shrimps
They ain't goin' do nuthin'
But try to take all your motherfuckin' cheese! (Yeah!)

[Hook: Big Boi]
From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails, down to the toes
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez

[Verse 2: BackBone]
Ay, ay, what's up lil' girl I see you workin' them Valente
She walk wit a fly Sashay
Look here say, I'm Mr. Fat Face I come through swervin' (ay, ay)
You love the way the leather grippin' your butt
Conversation kill 'em, drippin' em up
Relax Shawty, oh lordy, I quote the facts
Whippin' convertible with Daddy Fat Sax
I stay G sharp as a note of music
Call me fresh baked bread, make a broad lose it
I'm just sayin' they just can't stand to see me execute game plan
I slow it down, she like it - speed it up
She poked it out, I beat it up like that
Hit 'em from the back, had to increase that ho vocabulary

[Hook: Big Boi]
From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails, down to the toes
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails, down to the toes
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
Yeah, yeah, Gipp keep it double loco
Met up in Cafe Intermezzo for some late night pastry
Conversation hasty cause I was ready to dip
Sweatsuit velour so I ordered Kahlua
Fell in, hit her with the garden hose
Left her with the pokahose, got up and didn't say goodbye
Her face wrinkle up and froze
Why you leavin' so soon, supposed to
And ain't no question about that
They call me Big Gipp on the southside
Mr. Get Down in the veins so what's the word
Don't fall in love with good pussy off the top
Better leave for two months come back and pop, "study the shit"

[Hook: Big Boi]
From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails, down to the toes
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails, down to the toes
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
They ain’t fucking with me, New Orleans N.O
Old school bitch I let her blow me like nintendo
Black panamera, me and Mac are getting lit though
Switching lanes in that thang 5 percent tint on the windows
I got 20 in my pocket, 30 on wrist, 50 on my neck keep it 100 in this bitch
Hey listen we don’t do no talking, I’m just running up in your shit
And I was never in the walking, I’m just running up in your pick
I say my swagger on infinity, money it ain't a limit
Real nigga every day, start and to the finish
You should hear this roar when I’m starting up the engine
Sounding like a motherfucker lion barking all up in it
Make a dollar every second, thousands on the hour
20 everyday, I’m getting money in the power
I was told never let the youngins get the powder
But now these niggas slipping like they're fucking in the shower
Pause
I really do this, I’m 6'2 and with Ricky Ross
I’m getting to it, you niggas loosing shit, I’m a boss
Yeah I took a loss, I was out in vegas
Me and Gucci Poochy, shooting at the tables
When I was broke, I used to have a dream
Before I had a dream best believe I had them fiends
Steady blowing up my celly, trying to get it any means
My nigga swoochy in the kitchen working up the triple-beams
Breaking ounces off the birdie, money it was dirty
And hammers they was filthy cause niggas was trying to kill me
And that’s word to Osama though
Fuck a bitch and vamonos
Niggas and they diss raps, they dont want no drama though
Leaning off the prometh, sipping Aunt Jemima though
Rollie all bussed down, call that perfect timing though
Tell my jeweler freeze me, just to change the climate ho
Bottom of the mountain and Meek Milly got the climbing though
Your chick my chick, my chick your chick
My swag fly shit, your swag, norbit
Nigga you’re a weirdo, no match forfeit
All these fucking bricks i’m thinking we gonn need a forklift
Coolest on your stereo, I don’t think they hear me though
Catch me in the hood, I be around just like the marry-go
Used to sell them little O's I ain’t talking cheerios
I’m talking about them golden grahams and I don’t eat no cereal
Murder on your record label nigga I’m a serial
Killer plus I’m realer this is scarier than thriller
In the villa counting trilla, with shorty she vanilla
As far as work, I make that fucking butter fly like caterpillars
And my flow be on some other shit
Hotter than an oven get
I just got his girl's number, he gon' need another bitch
Maker her fuck my other bitch, then put her on a punishment
She said she in love with me and she dont know my government
Shorty tripping, where your luggage at
Broke niggas never seen me cause I'm where the money at
All I know is hustle hard, like a got a hundred pack
A nigga get my jewels, I'mma kill him, and I don't want them back
Wear them to your funeral, be stunting while they're viewing you
Momma wouldn't notice, she's like what the hell they do to you
Clip full of hollow heads, make me put a few in you
Yeah nigga, I will ruin you

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
You see I run with them dudes, get loose with them pipes out
You sweet as ice cream, two scoops what your life bout
I'm heavy on the scene, bad news when the mic's out
And heavy on the lean, Timb boots or the whites out
It's Pittsburgh's kick flipper, spit words great nigga
Disturbed? You could get your shit curbed way quicker
Mad cus I spit that hard
And I'm with that broad
Fast lane how I rip that car
Fast change, how'd I get that large?
Cus the flow is dope
Yours, yea you know's a joke
Sure, here you hope to blow
I'm out to move the units from the set to Kosovo
Flow like the Rope-a-Dope
Crack, call me coke to smoke
You niggas washed up and they ain't even started yet
A lot of new niggas coming out but I'm the hardest yet (Yes)
One I can fear, I ain't met an artist yet
Throw the lead, that'll roll his head right up off his neck

[Hook: Jay-Z sample] (Repeat 2x)
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em niggas scared of that black

[Verse 2:Wiz Khalifa]
Gettin' cake's what my life bout
Them long days, takin' them nights out
The grind and paper chase what I write bout (Yea)
I'm a hustler, cake is my lifestyle
And for the fam, takin' your lights out
You niggas want a problem you can get it
I'll take your wig, all of it get splitted
Leave your dome throbbin' in your fitted
My advice to you is just be cool
And that's for all of y'all
A pimp always with a bad chick like in Monster's Ball
I'mma show you how monsters ball
Yea, the rap livin', crack spittin' bars and all
And your punch lines are hardly hard
It ain't the flow, its the fact you niggas broke that make me "hardy-har"
Wiz Khalifa leave your body scarred
Fuck your plans up
And if I can't get to you dog, I fuck your mans up
So just listen fag, most niggas quick to brag
Me, I'll get you zip and tagged
Dragged in a kitchen bag

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Smallz Money]
Who you know keep it gudda as me
Popular, me so I'm floodin' the streets
Wolves hungry so I stay with my heat
They wanna slump me, leave me six feet deep
They want me cuffed doin' time up creek
I spit hot when I rap to the beat
I stay high off the limiest chief
Every day I be grindin' for cheese
In the club with the nine in my sleeve
Act tough and you could die when I squeeze
Got shooters in the weeds like I'm Vietnamese
They keep clappin' 'till them hammers go ding
My money long you could call me the king
Thought your man was gettin' money caught him pawning his bling
Niggas say they blood in like 'Ricans and Vatos
I'm hood in, hood out, like Dominicans papo
See y'all broke, on the block servin' fiends Dove soap
I keep the snub close, pop let the chrome glow
Shots in ya dome ho, chyea

[Hook x2]
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em niggas scared of that black
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em niggas scared of that black

[Verse 1]
I grew up in New York City
Since I was born on Broadway, baby
Moved downtown when I was just nineteen
To start a new life on the New York scene

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no way I could be stopped
Was taking my best shot
I had a better plan
There's no way I could be stopped
Was coming for your spot
I met a better man

Amen
On the runway, dressed in his best
Amen, fashion
On the runway, work it, Black Jesus
Amen
On the runway, dressed in his best
Amen, fashion

[Verse 2]
Dancing in my revelation
Underground pop civilization
Concrete poetry to feed my mind
Old symbolism was left behind

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no way I could be stopped
Was taking my best shot
I had a better plan
There's no way I could be stopped
Was coming for your spot
I met a better man

Amen, fashion
On the runway, work it, Black Jesus
Amen
On the runway, dressed in his best
Amen, fashion

Put it on, amen, fashion
Celebrate, ooh-ooh, wear out your vision

[Intro]
(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains, you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 2]
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up, you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)
And I hope it rains, you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

[Bridge]
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you

[Hook: Big Sean]
My life is nothin' but a G thing
Pick up 100 G's, take off a G-string
Clique full of Gs and some bad-ass bitches
Oh, your ear to the streets? Okay, well, holla if you hear us
I keep it G, I keep it G
I keep it G, I keep it G

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
My life is nothin' but a G thing
Pick up 100 G's, take off a G-string
Oh, Jesus, they love me to pieces
Got up in the game cause I was tired of the bleachers
Get rich, repeat it, taste it, I'm delish
Lookin' so good she put me on her fuck for free list
I turn her on 'fore I go in
I swear that pussy keyless
I might let her ride the mic and let her friend come get the remix
Rollin' rich nigga weed, with a rich nigga bitch
Ridin' 'round the city, in a rich nigga whip
Yea a nigga paid a grip, for all this rich nigga shit
And all these bad hoes, they want a rich nigga's dick
O God, this life is such a blessin'
See I smoke 'til I can't smoke no more and drink is no exception
Man these crazy niggas crazy, nigga when you gon' learn yo lesson
They won't talk shit about you plaques, but they gon' talk when you arrested

[Hook: Big Sean]
My life is nothin' but a G thing
Pick up 100 G's, take off a G-string

I keep it G, I keep it G

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
10 Ben Franklins, nigga, that's a G homie
Flash the pinky ring, baby you can ski on it
Put it in your uterus, U-Haul, I move the shit
Baby I'm a shark and these rappers taste like tuna fish
Look at this, movie with no movie script
I diarrhea: do this shit
Just bought an old-school so that's my newest whip
Cartiers on, I can see all through the shit
I spell southside with an F that stand for foolishness
Fuck that shit, fuck with us, we'll have you in some luxury
I need a stash pot for a couple keys
When I'm in the Gucci store, I spend some G's to wear some G's
If you is a sucker, I'm a charge you ass a sucker fee
Luckily, smoking on that vote for me, Presidential evidence
Truck so big, I can't park it at my residence
Wallet so big, I can't put it in my back pocket
Soon as her ass dropping, the cash dropping

[Hook: Big Sean]
My life is nothin' but a G thing
Pick up 100 G's, take off a G-string
Clique full of Gs and some bad-ass bitches
Oh, your ear to the streets? Okay, well, holla if you hear us
I keep it G, I keep it G
I keep it G, I keep it G

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I deserve congrats (Why?)
I just turned my old car into a new
My basement into a presidential view
One into two, a milli into a few
Niggas want to see me fall, ah shit
I'll fall off and turn into you
Fuck around, turn this peace sign to a piece
Tool Time: now you little mothafuckas screwed
I feel like slappin' a ho
Keep a bad bitch at the passenger door
Never ever break these broads off a lil
Once you give 'em something they be askin' for more
If I run out then I'm snatchin' up yours
Man I remain a quadruple-triple OG, triple OG, triple OG
And that's not a maybe either, nigga, that's fa-sho

[Hook]

Check it
Sky’s the limit so I’m reaching for the stars
Im tired of being that nigga that they keep behind bars (bars)
Whats good, you got it, I’ma take yours
Im hood, fuck a gun, I break jaws
Understood, its nothing to bang for the cause
And I should cos you frontin’ bang with the force
Rats playin’ in the walls, cats playin’ in the halls
But niggas know after a certain hour stay indoors
Cos im not responsible for what I might do
Or what might happen if dog come through
Its gon’ be a problem cos man if I catch em I’ma rob em
Pleeeease somebody stop em
But for that its too late, I gotta eat
You ain't, you straight
I ain't gon take it all… today!
You can say what you want but cha know the truth
X is a beast in the streets and the booth

Got me f-cked up if you thought that I fell off (come on)
Now niggas wanna ride dick get the hell off
Come on Chulo, we both know you culo

Beefing for real, nigga I sleep with the steel

Niggas make threats yet they wait for a year

[Intro]
Ahh, yes

[Verse 1]
Well, looky here, looky here, ahh, what do we have?
Another pretty thang ready for me to grab
But little does she know that I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night, it is her I'll be holdin'

[Pre-Chorus]
"I love you so" (Hey) That's what you'll say (That's what you'll say)
You'll tell me, "Baby, baby, please don't go away" (Don't go away)
But when I play (But when I play), I never stay (I never stay)
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say

[Chorus]
Run, run, run away, run away, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Uh, ah-yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, let me think, let me think, ahh, what should I do?
So many eager young bunnies that I'd like to pursue
Now even though they eating out the palm of my hand
There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it!

[Pre-Chorus]
"I love you so" (Hey) That's what you'll say (That's what you'll say)
You'll tell me, "Baby, baby, please don't go away" (Don't go away)
But when I play (But when I play), I never stay (I never stay)
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say

[Chorus]
Run, run, run away, run away, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby, uh

[Bridge]
See, I ain't tryna hurt you, baby, no, no
No, I just wanna work you, baby, yup, yup
See, I ain't tryna hurt you, baby, no, no

I be spittin' fire like a dungeon dragon
I be spittin' fire like a dungeon dragon
Leggo!

[Freestyle:]
@MeekMill, follow me bitch
Don't you spit, girl swallow my ish
If I had a dollar every model I hit
And a quarter just for every single bottle I sip
I'd prolly make the Forbes
No prolly, it's for sure
I'm prolly on the tour
Prolly partyin' some more
Back stage goin' ham
Sloppy Toppy On The Floor
I been winnin' whole game
I monopoly the board

I'm verified, give me my stamp
I'm underrated, K. Durant
My money tell me to get it jumpin
I play the ramp
You like Pacquiao
You wanna face the champ?
I'm Floyd, in my new toy
On my way to Boyd
You lookin like a boy
And this is abuse, this is the truth
Treat the mic like my toilet I shit in the booth
Get so many funny stares
Hard wrists in the coupe
On my old school shit just listenin' to SNOOP!
Rollin' down the street
Gin with the Juice
Gettin' money now you hate
This what you do?!

You ever play roulette?
Well this what you do:
Put a bullet in the gun and put it to you
You pull the trigger back
If the hammer don't bang
You pull that trigger again til you blow out your brain
You hater!

I'm way past ruthless
You don't know I'm hot?
You way past stupid!
Everybody know I made my movement
Why they in Phantom bangin' Maybach Music?
Cause I'm rollin with Ross and Ross rollin' with Splif
Ain't gotta shoot the vid' to show you we on some shit
You can look at the neck and tell it glow from the wrist
I ain't even drop an album, but I'm global as shit
Shout out to Khaled
We the best
Ask the hoes, they gonna tell you he a mess
Why you dissin' though?
He a stress
Say the wrong thing
He gonna need a vest!

I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
Sippin' on Patron and Ciroc I'm on
Killin' this beat
What the fuck am I doin'?
30 pounds of weed, lookin' like a front lawn!

I got it in
I got it out
Who in the buildin'?
Let me show 'em out...

Murder after murder, nigga you ain't heard
'Cause when it come to beef, I'm puttin' bread all on my burger
Man them shooters be so hungry
With bodies on they burner
I could send em to your crib
And once they spot you and confirm ya
They gon tear you out the frame
Fuckin' rip your picture
Send a message to your homie just to make him get the picture
And if they tellin on me
I could make em hit the witness
They been off 'em like a summons
Dawg don't make me give 'em business
Talkin all that killa shit now what's your body count
Shotty bounce will make your motherfuckin' body bounce
We on the graveyard shift where all the bodies found
Catch em on twenty-threes

Ah

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
What's your body count nigga?
I'm double digits
What you talkin' bout nigga?

Bad bitches in the house

Couple million in the couch
Right here where I'm sittin'
What's your body count nigga?
I'm double digits
What you talkin' bout nigga?
It's time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
They all exquisite
Couple million in the couch
Right here where I'm sittin'
Im Stacking Money On Top Off Money

Once I Master The Craft Then Its A Fucking Rap
Plan My Two Feet On The Map No Matter Where Im At
Im Making Big Moves

Fucked Lady Luck

Im On A Fucking Mish To Get All Of My Niggas Rich
And They Never Trip Cause They Already Know I Got This Shit
Golf Wang You A Poser You Can Eat A Dick
While I Reefer Twist
And Be On Point Like A Eastern Pic
Living Life By The Horns
Bitch Nigga You Need A Grip
But You Ain't Got The Drive Or The Talent To Compete With This
I Let The Cameras Flash On My Half Famous Ass
And Im Cool With That
The Hunger For More Is What Makes It Last
Blowing Tour Money
Just Looking At This Fucking Swag
Niggas Trying To Do Me Is Suffering Like A Sucer Tash
My Ambitions As A Rider My Mothers Lag
Killing Every Thing
Tell The Coroners Bring A Couple Bags
Smokers Going H.A.M
My Fans Tell Me Im Fucking Rad
Bitches Getting Thrown Out The Crib Like They Fucking Jazz
Be-lair Hopes

Bad Bitches Rolling Weed Wherever Domnier Smokes
And You Can Catch Me In The Grass Like A Fucking Scare Crow
Stoner Swaging
Fitted Hiding My Fucking Hair Bro

You See The Energy I Be Giving Out At The Concert
Air Plane Mode For Them Hoes Blowing My Line Up

Getting My Eyes On The Prize
Bitch Niggas Yo Times Up

Mirror On The Wall Saying
Genesis The Freshest Of Freshman
Even Upper Class Take Lessons
Wanna Make Some Bread
Well Im The Shit You Should Invest With
If You Ain't Talking Money
Then Start Heading To The Exit
Everything I Touch Is Like Baker With A Death Wish
Its About That Time That You Give Me My Respect Bitch

[Intro: André 3000]
Yeah

[Verse: André 3000]
What can make a nigga wanna take another nigga life?
What can make a nigga wanna do another nigga wife?
Like a butter knife
What can make a nigga wanna get his body so high
That can't go to sleep, don't wanna eat?
Pray to God that he don't do crack
What can make a nigga wanna cut a beauty queen raw
Feeling every drip drop she can generate, imitate seesaws?
What can make a nigga wanna fight a whole night club?
Figure that he ought to maybe be a pimp
Simply cause he don't like love
What can make a nigga wanna achy, break all rules?
In a book when it took a lot to get you hooked up to this volume?
What can make a nigga wanna lose all faith in
Anything that he can't feel through his chest wit' sensation?

[Intro]
Dear God, I pray, for all, my haters
All my haters, all my haters, all my haters
Dear God, I pray, for all, my haters
All my haters, all my haters, all my haters, all my haters
They hatin' on me but I don't know why they tryna stop me
Tryna slow down my grind, ah
I won't let 'em, I won't let 'em, I won't let 'em, I won't let, nah
They tryna stop me but I won't let 'em
Ain't no way to say no how
I can't give up, I ain't gon' give up
Cannot give up, I just can't give up

[Verse 1]
My life is a movie and everybody's watching
Are you entertained looking at me partner?
I made it out the hood, let us get this understood
People think my life is good, but there's way more too
Rumors spreading fast, they trying to take my glory
But it's two sides to everybody's story
So let me tell this story truthfully, no lying
I hate when my momma called me crying
Telling me "Dre, I feel like dying"
Telling me "Dre, I feel like dying"
I remember growing up west side of Atlanta
Couldn't pay the light bill so we kept the candles
I'm asking mama questions, she giving false answers
I didn't want to leave my hood, I just couldn't stand it
Moved to Mississippi and I finally had a family
Moved to Mississippi and I finally had a family
My dad, my sister, and my newly born brother
The first time I had to call another woman mother
Flair I love ya, I know I didn't show it
My mom asking for money and you asking for nothing
Every day I told ya, one day I'ma make it
And if I never told ya, really appreciate ya
And if I never told ya, I really appreciate ya
And if I never told ya, I really appreciate ya

[Chorus]
It's in my soul, I got passion
I won't stop, I can't stop rappin'
Haters blastin' out they mouth
Just 'cause Soulja from the South
But I won't stop, I can't stop, no
I won't stop, I can't stop, dawg
I won't stop, nah, just can't stop, dawg
Ain't gon' stop, dawg, I can't stop, dawg

[Verse 2]
I got girls claiming I got 'em pregnant (Pregnant)
My life is really hectic (Hectic)
I'm going through the spectrum (Spectrum)
Don't hate it, just respect it (Respect it)
And if you can't respect it then I guess that's too bad (Then I guess that's too bad)
And if my life don't change then I guess that's too sad (Then I guess that's too sad)
With every move I make I make a lot of people mad
But with a lot of moves I make, I make a lot of people glad
Glad, glad yeah, glad, man, I do it from the heart
And if I wasn't gonna finish, why I would I even start?
I'm Soulja Boy Tell 'Em and my life is a movie
But all I gotta say is please free my nigga Gucci
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em my life is a movie
But all I got to say is, mane, free my nigga Gucci

[Chorus]
It's in my soul, I got passion
I won't stop, I can't stop rappin'
Haters blastin' out they mouth
Just 'cause Soulja from the South
But I won't stop, I can't stop, no
I won't stop, I can't stop, dawg
I won't stop, nah, just can't stop, dawg
Ain't gon' stop, dawg, I can't stop, dawg

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Shamed on, played on, motherfucking hated on
Hated misery so I keep my company gone
Six blondes, no bras, begging me to fuck em raw
Only with a rubber on, get served rawly raw
Sick world living in, pissing in the whirlpool
Last dollars on this coffee table, but i’m good
Head to the sky, praying like Christ would
It’s hard to level when all of us harvest from the ghetto
You are fellows, get marshmellowed, your so sparrow
Waking up on god’s green, bloody on your knees
These malt liquor vendors sell it to you no ID
These young niggers hot on pills down one degree
My art speaks illustrated it on the beat
If all fails at least I live with memories
Judgement day, my only day of death
So motherfucker dont you test me, nigga

[Hook: Tyga]
I came rolled in a break
Your a real hater I can see it on your face
You don’t wanna do that
Motherfucker, you don’t wanna do that
No, been hustling all my life
I wanna do right, road to success only way to survive
So I gotta do that, yeah I gotta do that
Motherfucker, let the angels sing
Oh, oh, oh, do that
Oh, oh, oh
Let the angels sing
Oh, oh, oh, do that
Oh, oh, oh
Apollyons theme

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, how you say you innocent, illegitimate children
Anger hurts, who feels it all this resentment
Fuck em, middle finger never bent
Only at the lord’s gates judging me to let me in
It’s funny when these federal bills spent in from ceilings
Since they figured it in back turns, no friends
I’m only human fly as donatella 'sace
We all die soon like gianni, no autopsy
Hard body, funerals invite only
Body eroded get you buried with black roses
Time told by a rolly quarter on my arm
Fifty thou, keep the Reaper blinded by your charm
Get money like i’m Jewish
Cheaper than the newest, all my girls indian style like buddhist
Hands to their booties that’s my call of duty
Motherfucker toodles

[Hook: Tyga]

[Intro]
Yeah this is my story, my struggle, uh
My bittersweet symphony, my pain, check it

[Verse]
Food getting lower, money coming slower
Damn land lord keep bitching cause you owe her
I'm too afraid to grow up, I pray to God I blow up
And roll up in something foreign where the front doors go up
I wonder if my peers could hear my prayers
The only nigga got me scared is the man upstairs
When my back against the wall, I'mma face my fears
I'll swallow my pride 'fore I swallow a tear
Cause I be going hard, Stevie on his job
I'm praying until something happen, I'm answering to God
These wolves got me scarred
I try so hard to survive, guess just to prosper gotta strive
Then I hit the stage, all gone and blazed
Everybody know my name and the song I sing
I rejoice my pain and they doing the same
And the haters gonna hate, I'm just doing my thing
Got my bad bitch with me she so dangy
Said she love ASAP cause we so tangy
Living life fast so I feel like kids
And I'm blowing up quick so I feel like B.I.G
With the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
Now we doing deals with the major businesses
Get a little change, niggas feel a little strange
Uh-oh truck flow, pull off in a range
Niggas say I changed but I'm living it up
Shit if money didn't change you, you ain't getting enough
Fuck coppin a car, I'm Tryna fly to the stars
Smooth on the moon and I be mobbing to mars
Niggas say I'm ill, y'all ain't telling me shit
Cuz the nights we was ill, y'all ain't help me with shit
Ooh now my money change drastic, The coupe do gymnastic
The doors lift up and the roof do a back flip
Zooming through traffic, probably with a bad bitch
Slash actress soon we on our way to Saks Fifth
Life was so tragic, all of that was past tense
Now I'm living lavish, this got to be magic

[Outro]
If I should die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
As I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord I rest in peace
If I die before I wake
Please rejoice this song I sing
As I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord I rest in peace
Yeah, sup motherfuckers
This for all you bitch ass niggas you bitch ass bitches out there
This is under the influence
Domo Genesis, he out there killing shit nigga that's what he do
He rips that motherfucking shit
Me? I'm L-Boy
I'm just under the influence
Of crack cocaine nigga!
Yeah I'm a crackhead
I don't how the fuck I got in here I'm just in here nigga
But this some real nigga shit
It just the interlude, give y'all niggas a break
Roll up some more mother fucking shit
Whether it be crack, weed, whatever the fuck you like nigga
Light that shit nigga
Smoke that shit nigga!
Cause that's what the fuck I'mma do!
I'mma do my shit nigga!
You feel me? You better feel me nigga!
Cause this is what I do nigga!

Cause everything I say, I mean

Cause the beat just dropped nigga!
I should rap but I dunno how!
So I'mma just keep talking
Nigga

[Intro]
I always knew one day I would become the best rapper
I just want to thank all my fans, I dedicate this to you
I call it "2 Milli"

[Verse 1]
I did what I wanted, niggas did what they could
A lion wouldn’t cheat but a Tiger would
I only keep real niggas in my stable
A million dollar chain, I’m feeling like Gucci’s label
So icey I really don’t care
Haters green as a pool table and they twice as square
Had to cut a couple bitches, them niggas need stitches
I’m getting money out the tree y’all niggas getting switches
Similar to Nas, I need a mic though
Chop the bread up, Tae Kwon Do
They pass me the game like Tom Brady
These rappers chances looking slim just like Shady

[Interlude]
Let me just take a brief intermission
I'm comin' right back at you with more bars than a motherfuckin' prison
Thank you, man, for following me, twitter.com/souljaboytellem
Two million followers, I love all my fans, let me eat these bitches

[Verse 2]
Niggas locked behind my bars I'm taking out prisoners
Sit back relax receiving my residual
Think this song is dope shit wait 'til you see the visual
Please brace yourself this shit about to get critical
Let it be known I got rappers on my hit list
I got so many gifts you would swear I stole Christmas
Word to the Grinch bitch my style will switch quick
I knew this all along I was waiting just to hit the kill switch
Since day one man your boy been the truth
Broke so many records like I’m in the glass booth
Like I’m in the glass studio breaking out barriers
Back when crime mob was screaming Ellenwood Area
Nigga I ain't scared of ya, never ever will be
I’m screaming I’m the best till these rappers kill me
Make the people feel me like the blind men do
On your girl, head so much, like her favourite shampoo
I’m travelling where I want, soulja’s vacation
My mind is so free, emanicapation proclamation
Im so hot, haters evaporating
6 bitches on my dick I’m elimidating
Im high every friday just like smokey
Im spitting real shit, these niggas spitting Karaoke
Hit stick with the flow just like Madden
Im so high on my carpet feeling like Alladin
I spit hot flames bitch just like a dragon
And my pants saggin
Spell it backwards niggas
Niggas get heated when they see the coupe on
I dont give a fuck got my Pyrex suit on
I’ma keep rapping til the fans hear the best of me
Im cooking up the game bitch yeah I got the recipe
You ain't gotta like me just please respect it
Hip hop is dead nigga let me resurrect it
Microphone check it, uno, dos, tres
I’ma keep spitting til they crown me the best
The rap games a mess, let me clean it up
Its a pigsty they going ham give it up

[Interlude]
Man, man, I know a lot of these niggas out here slept on me, man, you feel me
But now I'm, like, they worst nightmare and shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on, man
Shit don't make no motherfuckin' sense, man
All my fans, hold your head, man, I got y'all man, it's nothin', you feel me?
Twitter.com/souljaboytellem, I'm doin' this for y'all
I broke two million, so I'm dedicatin' this to you
But at the end of the day, man, I know y'all love me, so I love y'all back
I'm the new best rapper

[Verse 3]
Flyin' down the highway, a million on the dashboard
You can't start my car up unless you got the password
I’m something like a prophecy, spit so properly
When my album drops, watch how many rappers copy me
Haters opinions are obsolete
Don’t make pop music, so it ain’t no pop in me
And my brains a bitch, where she at when I need her?
You pack nines, I pack nine kilometers
You didn't want beef, why would you start it?
Canoons flashing like you walkin' down the red carpet
First you was nameless, now I'ma make you famous
Hit you with the stainless and leave your ass brainless

[Outro]
Best rapper

[Verse 1]
Oh, yeah, got you drinking out them white cups, sodas
All this shit so foreign to you, thick smoke, choking
Baby, get familiar with the order
Just crack it, then pour it, then sip slow, then tip low
My eyes red but my brim low, that XO
She climbing, straight to the top, forgetting why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate slow, put that rum down you don't wanna die tonight
I promise, when you’re finished, we’ll head to where I’m living
The party won’t finish, it’s a fucking celebration, oh yeah
For my niggas out tonight
And they high off Shakespeare lines
There's enough to pass around, you don't gotta wait in line
And the clocks don't work, you don't gotta check the time
And the blinds don't work, you don't gotta check the sky
We'll be going all night, 'til light

[Chorus]
I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys

[Verse 2]
And you've been going hard, baby
Now you rolling with some big boys, baby
Got a lot you wanna show off, baby
Close that door before you take your fucking clothes off, baby
Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
I thought I passed my peak, and I'm experiencing fall
And all I wanna do is leave cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, tryna concentrate to breathe
Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, heavy gum chewing
Go on if you thirsty, baby, if you dancing
Grab a cup of that XO, baby, I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl, I've been fiending
For another round, don't you blame it on me
When you're grinding up your teeth and it's fucking hard to sleep

[Chorus]
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high

[Verse 3]
Baby, come over here and
Ride it out, ride it out
Work that back 'til I tire out
Roll that weed, bring that fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Bed so wet when I eat you out
Girl's friends scream that I'm creeping out
If they're not down, better keep em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking reefer now
Bet a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out
Baby, baby

[Chorus]
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and ride it out
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Come over here and ride it out
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh

[Outro]
That north north, that up top, that OVO and that XO
That north north, that up top, that OVO and that XO
That north north, that up top, that OVO and that XO
That north north, that up top, that OVO and that XO (XO)
That north north, that up top, that OVO and that XO
That north north, that up top, that OVO and that XO
That north north, that up top, that OVO and that XO
That north north, that up top, that OVO and that XO

[Hook:]
Ay suckas hate to see me get it like so, so
Bitches say they dig the way I kick it like so, so
Filthy rich and still I keep it pimping like so
Still the realest nigga in it with a image like so, so
Shawty just might pull up in a ride like so, so
With a bad bitch with him inside like so, like so
Super fly like so, niggas lying like "SO?"
Still spit it how I live it on the Hill, here I go, go

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey all I do is go and go by this and that to so-and-so
Lil' PeeWee say "They hate to see ya ballin bro," you know I know
So what though? They can't stop it, they just watch it as this dough I blow
With millions in my pocket, shut it down in every store I go
Atlanta on my shoulders, oh I tow it like a soldier though
Suckers I expose or minimize in exposure so
They trying to make me kill 'em, I'm controlling my emotions though
Why you niggas lookin so surprised? They not supposed to blow?
From trapping to the club scene, rapping to the big screen
Fashion, television, listen shawty doin big things
Get team money, fuck a bitch if she ain't coming
So conceited ain't funny, if she ain't fly well she ain't for me
Pretty face, fat booty with a magazine stomach
Catch me somewhere where it's sunny, it ain't us if we ain't stunting
Say we running we ain't fronting, they be tripping, ain't nothing
If they kick it we be putting in, man I'm tryna teach you something man

[Hook:]
Ay suckas hate to see me get it like so, so
Bitches say they dig the way I kick it like so, so
Filthy rich and still I keep it pimping like so
Still the realest nigga in it with a image like so, so
Shawty just might pull up in a ride like so, so
With a bad bitch with him inside like so, like so
Super fly like so, niggas lying like "SO?"
Still spit it how I live it on the Hill, here I go, go

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Is there a message from the greatest? Yeah, go get yourself some paper playa
Try to do as I do, God but I anticipate you'd fail
It could be that my greasy yellow deuces make them hate me where
They try me bruh, they get tore up just like Drake did his ACL
Respected foreign and domestic in the A as well
Feel like 'Pac did when he said y'all act like y'all want me to stay in jail
I'm raisin hell today cause yeah I heard about you suckas
Use my absence as a present, so fuckin ass time to suffer
Rappers keep on tryin to catch-up(ketchup) but they just can't cut the mustard, huh?
I'm way ahead, gone stay ahead, so fuck if they say such-and-such
You keep the credit, what I need a trophy and a statue for?
Millions stackin up and I don't give a fuck what awards show pass me up
My movie agent Brian always ask me what I'm rapping for
It's passion, I wouldn't trade it for all the diamonds out in Africa
Sahara hot, everything you dropping coming after us
My character is rare and for that reason they be starin, huh?

[Hook:]
Ay suckas hate to see me get it like so, so
Bitches say they dig the way I kick it like so, so
Filthy rich and still I keep it pimping like so
Still the realest nigga in it with a image like so, so
Shawty just might pull up in a ride like so, so
With a bad bitch with him inside like so, like so
Super fly like so, niggas lying like "SO?"
Still spit it how I live it on the Hill, here I go, go
We came in together, but you held me
The process walking right through that door, at the entry
I can't seem to remember, the lights were so bright
And the disco-ball blurred in the turn of that night
But it was perfect I was told the tux was starched and all
Grabbed the glass of punch nervousness struck, stood by that wall
Arms folded, myself I didn't know yet
Until you came over, stood by me, you poasted
You put your hand out like I was stranded
Tried to pull me on that dance floor.I stepped backwards
See I wasn't ready yet, but you were my medicine
You showed me that trust through that love that you held me with
Our backs against the wall as the DJ would spin
The soundtrack had changed as he played that mix
Our lives flashed in front of us, just a glimpse
We were together and experience this

You finally pulled me up
I didn't want to
But you filled me up, from the bottom of my heart
And as we walked through that gymnasium that I'd been watching
Feeling like my chest would explode from my heartbeat
To the middle of the floor, I almost panicked
You put your hand out and I fearfully grabbed it
The most beautiful thing that I'd seen on this planet
She laughed cause you could tell that I didn't know how to dance yet
We started moving
And I, didn't know what I was doing
You whispered, "Don't you love music?
It's such a gift and I'll give it to you
But you gotta use it"
I strayed
She brought me back in
Trying to sneak a flask outside of that gym
She said, "You don't need that, look within"
She hugged me, looked into my eyes, she gave me a kiss
And she said, "I can't help you, if you don't let me
You're here to live just be, don't forget me
The end of this dance you don't want to regret me
Live, cos tonight you'll all be set free"

"Last dance!" the DJ yelled
Looked into her eyes and I could see myself
Slow motion
Frozen, toast to this moment
Like there is no morning, like there is no mourning
No emotions, you on my shoulder
Me lead and you follow
As we circle the floor like the globe
Through this infinite mass
Makes us seem so small
With you in my hand like the skyline holds the stars
Not letting go
But I can't hold on
Fading through my fingertips
Watching us fall
I try to catch you with my arms
I would never take it for granted when I had you in my palms
To all I ever wanted
Please play my song
And put the record to the needle
Don't ever touch that off switch
You are perfect, forget that prom dress
My God, seconds away from God yes
Somebody turned the heat on in this party
Or we’re becoming one because I’m melting into your body
One being, heartbeating, universe falling
The ground split right between us and that concrete
Separated my love
I could hear her calling
Separated, but I could hear her calling
Goodbye forever
Never see you again
Winterball 2012
"The End"

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I used to sit with my dad in the garage
That sawdust, that Pinesol, and the moss
Around every spring, when the winter thawed
We’d huddle around the radio, twist the broken knob
710 AM, no KJR. Dave Niehaus' voice would echo throughout the yard
Couldn’t have been older than 10
But to me and my friends
The voice on the other end might as well have been God’s
1995, the Division Series
Edgar's up to bat
Bottom of the 11th inning
Got the whole town listening
"Swung on and belted," the words distorted. "Joey Cora rounds third!
Here comes Griffey! The throw to the plate’s not in time!
My, oh my, the Mariners win it!"
Yes. Fireworks, they lit up that ceiling in the Kingdome
We had just made history

[Interlude: Dave Niehaus]
"Swung on and lined down the left field line for a base hit! Here comes Joey! Here comes Junior to third base! They’re gonna wave him in! The throw to the plate will be… late! The Mariners are going to play for the American League Championship! I don’t believe it! It just continues! My, oh my!"

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Laces woven, barely holdin’ that stitch
The creases of time amongst the grime and the grit
Where the leather he used to pound his fists
To some it's just a mitt, but see that glove was him
Yep, tell me stories on the field, with that sun-stained brim
Blood under my chin, he taught me how to spit
Sunflower seeds back with me and my crew
Sunburnt arms
Big League Chew
Yeah we were like, The Sandlot after dinner
After practice we'd listen
To the M’s in the kitchen
And if mom wasn’t trippin’
"Come on dad! Please, I swear, just one more inning!"
Voice went "pump, pump!" through the system
"Break out the rye bread! It's grand salami time!"
"My, oh my! Another victory!"
Yes. My city, my city
Childhood, my life watchin’ Griffey right under those lights

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Under that light rain, gleaming in that night game, can't stop now
Keep moving, no brake pads!
Came here to prove a point, live my life on the field
Make history in between the base paths
And compete against the fear that is in me that’s my only barrier and I swear that I'mma break that!
From the mud
The cleats that we drug
Through the feet
This is that moment, and you can't take it back
I don’t really collect cards anymore, just a box and some old cardboard
Memories embedded in the dust, in the fibres that age just like us
Livin’ somewhere off in the drawer
This is what you make of it. Yeah, we play to win
Live it like we’re under the lights of the stadium
Fight until the day that God decides to wave us in
Right, until he waves us in
It’s my city, my city, childhood, my life. That’s right
Under those lights
My city, my city, childhood, that’s right. Niehaus, "My, oh my!"
Come on. My city, my city, childhood, my life. That’s right, under those lights
It's my city, my city, childhood, my life, Niehaus. My, oh my. Rest in peace
Verse 1: Drake

I always wonder why you bother putting makeup on
You don't need it
And even though I always tell you that you're beautiful
I'll repeat it
Cause I don't want no singer, I don't want no model
And I don't want no fashion designer or nothing
I just want your love
I promise you that's more than enough for me
Chorus:
All you gotta do is come real
Shawty what the deal?
Dont think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal
I wouldn't have it any other way (2x)

Verse 2: Kyoko

Baby just because I wanna look good
Don't mean that I ain't real
Not in the least bit
All the clothes and doing of my hair, face, nails
Make me feel good
And I'll keep it up
Im not sayin what you been stayin to me
Ain't exactly
What I need to feel and know
You're the one I'm wearing for
And where I'll always go when I need a real love
Kyoko Chorus:
So stay real
What you make me feel
Is true beauty of the ultimate appeal
And I don't want it any other way (2x)

[Verse One: Wiz Khalifa]
I work hard for everything, so why not salute?
They say a grind pays baby, all I got is proof
And a Swedish broad badder than my main bitch
Cigarillo rolled, you smell it when it ain’t lit
She don’t cook well, but she give me sweet brain
Make a rapper turn singer like T-Pain
Got her stayin’ up late; wakin’ up, bake
And to think this the life that I chose?
Arguing with attendants who’ve shorted my flight clothes
And every girl I fuck, feel like her boyfriend might know
Smokin’ all this weed as it smells, my weed come in barrels
Fuck wit bitches who fiend for Gucci and need her Chanel
Nigga, I’m higher off life so my eyes low
Can’t wait to see what’s in the future but I drive slow
And wait for the picture
Hated, now they say I can’t miss like mister

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
All of this smokin’
Oh you, got me thinkin’
And all of this dreamin’, I’m supposed to
Live life like, the weekend
Don’t know where I’m goin’
Cause I’m gone, On to
Show you succeeding
Yeah I’ve been livin’, Smokin’
Smokin’ Dreamin’ Livin’

[Verse Two: Curren$y]
I go to sleep with a picture of a Porche on my wall
Nigga I’m tryna come up on ya’ll
Pop the trunk n front him my car, in front of your broad
She reconsidering her decision to fuck wit ya
I think it because of the
Possibility of kickin it courtside, ringside, front row of anything
Livin my life simultaneously in this dream
Shit goin so good I swear
Airplanes stack change wit the gang, Taylor
Wings spread over cities, leave shadows everywhere
I care less about industry mingling
Niggas was WWF wrestlers, court jesters and cross dressers
I got them cross-trainers, Nike, SB
Niggas can’t fill my shoes I’ma nicer MC
I had a dream that I caked up
Tried to roll a joint, and count a million when I wake up
JETS, Nigga!

[Chorus]

[Hook]
If you rest for me tonight
I'll let you drive off in the morning
I don't want you in the shoulder
Where no one comes around

[Verse 1]
You go where I was
I'll go to the wall
Don't mind the streetlights that leak through the blinds
If it gets in your eyes
Just look into mine
Just look into mine
Just look into mine
We'll slip into dreams
And you'll be alright
You'll be alright
You'll be alright
I'll be alright
I'll be alright

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry for the other
That was us for the last five years
Now it's over and it's getting better
That's how we lived
Now we're living different
Now it's over and it's getting better
(Getting better)

[Hook]
If you rest for me tonight
I'll let you drive off in the morning
I don't want (No)
You in the shoulder
Where no one comes around (No)
When no one comes around
If you rest (No)
For me tonight
(You know I've got to be up
At six and start to be without you)
I'll let you drive off in the morning
I don't want (No)
You in the shoulder
Where no one comes around
(You know I've got to be out
By eight so I can get back to you)

[Outro]
(No)
You know I've got to be up
By six and start to be without to you
(No)
You know I've got to be up
By eight so I can get back to you
(No)
You know I've got to be up
By six and start to be without you

[Hook]
Give me somewhere to be
Take me to someone now
You might as well waste
Your time with me
If you got me here

[Verse 1]
Get away
From the ones that make you fray
Down to the last few strands of thought
Making you a target for a fight

[Bridge]
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait

[Hook]
Give me somewhere to be
Take me to someone now
You might as well waste
Your time with me
If you're gonna be here

[Bridge]
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait

[Verse 2]
I don't think I'd work out
As a best friend
I don't want to hold you down
I know there's someone better for you
I don't want to be around
When you've gotta go

[Outro]
Go away
Go away
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Whoever thought a Carolina nigga would've been the greatest
We strong cause the hard times made us into men
Hold up I gotta say that shit again
I said the hard times made us into men
See a man gonna stand with the world as a weight
But the boy gonna break, only so much he could take
See I traveled outta state and I ain't know a soul
Told my momma I'd be back when I had a million sold
Million flows million stories I done told
Shed tears when they cut me from the team couldn't wait till next year
Then I told the best player look
"Though I ain't as tall as y'all niggas
Next year I'mma be better then all ya'll niggas"
Ay this is for the Ville shout to all ya'll niggas
I pray you never pass like them ballhog niggas
And at all cost nigga I'mma shine
They gon' remember my name like it's tatted on they mind
J. Cole J. Cole
Ay, fresher than a day old newborn, bitches blowing kisses
That's the same ho that you on
I knew her back in high-school, but heard she failed college
She blew me like she blew her nail polish
That's knowledge if I ever seen it
Say I'mma call her, but don't ever mean it
See I'm preoccupied, watch how my stock arise
She want the time and that's just something I cannot provide
Cause time is money and I, I ain't no dummy and I
I'm trying get paid, man I gotta stay brave Atlanta
I let your misses sip me, I ain't talking David Banner, ain't a planner
So if it's random then it's naturally
Name a motherfucker out here matching me

[Outro]
Nigga I'm feeling good, nigga I'm feeling good
Nigga I'm feeling good, nigga I'm feeling good
Nigga I'm feeling good

Makin' feel-good music like I fucked you in ya ear
Pause, no homo, no David Alan Grier, naw

[Verse 3: Diesel]
Uh, fuck 'em all, haters talk a lot
Voices in my head tell me, "Diesel, cop a bigger yacht"
The Black Card said, "Go 'head, buy another drop"
Garage lookin' somethin' like a foreign car lot
Wow, I swear I'm livin' like monopoly
And there's hotels on every single stitch of property
Nothin' in my wallet, but I'm shittin' on the lottery
Ain't talkin' Twitter when I say yo' girl follow me
Give me yo' Patrón before I perform
Got me spittin' so smooth, I'ma call it Drake Ramon
I'm on right now, the ladies on with me
Actin' like they love me, someone give these hoes a Emmy
Fuck 'em all 'cause I know they all let me
They shake they whole team, feel like action in a ESPY
Or the Heisman, status on high man
How can I crash land when I'm flyer than the pilot?

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
I told 'em, "Fuck 'em all"
Y'all know me, same ol' G
I told 'em, "Fuck 'em all"
All these niggas hatin' on me
'Cause I'm the man of the hour, yeah

If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go
I could take you places you ain’t never been before
Baby, take a chance, or you’ll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I’d really like to blow
Swag swag swag, on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue
I dunno about me, but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag

[Pre-Chorus]
I’d like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

[Chorus]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl, you’d never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go, I’d never let you go

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you like, yeah, tell me what you don’t
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don’t never wanna fight, yeah, you already know
I‘ma make you shine bright, like you’re laying in the snow, burr
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the-the-the world ends
Make you dance, do a spin, and a twirl, and
Voice goin' crazy on this hook, like a whirl wind
Swaggy

[Pre-Chorus]
I’d like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
So give me a chance, ‘cause you’re all I need, girl

[Intro]
Get on my bike and I'ma fly through time
Until I'm with you
I promise

[Verse 1]
I'm scared
I guess I shouldn't be
But I'm a boy
In this adult body
I know I said
That we would grow old together
But I haven't
And that's cost you years

[Pre-Chorus]
This is has been the one of my fears
That's has only ever caused you tears

[Chorus]
So time machine, take me ahead till I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself
Lift off and go

[Verse 2]
I tried
With all my might, I peddled as fast as I could
Until the years just started to flicker past
Our life, oh all of it
I saw memories on both sides of the road
I pointed them out as I went along
Right there, we're making out listening to Purple Rain in the basement
And just ahead I can see your heart falling but I can't save it

[Pre-Chorus]
This is has been the one of my fears
That's has only ever caused you tears

[Chorus]
So time machine, take me ahead till I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself

[Bridge]
I'm on my way there
To that time in space
I wish you could see, all that I see now
I'm headed towards you, yeah
I wish that time could wait
I'm on my way home

[Pre-Chorus]
This is has been the one of my fears
That's has only ever caused you tears

[Chorus]
So time machine, take me ahead till I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself
Lift off and go
Lift off and go

Everything I Touch Is Like Baker With A Death Wish
Its About That Time That You Give Me My Respect Bitch

[Verse 1]
Came in together, but you held me
The process walking right through that door, at the entry
I can’t seem to remember, the lights were so bright
And the disco ball blurred in the turn of that night
But it was perfect, I was told the tux was starched and all
Grabbed the glass of punch, nervousness struck, stood by that wall
Arms folded, myself, I didn’t know yet
Until you came over, stood by me, you posted
You put your hand out like I was stranded
Tried to pull me on that dance floor, I stepped backwards
See I wasn’t ready yet, but you were my medicine..
Showed me that trust through that love that you held me with
Our backs against the wall as the DJ would spin
The soundtrack had changed as he played that mix
Our lives flashed in front of us, just a glimpse
We were together and experience this

[Verse 2]
You finally pulled me up, I didn’t want to
But you filled me up, from the bottom of my heart
And as we walked through that gymnasium that I’d been watching
Feeling like my chest would explode from my heartbeat
To the middle of the floor I almost panicked
You put your hand out and I fearfully grabbed it
The most beautiful thing that I’d seen on this planet
She laughed ‘cause you could tell that I didn’t know how to dance yet
We started moving and I didn’t know what I was doing
You whispered, "Don’t you love music?
It’s such a gift and I’ll give it to you
But you gotta use it”
I strayed, you brought me back in
Trying to sneak a flask outside of that gym
She said "You don’t need that, look within"
She hugged me, looked into my eyes, she gave me a kiss
And she said, "I can’t help you, if you don’t let me
You’re here to live, just be, don’t forget me
The end of this dance you don’t want to regret me, live
Cos tonight you'll all be set free"

[Verse 3]
"Last dance!" the DJ yelled
Looked into her eyes and I could see myself
Slow motion, frozen, toast to this moment
Like there is no morning, like there is no morning
No emotions, you on my shoulder, me lead and you follow
As we circle the floor like the globe through this infinite mass
Makes us seem so small
With you in my hand like the skyline holds the stars
Not letting go, but I can’t hold on
Fading through my fingertips, watching us fall
I try to catch you with my arms
I would never take you for granted when I had you in my palms
To all I ever wanted, please play my song
And put the record to the needle, don’t ever touch that off switch
You are perfect, forget that prom dress
My God, seconds away from God, yes
Somebody turned the heat on in this party
Or we’re becoming one because I’m melting into your body
One being, heart beating, universe falling
The ground split right between us and that concrete
Separated my love, I could hear her calling
Separated, but I could hear her calling
Goodbye forever, never see you again
Winterball 2012
"The End"
I feel good
I feel wonderful
And it's because
You made it that way
I feel super spectacular because of you

And now I'm flying
I think I'm floating
I feel so high
Your love leads me to the sky
And if I fall I won't care
Cause I'm safe with you

Cause I'm in love (with your) story
And I'm in love with your smell and your smile
So keep on liftin'(lalalala) I won't stand in your way
Cause I'm in love with you

Now baby you the truth so I'm just being honest
You treat me like a king so that's why you my highness
That means queen
Seems I known you for the longest
Funny how we connected on the low like vonage(huh)
And I know it ain't as deep as it could be
Or as it would be but that's how it should be
Cause overtime we gonna be fine like wine
I never put another over mine
See difference between you and them is they just wanna shine and
Well you
You just want Sean
So tell mama sandy, mama myra and that family
That when I get that grammy, they gon' be a granny
And if I see that reaper before you see that reaper
Just know I love you every time you hear me through them speakers and I ain't tryna blow your head up like reefer but we got chemistry to the point we need a
Beaker
So promise that you'll keep me
Promise you won't lead astray
You promise me forever you promise me to stay
So I keep you with my laughter
We're so complete

There's something bout your brown eyes that gets me lost for days
Your touch is like an angel lookin' down with heavens grace
And that's why I'll keep you sheltered from the storm
I
I need you here with me

Cause I'm in love (with your) story
And I'm in love with your smell and your smile
So keep on liftin' I won't stand in your way
Cause I'm in love with you

Now listen
First off if it was the last thing
I'll put you first
So you deserve my last name
You make my worst days feel like my birthday
If we never happen we'll regret it in the worst way
Like not seeing the world trade you worth the galaxy baby so let's world trade
And I tend to tell God thank you
Cause baby you a angel
At least from my angle
Cause I'm in love (with your) story
And I'm in love with your smell and your smile
So keep on liftin' I won't stand in your way
Cause I'm in love with you

[Verse]
Crack music, nigga...get smacked music, nigga!
Look, you see them ruby red diamonds on my ice
You can call it what you want shit'll prolly change ya life
If you stole it and you pawned it
You should prolly think twice, well connected so I'm on it
Well connected on yo flight, you niggas be writing sonnets writing sonnets
Like we miss you we miss you
Mama go get the tissue
Them things start blastin, Mark Jackson can't assist you
Life cut short like initials, raps or the pistols
One way or another, I'mma uplift you BLAOW!!
You believe me, then you crazy
All these little niggas out here wanna be me but they lazy
Step ya game up get ya name up
Look how I came up
Remember this bitch in high school I liked said I was lame but
I played it off Deep down I was ashamed
But walking through these hallways, all you got is your name
The boy she liked was g-like and very slang
Whips and fresh clothes and so they doing they thang
I ain't good enough
I ain't hood enough
This older nigga stepped up to me at my locker I said put em up ready to jab at
Much to my surprise that nigga backed back
And went about his way
I threw my notebook in my backpack
Walked home just to get my thoughts goin
It’s a hardcore world if they think you soft porn
Niggas will try to fuck you
And steal, rob, or cut you
And we ain't sellin dope but we still gotta hustle
And this that crack music, nigga thatget smacked music, nigga!

HEY!!!!!!

[Verse 1]
If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walking out the door

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain

[Verse 2]
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Saying, "There goes my little girl
Walking with that troublesome guy"
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but little darling, watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try

[Refrain]
And pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make you mine

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain

[Bridge]
Ooh, don't you say (Don't you say)
Goodbye (Goodbye)
Don't you say (Don't you say)
Goodbye (Goodbye)

[Refrain]
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
And there'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
And just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain

[Intro]​
(2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
Ahh! Ahh!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

[Verse 1]
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new land
To fight the horde, sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

[Refrain]
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

[Chorus]
Ahh! Ahh!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

[Verse 2]
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

[Refrain]
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

[Verse 3]
So now you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing

[Outro]
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ah, ah
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh

[Chorus]
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us, anyway

[Verse 1]
A New York nine's an everywhere else six
Timewise, the opposite goes for chicks
I'm in a taxi, texting with my best friend
He's sleeping with this girl that he met up on the West End
He's lucky, she's a career woman, no kids
Most girls see the clothes and try and gold dig
Most hoes poke holes in Trojans
Most people don't fuck and hit the lotto but my folks did
I'm a mess
That don't rhyme with shit, it's just true
Don't bring your girlfriend here, it's just you
When I'm depressed you're someone I run to
But, I guess meet me at Pianos
They cross-fadin' off of Nanos
Ugh, on that hipster shit
And you's a hipster, bitch
Yo, but not in the lame way
Like, you ain't livin' out in BK
Like, you ain't workin' on a screenplay
Like, your baby daddy ain't a DJ
Like, she listenin' to old Freeway
'Cause everybody listens to Biggie, but she different
Right, that’s why your friends need wristbands?
Fuck you
Can I have this dance?

[Chorus]
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us, anyway

[Verse 2]
We can pretend if you want to, like
We in love and started dating at your art school
'Cause either way we both lying more than half of the time
Except for when I’m home workin' on your graphic design
Every time we see each other, I'm taking you home
Our relationship has gotten Sylvester Stallone
Yellow-911-Persian girl-in-the-back car
But me writin' a verse would be the only way they buyin' a bar
White boys used to trip and send me over a gin
But they busy showin' off each other Indian friend
She got ironic tattoos on her back
That ain't ironic bitch, I love Rugrats
Watching lames handle they fame, they bang any broad with bangs
In a band with an animal name
Hannibal came drinkin' a handle of Jameson
Analling anyone is the plan for the evening
I'm kidding, stop
Girl cryin' on Ludlow, she still look good though
Love is Eastside, who are you to hate?
Movie ass; not a 10, but a super 8
You ain't see me at the show? I was super great
Hotel penthouse, gon' and let it ruminate
City never sleeps, so I guess I'm never slept on
Did everything I could, then I kept going

[Chorus]
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
(I hope nobody catch us)
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us, anyway

[Bridge]
Ooh, girl, I wanna know
Are you ready to cry? 'Cause I'm no good, no good
Ooh, girl, I wanna try
I'm an awful guy and I'm always away
And I'm tryin' to say I'm a piece of shit
Believe in this, I'm tellin' you
'Cause we barely knew what we had
I'm not that bad, the fun we had
Ooh

[Chorus]
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us, anyway

[Intro]
Most Dope, hey
Andrew Lloyd, my fuckin' man
Hey, uh

[Verse 1]
With my backpack on as I dip from class
If my mom see I'm gone, she gon' kick my ass
Hop in the whip and laugh, I got some piff to grab
Then go and scoop TreeJ, then sit and pass around the weed
While we talk about life and all the different ways to get rich overnight
Shit, I think I'ma be a billionaire
But, this life here ain't really fair
I try to do my own thing, be a little different
See, I'm just tryin' to spit about this life that I'm livin'
And if it was a game, I be playin' extra innings
Never be the same, tryin' to find out where I fit in, uh
I'm in the sky, but I haven't found a limit
So I'ma keep risin' for another couple minutes
Until I reach maximum altitude, Himalayan mountain view
I get refreshed without a Mountain Dew
They wonder 'bout this Malcolm dude
Oh, that's just my government name
No Republican, you never see me runnin' with lames
I got the Most Dope with me from city to city
Lookin' for a spot to get tipsy
Carry music that I Hussle like Nipsey
The type of bars puttin' stones in your kidneys
I think I found my passion
Used to play sports, now all I play is Madden
Hey, I used to hoop like Okafor
Now there's Henny bottles where all of my trophies were
The boy's from the north, married to the speaker
If you don't know me, it's nice to meet ya

[Interlude]
Haha, yeah, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

[Verse 2]
It was all a dream, I used to read Vibe magazine
Picture myself right on the cover lookin' clean
With some size thirty jeans and a medium tee
You ain't fresh 'til it fit right, get like me
See, he never tried to be a G
Tricks is for kids, got 'em hidden in my sleeve
Which cover my tattoos, oh yeah, Script shit
While this Earth stay spinnin' like a kickflip
A misfit in this clique-filled world
Groupies tryin' to holla while I'm chillin' with my girl
'Cause I'm all that, ha, no Nickelodeon
Address the class when I'm standin' at the podium
They don't believe me, guess I'm the only one
See this path gets slippery, petroleum jelly
Sittin' by the tele watchin' movies
I be Up In The Air, no George Clooney
Killin' 'em softly with The Fugees
Walkin' in the party like I own the place, "Who's he?"
Somebody answer that, you see them stand and clap
The boy got presents like Santa's bag, haha

[Outro]
Just some motherfuckin' kids
We just some motherfuckin' kids
Tryna get it how we live, do it big
Just some motherfuckin' kids
We just some motherfuckin' kids
Tryna do it big, get it how we live
Homie, we the shit, ha-ha

[Verse 1]
Yeah nigga, it's me again
I'm still around, I guess I win
You hear me in your sister's room like all the time
"Gambino Girl forever" on that bracelet that she bought online
To dudes who couldn't take it, might I say, "Hasta luego"
'Cause I'm takin' all your city like I'm Carmen Sandiego
I am smokin', I'm on fire
I am blazin', don't get hurt
To my white dudes, it's a concert
To my black nerds, this is church
From that NYU dorm to the Emory
Everyone hated me, I'm more hip-hop than you'll ever be
I'm bustin', bustin', bustin', I'm bustin' on these niggas, man
And nothin', nothin' nothin', n-nothin' is the same again
You lookin' dumb as hell man for ever sleepin' on him
Your girl is not around, she busy sleepin' on him
Will he fail? Now that's the wrong conversation
Terry Gross on the mic, I'm the talk of the nation, ha

[Chorus]
(Ayy) What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy
(Ayy) What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy

[Verse 2]
New shit, you didn't know?
Black rock like a fuckin' LOST episode
Somethin' for these black kids to call they own
So when you skatin' in your driveway, you not alone
She stay down like that new coat that I bought her
And the fly Rihanna girls be drinkin' my coconut water
And I'm lookin' at her butt, that's that 20/20 hindsight
My shit be Jackson, Jordan, Bolton, Keaton, Tyson, 5 Mikes
Donald Glover, no relation
Always workin', no vacation
They couldn't feel me, novocaine-tion
Murder verses, the only motive was motivation
Money equals freedom
I've wanted this since a three-year-old
I've seen it all, like I'm John Mayer's penis hole
Bein' me, that's somethin' that's so unusual
I've seen the future, and the future go, ah

[Chorus]
(Ayy) What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy
(Ayy) What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy

[Outro]
New shit
(Woo!)
Can't you hear me, baby?
Can't you hear me callin' out your name?
Can't you hear me, baby?
Ohh, can't you hear me callin' out your name?

[Intro: Spoken]
Now, now, now, honey
You better sit down and look around
'Cause you must've bumped yo' head
And I love you enough to talk some sense back into you, baby
I'd hate to see you come home, me the kids
And the dog is gone
Check my credentials
I give you everything you want everything you need
Even your friends say I'm a good woman
All I need to know is why?

[Hook]
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me?
When I make me so damn easy to love
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me?
When I make me so damn easy to need?

[Verse 1]
I got beauty, I got class
I got style, and I got ass
And you don't even care to care
Look here
I even put money in the bank account
Don't have to ask no one to help me out
You don't even notice that

[Hook]
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

[Verse 2]
I got beauty, I got heart
Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp
But you don't care to know I'm smart
Now, now now now now now now
I got moves in your bedroom
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do
But you don't seem to be in tune
Ooh

[Hook]
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me?
When I make me so damn easy to love
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me?
When I make me so damn easy to need

[Verse 3]
There's nothing not to love about me
No, no, there's nothing not to love about me
I'm lovely
There's nothing not to need about me
No, no, there's nothing not to need about me
Maybe you're just not the one
Or maybe you're just plain
Dumb

[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
I'm never good with these names so I never call her that
Triple cross into third base how far is that
The worst case in the first place is not the fact
That you sitting infatuation but filled high enough to catch a fucking heart attack
She said she's scared that i'll fuck and never call her back
She's probably right but I kept it G and remained a mack
Had a little chat now we're right back where we started at
I guess I gotta knack from words her guard's down flat
She wanna get a little higher I'm bout that
Hit it in good zone for a second and then I bounce back
Barely no where high is where we find middle ground at
Her mind wide open as the ocean so I pound that
Nice and easy hoping that no feelings get around that
I got a flight to catch and ain't no telling when I'm coming back
Young heart breaker but no Malice in my heart
Is that I can't tell if she likes me or just want me for my ball of stacks
So I play my role, guess I got my own garden tap
Play it way safe, satisfied with the art of that
Maybe I could change but I just don't know where to start with that
In a case of Mind Games I guess we all apart of that

[Verse 1: Drake]
I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it'll make the shit last
Don't make it too easy, girl, don't take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there, that's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still wet 'cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale, but you probably went to Howard, knowing you
Weekend in Miami, tryna study by the pool
Couple things due, but you always get it done
Might've been a time where I loved her too
But you take that away and you've always been the one, one
I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in they life as a wife
That's why you wanna have no sex, why you wanna protest
Why you wanna fight for your right
'Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wonderin' what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these motherfuckers wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you—

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I'm badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I'm straddling
And my shit's so wet, you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row your boat
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still
The best legal team, so the deals is ill
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too
Apparel, I'm dominatin' every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
'Cause I'm fl-fl-fly, I'm flyin' high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say
Could be a million, billion, trillion miles away
He asked my sign, I said a Sag'
I'm a star, sheriff badge
What's the point if I'm guardin'?
Double-D up, hoes, Dolly Parton

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these motherfuckers wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are

[Bridge: Drake]
And all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
And all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so—

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are

[Hook]
What we doing Drake? (We bag jackin, bitches!)
What we doing Drake? (We bag jackin, bitches!)
Take your whole bag of candy, leave you in the cold
So bring the ruckus if you under 12 years old

[Jay Pharaoh]
It's 7:58 and now your curfew is pushin
Watch how just like Republicans I'm behind the bushes
"It wasn't me" - if you asked me, that's what I'mma tell ya
And I'mma eat so much chocolate, my blood type's Nutella
Got wanted signs from madd parents, state troopers
Kidnapped Willy Wonka and bitch-slapped an Oompa-Loompa

[Hook]

[Drake]
Give me your Reese's Pieces, give me your Hershey bars
I want your Milky Way, give me that Snickers bar
I would Trick-or-Treat but I'm too old now
So I snatch your bag so I don't look like a pedophile
My sticky fingers got all of these mamas mad at me
We're talking stomach aches, restraining orders, cavities
I probably won't have no teeth when I'm finished
I don't pay for the porcelains, I just marry my dentist

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus]
He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus]
She'd better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone
As I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough for me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

[Outro]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see

[Verse 1]
I see so many people lost who really try to pretend
But am I just another white boy who has caught on to the trend?
When I take a step to the mic is hip-hop closer to the end?
'Cause when I go to shows the majority have white skin
They marketed the windmill, the air flair and head spin
And white rappers' albums really get the most spins
The face of hip-hop has changed a lot since Eminem
And if he's taking away black artists' profits, I look just like him
Claimed a culture that wasn't mine, the way of the American
Hip-hop is gentrified, and where will all the people live?
It's like the Central District, Beacon Hill to the South End
Being pushed farther away because of what white people did, now
Where's my place in a music that's been taken by my race
Culturally appropriated by the white face?
And we don't want to admit that this is existing
So scared to acknowledge the benefits of our white privilege
'Cause it's human nature to want to be part of something different
Especially when your ancestors are European Christians
And most whites don't want to acknowledge this is occurring
'Cause we got the best deal, the music without the burden
Of being black in a system that really wants you to rock
'Cause all you need is a program and you can go and make hip-hop
And we hate the mainstream 'cause we're the ones that took it
Now we listen to Aesop Rock and wear t-shirts that say "Brooklyn"
But it's not about black and white, right?
I mean good music is good music regardless of what you look like
But when you don't give them props isn't that selfish?
That's like saying rock was actually started by Elvis
So where does this leave me?
I feel like I pay dues, but I'll always be a white MC
I give everything I have when I write a rhyme
But that doesn't change the fact that this culture's not mine

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm gonna be me, so please be who you are
This is something that's effortless and shouldn't be hard
I said I'm gonna be me, so please be who you are
But we still owe 'em 40 acres now we've stolen their 16 bars

[Chorus]
Hip-hop started off on a block that I've never been to
To counteract a struggle that I've never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow too
That means I'm not keeping it true, nope
Hip-hop started off on a block that I've never been to
To counteract a struggle that I've never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow too
That means I'm not keeping it true, I'm not keeping it true

[Verse 2]
Now I don't rap about guns, so they label me conscious
But I don't rap about guns 'cause I wasn't forced into the projects
See I was put in the position where I could choose my options
Blessed with the privilege that my parents could send me to college
Now who's going to shows, the kids on the block starving?
Or the white people with dough that can relate to my content?
Marketed the music, now adapted to the lifestyle
What happened to jazz and rock and roll is happening right now
Where's my place in the music that's been taken by the media
With white corporations controlling what they're feedin' ya?
I brought up Aesop Rock, but I'm not even dissing, dude
We love hip-hop, and what do you think caucasians are listening to?
And I speak freely when I write this
If a black MC examined race, there goes half their fan base, white kids
And this is so true
And we didn't even have to fight the system, we just went and picked up the microphone too
And we got good at it so we should be rappin'
But only supporting them is like burning Jimi and buying Clapton
Now Clapton's incredible, but no Jimi, no foundation
So here comes history and the cultural appropriation
White kids with do-rags trying to practice their accents
From the suburbs to the upper-class, mastering a language
But hip-hop is not just memorizing words
It's rooted in authenticity, something you literally can't learn

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm gonna be me, so please be who you are
This is something that's effortless and shouldn't be hard
I said I'm gonna be me, so please be who you are
But as I'm blessed with the privilege, they're still left with the scars

[Chorus]
Hip-hop started off on a block that I've never been to
To counteract a struggle that I've never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow, too?
That means I'm not keeping it true, nope
Hip-hop started off on a block that I've never been to
To counteract a struggle that I've never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow, too?
That means I'm not keeping it true, I'm not keeping it true

[Intro]
You give me that funny feeling in my tummy

Your love is like (it’s like what?) a Rollercoaster baby, baby
I wanna ride
Your love is like a Rollercoaster baby, baby

[Outro]
I wanna ride
I wanna ride
I wanna ride
I wanna ride
I wanna ride
I wanna ride
I wanna ride
I wanna ride
I wanna ride
I wanna ride

[Intro: Anthony Kiedis]
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
Whoa!
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Forty detectives this week
Forty detectives strong
Takin' a stroll down Love Street
Strollin', is that so wrong?
Can I get my co-defendant?

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu
(Oh, no!)
Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu
Bump, bump
(Whoa!)

[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
It must have been a hundred miles, or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear, but the way we make out
When I was another loner, nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm— I'm wide awake now

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Workin' the beat, as we speak
Workin' the belle du monde
Believe in the havoc we wreak
Believin', is that so wrong?
Can I get my co-dependent?

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu
Bump, bump
(C'mon!)

[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
It must have been a hundred miles, or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear, but the way we make out
When I was another loner, nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm— I'm wide awake now

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya)

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu
(Oh, no!)
Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu
Bump, bump

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
Listen to me, what I said
Try to get it through your head
A little bit of circumstance and a chance to make out
Livin' in a citadel, it's hard enough to be yourself
Waiting for the bell to toll and I am wide awake now
It must have been a hundred miles, or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear, but the way we make out
When I was another loner, nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm, I'm wide awake now

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
She, she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But baby, is that really what you want?

[Pre-Chorus]
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
She made a fool out of you and, boy, she's bringin' you down
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it, she ain't got your love anymore

[Chorus]
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)

[Verse 2]
She is half your age
But I'm guessin' that's the reason that you strayed
I heard you've been missin' me
You've been tellin' people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out when she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours? (Bless your soul)

[Pre-Chorus]
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me and, boy, you're bringin' me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it, I'm the one you're leaving her for

[Chorus]
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)

[Bridge]
All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

[Chorus]
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour, rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it (Rumour)
Rumour has it

[Outro]
But rumour has it, he's the one I'm leaving you for

[Verse 1]
Didn't I give it all? Tried my best
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to, well, having me around
Still, how can you walk away from all my tears?
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here

[Chorus]
But go on and take it (Take it)
Take it all with you
Don't look back (Don't look back)
At this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

[Verse 2]
Maybe I should leave to help you see
Nothing gets better than this
And this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it?
You're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this

[Chorus]
But go on, go on and take it (Take it)
Take it all with you
Don't look back (Don't look back)
At this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

[Bridge]
I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh, if only, if only you knew
That everything I do is for you

[Chorus]
But go on, go on and take it (Take it)
Take it all with you
Don't look back (Don't look back)
At this crumbling fool
Just take it (Take it)
Take it all with you
Don't look back (Don't look back)
At this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

[Verse 1]
"This is the last time," you say
After the last line you break
It's not even a holiday
Nothin' to celebrate ('Brate, 'brate, 'brate)
You give a hundred reasons why
And say you're really gonna try
If I had a nickel for every time
I'd own the bank (Bank, bank, bank)

[Pre-Chorus]
Thought that I was the exception
I could reroute your addiction
You could've been the greatest
But you'd rather get wasted

[Chorus]
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forté
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

[Verse 2]
You say it helps you write your rhymes
Whatever helps you sleep at night
You become what you despise
A stereotype-type-type-type
You think you're so rock and roll
But you're really just a joke
Had the world in the palm of your hands
But you fuckin' cho-o-o-oked

[Pre-Chorus]
Should've been my teammate
Could've changed your fate
You say that you love me
You won't remember in the morning

[Chorus]
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forté
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

[Bridge]
(Nine, one, one)
(Nine, one, one)
(Nine, one, one)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forté
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down
(I'm not stickin' around, I'm not stickin' around)
Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

[Outro]
Watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
(You're goin' down, you're goin' down)
(You're goin' down, you're goin' down, I know)
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forté
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down

[Eminem]
*burps* Woo!
Hey, how you guys doin'?
You want more? Alright
Then SHUT UP!

Shooby doo (Shoody doo)
Shooby doo (Shoody doo)
Shooby doo (Shoody doo)
Shooby doo (Shoody doo)

Skibbidy bee bop
Girl (Girl, girl, girl)
You're my world (World, world, world)
You're my pearl (Pearl, pearl, pearl)
You're my world (Woooorld)
Hey yo, here's a song for the ladies...

[Intro: Macklemore]
Hey, hey, hey
Good to see you
Come on, dude, let's go
Yeah! Let's go!
Ha-ha-ha-ha alright
Alright, okay
Alright, okay
Alright, okay

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the back (back) pack (pack), fat (fat) cat (cat), crushin'
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give that to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give it to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)

[Chorus: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)
Learn from that failure, gain humility (Hey, hey, hey)
And then we keep marching, I said

[Chorus: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Interlude]
And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Bridge: Ray Dalton and Macklemore]
Let's go!
Na na na na, na na na na (Uh-huh)
Hey (And all my people sing)
Na na na na, na na na na (Hey, hey, that's right)
Hey (Here we go, all right, uh)
And all my people sing
Na na na na, na na na na (You do it, Ray)
Oh (Ha-ha, let's go)
And all my people sing
Na na na na, na na na na
Mack-le-e-e-e-e-more!

[Chorus: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment (Ooh)
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over (Ooh)
So we put our hands up (Ooh)
Like the ceiling can't hold us (Ooh)
Like the ceiling can't hold us (Ooh)

[Video Outro]

[Intro: T.I. & Chazz Michael]
We're going to skate to one song, one song only
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
Aye man I don't know what been happening
I guess y'all must have caught amnesia in my absence
I ain't been gone that long, have I?
Well, just for y'all reminder
How about the crown meet the throne right here
Let's get it

[Verse 1: T.I. & JAY-Z]
Call me T.I. no CPR, I'm killing shit
Even in prison I'm still the shit
Better recognize King in the building bitch
Act like you know you serious, I (ball so hard)
My ankle hurt, don't buy a car if I ain't the first
In the country with a 1, 2, 3 bitch
You watch me while I painted her, I (Ball so hard)
They hate to see me on the stage Jay-Z, Kanye with me
You know I (ball so hard), TIP is scary
Merci beaucoup in Paris
Parlez vous francais I say, Menage a trois today I say
I (ball so hard), hard out the park
Maybach chauffeured, I ain't got to park
So Ross, so official dawg
Them lame can't do nothing with you dawg
She all on me, better get your broad
Don't like that, blow your whistle dawg, I (ball so hard)
No referee throw no flag, ain't no techs for me
I keep them suckas upset with me
Them racks back on deck you best believe that I

[Chorus: JAY-Z, Kanye West & T.I.]
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me

B-ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray
(What Ye? Yeah, yeah, go, ayy)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
So I ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's fifty grand to a mothafucker like me?
Can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho: I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broken clock
Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(B-ball so hard) Let's get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave
Just might let you meet 'Ye
Chi-Town's D. Rose
I'm moving the Nets to BK

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Kanye West]
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray
B-ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray

[Verse 3: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
She said, "Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all"
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain't it, Jay?
(B-ball so hard) What she order, fish fillet?
(B-ball so hard) "Your whip so cold" – this old thing?
(Ball so hard) Act like you'll ever be around mothafuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab my hand
Fuck that bitch; she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French, but I'm in France, ahah, I'm just sayin'
Prince Williams ain't do it right if you ask me
'Cause I was him I would have married Kate and Ashley
What's Gucci, my nigga? What's Louis, my killer?
What's drugs, my dealer? What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest 'cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh

[Interlude: Jimmy MacElroy & Chazz Michael]
"I don't even know what that means
No one knows what it means, but it's provocative
No, it's not, it's gross
Gets the people going"

[Chorus: JAY-Z]
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
B-ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me

[Outro: Kanye West, JAY-Z & Both]
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin'
Actin' like the summer ain't mine
(I got that hot bitch in my home)
(You know how many hot bitches I own?)
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I'm 'bout to kill it
How you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone
(I'm definitely in my zone, zone, zone, zone, zone...)

[The Weeknd: Verse 1 (rapping)]
Can'ts and Do's
Sun rays in my rays
Sweatin' to my feet
Sippin on lean'
On the beach passin' other Bs
Still got my two con, color of Poupon
Baggy jean nigga
Got me raggin' like UConn
And the strippers no fruit, God
All my niggas
Celebrate with grey goose
With my Billy Mays crew
Cus we clean so smoove
We revved with tattoos
And some bitches so goose
Sayin' how they want it
Then they take us to they rooms
In they birthday suit
Take it all off
I dont wanna see you baby in those draws
We can make a movie (ohh)
We can rate it R
I can bring the camera
Baby you can be the star
Done
Follow the sound of Onra
Back to the party
Don't crash the car
We back to the jam
Back back to the jam
Our summer things comin'
Baby put away the cam
Our summer things comin'
She my number one fan
I never give a damn
But her ass too slamin'
And I just wanna hit it til' the snow hits the floor
Oh yeaa
Soakin' ova' before hand
You are my favorite one night stand
My favorite one night stand
You are my favorite one night stand
My favorite one night stand (ohh)
You are my favorite one night stand
..Talk to me baby, talk to me

The Weeknd 

[Singing]
Ohh Ohh
Ohh Ohh
Ohh Ohh
Ohhhh Ohh

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Look, illest of the illest, I'm a sick soul
A little margarita blend so I sip slow
Too talented type of nigga, I'm kinda schizo
But never out of my element, I let that fifth go
Shots in the club, panic at the disco
She of that MDMA, that's from Frisco
Hella chips, call me Mister Nabisco
Is that your bitch? 'Cause she won't let my go wrist go
My technique is to sex freaks
Skinny dip with hot models, bitches and lesbies
I'ma put my tongue on they soul like a ESPY
But they don't know they scum to my soul, they just sexy
I'ma play dumb, play that role in the SV, it's ridiculous
And can I get a girl with real ass and tits?
Most respect in the world to my real niggas
'Cause all them fake niggas make me wanna kill niggas
I stand alone, fuck that gang bang shit
They Nintendo blowin' niggas 'cause this game ain't shit
Uh, it's relevant that I'm better than these veterans
They sleepin' on me like I been givin' 'em sedatives
Sometimes I wish I had better friends and better peers
'Cause I know when that cheddar ends, they disappear

[Interlude: Kevin McCall]
Damn, where they go?
Where they go? Where they go, huh?

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
See I'm doper than that shit Pookie was on in New Jack City
This is why I'm gettin' rich without tryin', I ain't like 50
'Cause what good is bein' rich if you dyin'? That shit is silly
Call the chain TLC, all the ice'll make you Chilli
I'm a pimp so you know I'm snatchin' your broad
I'm a real star, you Patrick from SpongeBob
L.A. my city to the streets, I'm Freeway Ricky
'Cause I keep the streets flooded with that crack music
I be sellin' CDs like them niggas push kilos
But I don't push weights unless it's plates in the weight room
Why you think I'm BUF? Blowin' Up Fast
Call me lead foot 'cause I be heavy on the gas
You would think I was a Spartan, 300 on the dash
Either that or a martian in a space aircraft
'Cause when you see that whip that I have
You be like, "What the fuck was that?"

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Hey, hey
Uh, and it's the best day ever
Every now and again you gotta just
Just say somethin', somethin' real
'Cause, you know, you plan on changin' the world, that's—
When it's all said and done, it's more than just
More than just rap, it's deeper than that

[Chorus: Bun B & Mac Miller]
The people think it's all about the fame
And the money and your status in the game
But it's deeper than all that
They just want the women and the cars
Gettin' high so they can chill with some stars
But it's deeper than all that
They thinkin' that it's all about the shows
And the chain hangin' down on your clothes
But it's deeper than all that
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believin' is all that

[Verse 1: Bun B]
I got that money on my mind, the grind, and the ability
The knowledge and the know-how, stamina and the agility (Agility)
Soon as I step in the facility, these haters start testin' my civility
I'm tellin' ya, they killin' me (They killin' me)
Some of 'em feelin' me and some of 'em be grillin' me
But I just blow my kush smoke up to the ceilin', G (G)
Yeah, and take a toke of the Swisher smoke (Smoke)
They got the paint and the brush, but not the picture, loc (Loc)
What is an emcee if he can't rap? (Rap)
Just a monkey with a mic just waitin' to get slapped (Slapped)
And what is a DJ if he can't scratch? (Scratch)
The one rotten apple that's spolin' the whole batch (The whole batch)
What is a B-Boy if he can't break? (Break)
Might as well do the Dougie or even the Harlem Shake (The Harlem Shake)
And what is a graffiti artist if he don't tag?
No homophobia, but he's a fag
'Cause it's deeper than all that

[Chorus: Bun B & Mac Miller]
Some people think it's all about the fame
And the money and your status in the game
But it's deeper than all that
They just want the women and the cars
Gettin' high so they can chill with some stars
But it's deeper than all that
They thinkin' that it's all about the shows
And the chain hangin' down on your clothes
But it's deeper than all that
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believin' is all that (Look, look)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
One time for the world 'cause we do it for y'all
Bat logo light up in the sky when the studio call
Movin' the crowd, get 'em loud without a gimmick
Spit with a golden ticket, I'm whippin' it up in minutes
My feet up in this game, you haven't even made a divot
Worried 'bout the critics, what's happenin' now, forget it
From my heart is where I give it
Stay thinkin' 'bout the future
When I'm rich, I'ma call my mom before I call the movers
These haters just losers
Hate to see you winnin'
Gave my all from the beginnin'
I'm in it for extra innings
Here to change the world like I change clothes
Wouldn't mind a little bankroll, pesos
But I'm right here for way more
What is somebody if they can't love?
A hater, someone give 'em a hug, aha
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believin' is all that

[Chorus: Bun B & Mac Miller]
The people think it's all about the fame
And the money and your status in the game
But it's deeper than all that
They just want the women and the cars
Gettin' high so they can chill with some stars
But it's deeper than all that
They thinkin' that it's all about the shows
And the chain hangin' down on your clothes
But it's deeper than all that
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believin' is all that

[Verse 1: Drake]
The clock that you’ve been watching has been stopping
He makes you wait
What kind of man does that to a girl he wants
If you just give tonight to me
I promise my hands will say
They'll say

[Chorus: Drake]
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don’t show no mercy
Oh, oh think about the last time I came through
Had something more than a gift for you
And I ain't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Oh, oh baby I just landed
'Bout to get my bags in
All I need’s an address and I’m on my way
Don’t fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it’s worth waiting for
Because I’m on my way

[Verse 2: James Fauntleroy]
Won't hurt, it's just some turbulence we're dropping
Dont be afraid
If you fall right here in love with me in my bed
I'll keep you safe, so safe

[Chorus: Drake]
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don’t show no mercy
Oh, oh think about the last time I came through
Had something more than a gift for you
And I ain't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Oh, oh baby I just landed
'Bout to get my bags in
All I need’s an address and I’m on my way
Don’t fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it’s worth waiting for
Because I’m on my way

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Ahh ohhh, I'm on my way
Ahh ohhh, I'm on my way
Ahh ohhh, I'm on my way
Ahh ohhh, I'm on my way

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]

Girl can I be real?
I just wanna feel on your booty, that''s not a big deal
Shawty you drinkin on that Martini

Or better yet a thong, baby what’s wrong?
Tryna tell you girl its the purpose of this song
Ooh, I want you closer
You look like a model of a poster
I wanna get ya to the car, to the crib, up the stairs, to the bed
In the morning you’ll be cooking us set
Oooh baby, I love the smell of your perfume
And if we were kids I’d be breaking curfew
To stay up with you

You gon need a scarf, wrap your head cause it’s gon get wild
If we keep lovin’ like this, we might make a child
A daughter, a son, whichever one
Girl your second to none

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
I’m feeling good, I’m having fun
This is the best night of my life

Girl this could be the best night of my life
You could been anywhere in the world
But you’re right here with me girl
And if we go home and make love
This could be the best night of your life

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
So girl let me ask you a question while we’re sipping bud
Are you going home with me after the club?
Thats a yes or a no, I’m just letting ya know
Where this night can go
And girl I’m hoping you see things my way
Cause I just want your love to stay
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, night, night, night

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I could be your bartender, tell me what you’re sippin’ on
Girl, I’m not a travel agent so what you trippin’ on
You say I think I could make it happen cause I’m famous
Nah, I’m just tryna get it cracking cause we faded
Get you to my crib, spend some time alone
Barely over 21, that mean you kinda grown
Ummm, and I’m tat, tat, tatted up
Come on to that bread, I’mma stack it up
Where you going? Baby girl back it up

[Pre-Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
You gon need a scarf, wrap your head cause it’s gon get wild
If we keep lovin’ like this, we might make a child
A daughter, a son, whichever one
Girl your second to none

[Chrous: Jamie Foxx]

Girl this could be the best night of my life

But you’re right here with me girl
And if we go home and make love
Girl this could be the best night of your life

[Chorus]
We spendin' all this
Money, gettin' all this shine, hittin' all this
Cuddi, spendin' all this time, I'm
Feelin' better than ever before (Ever before)
This my life for better or for—
All this money, gettin' all this shine, and it's all so
Funny, 'cause it's all just mine, I'm
Feelin' better than ever before (Ever before)
This my life (Hey) for better or for worse

[Verse 1]
I'm lookin' out the window, the kid stayin' lit like a Zippo
You hatin', I don’t trip, bro, it's gravy, 'cause your bitch know
Cup of Henny, I sip slow, the spins, yo
Hit the stage to bust a rhyme, call me Flipmode
This, that, the other, I'ma make it happen
Travel all around the country in a station wagon
Take it back, you reminisce on all your favorite classics
My words play more than Mad Libs
I got plenty lyrics, they got plenty ad-libs
Warn the holy spirit, my father's on some rap shit
Listenin' to Tribe, gettin' high, puffin' lye
See some people ridin' by, come outside, say what up
I ain't nothin' like a star, I’m chillin', layin' back
Travel round the whole world, enjoyin' everywhere I'm at
Meetin' different people, eatin' different food
No one like a gourmet meal more than Q though

[Chorus]
We spendin' all this
Money, gettin' all this shine, hittin' all this
Cuddi, spendin' all this time, I'm
Feelin' better than ever before (Ever before)
This my life for better or for—
All this money, gettin' all this shine, and it's all so
Funny, 'cause it's all just mine, I'm
Feelin' better than ever before (Ever before)
This my life for better or for worse

[Verse 2]
They feelin' kinda jealous, everybody be thinkin’ that they was cool
Gettin' money since my mommy was droppin' me off at school
Now I got a whip to cruise in
You the Pirates so you losin’, I'm in the news, you let 'em bring your news in
I bowl strikes, you always leavin' a few pins
I do me, you keepin' up with them new trends
I got fam, you worried 'bout makin' new friends
I'm in my PJs, you had to wear your suit in
Thinkin' what I'll do? When? Where? How? Why me?
Relax myself, kick it like Tai Chi
You could find me, only where I’m at
There ain't no other me's, they be checkin' on my stats
High cat, find 'im up in a tree
Homie may be spittin' bars, he ain't fuckin with me
I'm just turnin' up the heat to a hunnid degrees
Spittin' like I got a razor blade stuck to my teeth, hey

[Chorus]
We spendin' all this
Money, gettin' all this shine, hittin' all this
Cuddi, spendin' all this time, I'm
Feelin' better than ever before (Ever before)
This my life for better or for—
All this money, gettin' all this shine, and it's all so
Funny, 'cause it's all just mine, I'm
Feelin' better than ever before (Ever before)
This my life for better or for worse

[Intro]
"I'd say there was as much dope in the music business as there is in virtually any other business now. The dope is so out in the open that you can go anywhere, and it's there. So there's no, sort of, underground movement of people taking dope, you know? The most extraordinary, straight people are taking dope. It's available anywhere, at any time, and it's all over the place. If you want it, you can have it, you know?"
Alright then, bitch
Ha, ya
Uh
A million ma'fuckin' fans on that ass, biotch! (La-la, la-la)
Feels amazin'
Ladies and gentlemen, I've always been the same kid (La-la, la-la, 

[?])
Now I'm famous (And I ain't even have to change shit)

[Verse 1]
Hey
Ayo, they keep on sayin' this dude back, this dude back
But I ain't sound like this dude, bitch, I'm Mac (Woo)
Now these girls all tryna suck my dick, I rap, haha
I may let her if I'm sippin' that yak, yeah
Too fly, submarine in the sky
Can't go out in public, I better get a disguise
It's better to be yourself, don't ever just live a lie
While I'm drivin' with the top down, listenin' to Plies (Hi)
Chicken wings and fries, I'm in love with all the simple things
Little things, hoes just be around, always bickering
I got some money, threw some diamonds on a pinky ring
That's why your favorite girl probably on my ding-a-ling
Chief blunts with Peanut, standin' on a tree stump
Rappers need to keep up, my bitch is double D cup
She fucks, but she ain't no slut, and she know that (Know that)
She freeze up, livin' in the moment, get her Kodak (Kodak)
Hold that, wait for it to flash, get the picture
I ain't doin' much, just out on this adventure (Ya)
Bus around the country, but I'm travelin' the world
With all these rappers that be hatin' like I'm battlin' with girls

[Chorus]
Ayo, this where the hook be
But I ain't got no hook, you pussy
I said this where the hook be
But, bitch, I ain't got a fuckin' hook, you pussy
Yeah, bitch, that could be a hook
You know what, I'ma just rap
If it's okay with y'all
And you can tell me if it was nice
A'ight, here we go

[Verse 2]
Uh
Ayo, I kinda want a fur coat, kinda want a grill
She met me at the party, now she kinda wanna chill
I ain't on no pills, just a little weed, molly, and lean
Yeah, I did a couple drugs, now they callin' me Sheen
This was all a dream just a week ago, now I got a heap of dough
I keep a ho that always has some weed to roll
All these rappers brag, but I don't ever see 'em close (No)
The illest ma'fucka in it, we don't need to vote (No)
'Cause I don't give a fuck what y'all think
And I don't give a fuck what that dude on that blog think (Suck a dick)
Yeah, I seen hay, been to court in three states
Had to deal with cheapskates who always want a free play
You hold the weight of the world, I bet your knees break
Put my dick in a bitch hand, keepsake (Haha)
You can't keep that, fuck off my case
You can keep some residue if I bust on your face, heh
I'm just playin', mistake him as Asian
Always been amazin', since days I've been hangin'
In ancient places, now the kid famous
And he ain't even had to change shit, biatch!

[Outro]
A million mothafuckin' fans
Just want to take a second to thank y'all, you feel me?
Thanks for fuckin' with the kid from day one
You know what I'm sayin', Blue Slide Park, November 8th
I'll see y'all then, a'ight
Cheah
Suck my dick
Hahaha, we should keep that
Oh shit, it worked again, biotch!
So I just threw this fuckin' mixtape together because I love y'all
How nice am I?

[Intro: Alicia Keys]
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
Pretty lady, you so feminine
My adrenaline
Be racin', you be tastin' like an M&M
You melt in my mouth and not in my hands
So I'ma put a rock on your hand
I plan to be swimmin' in
Your ocean and I'm hopin' we can get it in
'Cause your pretty skin is vanilla mixed with cinnamon
But then again we might argue and fight
But I want you to be my wife
It'll be alright, a'ight?

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys & Cassidy]
(Yeah) You and me together (You and me) through the days and nights
(Through the days, through the nights)
I don't worry 'cause (Why?) everything's gonna be alright (Yeah, yeah)
People keep talkin' (Let 'em talk, let 'em talk)
They can say what they like (Let 'em talk, let 'em talk)
But all I know is that everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
No one
No one
No one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one
No one
No one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Get in the way of what I feel for you

[Verse 3: Alicia Keys]
When the rain is pourin' down
And my heart is hurtin'
You will always be around
This I know for certain

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys & Cassidy]
You and me together (You and me) through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause (Why?) everything's gonna be alright (Yeah yeah)
People keep talkin', they can say what they like
(Let 'em talk, let 'em talk)
But all I know is that everything's gonna be alright
(Cassidy)

[Verse 4: Cassidy]
Cutie, you my real wife
This ain't a movie, this real life
They could say what they feel like
But things still right
I feel like they can never ever break us up
And if I'm dreamin' then I pray they never wake us up
They hate on us trying to ruin our relationship
They make me sick but they can never make us split
As long as we conversate and straight talk together
We'll be together forever like salt and pepper

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
I know
Some people search the world
To find
Something like what we have
I know
People will try, try to divide something so real
So 'til the end of time
I'm telling you there ain't no one

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
No one
No one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one
No one
No one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

[Intro: Alicia Keys]
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh
Miguel, Sean Don

Mami you looking like I'm just another guy
That came to check you
That came to wreck you
No disrespect but mami that's correct cause...
What's in them jeans just got my mind hectic
I can see that you're feeling my fashion
Is it cause I'm flashing
Or is it this cash that's just way too reckless?
Or is it this necklace?
Wait let me interrupt myself with this smash you see

[Hook:]
I don't wanna be loved
I don't wanna be loved
I just wanna quickie
No bite marks, no scratches, and no hickies
If you can get with that, mami come get with me
I don't wanna be loved
I don't wanna be loved
I just wanna quick fix
Up in your mix miss
Send me you wishlist
I have you addicted
So mami come get this

[Big Sean]
I just, I just, I just wanna kiss you on your lips
Between your hips, look down, I'm packing, fuck a trip
I want you to say my name girl
What's my name? Like I forget
I love it how you move it because
You do it to my dick
You got that back seat Caddy pussy
You should let me ride
No time to take her panties off
So move 'em to the side
I'm back go big chaining, I'm big slanging
I'm smoking good: Rick James
And I'm training ladies, I'm bitch taming
I'm rubbered up cause your bitch raining
I'm all in your butt like beyo-, beyo-, beyo-, bitch
Let's make it quicker than tea-time
I got her legs doing a peace sign
I'm in between her like halftime
It's "hit ass time"
And I gotta go cause I'm running late
Even for CP time
Hit once and it was new sheets time

[Hook]
Mami I realize that I'm mannish
Speak a language of love like Spanish
"Quero Fugir"
I'm so obscene and know what I mean?
Yeah sorry that was Portuguese
And I speak with ease
Please (aha) get on them knees
I gotta penny for your thoughts
If you know what I mean

[Hook]

Don't be offended babe
By what I say
It's just a game
And how I play
Pillage and plunder
Call me ya plumber
Knock on this wood
Get rocked by this thunder 

[x2]

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
She callin me back to her mattress
Back was like backflips we practice gymnastics
We got attached to the fact we attracted
You know I'm an addict and
My soul is a magnet
So if you get close then you can't go backwards
I know I'm kinda like a black hole in a galaxy
You are trapped beneath my galactic habits
I couldn't even notice the patterns, damn

[Hook]
But I was just so blind
You had me caught up at the perfect time
But I couldn't see it
I said I couldn't see it
Eventually I had to wisen up and open up my eyes
But I couldn't believe it, the way you looked was so deceivin
Cause I was a fool for love
Who sadly fell in love
With a girl who couldn't love X2
And now I'm sad in love
Cause I'm not the only one
And I'm beatin myself for love
For the girl who couldn't love
Cause I was a fool for love
Yeah I was a fool for love X3
Cause I was a fool for love

[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]
Check HA HA
Hola Bobby
Let me tell ya about my ex
But yet so fly mommy
I probably had the chance to exit stage left
With her sister but whenever she left I would miss her
Lady dropped me like a cut in a track
Cuddlin cats who love they cat
A puzzlin accent, was she from Scandinavia
Or Fantasia from Asia
Click the mouse
I took a second to figure it out
Digging her out, kissing, adrenaline in her mouth
Is it about you? Her? Or is it somethin super?
Silly me still in love with a cougar!

[Hook]

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Produce by Drumma, featuring The Game
Drumsquad DJ's in the bulidin' with me, I'm rockin' with you
1017 Drumsqaud DJ, you know how we rockin'

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
They say kush is my cologne
I say, "Is it me"? I'm easier to smell
Than I am to see
Them Rolex on my wrist cost 'bout ten bricks at least
I stole your bitch right under you, cause I'mma beast
Diamond's on my knuckles, Gucci on my buckle
If you want some trouble we can do the fuckin' Royal Rumble
I'm on now, it's in killa
You wanna win, bet a real with a real nigga
I'm trapped out, she coked out
Fifty bags of gas, room smoked out
I double back, then change routes
Call back he need a 9 and a half a pound
It's Gucci

[Hook: Gucci Mane] (x2)
Everybody wasted, like it's payday
The whole world faded, like it's payday
Bottles poppin' crazy, like it's your birthday
We smokin' chronic crazy, like Dr. Dre day

[Verse 2: Game]
Nigga I'm a motherfuckin' killa
Used to run with a pack of motherfuckin' gorillas
I'm about my scrilla, I'm about my gang
S double O - W - double O nigga we insane
Talkin' to me bout Gucci, nigga lost his fuckin' brain
Automatic, we tune his ass up like T-Pain
Nigga we ain't entertainers, we nothin' like Rambo
Pull up in them Lambos, and hop out with them bangers
Nigga I be makin' bangers, my plaques they be platinum
My rims they be platinum, so them bitches know what's happinin'
When Gucci get to rappin' all them haters be quiet
Flocka start shakin' his dreads niggas start a riot
Black wall Bricksquad, Chrome four fifth squad
Phantom got diarrhea I can't stop shittin' on 'em
Sittin' on them sixers, like Doc in his hayday
Rollin' up them swishers, cause nigga it's, nigga it's payday

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Stoned, they wasted
They can't feel they face, gotta take it
It's so hard to shake how I bake it
Cook cakes like the chef in the bakery
I'm just tryin' to make it through makin'
I got a sweet jug in actin'
I got a coke connect he a Haitian
I had a weedman, but he a has been
I gotta smoke the gas 'til the ass end
They wanna jack me, but that's a dead end
This AR-15 will make your headspin (two times)
I'll even drop the top like Janet Jackson (two crimes)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, you ain't gotta sell it, cause its already sold
And you ain't gotta roll one cause its already rolled
Check out my technique, jus weed, let it flow
Shit, I've been smokin since I was 14 years old
I had a dime that never smoked blunts, just bowls
Taught me how to blow O's, inhale through my nose
So if you see me smokin dont blow my high
Uhhh, so I roll one and we both gon' fly
You smell it all in my clothes
Im takin in all the smoke when I...

[Hook: Mike Posner]
French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again
French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I take it to the face, inhale it through my nose
Blowin with the homies on the low, man fuck these hoes
And crack-a-lac, pin it back
What you call a mack who crack a mad bitch like that?
A cracker jack
Im like a florist, tourin like a tourist
Godzilla flyin on a pegasorous
Niggas know about it, even fore I pull it out
I put some fire on it, n now they beggin me to put it out
Im in the hallway, rollin on the purple psyche
I know the in's and out's so I'mma do what the fuck I like

[Hook: Mike Posner]
French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again
French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again

[Verse 1]
Now, this is my job, I will not quit it
Pulled me out the depths when I thought that I was finished
Yeah I questioned if I could go the distance
That's just the work, regardless of who's listening, listening
Listen, see I was meant to be a warrior
Fight something amongst me, leave here victorious
Classroom of kids, or a venue performing
If I'd done it for the money I'd have been a fucking lawyer
Concrete, vagabond, van telling stories
Humbled by the road, I'm realizing I'm not important
See life's a beautiful struggle, I record it
Hope it helps you maneuvering through yours and
That's why we stay in the lab at night
I've been staring into this pad for over half my life
A true artist won't be satisfied
So I guess that's the sacrifice
And I say

[Hook]
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true, I say
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true

[Verse 2]
Forget about the fame, fortune and the mansion
Sitting and tripping watching myself on a plasma
Yeah, I start slipping when I'm thinking about that stuff
Ego once swollen until karma catches that up, that up
I'm my grandma's number one grandson
I lost myself to remember who that was
We start thinking about some kicks, necklace
What I really need is a job off CraigsList
Take away the dot com, name, love
Fans, Twitter followers, and the buzz
See, you keep the issues but you take away the drugs
And I had to find out who I really was
Who I really wasn't
So sick of who I was becoming
Yeah, tired of running
Time to look at the man in the mirror until I can learn to love him

[Hook]
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true, I say
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true

[Bridge]
Of course I want dubs and a candy-painted 'lac
Watch the videos and get the girls in the back
But if that's what I believe in, and the reason that I rap
Uncle Sam is my pimp when he puts me on the track
Of course I want dubs and a candy-painted 'lac
Watch the videos and get the girls in the back
But if that's what I believe in, and the reason that I rap
Uncle Sam is my pimp when he puts me on the track

[Hook]
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
Stay true, stay true, and I said
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
Stay true, stay true, stay true

[Outro]
Forget about the fame
I said forget about the fame
I'll forever remain faithful
Stay true, stay true, stay true

[Chorus: Redfoo]
It doesn't matter what I say, no matter what I do
Every little thing reminds me of you
It gets harder every day, I don't know what to do
Every little thing reminds me of you

[Post-Chorus]
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you

[Verse 1: Redfoo]
Yes, party people, we drop and feet go
To make your fist-pump, hands up and feet go
Crazy, look at all these ladies, tonight is going down
Going down, Mayday!
We party rocking' in this place for sho'
Every place that we walk in is the place to go
Popping bottles up for free, with the models every week
Sexy go-gos the way your booty bobbles to the beat it's like:
On and popping, ain't no stopping, that bass is knocking
Them shots are dropping, some of us came to celebrate
But most of us came to get away

[Chorus: Redfoo]
It doesn't matter what I say, no matter what I do
Every little thing reminds me of you
It gets harder every day, I don't know what to do
Every little thing reminds me of you

[Verse 2: Sky Blu]
I'm a heavyweight
Light on my feet, watch me levitate
Sex tape, watch me penetrate
Then I slap you in the ass let it resonate
I'm living with the finer things
Designer draws, and diamond rings
Go to the mall, lots of things
I stay the same, call it pocket change, nigga (Pocket change, nigga)
I never ever been a bitch, my last girl was, so player had to switch
Probably only with me cause I'm rich, now she only on my booty call list
Yeah, mo money don't stop the show
But she still can ride my banana boat
She still can ride my banana boat
Now her new nick name is banana throat
Clear it out
I'm the one everybody here about, man you're just here for now
So simmer down, Verizon flow, you hear me now
I'm always up to something, we got Goon in the house cause he my cousin
We got dimes by the dozens, but without you girl, I'm nothing

[Verse 3: Redfoo]
Everybody's on the floor, I can see your hands up
From the stage to the door
Calvin Harris on the decks
LMFAO is on the checks
One, two in the place to be
It pays to be, what's happening next
Baby you look so fine, I can tell with that look in your eye
That me and you in the bathroom
Has crossed your mind
I rock a chain on my chest
Cause I'm fresh to the death
And everyday I'm shuffling, I'm like a soldier with these steps
It's on and popping, there ain't no stopping
That bass is knocking, the shots are dropping
Some of us came to celebrate, but most of us came to get away

[Chorus: Redfoo]
It doesn't matter what I say, no matter what I do
Every little thing reminds me of you
It gets harder every day, I don't know what to do
Every little thing reminds me of you

[Outro]
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you
She know a nigga' street
Vacation for a week
We sexing on the beach
And I ain’t taking ‘bout the drink
Open doors for her when I take her out to eat
I’m rolling up a sweet while she massage a nigga’ feet

Lil’ shawty so fine
I got her sipping wine
I tell her I don’t cheat
But she be knowing a nigga lyin’
Feds can’t stand me
They don’t understand me
While they ho hopping, I got her shopping in Miami

Everything’s G
Her friend's cuz bought a Jeep
Her bag a couple grand, and they compliments from me
See, I can be the king, and she can be my queen
And we can be a team
And fulfill eachother’s dreams
I love the way she talk
Love the way she walk
I’m always on her mind and she always in my thoughts
I got her at the house
We blowin’ on an ounce
I’m cooking dinner for her tonight
We ain’t going out

[Hook]
I meet a lot of hoes
Traveling on the road
Some I say yes, but some I say no
I be like “No no no, you can go go go”
Only fuck with bad bitches this is for my bad bitches

Meet a lot of hoes
Traveling on the road
Some I say yes, but some I say no
I’m like “No no no, you can go go go”
Only fuck with bad bitches this is for my bad bitches

No Wonderbra
She got monster jaw
Like a porn star
Nice ass, nice job

I wear no star
So I’m bringing my entourage
Bust a gun and put it in the air
If you down with Gucci Gucci
Turn yo’ boy on to La Flare
Girl so fine just look at her and stare
Millions worth of ice on
No need to compare
Your jeweler is a loser
I think I might need a cooler
Or change that ring to ruler
Eat breakfast go to Sizzly
Wake up, eat lunch in Italy
Buy you all types of iced out ornaments
The trap boys do that normally
I’m like “No no no, if you ain’t a bad bitch you can go go go”

[Hook]
I meet a lot of hoes
Traveling on the road
Some I say yes, but some I say no
I be like “No no no, you can go go go”
Only fuck with bad bitches this is for my bad bitches

Meet a lot of hoes
Traveling on the road
Some I say yes, but some I say no
I’m like “No no no, you can go go go”
Only fuck with bad bitches this is for my bad bitches

Started off as friends
But now we got a plan
I call her on her cellular
She’s calling me her man
Lets go to Japan
Maybe even France
Spend a hundred grand overseas
We holding hands

Gucci, Louis, Prada
It doesn’t even matter
I spoil her like my daughter
So she love me like her father

Cruising the Atlantic
Isn’t it romantic
Spaghetti strap dress
She ain’t wearing panties

Sex her on the couch
Freak her on the sink
I think tomorrow I might go buy her a mink… 

[2x]

[Hook]
I meet a lot of hoes

[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey
(9th Wonder) Hi, hey, hey, hey
92 'til infinity and beyond (Hey)
And on, and on (Heaven's like, Heaven's kinda like)
And on, and on (Heaven's kinda like)

[Verse 1]
Hey, I heard they got nice cars up in Heaven
Free liquor out the bar and the brightest fuckin' stars up in Heaven
Heard that you can chill, not worry 'bout the police
Not worry 'bout someone fightin' 'cause everything just at peace
Heard the streets paved with gold, the women all gorgeous
You just float, can't even feel where the floor is
I heard Heaven got a brand new venue
Next to that restaurant, you love their menu
And everything free, so everyone cool
Look out any window, it's an incredible view
Everyone you speak to always tellin' you the truth
And it's only good shit when you gettin' all your news
Ooh, ah, imagine that
Just a place that we can kick it, be happy at
Satisfaction or maybe I'm dreamin'
Tell you what it's like when I see it

[Chorus]
If you hear what Heaven's like, can you tell me?
Please, I'm really tryin' to know
'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done
Shit, I'm just tryin' to go
If you hear what Heaven's like, could you tell me?
Please, I'm really tryin' to know
'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done
Shit, I'm just tryin' to go

[Verse 2]
I heard ain't nobody famous up in Heaven, everybody the same
Just kick it up there in Heaven 'cause nobody goin' change
Nobody can complain, the parties are all insane
The people all know your name, shit, you entertain
See everybody you want, always keepin' in touch
And go and chill by yourself when everything get too much
Never a fuckin' rush, you there for a million plus
You probably got a Mercedes, but always could take the bus
So fuck, that's what Heaven's like, I guess I think it is
Come to think of it, I've been drinkin' shit, I don't know the truth
This is what I imagined when I was standin' in the booth, haha

[Chorus]
If you hear what Heaven's like, can you tell me?
Please, I'm really tryin' to know
'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done
Shit, I'm just tryin' to go
If you hear what Heaven's like, could you tell me?
Please, I'm really tryin' to know
'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done
Shit, I'm just tryin' to go

[Intro]
T. Slack, I promise I got 'em, homie!

[Verse 1]
I turn the phone off, I let the seat back
I'mma be out for a minute, I'll bring the heat back
The jet-setta and forever will I get chedda
And y'all will only get cash when you get betta
Check luggage, flow to a new city
Plus, the hoodie cover my eyes
I'm too pretty, nah, I'm just playin'
Heavy is how I weigh in
Top floor with a view of the water is what I stay in
But y'all don't hear me, yeah, y'all ain't relatin'
Well, let me tell you what happens when I be datin'
These chicks with ass fully skip they class
Catch me at the hotel and try and get they cash
But, I'm not stupid, nah -- I'm tight fisted
You tryna sex me for money is quite twisted
Prior to fall, I was lying to y'all
So if you gettin' one ring, I'm denyin' ya call

[Hook]
Let him breathe, let him live
Let him be, let him do it on his own
He a G, he just doing his thing
Gotta love that
Let him go, let him fall
Let him grow, if you feeling where he's at let him know
He just doing his thing
Gotta love that

[Verse 2]
Now my momma kinda iffy, My uncle kinda shifty
Expenses at this point have cost a little over fifty
The hummer and the range was in someone else's name
Hope my city's reputation for the summer's gonna change
I hope you stick around and see it
Cause if you ain't around I'll bring your chick around to see it
Until she catch feelings and I have to let her go
And when I park my car outside she'll stick around and key it
Repercussions of a cheap lash
Had me doing repaints, just to get em re-scratched
And get attached do insane things
Take new jewelry and put it down the drain things
But, that's just the drama that the fame brings
Fresh prince tryna touch sky like
Mr. Busy, Mr. Recieve the shipment
It's Mr. big dreams, no more than 2 months commitment

[Hook(2x)]
Let him breathe, let him live
Let him be, let him do it on his own
He a G, he just doin his thing
Gotta love that
Let him go, let him fall
Let him grow, if you feelin where he's at let him know
He just doin his thing
Gotta love that

[Intro]
I'm officially going in
And refusing to come out
Unless I'm bloody
Let's go

[Verse 1]
I'd like to think I pride myself on being humble
And let these other motherfuckers lose touch like a fumble
Cause you can keep a level head and have fun too
But I came to promote the game, ?
At least till my name's in the same lane as ?
You gonna have to respect me for making being uncool cool
? with sandals, Ray Bans, skinny pants and flannels
So insecure I'm tugging at my t-shirt
Cause I swear the girl behind me staring at my love handles
I just wanna change the channel or delete them
Where the fuck is Adam Sandler when you need him?
I'm Christopher Walken
On my papercut shit again,thank god for Walkmans
And I gotta thank God often
Cause otherwise I'd be like these other guys

[Hook]
This type of scene just ain't my thing
And everybody too cool for school
And yet somehow I never felt so alone
In a room full of people
So now I'mma seat on this stoop
And I'mma gonna lace up my boots
And keep on walking till I make my way home

[Verse 2]
Can someone tell me how I got here in the first place
Cause honestly in my opinion this the worst place
I mean I even said hello to a few girls
I feel like Brad Pitt stuck in cool world
Cause everything is so foreign
And all the conversation's boring
I mean I'm practically snoring
Could somebody please show me the door man
Cause I don't think that I can take it
Everybody here is extra hip like replacements
That's probably why I ain't sayin' shit
Oh what the hell I might as well get wasted
Cause I'd rather be sedated
Than conversate about whose sneakers are more outrageous
Or whose outfit's the latest
I think I'll blow jokes on you, greatest

[Hook]
This type of scene just ain't my thing
And everybody too cool for school
And yet somehow I never felt so alone
In a room full of people
So now I'mma seat on this stoop
And I'mma gonna lace on my boots
And keep on walking till I make my way home

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen
Boys and girls
I'd advise you all
To the Papercut Chronicles II
It don't get much better

[Hook]
This type of scene just ain't my thing
And everybody too cool for school
And yet somehow I never felt so alone
In a room full of people
So now I'mma seat on this stoop
And I'mma gonna lace on my boots
And keep on walking till I make my way home

[Intro]
Jay Rock what's good?
Haha, we label mates nigga I shoulda been jumped on this shit
But it's all good I'mma take care of it
Start like

[Verse 1]
I started out lil' nigga with a dream
Now I'm on but it still ain't what it seem
Cause now I got more money
More niggas rather see me somewhere on the floor then the ceiling of this thing
But I can give a damn what a little nigga think
I pop more champagne, peel another sweet
Catch Wiz skinny ass chillin' on the beach
Cut my old hoes off, I ain't get with them in weeks
I pray to God every night before I go to sleep
To let her know I'm safe, kiss my mother on the cheek
My little sister grown, little cousin tall as me
And I'm proud cause he ain't fuckin' round in the streets
The fans love the old school sound that I bring
You like jab-work, I pound on the beat
And bein' from Pittsburgh they sayin' they concerned
With tryna make a lame cause my sound is unique
I love when a nigga talk down, think it's sweet
You couldn't play me if you was acting in the scene
The haters can't see 'em, the money's in the way like traffic
Pistolvania is straight action
I'm from the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)
Where niggas ain't workin jobs
They only option is to hustle
They feel like they gotta get it
Not all about it then fuck you
You ain't someone that I grew up with
So why you think I would trust you?
Real talk like a dictionary
They say life's a bitch, I'm married
And we make love, she fuck other niggas tho
Can't keep up, you haters to slow, oh

[Outro]
Yea budy
That's how it is
That's it, that's all
Hahahaha, yea bitch
OK, hahaha

[Verse 1]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Verse 2]
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

[Chorus]
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Bridge]
You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
(Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no)

When the time cats run and hide upton
When I'm on tour the only time I'm not uptown
Now don't be wiggin off that E and get F'd up
Thinkin that you're G'd up boy you better ease up
We bleed the hood, the hood bleed us
But every time we hit the hood, the people hollerin out "Jesus"
Become lil nasty, product of his environment
Micky Dees firin, the postal wasn't hirin
Everyday the boy went to sleep to the sirens
And them people swingin round here and they inquirin
Who that is supplyin all that love?
I wouldn't of crept but I was hollerin out "What up blood"
When your relative when I was hollenin "What up cuz" if necessary
My pa was a beast, its hereditary, chyea

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Well I was just ridin in my city ain't stoppin for a hater
Make that get off my face if you ain't talkin about cake

Olympicks—Olympicks—Olympicks—Olympicks
Uh, alright

[Verse]
Get money addict, I'ma get "Money" tatted
Money in the attics, money in the stashes
Money in the cabinets, stuffed in the mattress
Safe full of guns, more money up in that shit
Taz Arnold TI$A, Jeremy Scott Adidas
Maison Martin Margiela, three strap sneakers
Riding with a leecher, student and a teacher
It's money over bitches, no room for a skeezer
Thinking of a Lambo, Bathing Ape camo
Play with the money, turn Rocky into Rambo
Patience is a virtue, life is a handful
Friends, they'll hurt you, learned that from my grandfolks
Me under a lamp post, while I got my hands closed
Haze to my brains like eggs, got it scrambled
Yeah I feel Rihanna, and I understand Hov
What you think I rap for? To push a fucking Land Rove?
Now I'm looking back when you said I shouldn't rap
Some slept on me, other niggas took a nap
Now I'm in the basement, probably cooking crack
Gave you teaspoons full but instead you took a cap
They say Tyga and Diggy, but Rocky been jiggy
Curren$y from the Wiz ain't enough to get me home
Can't really hate when they compare me to Drake
Could have been J. Cole if I met Jay Hov
(Who dat? ASAP) But I'm fly like I never left
You's a lie, like fly without the letter F
If hip hop is dead, fuck it, let it rest
Reincarnated through me when she resurrect
Long hair, blue jeans, live on U-Stream
High top boots like Pac in a Juice scene
No, it ain't a movie, diamonds in my new gleam
Dead tone cause the redbones is my new thing
Nigga, I do things, let the coupe sing
Niggas say I'm insane, Saddam Hussein
Niggas still jokers, me, I'm on my Bruce Wayne (Uh)
Fly kicks, my shit (Uh) yeah, I'm on that Liu Kang
I ain't bragging but I do this, my shoes is Bermudas
I'm bougie in that Gucci but my nudies is my newest
And your foolishness and rumors, I give two shits
I only hear the money, so save the bullshit for the Q-tips
Swag is the coolest, my bitch is the rudest
My jeweler is Jewish and my wrist is the bluest
And I get it poppin' on the block like Whoo Kid
A$AP standing on the block like the new kids

[Outro]
Uhh, A$AP nigga, uhh, uhh
Alright, yeah
A$AP nigga, uhh
Alright, alright

[Intro: Sample, T-Pain & Chris Brown]
"We're going to skate to one song, one song only"
Ooh, woah (Boom!)
Hahaha (Yeah!)
Look
It's your turn Chris (Hahaha)
I don't do this for my day job, man
Let's go, baby
I just do this shit for fun
I said let's go

[Verse: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
Look, I just came to get rid of every nigga
To murder every rapper, watch a nigga come up outta me (Boom!)
I'm stuntin' hard on these motherfuckers
Flyin' on the VMAs, Evel Knievel, the nigga proud of me (Boom!)
I'm drinkin' this shit 'til 5 in the mornin'
Your girl's number 1 pick, call me Mr. Lottery (Boom!)
I let a hater nigga die, pow, like it's suicide
I ain't givin' no more fuckin' apologies (Yeah!)
Stunt so hard, that shit crazy, ain't shit free, fuck you pay me
Heron flow from the '80s and my chain on me like, "We made it"
My kinfolk got 10 hoes, five whites, two blacks, like three Asians
My Benzo, goddamn, ho, nigga, take this shit I'm too faded
Go 'head and bring your crown over, ass kisser, brown noser (Woo!)
Fuck yo luck, I smoke clovers, I'm partyin' with boat owners (Uh!)
Marilyn Monroe hoes all on us, rookies tryna get your signin' bonus
Nigga, look at my chain, man, I paint your face, you a clown, homie (Oh!)
Not tryna throw subliminal, my Porsche got force, centrifugal
Even if it's just 10 of y'all, I put you in the old school and you pin up dolls, yikes (Yeah!)
That shit crazy, don't you play me
You tryna get on this bus (Woo!), bitch, sign this waiver
Hol' up, hol' up, gimme that Chardonnay and that Marvin Gaye shit (Woo!)
But hol' up, my conversation too complicated, this bitch too basic (Oh!)
You ain't no groupie, girl and you know that I won't say shit
You got skeletons in your closet, I got aliens in my basement (Yikes!)

[Outro: T-Pain]
Ladies and gentlemen
That's what you call rippin' the game a new asshole
Hahahaha
CBE, Nappy Boy, baby, leggo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That shit cray

[Verse 1]
No baby don't do that, don't touch that
Could you please be still? (Baby, stop)
No baby, you can't have that, until you eat your dinner
Guess I gotta treat you like a baby girl

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the cutest, you're the cutest thing, oh oh
But you can't always get your way, like a baby girl
I wanna keep that smile on your face, all for it
But it ain't easy, you won't make it easy

[Chorus]
You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

[Verse 2]
Now you know you should be sleeping, but okay
I'll give you ten more minutes
We've been sleeping in the same bed
Cause you been having nightmares
And you need me here
I guess I always treat you like a baby girl

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the cutest, you're the cutest thing aw yeah
But you can't always get your way, like a baby girl
I wanna keep that smile on your face, uh huh
But it ain't easy, no it ain't easy

[Chorus]
You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

[Verse 3]
You want love? Well no more sugar for you
And you don't know how to act, so no more sugar for you
You're jumping off the walls, no more sugar for you
I said ain't no sugar for you
Well, just a little bit, but

[Chorus]
You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

[Intro: Travie McCoy]
Let's go

[Chorus: Oh Land, Travie McCoy]
Oh, when the day is gone
Oh, when the nights are long
Life goes on
Life goes on
We gotta live it up 'til it's gone (Live it up)
'Cause we won't be around too long (Nah)
Life goes on
Life goes on (Yeah!)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Lately, it seems the good dreams are few and far between
Nightmares are putting fires out with gasoline (Damn)
And I'm just tryin' to stay righteous
Sometimes I see my own face in Christ's likeness (Uh-huh, yeah)
And apart from my life's vices
Fifteen years young had my first midlife crisis (Uh, uh, wow)
But it's tough to stay upright and pious
When people you hold highest be the ones that most biased (Damn)
My daddy told me misery loves company
If that's the case they must hate they ain't getting none from me
I don't sweat it, it's embedded in my DNA
I got a good heart and Bad Brains BMA

[Chorus: Oh Land, Travie McCoy, Both]
Oh, when the day is gone (Yeah)
Oh, when the nights are long (Uh-huh)
Life goes on (Life goes on)
Life goes on (They say that life goes on, let's go!)
We gotta live it up 'til it's gone (Live it up)
'Cause we won't be around too long (Nah)
Life goes on (Life goes on)
Life goes on (You know that life goes on)
Yeah (Come on!)

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
Up late Facebookin', playing could've been
And staring at an empty bed my ex-girl should've been in
Thinking what I woulda done different
Not a damn thing 'cause finally I'm done with it (I'm done)
Besides, I got a girl that adores me
And I never take for granted all things she does for me (Never)
I shoot the moon down and put it on a wedding band (*Pow*)
And sing "These Arms of Mine" to her, she's a Otis Redding fan
And she'll never forget it, man
'Cause she knows she'll never find a better man (No)
Let's go ahead with these wedding plans
Come on, let's sing a song, life goes on

[Chorus: Oh Land, Travie McCoy, Both]
Oh, when the day is gone (Day's gone)
Oh, when the nights are long (Nights are long)
Life goes on (Life goes on)
Life goes on (You know that life goes on, come on!)
We gotta live it up 'til it's gone (Live it up)
'Cause we won't be around too long (Nah)
Life goes on (Life goes on)
Life goes on (They say that life goes on)
Yeah

[Bridge: Travie McCoy & Oh Land, Travie McCoy]
We take too much for granted
Too much, we don't want an inch, we want miles
I just can't understand it
Can't understand it, is it really that hard to smile?
We don't ask, we demand it
We demand it, it's gone when it's gone
And I'm tryin' not to panic
But you know what they say, life goes on

[Chorus: Oh Land, Travie McCoy, Both]
Oh, when the day is gone (Yeah!)
Oh, when the nights are long
Life goes on (Life goes on)
Life goes on (Ya know that life goes on, come on!)
We gotta live it up 'til it's gone (Live it up)
'Cause we won't be around too long (Nah)
Life goes on (Life goes on)
Life goes on (Life goes on)
Oh, when the day is gone (They say that life goes on)
Oh, when the nights are long (You know that life goes on)
Life goes on (They say that life goes on)
Life goes on (You know that, You know that, you know that life goes on)
We gotta live it up 'til it's gone
'Cause we won't be around too long (So beautiful)
Life goes on (I feel amazing, baby)
Life goes on

[Outro: Oh Land, Travie McCoy]
(Life goes on)
Yeah! Ha-ha-ha
(Life goes on)
(Life goes on)
I'm feeling motha-fucking great
(Life goes on)
(Life goes on)
(Life goes on)
(Life goes on)

[Intro: Pharrell]
Yup!
Um
Ugh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
There's a rainbow everywhere dependin' on where you stand
Whether the dashboard of yay or the walls 100 grand each
Double R, interior tan, outside is peach
Oh, you trying to make a deal out in Golden Beach?
Or the Florida Keys, ducking the Florida Ds
But you only end up with bricks of sand
I know niggas that run from they shadows like Peter Pan
Runnin' like it's a Nike commercial, but he the man
What he don’t like, on sight, he murk like he's the Klan
Eightballs the size of baseballs like Jeter’s hand
It's fecal, fam—yeah, it’s the shit
Zip your face up when Skateboard is on the script
Catch me in the Gap V with some BBC trunks
Flip flops, sippin' on Qream like it's punch
I push the spaceship with the chrome lady in the front
Bendin' over like she just puffed Busta’s blunt
I told y’all muh'fuckas once: I think I’m hungry
Finna eat y'all niggas' lunch, y'all niggas cunts
I’m from the Commonwealth, where wealth ain't common
When niggas roll around with chrome solvers, looking for problems
Mouth full of gold, flame when they roll
Arthritic fingers: niggas bang when they stroll
Tradin' in the hats for the cane and the gold
The golds for the chain and the 'caine was on swole
Ayo Tip, get these peon niggas told

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Still stand tall when it all falls down
Whether Hollywood Hills or a one-horse town
You should know better
There’s no better than these four letters
More than ever, niggas want me dead
'Cause they're starving and I'm getting fed
But fuck 'em anyway
I’d rather be me on my worst day
Than to be a sucker nigga on his birthday
All cake, no candles, just a living example
Ten toes down, all out, no sandals
Godfather, young Marlon Brando
Let me make sure they understand, yo
Here ye, hear ye, you wise, you fear me
Real niggas on their shine, much obliged, merci!
Everybody want to criticize him
'Bout how bad he ended up; look how bad he could've been
I could've caught a body, sold a brick to somebody
Who volunteered my information to the federales
I made it out of all of that like I ain't gon' be proud of that
So petty shit you sticking to me? Give me all you got of that
Doing this for all my niggas
Who'd rather go to prison than to let a nigga kill 'em
So we leaving this PO snub-nose in his denim
Trap or death is waiting 'round the corners that he been in
On bended knee, God forgive us, we been sinnin'
In our defense, look at the options we was given
Laying in the prison cell, staring at the ceiling
Back in this bitch again, guess they wasn't bullshitting, huh?
Still wonder where it all went wrong
Since Phil got killed, I ain't never moved on
Like I’m still in the club where the blows got thrown
When my crown fell down and I got dethroned
Bunch of niggas around, but I feel all alone
Like a piece of me is missing; guess it never came home
Probably died in the van when it all hit the fan
Save the life of a friend—we don’t all get the chance
Now, here I stand, with blood on my hands
Trying hard to explain so his mom understand
I'm at fault for the loss of the soul of a man
Only soldiers know how that'll take a toll on a man
Burdens of the world on my shoulders, heavy
Visibly composed, my emotions buried
Scary, so if I pop a pill
Smoke a blunt or take a shot, y'all, let a nigga live
Still baffled how my life unraveled
In the meantime, time just travelled
Can’t see behind the walls of my castle
Opinionated peon, son, but who asked you?
I tell you what you do: take your two cents
Kick rocks to a fountain, pitch 'em and make a wish
Shit, if wishes had wings
They’d all make it to heaven and we’d all be kings
Hahaha! If wishes had wings
They’d all make it to heaven and we’d all be kings
Yeah!

[Verse]
You're the only girl that I have ever wanted
Every other girl is trying to be you
My mama says that I should write you letters
But I think you're with other dudes

Take my hand, you'll like it
You don't even have to call
Yes, I've had some alcohol, I'm sorry
Take my hand
You don't even have to call
You're somewhere out there after all

[Outro]
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever wanted

[Produced by Infamous]

[Verse:]
The clock that you've been watching has been stoppin
He makes you wait, what kind of man does that to a girl he wants
If you just give tonight to me I promise my hands will say

[Chorus:]
They'll say
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarms
Even though the traffic downtown don't show no mercy
Think about the last time I came through
I had something more than a gift for you
And I don't only fuck you like that on your birthday

Baby I just landed
Bout to get my bags and all I needs an address
And I'm on my way

Don't fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it's worth waiting for
Cuz I'm on my way (2x)

[Verse 1: Drake]
I can buy it all out
But this the only shit that I sip though
So tell 'em bring the waitress
And I won't even ask what it hit fo'
Just send her to the bar like (like)
Send her to the bar like (like)
Send her to the bar like (like)
Like them niggas over there wanna..

[Chorus: Drake]
Pop Rosé (Hey... ay ay)
Pop Rosé (Hey... ay ay)
Pop Rosé (Hey... ay ay)
Pop Rosé

[Verse 2: Drake & Trey Songz]
Uh
They say you get paid when you think ahead
Valentines day girl, all you see is pink and red (yup)
And everything is on me
Rosé Spade to the '96 Don P
Hang around us, and I bet you
We'll get to stunt on whoever ya sittin' next to
You put 'em all on, and watch 'em run wit' it
And then wait for whatever's next when I'm done with it
And niggas show hate, period
It's like they all pregnant, they late, period
Yeah and shit's all good
The deal got signed and my split's all good
And some people pretendin' that it's all good
Say that shit in person man I wish y'all would
Yeah I told you I partied with Azuka
I'll let them other niggas Grey Goose ya
And we about to (yup)

[Chorus 2: Trey Songz]
Pop Rosé
Pop Rosé (Ooooh)
Pop Rosé (Ooooh)
Pop Rosé

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
If your beat gets released then I'ma take it
If your girl is a freak, then I'm her favorite
Got my partner with me, this is a replacement
Who do it like I do? You tellin' a lie fool
Leave the beat dead, all red like Piru
Been around the world, all girls like fly dudes
You a herb, get on her nerves like flies do
You need more girls, go call my manager
Two, three, four more, sure, we can handle ya
Gimme e'rythang I want, don't mess my order up
And her ass on point so my homie brought her up
Ma passed me the blunt, then I told her pour it up
In a flash we was gone, and you know I tore it up
Breast, ass, silicone, sex hot as Florida
South Beach, mouthpiece could swallow a Porterhouse
Yup, it get nasty, then I get gully
Grab the coochie, then the Gucci skully
A whole pack of rubbers, then I burned rubber
You cuddle undercovers, tellin' her you love her
When it come to verses, swear that I'm perfect
Murder in the first it's chllin in the hearses
Worthless, singing off key on purpose
We gon' pop, fuck urban (Ooooh)
(Yup)

[Chorus 3: Trey Songz]
Pop Rosé (Ooooh)
Pop Rosé (Fa Sho... Ooooh)
Pop Rosé (Fa Sho... Ooooh)
(Yup)

[Outro: Drake & Trey Songz]
Are you drunk? I'm faded too
When you get money they just hate on you
But, fuck them, there's all these ladies in my view
So I ball baby (Yup)
Ball baby
Ball baby
Ball baby
Lyrics from Snippet 1

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, uh
I'm feelin' you, guaranteed that you into me
I got the phantom, the aston, the bent-e-ley
But let me tell you where a nigga at mentally
Two things I don't give a bitch: pay checks and sympathy
Ha! But I guess it's just the pimp in me
All around paid, can't even get a sentence free
So judge a nigga sweetheart, sentence me
I ain't worried it's gon' happen if it's meant to be
And if you ever feel the need to step inside
Be a woman about it and know we living separate lives
Trying to tell you, less feelings mean less goodbyes
That's some game for your ass, better recognize
But some cats can't even relate
I ain't a mind reader though, so if you tryna escape
Then let me know that, show that
My place, roll back, lay down, so flat
Tell Me!
Lyrics from Snippet 2

[Verse 2]
... Talkin' and a lil chit-chat
You rollin' with me, then we fucking when we get back
That's a 

[?], tell me if you with that
Don't decline, just recline, sit back

[?] straight ...
Intro:
I wouldn't be me if I didn't get a little nasty
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na hey
They say all I talk about is sex

Verse (Trey Songz):
How 'bout we just pull over and do it where we at
How 'bout you just lift that skirt up, ooh we can be bad
That place that ain't been touched, I'm feelin on it
All that juicy fruit, keep spillin' on it
Girl, giddyup, get it up take me on a ride to extacy
You don't wanna pump pump then take a nap
You just wanna pump pump, bring it right back
Watch me (Watch me), Im'a heat it up beat it up

Hook:
Know you're tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
I'm not coming with the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon feel something unusual
Verse (Trey Songz):
I want to do the freaky things you never do
What if we did it while your friends was in the room
Is that too much for ya?
Don't you feel bad, let them see your sexy ass
We can make a sex room wherever we go
Take it to the restroom, they ain't got to know (no)
Watch me heat it up beat it up
Hey, do you hear me girl
Woah watch me heat it up beat it up

Hook:

Bridge:
Restaurants (check), Cinemas (check)
On the hood (check) of the car
Counter top (check), Balcony (check)
In the jet (check), On the beach (leggo)

Rap (Drake):
This that other shit, You know your asked for it
I might just send you some money to get your passport
So you can come to my city, I'll take you all over
And hit you on the balcony just don't fall over
Send me your picture baby you know I'll never leak it
I know you got something recent for someone decent
Why you laughin' out loud, I'm serious
Bring your girl if she's a little bi-curious
Please, please no story tellin' to others
I promise you gon' love it
I would never let you down
Feel like I might have perfected all the things that you expected
You gon know it when you bring your ass around
Hook:

Outro:
Do it all different ways or different places
Look at the many love faces your makin'
But can you take it

Yall thought I was nasty last time...Leggo

[Hook: Ellie Goulding]
I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I’m not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I’m not keeping up
The strength I need to push me
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

[Verse: Lupe Fiasco]
So, what are you going to stand for?
Dreads in the sky, I and I, 2 new Vans on a land four
Take that back, make that 2 new shoes on the van floor
Me and my band out on that road
On a never-back-down-from-my-stance tour
Yeah, touch more souls than a dance floor
While they touch less floors than a hand or
Ceiling fan or - wait, let me tell ya slower
Lift my fans up to the ceiling and you'll never touch the floor
Woah, now if Noah need a rower
I'll be there with my oar till we get back to the shore
Dad made me a soldier, GI Joe to these Cobras
Tryna FBI my Panther, CIA my Sankofa
Infiltrate my Carter, illuminate my culture
While they watching through that buckle, but I stay up on my hustle
Turn that belt back on they self, now I watch them scream for help
Like Africa need aid, or black women as maids
Uncover undercovers turn those maids to Bubba's mothers
Take the hero out the Nino, keep it real as trouble-trouble, huh?
Or maybe cartoon Martin on The Boondocks
Flip the script on chicks who think their shit smells like perfume shops
Help them girls find beauty without a magazine or movie
She Delilah with them .45s or Keisha with that Uzi
Now I know that's contradiction, wants and needs in competition
But it's hard to stay on point with such extremes in opposition
While we waiting on that compromise, proceed with that conscious eye
New gang alert: hashtag occupies
Repper 'til the death of me, FnF, what's left of me
All my hate is for the fake recipes for wrestling
Only time I wrestle's when I'm wrestling with settling
Only way I settle if we wrestle over everything
I know that that don't mix like ecstasy and ketamine
Funny how I'm only sick if you never catch a thing
Argue with your friends over what really the record means
Back and forth about its course, with professors refereeing
Why he so rebellious? Up-front with his realness?
They wanna be fiascoes, reproduce his failures
Emperor is his alias, but not Marcus Aurelius
This is more like Sparta: kick you down a well, kid
And on my last check, I copped the NSX, just like Pharrell did
Well did, better doings to come
My only promise is I'll never ruin the young
I'll never human the sung lyrics in a spirit that's
Superhuman to some, keep you pursuing the sum of
Slums, plus, get up out of them, plus, never forget
Just where you from, plus, make sure that you're ballin'
When you come back up in them, plus, we don't die, multiply
Every single come-up,  parum-pa-pum-pum, yup

[Hook]

[Hook]
Hey how you doin', Ms. Lady? You so fine with it
I know you handlin' business, can I get your 5 minutes?
Don't be offended by me telling you you thick with it
With all that shake - can a player get some fries with it?
With all that shake - can a player get some fries with it?
With all that shake - can a player get some fries with it?
Don't be offended when I tell you that you're very pretty
With all that shake - can a player get some fries with it?
's Gucci

[Ludacris]
That waist got a swivel to it
But that ass a Cali earthquake jiggle to it
She a stallion - no horseshit
You could fit that bitch's booty on a forklift
Beep! Beep! Bitch back it up
I put my balls on the table, tell her rack 'em up
Vanilla bed sheets, chocolate laid one way
Sprinkle my nuts on top — what a sundae
Whipped cream cherry on top
And when I ain't wit' her, pussy on lock
Throw away the key, it's a wrap bitch!
Large shake and a Ludacris sandwich

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
Yo, mama turned out, she so popular
You suckers can't see her with binoculars
She'll suck your pocket dry like Dracula
Her last boyfriend bought her an Acura
Don't try to get all attached to her
She an alley-cat type — that chick'll scratch you up
Like Bel Biv DeVoe said, "She's dangerous"
Her old man used to snort angel dust
So, don't be quick to judge, shorty bad as fuck
She's the type that drive back with the bricks for bucks
She had a ballplayer dude but she fucked him up
He bankrupt, selling cars like an auctioner
's Gucci

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
I've got a sausage for them hot cakes
And I be fuckin' while you niggas out on hot dates
You all polite and open doors for her
While every night I put that blanket on the floor for her
These hoes be sprintin' like it's track 'n' field
Because this supersize dick is their Happy Meal
So for an extra value woody
Put this Big Mac into that Quarter-Pound pussy, yes!
It's Ludacris "Mr. Slay-A-Bitch"
Unless that pussy is smelling like a Filet-O-Fish
Shoo Fly, ho! Kick the bucket
And niggas talking shit I bust 'em in their chicken nugget

[Intro]
Alright, c'mon
T-To me, girl, oh it's you

[Hook]
No matter what they say you do you know we got the whole city and we riding for you, you
And when the kids get big they gon' try and do it big like you, you, you, you
They gon' try and do it big like you, you, you, you
They gon' try and do it big like you

[Verse 1]
Now it's a lot on my back like J-Lo
Heaven on Earth, all I'm missing is a halo
Won't stop 'til I am the greatest on my label
When I'm all GOOD music, that's the greatest of the labels
It's hard tryna build a palace out of legos
19 got it in early like eggos
Never did anything illegal for a payroll
So without Cain I was always Abel, get it?
You dumb with it if you ain't able
And life is better with bread like mayo
So I was young like "How we gon' get paid bro?"
Now I'm on rodeo, fresher than a day old, you know
And I know the whole world is gon' see me
Mamma do I look better on TV?
I know them haters irritated as a STD
Man tell them niggas be easy, man be easy

[Hook]
No matter what they say you do you know we got the whole city and we riding for you, you
And when the kids get big they gon' try and do it big like you, you, you, you
They gon' try and do it big like you, you, you, you
They gon' try and do it big like you

[Verse 2]
Man I be better, than whoever, for forever in a year
I put it on mama dear
I love the limelight shine bright, ha bing
19 living out a niggas pipe dream
I'm so legitimate
It would be ignorant
If you were not to consider this, from a true lyricist
Unless they hating on a nigga like Jena 6

[Intro]
Yeah, my check
Yeah
Gucci

[Verse 1]
Started out with blood money
50k in drugs on me
Drop Chevy, put thugs on me
Just pulled up in the club homey
We just put my thugs on it
Homeboy getting his mug on
Hey, I wanna get my buzz on
Fuck around, I'll put my gloves on
Say no robbin', how I eat
B.C 32, that's my street
Brick Squad runners ten million deep
I'm trying to sell ten billion ki's
Fuck what a bitch boy say to me
AK 'n AR stay with' me
Mac 99 not far away my dogs don't even play with me
In my apartment, 80 a piece
Stack a piece, 80 G's
Old school donk parked right out front
Off set shots, 73
You say he's a trapper, please
I hang around with a gang of thieves
They probably charge 200 G's then sell your ass a sack of leaves
Gucci Mane, fuck Uncle Sam
Dead drunk like my Uncle Coke
Touch my brother Duke and I'll cock and shoot or cut your throat
Gucci Mane, fuck Uncle Sam
Dead drunk like my Uncle Coke
Fuck around, touch my brother Duke and I'll cock and shoot or cut your throat

[Chorus]
My cookers made a 50 pack, I ran straight through it
Doin' numbers in my blow spot, my trap house boomin'
Talkin' trap talk (Trap talk)
You chop it up with me, then trap talk (Trap talk)
I'm still in my trap house, aka my blow spot
Got some many chops and Glock, no need to keep the door locked
Talkin' trap talk
You chop it up with me, then trap talk (Trap talk)
It's Gucci!

[Verse 2]
55 white bricks fronted to me (Fronted to me)
23 thou' 5'hunit a piece (Wow)
.357 sit on top of the seats (Baow)
Plus a AR-15 ain't far from my reach
Got a house on flat Shoals, sell nothin' but dro
Apartment on the crest, where I get off the blow
Went from pan to perform to 80 a show
Now 26 a shocks, sit up under the rows
A nigga think he playin' with me but I play with his nose
Put a hole in his chest, 'bout the size of commode
I got a J that swing my door and I pay him in dope
I got cutters on my team that snort, I pay them in coke
It's Gucci!

[Chorus]
My cookers made a 50 pack, I ran straight through it
Doin' numbers in my blow spot, my trap house boomin'
Talkin' trap talk (Trap talk)
You chop it up with me, then trap talk (Trap talk)
I'm still in my trap house, aka my blow spot
Got some many chops and Glock, no need to keep the door locked
Talkin' trap talk
You chop it up with me, then trap talk (Trap talk)

[Verse 3]
There's no one in the game with more swagger than this
'Cause I can score with any ho with just the flick of my wrist
Diamonds sittin' on my finger cost ten brick of the sniff
For this matchin' Cartiers, 20 bags of the pills
You can talk and say your sick but I ain't goin' legit
Try and think of the newest murder drop I'ma get (Gucci)
Flow hotter than runnin' water
Tattooed up like Travis Barker
More swag than your baby father
Wrist colder than Northern border
Lang gonna get your life in order
Squares don't get no likin' on
Half my goons are thankin' slaughter
Fuck around, find you stankin' partner
These diamonds in this bitch look like newvo on my fist
Shit, this all a would have twist so I keep a new bitch on my dick

[Chorus]
My cookers made a 50 pack, I ran straight through it
Doin' numbers in my blow spot, my trap house boomin'
Talkin' trap talk (Trap talk)
You chop it up with me, then trap talk (Trap talk)
I'm still in my trap house, aka my blow spot
Got some many chops and Glock, no need to keep the door locked
Talkin' trap talk
You chop it up with me, then trap talk (Trap talk)
It's Gucci!

[Intro: Big Sean]
All night, yeah

[Verse 1: Mr Bentley]
Batter up, forget the sign, here come the wind
He swing away, I knuckle up
Been in the clutch, he drive a stick
No not bat, you missed that, I'm not in fifth gear, switch
Six Bent, chopped and screwed
I ain't talking 'bout the beat, I'm talking 'bout my suit
Keep four hand not like bi-fon-du
When I move they telling me they loving my colours
All that talking 'bout the clothes, I'm talking about the under
Huh, ground sonic kings I rap while pimped with a wease
My audemar maid bring me green tea
Tell foreign election girls, I massage her feet
And she love me long time, my woman stay on her knees
Use the head for prayer only, Bible to say thank you
And now you know for sure that I'm not like you
I'm not shallow, watch out, I just signed a tape
You can't catch a fish unless you got the right bait
And though I have a stable with the best milkshakes
The booty pass, formaldehyde
Abstinent like ebony in fashion league, why? We different
You complain that there's not enough metaphors
I complain that there's not enough candy for us
We got different tastes, you get hot when you're not getting enough green
Uh, some more collard greens? I got enough pepper sauce
You hear things and let 'em go over your head
I write 'em down and Google 'em before I go to bed
'Nough said, pays the parallel park, rim brand, let the driver take a day, Big Sean got the big Benz instead
Yeah, and if you got all that, the result tab, points are factual, red

[Hook: Big Sean]

Cause we know what you like

So tell 'em that we going all night, alright?

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I miss Cherie Amore I see
Won't you come be my Cherie Amore for me?
Oui oui, baby I can make it better for we
She got that baby phat fat, not Kimora Lee
I used to be underground like the pipeline
Now I'm everywhere like Wi-Fi
So long on to a Don Corleone
Who was known to be known off performing his songs
And that's honest, I'm from a place that's so unprotected
Need more than a condom
But now a nigga label mates with Common
So how them haters feel? Shit, no comment
You like Kanye? He cool with Hov
Oh, you don't like Hov? Well I know you like Beyoncé
Ain't looking for a wife but, maybe a fiancé
The man on my team from the D like Chauncey
Billups babe, mhm, and we could leave
I'm tryna beat like 88 keys
High living like we smoke 88 trees
Hot shit baby, I might radiate heat
Excuse me if I don't come all cordial
I don't mean to put you through this whole ordeal
Baby I'm more real
Coming from a city where the niggas keep it popping like Orville

[Hook: Big Sean]
It's on, roll up, post up
Here come the pig seats and pose up
And tell 'em that we going all night
Cause we know what you like
Bentley know what you like

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We out in Abu Dhabi, we like to party
We don’t cause trouble, we just ride Bugatti
Bad chick shawty, sorta resemble Sade
Imported her in from Raleigh
And pulled up into the valet
The boy dropped the keys tryna sneak-a-peek at that body
See this that time of the week, she like to freek-a-leak and get naughty
Therefore I like to thank God and Ice Cube for Friday
Cause La-Di-Da-Di… (Cause we like to party)

[Bridge: Beyonce]
So in love

I wear my sunglasses at night so I can — so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night so I can — so I can

(Two chainz)

[Verse 1: Tity Boi]
I am wearin' my sunglasses, I'm feelin' fantastic
I'm blowin' on that 

[?] watchin' a plasma, what have you
And shorty layin' in my lap, then she sit up in my lap
Tried to take my glasses off, I'm like, "Uh-uh-uh— none o' that"

[?] wit' a hun'ed packs 

[?] wit' a hun'ed stacks
I'm ridin' in a fancy car with twenty-somethin's ona that
Yeah you gotta honor that, cause you know we runnin' it
I'm a fuckin' soldier, that make my kid an army-brat
Ain't no need o' stallin', when you call, we ain't callin' back
Yeah we want that product, when we rob you we'll take all o' that
Yeah, my sunglasses on, it keep my face tucked
See, when her sunglasses on, yeah that's her make-up
With tinted frames on my eyelids look what I did
I drive with no gasoline like a hybrid
I'm high, bitch. I'm on it, ho
Seven-five-oh on two-eighty-five, peddle on the flo'

[?] in my 

[?], I fell in love with dough
It's all about that money, that's all you need to know
I can't explain it, I don't know what you drinkin'
See all I care about is pussy, weed, and Ben Franklins
(Aphilliates, nigga. Pay attention, biatch!)

[Hook: Corey Hart]
I wear my sunglasses at night so I can — so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night so I can — so I can

(Tell these motherfuckers how I do it. Luda!)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I wear my sunglasses at night-time, never in my right mind
Pushin', peddlin' then movin' that gwop right through that pipeline
Money money's what I see an' money money's what I be in
Freshly dipped from head to toe, flew to Cabo just for the weekend
Bitch, that's just how I do it; Oh bitch, I get right to it
Sippin' on some Golden Grain, but my niggas we call it embalmin' fluid
Put a bomb in your mamma's house, put a bomb in your bitch's bed
Meanwhile over on the southside, Ludacris is gettin' head
I'm on that foolish shit, only got one life to live
I'm shootin' pool wi' Tit, only got five thou' to give
Till I stop tellin' Tit to rack 'em, then we shoot them dice 'n' clack 'em
Later on that night on the southside, we got some bitches and macked 'em
Right down to their bare-essentials, don't mess wit' 'em on their menstruals
Don't test us like that bitch — get a number two fuckin' pencil
You must be out your noggin, better make the right decision
I wear my sunglasses at night cause they got x-ray vision

[Hook: Corey Hart]
I wear my sunglasses at night so I can — so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night so I can — so I can
First name Scott, last name Mescudi
I will say it now so you all can say it properly
Even for awhile lotta people stayed mocking me
Then I went G.O.O.D. cause of 'ye now they jocking me
I have the same sound, same old fire, same lion heart
And I stayed smoking sour, every single minute now, gotta say an hour
I feel I am cross of John Lennon and my father
I remember when I finally left Cleveland
Being cool, it wasn't the only reason
My heart had urges, the feelings
Something special you could feel up in the evening
When the moons full and the drink is poured
And most of the real pretty girls are whores
Now I gotta say get the fuck outta here, I don't know you
No, you can't chill in here

Na na na na
Yeah yeah yeah
Now
Do you, do you, do you
Do you get it, get it
Na na na na
Whoa.. na na
Now
Do you, do you, do you
Do you get it, get it
My last name Mescudi, first name Scott
I was the kid you knew who liked to joke and clown a lot
But when I went home school work to the side
I'mma go and study how to finish up these rhymes
Maybe hit a kidney and my family hit the grind
Before I feel I'll never ever find my own mind
Losing my pops really fucked me up
At that time in my mind I thought my luck was up
Its mostly cause I never got to show what I dream
I guess its cause I never had the time to let it show
But now I got an op im bout to give to the public
I know he lookin' down, I know he gotta love it
Ohio got a spokesman

They wanna know if I really smoke
Come on fam
Are you lookin at these black lips?
All the time im flatlined stoned bitch

Na na na na
Yea yea yea
Now
Do you, do you, do you
Do you get it, get it

Na na na na
Whoa.. na na
Now
Do you, do you, do you
Do you get it (Yea) , get it
I'm scott mescudi
Never let the sucker motha' fuckers get the best of me
Goin back to Cleveland, dap and pound her is my ?
Stand up nigga
When people hate on Cleveland I stand up nigga
WOW in my A.P.C
AA get the best plain tees
When I head to the grammys I might dress tacky
Cause all the people care about is what im wearing
In the bag it should be about the sweet fuckin album
Lets talk about the fact you want a sweet fuckin album
Some talk shit makin' videos and jokin
Now your all fans of my shaft think I stroke em
I told you, I was not playin'
From here on believe the words that im sayin'
But know I won't lead you astray
Just take heed to the words that I say

Na na na na
Yea yea yea
Now
Do you, do you, do you
Do you get it, get it
Na na na na
Whoa.. na na
Now
Do you, do you, do you

[Verse 1]
Woah, Nelly, tell Angelina Jolie I'm ready
With petroleum jelly, to smear it all over me belly
And tell her she can hit me on me mobile, me celly
And meet in the salami section of the grocery deli
And maybe we can find us an appropriate telly
A Motel 6 or 8, I think they both could be helly
I hit it, then I quit it and I told her "Email me
And don't call me, I'll call you— can you feel me? Ho, do you smell me?
Animal instinct, cannibalistic
I just ran out of lipstick, man, I'm a twisted
Sick, sadistic, son of a bitch, 666
Broke his crucifix made out of sticks, then fixed it
Chck-chck-chck, chick, chck-chck, chck-chck, chck!
Now play it backwards: "muscle relaxers mixed with
Liquid Dilaudid, it's diluted for quick fix
You're delusional, illusions look realistic

[Verse 2]
I need Christopher Reeves to come and lay his verse
I think he can spit it better on Medicine Ball, first
Off, I did not even realize the guy died
So I guess them Christopher Reeves jokes ain't gonna fly
Oh! I'm on a roll, don't get me started
Ellen got pissed at me and tried to push me into the garden
With such accuracy, she aims and shoots the target
Cupid's arrow done forced it, now look, sweetheart, it's
The kissin' bandit on a mission to leave Ms. Degeneres
Disenchanted by men, now just listen, dammit
Mr. Rossi, I need no posse, I single handed-
-ly will steal your heart with a kiss, where should I plant it?
Moi! Baby, it's Moi! And my repertoire
Is running around in pink panties and leopard bra
And negligah, negligée, you say tomato, I say tomah-to
I'm Tommy Motola Mariah, don't stop me, I'm on a roll
Oh!
I return before tables get turned
It’s my turn, spur of the moment
They re-produce my sperm and try to clone it, stand firm
Bumping The Firm, Phone Tap, I’m on it
I slaughter every opponent to bits of components, potent
You can’t fuck with the horse power, your woofing too much
Y’all bout to hoarse coward, as soon as I buss, pause
You put your hands on a broad and telling me you can brawl
You thought you saw me when you saw Saw, frightening
More reckless than a paisa driving without a license
Hittin’ your new truck then leaving you hiking
They said no, the industry let it go
I cracked the window then hit the back door like trick dices
Stickin’ and movin and movin’ and stickin’ the prices
Uppin’ the ante before I'm a antique, can promise you hear me clear
Even if you eat 3 ears with Tyson
Rippin’ the panties but bootin’ the wammys
They dyke and I’m liking them all, I’m siftin’ through panties
Haters’ll spike it
Voicing opinions but holding laryngitis
But I don’t hear ‘em, I’m a winner by law
Track em down like the subway when they sub-par
Sub-zero everytime I jump in the synagogues
Send the angels, send the God
I can make you look hard, I know
I just let the thoughts take its toll
More sentences than level four of y’all, Bogard
Go hard, black tar, concrete, Tom Vick times Papi Mason times 3
Uncle Toms need Tums to stomach atomic bombs
Or die from my Wizardry
RZA, GZA, Method Man
I’m a killer B, killer! Be killed, make your embassy yield
This is not your cup of tea, and oh
They say waters run deep, dive in, Bermuda triangles
And you will see us, we must leave dust behind
Emcee’s duck, deduct, revenue declined
When we touch down like a Running Back’s grind
Can you keep up and keep us safe for keepsake
That ain't safe
Compton!

One more time I've got to say
Oh little, little darling, please don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

[Introduction]

[Verse 1]
Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park
"Do you ever get the feeling that you’re missing the mark?"
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold
Written up in marker on a factory sign:
"I struggle with the feeling that my life isn’t mine"
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold
See the arrow they shot trying to tear us apart
Took the fire from my belly and the beat from my heart
Still, I won’t let go
Still, I won’t let go
Of you
'Cause you do

[Hook]
Oh, you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

[Verse 2]
On every street, every car, every surface, a name
Tonight, the streets are ours
And we’re writing and saying
"Don’t let 'em take control"
No, we won’t let 'em take control
Yes, I feel a little bit nervous
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax
How come they’re out to get us?
How come they’re out when they don’t know the facts?
So on a concrete canvas under cover of dark
On a concrete canvas, I’ll go making my mark
Armed with a spray can soul
I’ll be armed with a spray can soul
And you
Oh, you

[Hook]
'Cause you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Yeah, it's true
When you use your heart as a weapon
Then it hurts like heaven
Oh, it hurts like heaven

[Hook]
Purp, purp, purp, purp
Yea you know I got that purp
OG kush and girl scout cookies
Cherry pie, no not dessert

What up Wale

[Verse 1]
Smoking on the finest, got a crib look like a palace
And I’m still prince of the city, so approach me as your highness
Tattoos on my body, in my joint I got exotic
And don’t question all the niggas I got posted up behind me, that’s that
Gang, gang, gang, gang, yea you know I rep that gang
Diamonds in my watch and I got Cuban Linx up in my chain
Ok I’m balling like a hooping game
Should go on you lames but I got songs to do with Snoop today
Money getting stupid, I’m still rolling weed on my ipad
And these niggas mad that I’m doing good and they fucked up so that’s my bad
I love champagne so 30 thousand that’s my tag
Out in Vegas nigga roll some weed when you play this

[Bridge]
I got weight, weight, weight, weight
Weight, weight, weight, weight, weight

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
She said her name was Lisa Marie
And she was a beast
Woman so bad, it's illegal to speak
She say she like me and she was eager to meet
And I was just as eager as eager as she
Body so sick you can eat off her feet
Go to the hospital, die in a week
She say she was a model, well obviously
'Cause I can sure picture her between my sheets
Baby was a flower with rose pedal cheeks
And every time she talk it's like a gold medal speech
Intelligent, she should teach
And if so
I will be a nerd like screech

[Pre-Chorus]
I told her I would write a rhyme about her and it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track, she said, "That's deep"
I worked on it all night didn't get no sleep
Now here is my song and this is the beat

[Chorus]
This is the beat, this is, this is the beat
And here is my song about Lisa Marie
She- she- she said her name was Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie

[Verse 2]
She said her name was Lisa Marie and she was discreet
Her picture's in the dictionary next to elite
I told her we can get away we can retreat
Cut off my arms put 'em on her seat
Cut off my legs put 'em on her head
So I could run through her mind like she does mine
And every time she smile it make me feel like a child
In the supermarket on the candy aisle
I saw a picture of her with her panties down
I fall asleep and dream, I'm a camera now
I would love to be the water in her shower
Or one of her bath towels

[Pre-Chorus]
I told her I would write a rhyme about her and it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track, she said, "That's deep"
I worked on it all night didn't get no sleep
Now here is my song and this is the beat

[Chorus]
This is the beat, this is, this is the beat
And here is my song about Lisa Marie
She- she- she said her name was Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie

[Verse 3]
She said her name was Lisa Marie and she was a piece
A piece of fine art like a piece of the leak
She was unique, exquisite
Like x y z, she was complete
And I think she like butterflies
Because she got one on her upper thigh
And her face is like summertime
Birthday the same month as mine with a different sign
Virgo, I go wherever her go
If she say so I'm on her like a fur coat
In November, she colder than December
She got me fallin' like timber

[Pre-Chorus]
I told her I would write a rhyme about her and it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track, she said, "That's deep"
I worked on it all night didn't get no sleep
Now here is my song and this is the beat

[Chorus]
This is the beat, this is, this is the beat
And here is my song about Lisa Marie
She- she- she said her name was Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie

[Verse 1]
Sitting next to your coffee table while
I'm tryna fix your cable box, again
Said you couldn't get channel four
And that's the only one you wanted to watch

[Pre-Hook]
Last week I was walking your dog, baby
Scrubbing your dishes
Took your clothes to the cleaners
I don't mind, cause

[Chorus]
When I'm done
When I'm done
I'm gon' get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)
When I'm done (You gon' get it)
You gon' feel every little bit of my love

[Verse 2]
Spent all day in my kitchen slaying
You didn’t even know that I could cook, oh
But you say you’re tired and you're ready to go home
Girl, you didn’t even touch your food, no

[Pre-Hook]
Last week I was washing your towels
Scrubbing your dishes
Took your clothes to the cleaners
I don't mind, cause

[Chorus]
When I'm done
When I'm done
I'm gon' get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)
When I'm done (You gon' get it)
You gon' feel every little bit of my love
When I'm done
When I'm done
I'm gon' get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)
When I'm done (You gon' get it)
You gon' feel every little bit of my love

[Bridge]
Well, gimme some more, baby
Gimme some more
It's never enough, baby
You gotta let me know
You need somethin', tell me somethin', gather somethin' to hold
Baby, I'll do it
Huh, 'cause

[Chorus]
When I'm done (When I'm done)
When I'm done (When I'm done)
I'm gon' get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gon' get it)
When I'm done (Whoa, you gon' get it)
You gon' feel every little bit of my love
When I'm done
When I'm done
I'm gon' get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)
When I'm done (You gon' get it)
You gon' feel every little bit of my love

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Look, I make my own decisions, learn from my own mistakes
My enemies they want beef but don’t know what’s at stake
I started out with nothing, just a dream and some hope
I fiend for riches like them crackheads fiend for the dope
I went from freeze tag to holding some weed bags
To a clown of hoes juggling my bean bags
I went from spin the bottle to kiss the model
Take 3 more seconds we gon’ find out if she spits or swallows
I heard it’s a recession, while you hardly survive
The hardest decision of my day is which car I’mma drive
Rolls Royce Phantom, maybe the gold Ac'
Or the origami Ferrari the way it fold back
This ain’t no 760, bitch this a Alpina
Custom kits, chrome lips as deep as vagina
And women lost for words, guess they don’t know English
No matter what language they speak, they all know dinglish

[Hook: Ludacris] x2
Don’t you understand with this blunt in my hand (I’m on fire)
Smoke, smoke, smoke sum’n
Don’t you understand with the world in my hand if I hate the shit
(How am I to know)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Now as the world turns, spinning on its axis
My dick be brushing women’s lips like chapstick
They say it’s cold outside
So like a dentist, I’m just trying to keep they mouth wide
Reminiscing on my days on the south side
I made Nene leak and I ain’t talking ‘bout no housewives
From eating canned tuna to shoe deals with Puma
From women saying “Hey Chris” to “Goddamn Luda!”
From playing slap box to making the ‘Lac drop
To white neighbors all swear I’m slanging crack rock
Eyes so low, they think I’m Asian when I’m blazing
Cuz that purple’s on my chest like I’m playing for the Ravens
Cadillac Deville still rolling ‘til the tires flat
Not from Arizona but I swear I want that diamond back
Sunroof top, wood grain wheel
I signed for millions, y’all will never get the same deal

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
I got a candy coated fetish, ho don’t you forget
Well bi-bi-bi-bi let me wet it
It’s that K-R-I-T stay beside me, we can go get this dough
That mean you mine if you show me you down, I promise I won’t let you go
I got a old school and that bass beat, if it ain’t on chrome then it ain’t me
Have my mouth piece colder than the A/C
So call me father winter in the peak of summer, I spit December
Breaking backs til they crack and limber, If that’s yo bitch she can’t remember
I give her wood, she holler timber
In the paint, I play the center – of attention
Take the vision of a player with (?) intentions to be richer, well I hate you missed it
Back again, one more time for them fuck niggas and them thoroughbred that won’t fuck with him
And hang on cuz I stuck with them
I ain’t got time to waste ho, didn’t have shit now I make more than I can barely count
Keep a thoroughbred shaking what the good Lord gave her, yo chick ass barely bouncing
We still live from the underground, ain’t nothing change to me
I put it down for the south and embody everything that these lame niggas claim to be
Young Krizzle!

[Hook] x2

[Intro: Scarface]
I sit alone in my four-cornered room
Starin' at candles
Oh, that shit is on?

Yeah, Aye, Aye-o At Night I Can't Sleep,I Toss And Turn
I Get Lost For Words,Its Like I Lost My Nerves
It All Started With My Chick About A Bitch That I Hit
That I Swear Ain't Shit,But She Swear I Ain't Shit
Awww Man Lord Help Her She Can't See What Im Sayin
'Or Hear What I Tell Her
It Feel Like Im Talking To Helen, Keller
I Wish That She Could Understand Me,Like A Shelter
I Called Her Up And Said Im Tired Of Beefin'
Told Her Im Leavin' And That Shes Not Needed
She Said Oh So You Just Done With Us, I Love You Doe
Yeah Well That Makes One Of Us And Hung Up
I Got Tired Of My Living Room Decor
Then Headed To The Liqour Store To Get Liqour
Swishor And A Stickor,And Then Pull A Lift Off
Til I Buzz Like Clipors And Pose Like A Clip Board
I Then Go Somewhere I Had No Business
Er'body Hands Up So It Wasn't The Question
I Started To Dippin' , It Take A Man With A Wooden Cane In The Air
To Reconize A Stick Up
Hell Yeah The Niggas Tried To Hit Me
But Off A Whole Round Swear To God They Just Missed Me
Then The Police Sirens were Roarin
They Took What They Saw Then Went Out The Back Door
Shit I Hoped Off The Floor Tryna See Which Way They Went
Mad Than A Motherfuckin' Bitch
Walked Back In To Make Sure Er'thang Was Cool
Looked On The Floor Saw Blood By The Pool
So I Asked The Clerk Dude Whats The Trouble
No Response but His Face Seemed Puzzled
I Walked Towards The Huddle To The Front Of The Crowd
And Thats When I Saw Myself Strecthed Out
See It Wasn't Til I Say My Own Body
That I Realized Them Pussy Ni***s Shot Me
Man I Couldn't Even Tell My Bitch I Love Her
Man I Couldn't Even Kiss My Mother
Ain't That Some Shit Homie?
My Mind Is Playin' Tricks On Me
Yeah, yeah
I know you feeling the sound
Yeah eh eh eh

In L.A we be rolling that shit
Crusing the sunset strip looking for chicks
Most girls you see be looking good
But they attitude is so Hollywood
I can like a nigga, gotta impress ya’ll
Bitch I seen you, uh you live on crenshaw
Girl You so fine, push your standards aside
You can jump in my ride and I’ll show you a good time
I know a club around the way that be poppin’ fo sho
So gather up your girlfriends cause we all fitin ta roll
There’s more booties than seats so just sit on my lap
And the rest of ya’ll ladies, ya’ll can fit in the back
Rollin up with the car packed, a wee booty and booze
In the club my nigga red foo’s are the ones and twos
Feelin like the man of the hour to the flow we cruise
It’s hard to dance baby
Why?
Cause I’m watching you, so just
(Chorus)
Get on down, get on down girl
Get on down, I know you feelin’ the sound (x3)

Get on down (x5)

Now who got the kush, and who got the swisha nigga
Roll it up, come on roll it up quicka
I gotta puff puff pass, puff puff pass
A girl just walked passed with a nice round ass
So excuse me I gotta go fuck up the rotation I know
But when I see a booty like that my other heads in control
On the dance floor again, she droppin it low again
Booty so big it look like two obese salsa twins
Oh my god, is this a fucked song
You lookin so good, got a nigga in awe
Baby baby please come back home with me
She drop it low, turned around then she agreed
“I know you ain’t thinking that I’m getting on my knees”
What! Girl you know you better

Get on down, get on down girl
Get on down, I know you feeling the sound (x3)

Get on down (x3)

[Intro: Childish Gambino]
We do it
We do it
We do it
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Kill ‘em
That’s what I hear when I get a hot feel
In my nostrils
In my forehead
As I code red
You’d be more dead
Than a horse head
In a four bedroom apartment
Bloggers that’ll start shit
You wanna criticize me
Just so you can drink green tea
With Lykke Li at a speakeasy?
Wearin’ some American Apparel
While you’re starin’ at a Tim and Eric DVD, uh
Can’t get enough
Crime Mob Shit, knuck if you buck
Celibate girls do stuff in the butt
Get it out with a Q-tip or some Müeslix
I’m a eunuch just ‘cause I can’t give a fuck
Kiss her on the neck while she’s buttonin’ up
Uh and my pants down
It’s funny how when I put Camp out
They gotta camp out
Better than half of all rap that you have on your laptop
At your dad’s house, hands down
Fake niggas say “you the man now”
Got a DJ like Roseanne’s house
Sam go hard like a handjob, nigga
Yeah, Childish don’t go hard, what
Now everybody wanna fuck with me, slut
The flow is too sick
Got them white boy clothes and that black dude dick, uh
Now I understand why you gotta hate a nigga
East side, Stone Mountain-Decatur, nigga
Y’all niggas lame, I’m fly as hell
‘Cause I’m fuckin’ lame, and I don’t even care
(Verse 1)
Walk up on this bitch with a hundred grand
Two rollies on my arm, another hundred grand
Bitch, let the money burn, nigga no tan
Got a young bitch, fucking doing what she can she can!
Pop killa King Kong killa’
T-Raw the real deal thrilla in Manila
Make a bitch pop (pop)
Pills ’till it’s dinna’
She a fucking nympho, that’s why I fuck with her
Whistle while you twerk pussy singers all up in the club throwing up middle fingers
If you try snitch turn a bitch to a hanger
Lay your shit out, now you’re planking, you’re planking
I’m saying!

(Hook)
One two and the bitch came
Break a bitch heart pouring out the champagne
Why you over there chilling with the little lames?
You ain't know, you ain't know that my shit bang?
Pop it bitch
Pop pop pop
Pop it bitch
Pop pop pop
Pop it bitch
Pop pop pop
Pop it bitch
One two and the bitch came
Pop it bitch
Pop pop pop
Pop it bitch
Pop pop pop
Pop it bitch
Pop pop pop
Pop it bitch
All these hoes know my damn name
(Verse 2)
She don’t give brain, that’s a damn shame
I don’t find the shit funny like soul plane
Put ice on my wrist like the shit sprained
I’m just riding around getting it...two chains
Last King, Y.M.C.M gang
Everything dope bitch where the Novocain
Bitchs saying I’m the bomb, oh man
Blow the pussy up, heir to the sex game!
Roll 8, make them bitches bend they back for laxed she gonna spaz
Make a scene like she act
Act stupid take a cab, oh you broke, oh your bad?
I don’t cuff hoes they just follow my command
I’m saying

(hook)

Lift that ass up, up
And bring that ass down, down
Bring that ass up, up
Shake that ass to the ground

(Hook)
On the battlefield I am the commander in
The war between the worlds, time to wheel the cannons in
I’m out here salamandering
They out here slandering
Try to smear a niggas image, damn who’s the camera man?
Where’s the man to man talk
What a fuck? Get up off the nipple, man
Let your momma have a mammogram
Busting like Sammy Sam
Niggas can’t even see me on the beat
Like a blind pianist at a band exam
But fuck a punch line, fuck a metaphor
Fuck the niggas who said that they wasn’t feeling me before
Life is like a movie, I just write the score
Let me dumb it down, maybe you can understand me more!
I got no time for this shock jock, get up above my cock
Put the mic down, you’re looking sixty four!
I’m guessing I’m the nigga that they love to hate
But they still watch a nigga, and they pay attention more!
Closer to my words, and closer you observe
Trying to decipher the flow you niggas know this shit is absurd!
You notice every verb and adjective and every syllable
And why compare to me, there is nobody who’s identical
Instrumental general, Grand Hustle emerald
I’m ballin’ over here, give a fuck about your interviews
Niggas talk, hoes too, but they know I’m one of the coldest overall and general
The more I ball the more the haters run
When you fuck the game, the problems gonna come
Back down never, I’m never known to run
Fuck life and get high, that’s what I call overcoming obstacles
Get up off my tosticles, I got this under control
I’m callin’ audibles, I know what I gotta do
When you travel on this road, man after a while
Nobody’s on the either side of you
Reaching out the other artists for a wider view
In reality artists just don’t have the time for you
It is what it is, I don’t take it personal
But it’s a jungle out, and lions don’t eat vegetables
I mean veggies, I’m all about my
I don’t smoke bap and I’m never on the reggie
I’m going full speed, but I don’t know where I’m heading
So keep up off my yard and never touch my hedges
I’m on the edge, you should never cross the line
Niggas feel safe when they’re online
But I’m out here touring, they out here keyboarding
I’m bout to show ya'll what the fuck a high score is
So let me do this for east side bitch
Decatuer GA, camera rolls on six!
Call it what you want, but real recognize real
So to us, niggas don’t even exist!
Ah, Grand Hustle, yeah it’s B.o.B
Said free T.I.P, now the nigga back
So now we gonna see what’s up and what’s good
Bobby Ray coming to your neighborhood!
Strange Clouds, dropping soon
Yeah that’s what’s up, good news

[Verse 1]
Get on your dancing shoes
There's one thing on your mind
Hoping they're looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through
Oh and the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Yeah, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting and

[Chorus]
The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
Well, don't you always do the same?
It's what you're there for, don't you know?

[Verse 2]
The lights are flashing
Down in here tonight
And some might exchange a glance
But keep pretending to dance
Don't act like it's not happening
As if it's impolite
To go and mention your name
Instead you'll just do the same as they all do
And hope for the best

[Chorus]
The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
Well, don't you always do the same?
It's what you’re there for, but no

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Get on your dancing shoes
You sexy little swine
Hoping they're looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through
I said, the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride, yeah
Yeah, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting
Uh, nigga I smoke good everyday
I probably live the life that you wish you could everyday
You probably think I had it good had it made
But nigga im from the 'Burgh I was in the hood everyday

But now im hoppin' off of jets
And these people cuttin' me checks
And I say people cuz im richer
Rich people show me respect
This come from Atrium, he's from collect
These diamonds I got on, they are Baguettes
Or VVS so all of them see me
Used to just be that dude on the net now im all in your tv
Butler asked me what I want to get Bentley or Lamborghini
Just came home and made 200 grand blew it all in Waikiki
Just came home and made 200 grand blew it all with Luigi
Smokin all 8 ounces to myself ain't that often that sleepy
Realest nigga out, it ain't hard to believe me
Thats why all the people that you know try they hardest to be me

Cuz nigga I smoke good everyday
I probably live the life that you wish you could everyday
You probably think I had it good got it made
But nigga im from the 'Burgh now roll up that herb

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Ok, ok, ok
Kyuhh
C'mon, c'mon
Uh-huh, listen

Ye' ain't say nothing lil' mama I got those
And I'm about to bl-blow like snot nose
(Whuh!) Oh no, no homo (Ugh!)
This is for my niggas, my niggas that don't know (C'mon!)
Please tell these rap bitches to get ready (Ugh!)
Don't get gassed unless you're getting getty
Don't get jerk j-jerk don't get nutty
Fix up your paperwork, you're somebody
But! You ain't better than the President (No!)
I'm just too eloquent, bitch, I'm the President!
I be sitting on a elephant, huhuhuh
Counting all my money where Stella went, hahaha
And I don't need my groove back (Oh)
Unless the nigga looking like 2Pac (Oh)
Unless he got colors like Toucan...
Sam (Uh-huh), Sam I am! (Whuh!)
Different color Lambs, Green Eggs and Ham (Okay)
Bet I could bake a gram like the baker's man (Okay)
Stop running up on me like who? what? when?
I stay around the white like the Ku Klux Klan (Okay)
I stay around the sand, butter-pecan tan (Look, haha)
Butter-pecan tan (Kyuhh)
I stay around the sand, butter-pecan tan, nigga

[Bridge]
Damn
Look, I'm a bad bitch
I'mma give y'all a couple more bars, it's nothing
Listen.... (Kyuh!)

[Verse 2]
I was shotgun when the Bentley cruised up (Word)
I'm a bad bitch let me put my shoes up (Okay)
I don't say hi, I just throw my 2's up (What up)
When I'm in Texas I chuck my deuce up
Bitches is snakes, sorta like Medusa (Ahh!)
I get on the beats like a new producer
(I hate Nicki Minaj!) Just excuse her
I'm in a GT, she in a PT Cruiser (Hahahaha)
I mean the PT bruiser
Dang, lil mama, you is such a loser (Okay)
Okay, you is such a loser
Dang lil mama you is such a loser, huhuhu

[Outro]
I mean... If I'm not the baddest bitch who the fuck is?
I mean when I do it's done
Y'know! Get who you want..
Like, I'mma body every last bitch in the game
I'mma sit on my throne and
And, you know these bitches, you know be
Picking my fruit out
I want some fresh strawberries and shit
Tell them bitches to be ready to pick my fruit out
I'm a be sittin on the throne
Like Michael Jackson and Eddie Murphy, it's nothing
Y-Y'dig? Hahahahaha

[Verse 1: Drake]
Don’t it seem like
Like I’m always there when it matters
But missing most of the other time
A terrible pattern
The rewards I see from working
Made me an addict
There's way more people that want it
Than people that have it
I don't get it, I would hate to think I tricked ‘em
They fall victim to my system
Guess I sure know how to pick em
And I’m always her regret
Yeah, I’m always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever’s coming next
It goes up and down, it’s just up and down
She’s crying now but she’ll laugh again
Cause we on the rise and she here with us
And expensive shit, just keeps happening
She loves it, she stares at me like who does this
And we hold hands while I pray that she’s not the type to hold grudges
I’m wrong..

[Verse 2: Mary J Blige]
Bad boys ain't no good
Good boys ain't no fun
Lord knows that I should
Run off with the right one

[Chorus: Mary J Blige]
Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (So good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (So bad)
We got a special thing going on
Me and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up cause his loves like that
Ain't no way that I’m moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

[Verse 3: Mary J Blige]
Hung up off your good
You call and I run
My fam' is screaming at me don’t do it
"Don't do it, Mary!"
I guess they never had none

[Chorus: Mary J Blige]
Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (So good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (So bad)
We got a special thing going on (Going on)
Me and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up cause his loves like that
Ain't no way that I’m moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

[Bridge: Mary J Blige]
When he put that loving on me, I can’t think of nothing
That’ll make me walk out
I’m holding on

He be kissing and touching on me
I can’t help but love him
I must be out my mind
For going so strong
I love my Mr. Wrong
Mr. Wrong

[Chorus: Mary J Blige]
Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (So good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (So bad)
We got a special thing going on(Going on)
Me and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)
Even if I try, no, I never could (I never could)
Give him up cause his loves like that
Ain't no way that I’m moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
Mr. Wrong

[Verse]
Check me out, look
It goes love, hate, pleasure and pain
Four albums in the can and I'm still in the game (what up?)
And last album, they don't like me to tell this
Debuted at #1 and sold more records than Elvis (shut up!)
That's what they tellin me, switch up your melody
Through with misdemeanors, they tryin to give rappers felonies
So they can lock us up one at a time
But true writers stay free in every one of our lines
And if you not feelin I'm the cream of the crop
I'll knock rappers off your list 'til I get to the top!
Still you lookin at a man that's financially stable
Only nigga gettin checks cut from four different labels
That Pillsbury dough, women poke my guts
Still I walk around the streets like I'm broke as fuck
So if you see me in your town and I appear to be moody
It's cause I'm thinkin 'bout plans that's bigger than Serena booty
Me and Chaka still starvin and lookin for meals
And heads up! Ludacris is almost out of his deal
I'm over ten million sold, every album is crack
And for now I'm bout to carry Def Jam on my back
Mad rappers I hear you talkin way down at the bottom
Though I make big money, still handle small problems
The ramblin at the mouth, I don't play that shit
I'm the best and I ain't really gotta say that shit

[Intro: Jadakiss]
Ay yo yo yo, ay yo WHAT!
Motherfucking you know who it is, ya mean? Ya boy, the motherfuckin' everything
I'm everything (hahahahaaa)
But we neither here nor there this is for ma motherfuckin' biatch!
Nicki Minaj, Sucka Free, I love you baby, you know I'm lookin for you, you be dodging me, ya mean, you be in Miami layin' songs and all dat but uhm it's all good
Ya'll Niggas make sure ya'll ch-check this shit out right here, Sucka Free, Nicki Minaj
Spittin' that shit for y'all niggas and bitches, ya dig?
Stop hidding from me too, Sucka Free, Muthafucka WHAT!

[Talking: Nicki Minaj]
Remix
Ayo Kiss
Look, I mean you know my aka "sit on your favorite rapper face" and shit, you know like, I mean you know
The question today is who's my favorite rapper like everybody wanna know, naw mean?
Hahaha, guess what? You're my favorite rapper

[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
Listen, I'ma spit on it then I'm gon' sit on it
You could fuck my girls too, daddy I'ma condone it
I'ma put my lips on ya lips, who's fatter?
Nigga, you could ask Michael Jack who's badder
You can lick it from the front and you can lick it from the back
When I jiggle my ass you can do your little laugh (hahaha)
You so funny Kiss, I wanted to fuck you since you worked with that yummy bitch
Anyway, I got a tight little honey dip
That's why these niggas get tight when honey dip
Niggas know my pussy taste like mango tango
So they put a couple karats in my ankle bangles
When my legs go back you can hear them jangle
Once you pop you can't stop like a can of Pringles
Let me grab the mic while I spit ya song, six seconds Jadakiss your on...
Uh-uh on, uh-uh-uh on
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh on

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
I represent Queens, he was raised down in Yonkers
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
I represent Queens, he was raised down in Yonkers

[Verse 1]
I used to dream every night, now I never dream at all
I'm hopin' that it's cause I'm livin' everything I want
I used to wake up in a bed between my mom and aunt
Playing with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut
My dad works nights, putting on a stone face
He's saving up so we can get our own place
In the projects, man that sounds fancy to me
They called me "fat nose," my mom say, "You handsome to me"
Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced
But he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants
And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out
They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about
Cause hood shit and black shit is super different
So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition
Mom and dad wouldn't listen
They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that
All their friends in NY deal crack
It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em
But when you leave the hood
They think that you look down on 'em
The truth is we still struggle on a different plane
7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same
Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit
But all they get now is, "Can your son read this script?"

[Hook]
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Dad lost his job, mama worked at Mrs. Winner's
Gun pulled in her face, she still made dinner
“Donald, watch the meter so they don’t turn the lights off"
Workin' two jobs so I can get into that white school
And I hate it there
They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair
And my uncle on that stuff that got my grandma shook
Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book
He’s supposed to pay ‘em back
He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero
So my mama made us sleep with Phillips heads
Under the pillow, like that would do somethin'
But she’s got six kids, she’s gotta do somethin'
She don’t want me in a lifestyle like my cousin
And he mad cause his father ain’t around
He lookin' at me now, like
"Why you so fuckin' lucky? I had a father too
But he ain’t around, so I'ma take it out on you"
We used to say "I love you," now we only think that shit
It feels weird that you’re the person I took sink baths with
Street took you over, I want my cousin back
The world sayin' what you are
Because you’re young and black, don't believe 'em
You're still that kid who kept the older boys
From teasin', for some reason

[Hook]
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows

[Outro]
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Oh, help us Lord
Oh, I'm screamin' baby, baby

Dynamite, the coke albino white (Ch-yea)

Chicken noodle bitches, on the side with a soda (Woo!)

[Chorus: Childish Gambino & Janet Leon]
Now when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And when they hear us on the beat
All they wanna do is make hits
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And if you're feelin' how I'm feelin'
How the world should be: perfectly
Fire like I’m third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so high
Firefly

[Verse 1]
Skateboardin' down at Washington Square
Lookin' for quarters
Maybe afford a falafel for dinner, uh
I’m so broke man, scholarship apologin'
Facebook messages from college kids who hollerin'
Girls like, "We love you, we go to LSU,"
"You gotta do a show so we can come and molest you!"
This rap stuff is magic
I used to get called "Oreo" and "faggot"
I used to get more laughs when I got laughed at
"Oh, you got a mixtape? That's fantastic!"
But everybody thought it was jokes though
They half right, the joke is
I got flow so don't act like
You ain't sittin' there with your friends like, it can't be
I know Donald Glover, he weak man, he campy
I'm still knocked down, but I up the ante
Me and hip-hop, that black Sid and Nancy, let 'em know

[Chorus: Childish Gambino & Janet Leon]
Now when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And when they hear us on the beat
All they wanna do is make hits
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And if you're feelin' how I'm feelin'
How the world should be: perfectly
Fire like I’m third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so high
Firefly

[Verse 2]
It's hard to make Hov the footsteps you followin'
Especially when your niggas look like Carlton
The pretty girls usin' skin so soft
Only be likin' black dudes with their hats broke off
Nigga, you act too soft
Fuck you! I'm from the projects
My mom was just workin' to give me options
No live shows, cause I can't find sponsors
For the only black kid at a Sufjan concert
"Yeah, so, whatcha gonna do man?
You don't speak to the hood, man"
If I was given one chance I think I could, man
These black kids want somethin' new, I swear it
Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't cause they embarrassed
All I do is make the stuff I would've liked
Reference things I wanna watch, reference girls I wanna bite
Now I'm firefly like a burning kite
And you's a fake fuck like a fleshlight
Even dudes who like me straight lookin' at me crazy
Like, how the hell he drop a EP and meet JAY-Z?
Girls used to tell me I ain't cool enough
Now text me pics sayin', "You could tear this up!"
I don't really like shades, big rims, or jewelry
But gettin' time of day from a model is new to me
Bein' me isn't as hard as it used to be
Now everyone sing the chorus man, you do it so beautifully

[Chorus: Childish Gambino & Janet Leon]
Now when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And when they hear us on the beat
All they wanna do is make hits
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And if you're feelin' how I'm feelin'
How the world should be: perfectly
Fire like I’m third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so high
Firefly
Now when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And when they hear us on the beat

And if you're feelin' how I'm feelin'
How the world should be: perfectly
Fire like I’m third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so high

[Chorus]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 1]
I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff type
He go and make breakfast
You walkin' round naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over
When it's all over, no settlin' down
My text go to your screen, you know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sittin' at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinkin' that this song's comin' on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start callin'; you start crying
I come over; I'm inside you
I can't find you, the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
Text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'ma flirt with this new girl
And I'ma call if it don't work
So we fuck 'til it come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we were losin'
I'm a ghost, and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place, 'cause

[Chorus]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 2]
It's late-night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Hmm, well, two can play that game
So I'm chillin' with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing, and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want somethin' from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one-hunnid
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
'Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' 'em if she'd wanna play games
We the Super Smash Brothers, but none of 'em you
I miss the sex where you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the art of choking's
Only thing girls want when you in that smoke and light

[Chorus]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 3]
So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his posts on your wall, and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm goin' straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you ate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J. and Keyshia are related: racist
I give you money; then you burn me (Bernie), then you made off (Madoff)
She ain't a killer, but she'd fuckin' blow your head off
I know he wonderin', "What the fuck you hidin'?"
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden; ayo, fuck this
Are we datin'? Are we fuckin'?
Are we best friends? Are we somethin'
In between that?
I wish we never fucked, and I mean that

[Outro]
But not really
You say the nastiest shit in bed, and it’s fuckin’ awesome

[Verse 1]
Alright it's Childish baby, Mr. Talk-About-His-Dick-Again
Nerdy-ass black kid, whatever, man, I'm sick of him
That well-spoken token, who ain't been heard
The only white rapper who's allowed to say the N-word
I buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card
Now I got some street cred, use it 'til it's maxed out
I got a girl on my arm, dude, show respect
Something crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech
She too fine, I do dimes
If not that, I'm walking out with two fives
Change my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet
Black male in short shorts, I'm double suspect
Ballin' since '83, half of 'em say he gay
Maybe that's the reason I like Lady What-babies-say
I'm a problem, I'm lame as fuck homie
But I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me
Fuck the cool kids, not Chuck Inglish
But people who think that hatin on me makes them distinguished
Like, "What is this nigga doin? Rap is for real blacks
I hate that fucking faggot, man, he think that we feel that"
Or "I wrote on rape culture my junior year at Brown
So I'm allowed to say what all his raps are about"
You better shut your mouth before I fuck it
You really hate my lyrics now or Kid Cudi's? Nigga

[Hook]
Runnin this thang, money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name?
In the woods, got these niggas usin' Mapquest
Man, fuck a backpacker

[Verse 2]
Niggas with OCD, N-W-O
All white like my clothes, CW shows
Nigga got signed, it's an anomaly
No cosign: trigonometry
Man these niggas hate me
"Man, fuck you nigga...fuck you nigga!"
They real black like won't show up on your camera phone
They real black like turn the flash on your camera on
They real black take shit, turn it into gold
I'm real black I survive when the pressure on
Upper echelon, bit my lip when I'm kissin' her
Clash of the Titans, baby your tits is titular
Listenin to some Kiss FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj
"Super Bass," super face inside a garage
It's not a massage, spa rap with a happy ending
Old niggas wanna assassinate me
It's a shame, these kids was supposed to save rap
Fuck that, boat shoes and a wave cap
He don't give back, how the fuck a nigga say that?
Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach
Comin' on that payback, comin' on that mace took
I'm comin' on that real shit, I'm comin' on her Facebook
Fuck a backpacker with a rhino's dick
I do me like a gyno chick, uh

[Hook]
Runnin this thang, money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name?
In the woods, got these niggas usin' Mapquest
Man, fuck these backpackers
Fuck these backpackers
Fuck these backpackers
Fuck these backpackers

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep, keep it going, going, going, going!

[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]
I got a little bit trashed last night, night
I got a little bit wasted, yeah yeah
I got a little bit mashed last night, night
I got a little shit faceted, yeah yeah (well)
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm on the roof
If you don't know
Well now you know

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going, come on!

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Drink up 'cause a party ain't a party 'til you ride out through it
End up on the floor but can't remember, you clueless
Officer like what the hell is you doing?
Stumbling, fumbling, you wanna what? Come again
Give me Henn, give me gin, give me liquor
Give me champagne bubbles 'til I'm bent
What happens after that? If you inspired then tell a friend
Like oh my homie Taio, we can all sip again
Get it in and again and again, leave evidence
Wasted, so what? Irrelevant
Beer keg to the head, who's selling it
I got a hangover, that's my medicine
Don't mean to brag or sound too intelligent
A little Jack can't hurt this veteran
I show up but I never throw up
So let the drinks pour up, pour up

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going, come on!

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going, come on!

[Chorus]
Oh, I want it, yeah
Whenever you need my hand
I'll hold you down, oh
Oh, you want it, yeah
Why in the fuck these niggas
Tryin' to hold me down, oh
Yeah, uh
Why in the fuck these niggas
Try and hold me down, ohh

[Verse 1]
"You such a fuckin' lame!"
It's what they used to yell back in seventh grade
My mama said she'd get me that new jacket when the cost go down
Hit the office, stole some Tommy Hill from lost and found
Not bad for a family of foster child
Lookin' fly man, I'm flossin' now
But them niggas saw through me
"Are you serious? What is this?"
Took the jacket off third period, ellipsis
Listening to "Sky Is the Limit" on my Walkman
Thinking if Biggie can make it through it, man then I can
Dope-boy swag, I always wanted that
But my persona was always more of that Arthur Ashe
But no love for the son of a commuter who was a radio head
And okay at them computers at the post office
It's funny how you smoke niggas then you start coffins
All my people need throat lozenge
My fear is dead, ambition drove the hearse
But niggas got me feelin' I ain't black enough to go to church
Culture shock at barber shops cause I ain't hood enough
We all look the same to the cops, ain't that good enough?
The black experience is black and serious
Cause being black, my experience, is no one hearin' us
White kids get to wear whatever hat they want
When it comes to black kids one size fits all

[Chorus]
Oh, I want it, yeah
Whenever you need my hand
I'll hold you down, oh
Oh, you want it, yeah
Why in the fuck these niggas
Tryin' to hold me down, oh

[Break]
We the baddest nigga
We the baddest nigga, yeah
We the baddest nigga, we the baddest nigga, uh
We the baddest nigga, we the baddest nigga, uh
We the baddest nigga, uh, we the baddest nigga

[Verse 2]
The reason that they say I'm nothin' what they seen or heard's
The same reason Will Smith always opposite Latino girls
They only see you how they wanna see you
'Til you make them see you in some other way
I'm trippin' off the other day
'Cause God knows what these white kids sayin' dude
You're not not racist 'cause The Wire's in your Netflix queue
Subtle racism, it's hard to pin it
'Cause you'd only understand if you were me for just a minute
This one kid said somethin' that was really bad
He said I wasn't really black because I had a dad
I think that's kinda sad
Mostly 'cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that
If you're a father, you should stick around if you could
'Cause even if you're bad at it, you could Tiger Woods or MJ
We warriors, we all need senseis
Change everything that we've done so far
I don't mean makin' B.E.T. T.E.R
I mean just the way that we see each other
I won't stop until they say:
"James Franco is the white Donald Glover"
Yeah, these niggas wanted Cookie, but instead I gave 'em Loch Ness
Sick Boi for life, my swag is in a hospice
Aimin' for the throne, Jay and Ye said to watch that
They ask me what I'm doin', and I said I'm stealin' rock back
Nigga

[Chorus]
Oh, I want it, yeah
Whenever you need my hand
I'll hold you down, oh
Oh, you want it, yeah
Why in the fuck these niggas
Tryin' to hold me down, oh
Oh, I want it, yeah
Whenever you need my hand
I'll hold you down, oh
Oh, you want it, yeah
Why in the fuck these niggas
Tryin' to hold me down, oh

[Chorus]
If we were kids, I'd want to give
You everything that you would want
Those other boys, they give you toys
But all they wanna do is
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up

[Verse 1]
I guess I'm fuckin' now, I'm gettin' used to it
It's 'cause I shine and I ain't gotta use a crucifix
Fuck the fussin' and fightin' and arguin' to this and that
And, "Why you being mean to me, Donald?"
I never text her back
I know it's comin' quick, wishin' I could fast forward
Tell these nice girls they're the reason that I'm an asshole
Omega to alpha male, because of that dollar bill
When I worked the mail room, I ain't have a shot in hell
I called her ass for two months, ain't heard shit from her
These girls couldn't care less when ya chips under
The chips are up and on my shoulder, you heard me?
I take it out on girls who don't even deserve it
The girls I tried to hit last year, I still might
Karma's a bitch who doesn't suck, but I still like
If we were kids, I'd have the black K-swiss and Reebok
If we were kids, I wouldn't act like this, but we not

[Chorus]
If we were kids, I'd wanna give you everything
That you would want
Those other boys, they give you toys
But all they wanna do is
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up

[Verse 2]
You made a mistake
These dudes? Man, you bathin' in apes
Findin' you's like findin' Asians I hate
But they say I got a fetish, nah, I’m skippin' all of it
Black and white girls always come wit' a set of politics
That’s all that I was sayin', I’m a proud man
They wanna holler when they see your name on SoundScan
Her name Mercedes, but she push a brown Focus
And she’s doin' coke in front of me, but act like I don’t notice
There ain't breakage in that Trojan? She see what she wanna see
So I make her take Plan B in front of me
Women talk shit on men like all day
But it's Pete Wentz, goes both ways
They too busy stabbin' hoes like OJ
They too busy trappin' pros like Kobe
The only thing I put before me is "Do, re"
If you had told me the truth, we'd be okay

[Chorus]
If we were kids, I'd want to give
You everything that you would want
Those other boys, they give you toys
But all they wanna do is
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up

[Outro]
It's alright, it's okay
It's alright, it's okay, girl
It's okay

[Chorus]
All these haters, see you later
All that I could do, but you don't even feel me though
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
So CG, but a nigga stay real though
I'm fly, I'm ill, I'm runnin' shit
3-points, field goal
Rappers used to laugh like I tripped and fell
Cause I don't stunt a gold cross like I Christian, bail
Yeah, they starin' at me jealous 'cause I do shows bigger
But your looks don't help like an old gold digger
Uncool, but lyrically I'm a stone-cold killer
So it's 400 blows to these Truffaut niggas
Yeah, now that's the line of the century
Niggas missed it, too busy, they lyin' 'bout penitentiary
Man, you ain't been there, nigga you been scared
And I'm still livin' single like Synclaire
Lovin' white dudes who call me white and then try to hate
When I wasn’t white enough to use your pool when I was eight
Stone Mountain, you raised me well
I’m stared at by Confederates, but hard as hell
Tight jeans, penny loafers, but I still drink a fo' dime
Staying on my me shit, but hated on by both sides
I’m just a kid who blowin' up with my father’s name
And every black "You're not black enough"
Is a white "you're all the same"
Mm Food like Rapp Snitch Knishes
'Cause it's Oreos, Twinkies, coconuts, delicious
How many gold plaques you want inside your dining room?
I said, "I want a full house"
They said, "You got it, dude"

[Chorus]
All these haters, see you later
All that I could do, but you don't even feel me though (Brra)
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Holla, holla, holla, holla at your boy
Like your dad when he's pissed off
Got flow, I could make a cripple crip walk
Niggas' breath stank, all they do is shit talk
People want a real man, I made 'em wait this long
Maybe if he bombs, he'll quit and keep actin'
And save paper like your aunt does with McDonald napkins
How'd it happen? Honesty did it
See all of my competition at the bodies exhibit
Yeah, I bodied the limits and I deaded them fakers
Motherfuck if you hate it, cremated them haters
So, my studio be a funeral
Yeah, this is our year, oh you didn't know?
Uh, yeah I'm killin' you, step inside the lion's den
Man I'm Hov if the 'O' was an 'I' instead
On stage wit' my family in front of me
I am what I am: everything I wanna be

[Chorus]
All these haters, see you later
All that I could do, but you don't even feel me though
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh-oh

[Spoken Word Outro]
This is on a bus back from camp
I'm thirteen and so are you
Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes
I hadn't met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble
It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That’s you
And we're still at camp as long as we're on the bus
And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us
We're still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pine needles
I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you
But I don’t know if you do or don't more-than-like me
You've never said, so I haven't been saying anything all summer
Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me
And choosing to do so again the next day and so on
A girl who's smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh
Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh
But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be
A girl who reads books that no one’s assigned to her
Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it
From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet
Back in the real world we don't go to the same school
And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood
We won't go to the same high school
So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something
And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something
The sun's gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep
We're talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop
That looks like a kid we know
And then I'm like, “Can I tell you something?”
And all of a sudden I'm telling you
And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming
And your face is there and gone and there and gone
As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway
And there's no expression on it
And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the time
Where we live in a world where you haven’t said “yes” or “no” yet
And regrettably, I end up using the word “destiny”
I don't remember in what context. Doesn't really matter
Before long I'm out of stuff to say and you smile and say, “okay”
I don't know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive
And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment
But there's nowhere to go because we're on a bus
So I pretend like I'm asleep and before long, I really am

I wake up, the bus isn't moving anymore
The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on
I turn and you're not there
Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore
We're parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church
The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad's car by now
Your bags and things piled high in the trunk
The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time
Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus
Just as one of them reaches my row
It used to be our row, on our way off
It's Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week
After throwing rocks at my head
Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise
She stops and looks down at me
And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can't really see her face
But I can see her smile. And she says one word: “destiny”
Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh
And then she turns and leads them off the bus
I didn't even know you were friends with them

I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over
So is summer, even though there's two weeks until school starts
This isn't a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad
This is a story about how I learned something and I'm not saying this thing is true or not
I'm just saying it's what I learned
I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody
So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always
Everybody can't turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them
But this means there isn't a place in my life for you or someone like you
Is it sad? Sure. But it's a sadness I chose
I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy
And got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit
But that's not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus
I still haven't

[Intro]
Oh, how about a round of applause?
Yeah, a standing ovation
Ooh, whoa, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

[Pre-Chorus]
And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught

[Chorus]
But you put on quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Really had me going
But now it's time to go (Ooh, oh)
Curtain's finally closing

Go on and take a bow

[Verse 2]
(Oh-oh)
Grab your clothes and get gone (Get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (Come on)

This just looks like the re-run
Please, what else is on? (Ooh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not (Mmm)
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught

[Chorus]
But you put on quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Really had me going
But now it's time to go (Ooh, oh)
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

[Bridge]
Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you (Goes to you)
For making me believe
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How 'bout a round of applause?
A standing ovation

[Chorus]
But you put on quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Really had me going
Now it's time to go (Ooh, oh)
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
But it's over now

Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole

[Verse 1: Redfoo]
I take it to the hole, it's Redfoo I'm aggressive
Four moves ahead, wrong dude to play chess with
I roll with the best click flow so impressive
Shots automatic, better get you a vest quick
(He's heating up!) You could have guessed it
They all compete and they all get bested
Why try to test it, just digest it
Spit so clean that's why I dress so fresh, kid
You see that girl over there she big chested
Let's start my motor boat, face nested
When I do that, she screams all festive
When you do that, she screams, "I'm molested!"
Now you are arrested
While we're in the club being most requested
Step up loud to be the next contestant
To go down town and to see what blessed with

[Chorus: Redfoo]
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole

Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
I beat it up

[Verse 2: Sky Blu]
Yo, give me the rock, I'm gonna rain in 3-point range
Whether you like it or not
LMFAO, we makin' the shots
And that's burning cause my hands is hot
Your team is just like a sandwich shop, we be eating them up
LMFAO we be beating them up
Halftime, we be sweepin' them up
On the court, I be running amok
There's no such thing as D-ing me up
Shot clock, three seconds left, I'm just gettin' started
And yo team out of breath
I juke right, fake to the left, pop, shot, count it, all night
I'm gettin' threes like I'm...
I think I might just top the team
Cause I've got the green
That's how I play in the league
And now I'm gonna be MVP, Sky Blu baby

[Bridge: Sky Blu]
Party people, party people, party people
Get your hands up, get your hands up, get your hands up
Yo, yo
Do my ladies run this party? (Hell yeah!)
Or do my fella's run this party? (Hell yeah!)
I said do my ladies run this party? (Hell yeah!)
Or do my fella's run this party? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, every single thing I spit on you know what it's cost
With some of my diamond shit on, you know who the boss
Either way I style on them all day make way
Put a smile for the women unless they know I don't play
People movin when I wake up and possessin' the best shit
Always the first to do with introducing the next shit
I ain't talkin', I ain't even put they neck down yet
To tell the truth a lot of nigga's need a background check, yo
Could give a fuck about your cute buzz
I return in case you may know who the truth was
And when you on the soundtrack and you ain't saying nothin'
I'm in a club bottle-sippin' and the bitches is jumpin'
When we step up in the buildin' and you see how we get it
And watch all of my nigga's back 'till you know how we did it
Throw it all up in the street just see the kid on a roll
And let me bang with this shawty when I take it to the hole

[Chorus: Redfoo]
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
I beat it up
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
I beat it up
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole

Yeah (aaw shit) yeah

I'm extra good (I've landed, nigga)

Hello

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Hello hello I bring the new era of terror
Speaking and its peaking but its cool you hear me clearly
In the lac' how it sound when it's up
Don't act you ain't fuckin' with it
Cudi hate the fronters
They always in the back, fronting, saying something
Until I, open my mothafuckin' mind and let it spill
Over samples over sense over heavy kicks in the mix
Figured I was all singing til I began ripping
Ready to die ever since my father died
Infatuated with death since my uncles left
Go through the ghost of my family
Dancing in the valley when they hear the harps playin'
Day 'n' Nite in the night
Oh, I ever wondered if I get this rappin' right
Hmm, I know why the bitches treat me oh so, politely
I need the mushu and this occurs to
I'll explain more after a blunt or two
Hey

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Oh, will they come around?
Wonder if they'll come around, now
Oh, oh will they come around
Will they ever come around, now
Now come around
Now do you get it, now do you get it
Homeboy, mothafucka, do you get it?
Now do you get it, do you get it
Homeboy, mothafucka, do you get it (get it)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Some niggas wear a Jesus piece
Trying to show their passion for ice
Instead of trying to show their passion for Christ
So until I get my world right homie I'm Jesus chainless
Waiting in the dungeon with the not many stainless
I'll be buckin at my demons
Truly for more reasons I couldn't put into words
Only assign melodies
If you ever hear a sweet sad sound
Those are the profound tones of
While I'm feeling lost, still waiting to found, down
Not by a model bitch, in her peace and Carey Anne
New motivation for the new generation
Born in 96' watching reruns of Fresh Prince
Inspiration come from all different angles
It is tangled in between
The bullshit that can claim you
Aye LeBron play this song before
You step on the court
This could your alley-oop
While you hop out the coupe
Never made it on the team
But I'm pimpin for sport
Ignorant to the fact I'm dying quick off this port
If any niggas set the goal for the sky to be the limit
You limit your role too stupid to even know
Damn son, what the hell?
We all need to think intergalactic
As I style as I smile
Finally after awhile, hold it now
They come around

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Oh, will they come around?
Wonder if they'll come around, now
Oh, oh will they come around
Will they ever come around, now
Now come around
Now do you get it, now do you get it
Homeboy, mothafucka, do you get it?
Now do you get it, do you get it
Homeboy, mothafucka, do you get it (get it)

[Outro]
Get wit' it!

[Chorus]
Them belly full, but we hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain a fall, but the dutty tough
A yut a yook but yood nah nuff
You're going to dance to Jah music, dance
We're going to dance to Jah music, dance, oh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Forget your troubles and dance
Forget your sorrows and dance
Forget your sickness and dance
Forget your weakness and dance

Cost of living gets so high
Rich and poor they start to cry
Now the weak must get strong
They say, Oh, what a tribulation

[Chorus]
Them belly full, but we hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain a fall, but the dirt it tough
A pot a cook but the food nah nuff
You're going to dance to Jah music, dance
We're going to dance to Jah music, dance, oh-ooh

[Verse 2]
A belly full, but them hungry;
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough;
A pot a-cook, but the food nah nuff
A hungry man is a angry man;
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough;
A pot a-cook, but the food na nuff
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough
A pot a-cook, but the food na nuff
A hungry mob is a angry mob;
A hungry mob is a angry mob

[Verse 3: Lil’ Wayne]

Uptown back in it, Hollygrove black menace, black shirt, black tennis, black semi

Fuck shittin on ya ill dump tha whole toilet on ya
Weezy F Baby bitch im hotter than Uganda

[Verse 1]
Evil $, I, yes, to find a shore
A beast that doesn't quiver anymore
And we could crush some plants to paint my walls
And I won't try to fight in the weekend wars
Was I? I was too lazy to bathe
Or paint or write or try to make a change
Now I can shoot a gun to kill my lunch
And I don't have to love or think too much

[Chorus 1]
Instant battle plans written on the sidewalk
Mental mystics in a twisted metal car
Tried to amplify the sound of light and love

[Verse 2]
Christ is cursed of fathers and martyrs
Might even take a knife to split a hair
Or even scare the children off my lawn
Giving us time to make the makeshift bombs
Every mess invested was a score
We couldn't use computers anymore
But it's difficult to win unless you're bored
And you might have to plan for the weekend wars

[Chorus 2]
Try to break my heart, I'll drive to Arizona
It might take a hundred years to grow an arm
I'll sit and listen to the sound of sand and cold
Twisted diamond heart, I'm the weekend warrior (huh!)
My predictions are the only things I have
I can amplify the sound of light and love

[Outro]
I'm a curse and I'm a sound
When I open up my mouth
There's a reason I don't win
I don't know how to begin
I'm a curse and I'm a sound
When I open up my mouth
There's a reason I don't win
I don't know how to begin
I'm a curse and I'm a sound
When I open up my mouth
There's a reason I don't win
I don't know how to begin
I'm a curse and I'm a sound
When I open up my mouth

[Bridge]
Don't cry dry your eyes call me a jerk
Not 'cause the size of my jeans but how I hurt ya
I know this relationship is never gonna work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do ya dirt
And I said this once before, we make the perfect team
We barely get along forever making scenes
You're crying on my sleeve what does it really mean
It doesn't really matter to me

[Chorus]
'Cause I go, I go all around the world
Fuck different girls, 'cause when they see ya boy
They scream and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I know, I know there's the perfect girl
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see
In my dreams and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me

[Verse 1]
Now you can cry me a river or cry me a ocean
Maybe the Pacific, that's just to be specific
I gotta keep it pimping these hoes they say I'm tripping
I don't care about your nails and your new hair, do your lipstick
Dip-dip next ho, they be on my dick like
All on my testicles, I can't even piss right
After we fuck, you won't see me again after this night
Real niggas know what I mean

[Chorus]
'Cause I go, I go all around the world
Fuck different girls, 'cause when they see ya boy
They scream and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I know, I know there's the perfect girl
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see
In my dreams and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me

[Bridge]
Don't cry dry your eyes call me a jerk
Not 'cause the size of my jeans but how I hurt ya
I know this relationship is never gonna work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do ya dirt
And I said this once before, we make the perfect team
We barely get along, forever making scenes
You're crying on my sleeve what does it really mean
It doesn't really matter to me

[Verse 2]
Now you can go go where you want front who the one gotta get that vibe
Did I hit that? Quit that? How did I hit that? Niggas know how I keep it live
Live try this surprised but she just say I'm on her eyes
Whenever get it in that Prada or Del Agua
Now I be the man Peter Pan, I fly high cause you like my drift
She know how I do it 'cause I got possess and I'm so swift
Get her girlfriend in this whirlwind how we spin
It don't really matter 'cause I'm pimping bitch until the end

[Chorus]
'Cause I go, I go all around the world
Fuck different girls, 'cause when they see ya boy
They scream and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I know, I know there's the perfect girl
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see
In my dreams and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing
The "Penis Song"
(Oh no, he didn't) (Honkey dick)

[Chorus 1]
This is my penis song
I wish that I had a bigger shlong
One that was quite a bit more thick and way more long
One of those porno king kong dongs

[Verse 1]
Haha, check it out, yo, uh
I wish my dick was bigger, yep, I can admit it
I'm above average on inches but I wanted damn double digits
If I had a big ol' cock what would I do?
I'd probably go to Florida and show it to Trina and screw
Get butt naked and start streaking at my school
And get arrested but at least the girls would be impressed
With my third leg and, and then I'd go to a keg and
Do a keg stand, get drunk and do the running man
With no clothes on just to show off
"My dick's bigger than yours when mine is cold and soft"
Haha, oh yeah
I forgot that's not really the cock that I have
I went out and party-bagged 'em and quickly opened the package
And it fit me like Kriss Kross's old school starter jackets
Tryna convince myself like, "Size doesn't matter
Anyways I'd probably just put it on backwards," I mean
I know that God made us all different and special
But shit did he really have to invent lopsided testicles?

[Interlude 1]
I don't have them, I just... I feel bad for, like, you know the guys with like, you know, their left one hangs like lower than the right one, kinda like a—kinda like a lazy eye, like on your, on your balls. I don—I don't know, I just just heard that... I feel bad

[Chorus 2]
This is my penis song
I wish that I had a bigger shlong
One that was quite a bit more thick and way more long
Fellas, if y'all feel me sing along (Don't front, don't front)

[Interlude 2]
Yo yo yo, Ayo ladies? Yeah? Ladies? Yeah? Do you want a guy with an average dick? Hell no. Then—wait, you don't? No, honkey dick. Okay, that's cool (Whatever) No, that's fine

[Verse 2]
I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you never see me skinny dippin' in August
Always walkin' around with my hands in my pockets
Tryna pump blood into my guy Alfonso
I mean, goddamn I don't think you girls understand
I've had a complex since that song Short Short Man
And even though girls have told me that I'm big
When I watch a porno I feel like a little kid
I mean, let's take Ron Jeremy
Now if a girl sees him she'll compare him to me
And every MC in hip-hop has got a huge cock
Or at least talks about it in every song that they drop
I mean, shit
If I was really hung I'd make a whole album called Me and My Dick
With interludes of all the girls that I'd been with
And talk about my package and multiple orgasms
'Cause all that I see is that size does matter
We got Enzite, penis pumps, surgery to Viagra
But when it all adds up you can't really change it
I'm not a porno star, I just gotta face it

[Interlude 3]
You know, I mean, what can I do? Nothing, right? This song goes out to, like, all the, like, little bit above average dudes, to, like, the small dudes, medium dudes but all you big guys, man, stop 

[?]

[Chorus 2]
This is my penis song
I wish that I had a bigger shlong
One that was quite a bit more thick and way more long
Fellas, if y'all feel me sing along (Don't front, don't front)
A dark windy road
Running down with my handgun
And it's' so cold
Hide behind the filling station
I can feel the bloodhounds sniffing and getting closer
I need to leave town 'cause I just shot down an officer

[Hook:]
A convict and I'm wanted
Two strikes and this will make three
They beat me down like Rodney
A victim of brutality it was self defense, self defense
Oh Lord knows that I’m innocent
Is a conspiracy

No time to waste
I'm running from incarceration
Get out my way 'cause I'm not going back to prison
They made me a outlaw
The moment when they stash that contraband in my car
Didn't do nothing illegal
But I've been set up to be the one to take the fall

[Chorus]
Convict and I'm wanted
Two strikes and this will make three
They beat me down like Rodney
A victim of brutality, it was self-defense, self-defense
Oh Lord knows that I'm innocent its a conspiracy
(Hey bud
Uhhuhh?
I need you to bring me anybody that
I can pin this on, yah hear me?
Yah
Get to work
Alright... alright... alright...)

Just another routine stop 'cause I was speedin
Thought they just give me a ticket and I'd be leaving
Little that I know I was a part of a bigger plot bad drug deal orchestrated by a crooked cop
Why so many of em, in one spot
Something isn't right, no is just not
But before I could figure out what was going on
I was on the ground getting beat up and stomped on
I'm half-dead, I'm half dead
What did I do to deserve this
I must escape before they kill a nigga
I grabbed the gun from his holster and pulled the trigger

[Chorus]
A Convict and I'm wanted
Two strikes and this will make three
They beat me down like Rodney
A victim of brutality, it was self defense, self defense
Oh Lord knows that I'm innocent its a conspiracy

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbin' hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up on Biscayne
Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
Twenty-five, sitting on twenty-five mil', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay, okay
Gettin' paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune light one, pass it like a relay
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J, and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't, then again, maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
One time, fuck one time
I'm callin' niggas out like the umpire
Seven grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy, so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall, put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted, doorknob
Talk stupid, off with your head
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer Bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet, niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue-kiss her other tongue
Skeet, skeet, skeet, water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt, Tunechi

[Chorus: Drake & Lil Wayne]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though (Yeah)
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?
Real nigga, what's up?
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see it straight, I can't even see it straight, ah
Fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, 'cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot, but I'm the truth, that's right, I fuckin' said it
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You, girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know? How'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I could tell a lie if you askin' me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rap and bitches, bitches and rappin'
Rappin' and bitches until all of it switches, I swear
It's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing, "Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga," ah
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm gettin' back to my ways

[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately, I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis, Tennessee know, see, I start to go deep back
In Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowin' in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowin' in the South
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm tryna be like?
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
Soon as I realize that turnin' papers in won't get me paid
And if I don't do nothing, I'ma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall, yeah, I need that
Making major changes to the life I'm livin'
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm gettin' back to my ways

[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately, I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it like it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it, and here I am
In the presidential, do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing movin' through the street
Got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib
Goddamn, man, she's beauty and the beast, Lord
Seem like yesterday that I was up-and-coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here? The drink here? The girls here?
Well, fuck, let's get it then

[Chorus: Drake]
Uh, I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double? You ain't even gotta ask, ah
Because it's hard to say no (Say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down
Every time (Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down
We'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)
Are you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down
Every time (Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down
We'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
Used to make us proud, we had dreams of getting bigger, man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man, uh
You keep talking how you was this and you had this
And you deserve some fuckin' credit, how did anyone forget it?
Got a show up in your city, your girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfuckin' time
You should take it as a sign, man, I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it, 'cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She says, "You're such a dog," I say, "You're such a bone"
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days, women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention, though, they always saying, "Show me some"
But girl, you ain't the only one that's tryna be the only one, uh
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then, fuck, let's get it then

[Chorus: Drake]
Uh, I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double? You ain't even gotta ask, ah
Because it's hard to say no (Say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down
Every time (Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down
We'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)
Are you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down
Every time (Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down
We'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)

[Outro: Birdman]
Yeah
Drizzy, your turn, nigga
Take care of the business, nigga (Shine on these niggas)
Give these niggas the business, nigga
Kill spray anything in the way, nigga, fuck 'em, we don't love 'em (Blatt)
Yeah, it's just that uptown gangster shit (Yeah)
Toronto, stand up for one of the realest niggas, Drizzy
With the realest flow, you know?
Toast to this gangster shit (To this gangster shit)
OVO, YMCMB, nigga (Believe that)
Yeah, you understand me?
Playin' with these motherfuckin' millions like they ain't nothing (Throwin' hundreds)
Rubber band stacks
Yeah, that YMCMB shit, nigga
Flashy lifestyle
One hundred

[Intro: Drake & Jon B]
No, no, no
I been callin' on, callin' on you
No, no, no
Yeah
I been callin' on, callin' on you
Uh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Word on road is the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody, they already know
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on the low
But it's cool, know you heard it all before
That's why I asked you

[Chorus: Drake]
How you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy, yeah
That's why I asked you, how you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy, yeah, heh, uh

[Verse 2: Drake]
How you mean? How you mean? What you know about the team?
Man, these niggas need to stop it, they be crowding up the scene
Baby girl, you need to stop it, all that pride and self-esteem
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines
Baby, she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know, I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Trying to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me
Before I'm on the next ting, YMCMB, ah

[Refrain: Jon B]
Ooh, finally got you right here (Said I finally got my baby)
Tonight, I'll ease your mind (Tonight, I'll ease your mind)
That's why I'm callin' on you (Why I'm callin' on you)
And, ooh, oh
Soft, you're love's desire (Soft, you're love's desire)
It's hard to stay away (Stay away)
You keep me callin' on you (You keep me callin' on you)

[Chorus: Drake]
How you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy, yeah
How you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy, yeah, heh

[Verse 3: Drake]
How you mean? How you mean? What you know about the team?
You just know what you get told, girl, I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gon' have to get it cleaned
She been going way too hard, someone has to intervene
Baby, she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know, I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Girl, they love me like I'm Prince, like the new king with the crown
Bunch of Underground Kingz, thought you knew how we get down, huh?

[Refrain: Jon B]
Ooh, finally got you right here (Said I finally got my baby)
Tonight, I'll ease your mind (Tonight, I'll ease your mind)
That's why I'm callin' on you (Why I'm callin' on you)
And, ooh, oh
Soft, you're love's desire (Soft, you're love's desire)
It's hard to stay away (Stay away)
You keep me callin' on you (You keep me callin' on you)

[Chorus: Drake]
How you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy
How you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy, yeah

[Outro: Drake & Jon B]
Ah, call on you
Just mail me my ring back
Oh, I wanna call on you, baby
Can't keep that shit
Oh, I wanna call on you, baby
She said I could call on you, baby (Hahaha)
Ayy
La, da, da, da, da, la, da, da, da, da, baby

[Intro: Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after, texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer?
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fuckin' with ya, damn
Is it the fall? Time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all, damn
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin' money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessin'
And started undressin' and asked me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure, damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin' money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Drake]
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, yeah, yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright, aw, yeah

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah
Yeah
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinkin' that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, aw
Pushing me away so I give her space, aw
Dealin' with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I would care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

[Chorus: Rihanna & Drake]
'Cause if you let me
Here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost
(Yeah)

[Verse 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're followin' your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate bein' alone, well, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you somethin'
To save you, instead, they say

[Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron]
Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt
I don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true
Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt
I don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Man

[Verse 1]
It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her, but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt and you smokin' heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it, and we argue about spendin' money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now it's fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat
And I leave out and you call me and you tell me that you sorry
And you love me and I love you and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep, but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard if you were healthy and it weren't so bad, uh
Maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
'Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbin' a bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh, it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinkin' of signin' me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son, man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
And get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we should've known
'Cause you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon' be somethin'
When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've, look what you've

[Verse 2]
It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love 'cause when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid, damn
Boohoo, sad story, Black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid, but it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you, man, this all new shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fightin' going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
Now I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'd be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, then you got to me
Then you'd toss the keys and loan me your car, yeah
Just a young kid in a drop-top Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life so worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything
You said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced, but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where I'd really be without that
It worked out, man, you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon' be somethin'
When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've, look what you've

[Outro: Drake's Grandmother]
Hi Aubrey
I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk
And he knew, knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this
In this comfortable place
All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together
And the times I used to look after you
And I still have wonderful feeling about that

[Verse 1]
I just wanna show you how much I appreciate you, yes
Wanna show you how much I'm dedicated to you, yes
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true, yes
Wanna show you how much you got your girl feeling good, yes
Wanna show you how much, how much you understood, yes
Wanna show you how much I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me, babe, yes
Wanna show you how much I really care about your heart
Wanna show you how much I hate being apart, yes
Wanna show you, show you, show you 'til you through with me
I wanna keep it how it is, so you can never say how it used to be!

[Pre-Chorus]
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch!

[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight, I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight, I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy, I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight, it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe
Swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on my babe
Baby, let me put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's 'bout to go down

[Verse 2]
You'll never need two 'cause I will be your number one
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you
'Cause I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backing this thing back
Pop-popping this thing back
Drop, drop, drop, drop-dropping this thing back
This is for the time you gave me flowers
For the world that is ours
For the mula, for the power of love
And no, I won't never ever e-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and a freak in the you know what
Sit back, sit back, it's the pre-game show
Daddy, you know what's up

[Pre-Chorus]
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch

[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight, I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight, I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy, I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight, it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe
I'll be swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on you, babe
I wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down

[Bridge]
I'ma take this time to show you how much you mean to me
'Cause you are all I need
No money can emphasize
Or describe
The love that's in-between the lines
Boy, look into my eyes
While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel
Rocking on you, babe, rocking, rocking on you, babe
Swirling on you, babe
In my mind, all I can think about is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past and a chance to make this love last

[Hook]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight, I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight, I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy, I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight, it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe
I'll be swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on my babe
I wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down

[Outro]
Watch me p-pop it, p-pop it for you, baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you, baby
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me roll it, baby
Wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch me
Watch me p-pop it, p-pop it for you, baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you, baby
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me roll it, baby
Wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch me

[Intro]
Don't you worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

[Verse 1]
I was out shopping thinking of something I should get you
Cause I've been gone so many weeks, damn, I miss you
Don't wanna do nothing more than just stare at your face
And let you know I'm happy you're my best friend
Part of this fortune, boy, I owe you
For being always there to talk to
Take some time out, starting with today
For my babe

[Chorus]
We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight

All of this fortune, boy, I owe you
For being always here to talk to
Taking time out, starting with today
For my babe

[Chorus]
We're gonna hit the floor at home

When it comes to my baby, I bring my best
I just wanna party tonight
'Cause it's obvious to see that you're all I wanna be
Uh, just let me look at you!
Uh, you look so sexy boy, I wanna taste!
All unwrapped and on it's way
When I groove with you
Oh, you'll feel so good boy you're my favorite place
Just come and lay up under me!

[Chorus]
We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
And I'ma DJ all of your songs

You kept me on this pedestal
No matter how much I let you down;
Too long, too long, too long
(now you trapped)
(My love for you) Ain't going nowhere, nowhere
Only only only

[Verse 1]
She told me I'm dying I'm trying to survive
Never be enough if it just
(Just me for u)
And now she questioning if it's real when I say 'I love you'

I guess it's hard to feel when I'm never even there
Actions speak louder than words and they say I don't care
But I know what's in my heart if you can hold it right now
You see it's only beating cause you hold a nigga down
Think about that for a second now, baby

I can't say it's right when I'm running through the night
You're my shining star can't afford to lose your light
So busy doing wrong, will I ever get it right for you
Oh no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She deserves something better and she know she does
(she know she does)
But I'm never gonna let her, cause she knows my love

[Hook]
You can never find another man
Cause I ain't never gonna understand
If it ain't
Me for u
Me for u

Even though I'm doing wrong, girl
U can never move along, girl
Cause it's just
Me for you

[Verse 2]
Me for you and you for me
That's the way it's gotta be
Even though I'm in the streets fucking with these fucking freaks
Stupidly, truthfully
I know you been so through with me
You put up with my foolery
I guess you got so use to me
And my infidelity
And through the bad you saw the better man in me
You picked me up every time they put me down
You try to leave me Imma tie you to the ground
Baby look what you've allowed (x3)
And I'll never found no nigga in my house
(who that talking in the background, huh)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She deserves something better and she know she does
(she know she does)
But I'm never gonna let her...
Kill a nigga dead, that's just
(My Love For You)

[Hook]

[Outro]
It meant nothing
I was helping her, Margaret, that's all
The way you helped me?
I thought she was your friend
So you wouldn't fuck her
That language does not become you
Yes
You'd rather I be demure
I'd rather you be rational
Meaning what?
That I say nothing about what I see
What I hear?
What have you heard?
That you are capable of anything
And who told you that?
Agent van Alden
While you were out campaigning
Well, if you didn't tell me about it
It couldn't have been very upsetting
It made me sick to my stomach
This whole arrangement does
What arrangement?
That I'm to accept what you tell me
And ask nothing more
That I aid you in the business you conduct
And pretend I don't know what that business is
I don't recall you ever saying no
To anything I put in front of you
You make a little noise every now and then
To remind me what a good person you are
But a good person wouldn't be here right now
A$$

Stupidly stupid a dat
Girl that booty so stupid I getchu wet it be oozing I stick my tongue out to prove it
I stick my tongue out I do it

[Chorus 1]
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?

Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know them Harlem niggas gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga (Uh,) but how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss

[Verse]
Uh
Stone cold love, rose gold slugs
I could afford it, I imported stone cold drugs
Stone cold, rolling stone, I'm a stoned nigga
Write it on my tombstone, I was stoned, nigga
Don't remember me as a wannabe New Orleans nigga
Slash lean sipping, Tennessee nigga, nah
Influenced by Houston, hear it in my music (Yeah)
A trill nigga to the truest, show you how to do this
My all gold grills give her cold chills
Said she got a coke feel 'cause I'm so trill
Two dope boy scales, but I sold pills
No deal, put her on her feet, toenails
Them vampires, them bloodsuckers, them thirsty killers
We 'bout it, 'bout it, we rowdy, rowdy, that Percy Miller
For really real, we chilly chill, don't sport Chinchilla
No bounty hunters, I'm 'bout to killa, I'm bout my skrilla
Give me the title, then give me the cash, fold it then bag it then move to the trap
Follow my stash, stealing my swag, niggas is wickity wickity wack
Like Kriss Kross, her lip gloss, slip-ons get slipped off
My bitch boss, Cristal, we smoking then thinking then burning that hash
Puff it and pass, making it last, walk in my shoes and then cross in my path
Game was for grabs, making 'em crash, took in a section ain't giving it back
Fuck the money, fuck the fame, this is real life
An insight to my trill life, Clams

[Chorus 2]
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga, boy, how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling this
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling this
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling this
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling it

[Intro:]

A falling star fell from your heart
And landed in my eyes
I scream for love
As it tore through them
And now it's left me blind

[Kid Cudi:]

Hmmmmmm, yeah
I'm here, super duper dooder cud
All up in the mix like yeah, nigga what?
Boy, I Stay blazed like Broadus
Even If I never said it
You should probably know this by now
Ta-Dow, what they go and make up
Every time I read about stupid shit they make up
If I ever saw them, black dynamite 'em
Then they'd have a reason to say why they never like them
Ain't no need to seek it
I am content, dream like content
So unconscious, just me and my conscience
I'm runnin' with them wild things
Livin' to do wild things, Cudder

[Outro:]

I live, I live, I live, I live for symphonies
I know that there's some place just right for me

[Chorus]
Let me know, know what's up
Before I roll, roll one up (Yeah)
Let me know, know what‘s up (Yeah)
Before I roll (Yeah) roll one up
I've been rolling up, that reefer got me high, high
I've been rolling up that weed, it got me high, high
I've been rolling up, sativa got me high, high
I've been rolling all week, it got me high, high

[Verse 1]
Puff, puff, pass, take a drag, just don't steam it though
Smoking on that captain kush, this shit is unbelievable
My shit come from Mexico, yeah, I got that dimelo
Mama said leave weed alone but I think I need it though
Oh, oh, niggas getting throwed
Oh, oh, we blowing purple smoke (Yeah)
Oh, oh, the kush and purple haze (Alright, alright)
Oh, oh, we flying paper planes
'Cause I'm always talking fly shit, fashion be the topic
That's why all these hoes wanna hop and jump on my dick
Then she looked at me and said, "How lower can your eyes get?"
Let me know who's chipping in, this before I cop it

[Chorus]
Let me know, know what's up
Before I roll, roll one up
Let me know, know what’s up
Before I roll, roll one up
I've been rolling up, that reefer got me high, high (Yeah)
I've been rolling up that weed, it got me high, high (Yeah)
I've been rolling up, sativa got me high, high (Yeah)
I've been rolling all week, it got me high, high

[Verse 2]
Rotation is like basketball, blunts is going back and forth
Niggas mixing hash and dro with cinnamon, that's applesauce
Show this what you asking for? Liquor is my last resort
Steaming niggas grab the torch (Then puff, puff, pass it off)
Uh, tell me what you think about it
I've been getting high, I'm tryna get a drink around it
Now my high is higher than it's ever been
(I'm so motherfuckin' high) I think I might never land
They be talking crazy but I've been rolling hazies up
I've been having like a twenty, forty then that eighty bucks
Man, I come through, get that Mercedes truck and them ladies fuck
They already know we got them blunts and we blazing up

[Chorus]
Let me know, know what's up
Before I roll, roll one up
Let me know, know what’s up
Before I roll, roll one up
I've been rolling up, that reefer got me high, high
I've been rolling up that weed, it got me high, high
I've been rolling up, sativa got me high, high
I've been rolling all week, it got me high, high

[Verse]
Feeling outta place, plus it's getting kinda late
Tryna make it home safe and not get raped, where you live?
Tina tummy ache, Gina got the funny face
Mona's sniffing dope, so her dome is leaning on your rib
I bet you wish you had a Benz cause you just helped your friends
Flag a taxi, now you walking not too far from your crib
Craving for an acid tablet for your satisfaction
Said you feeling flabbergasted, you just had to have it
Made your way to 7th Ave, flagged a yellow cab
Now you need an upper fast to help your mellow swag
Black kid, french braids and he keep the potent
Hold ya purse, don't trust him cause his teeth is golden
Dice rolling, reefer blowing in the streets, he smoking
Blowing weed while police patrolling, uh
Acid strips, purple drank, you can have a sip
Have a fix of this acid drip, drip

[Chorus]
Hands on her thighs, kiss on her lips
Eye for an eye, drip for a drip
I get ya high, please don't forget
I can supply the fix for ya trip
Hands on her thighs, kiss on her lips
Eye for an eye, drip for a drip
I get ya high, please don't forget
I can supply the fix for ya trip

[Outro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah, drip
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, drip
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, drip
Acid strips, purple drank, you can have a sip
Have a fix of this acid drip, drip

[Intro]
Yeah, uh-uh, uh-uh
Yeah, alright, alright
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Smoking, rolling reefer up, I adjust the tweakers up
(Break it, break it down) Break it down so I can beat it up
Where the welcome back? Where the welcome mat? My sneakers tough
This is for my old head, gon' turn your speakers up
"Rocky, where you been?" I been tryna make my ends meet
So I can cop that Bathing Ape or Jeremy Scott or 10 Deep
Bottles full of Rose, riding in the Benz jeep
Blowing money fast, now I'm finna think I'm (Big Meech)
I met with my old head, we sat for a while
We rolled a couple Swishers, we chat for a while
I said, "I'm just on my grind, I come to Houston all the time"
He said, "What's been goin' down in your New York state of mind?"
Fine, you ever got days you feel like giving up
Like how you gon' eat when this gig is up?
When the chips is down and the jig is up
But I don't give a fuck, roll another Swisher up
Cause I just came here down South so I could get these pounds out
And move my mother nice somewhere, nothin' closer than a townhouse
And my beats banging, kicking harder than a roundhouse
I spoke with my old head and this is what I found out

[Chorus]
Life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight
Cause life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight

[Verse 2]
Now my old head old age, bald head, Rogaine
Code red codeine, nose red, cocaine
Pimpin bitches since lemon chicken, shrimp lo-mein
Gold chains, afros, platforms, Soul Train
And he told me 'bout that rapping, trapping in the old days
When Pac hung with Shock before that rat-tat-tat-tat, nose rings
And I'm so high, I could fuck around and grow wings
And we sipping on something purpler than Soul Plane
We sip slow, we slow swang
We tip fours, on chrome wings
Told me I should head home and do my own thang
Then I heard my phone rang, hold up, that's my old dame
Pick it up, I hit you back, miss me and I miss you back
She said, "Harlem miss you too and they can't wait to get you back
You should come on home, leave the drugs alone and stick to rap
Just don't come back flossin' 'cause that type of shit'll get you clapped"

[Chorus]
Life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight
Cause life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight

[Bridge]
I'm riding down, coming down for my old head (Yeah, yeah)
Junkied up, chunk the deuce for my old head (Alright)
Sitting slow, riding down with my old head (Yeah)
Bury niggas talking down on my old head (Alright, yeah)
Riding down, riding down with my old head (Yeah)
Chunk the deuce, give it up for my old head (Yeah)
Riding down, riding 'round with my old head (Alright, alright)
For my old head, for my old head

[Chorus]
Life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight
Cause life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight

[Verse 1]
Baby I'm living the dream
With you by my side we work as a team
I know I'm a mac, it's not what it seems
I'm covered in pink, from swimming in green
When I'm eating you like Idi Amin
Mama the stars could not intervene
You are a star, I'm keeping it clean
You are the prettiest girl I have seen
What does that mean? It means you're the one
And most of these dudes are just fucking for fun
Girl you know that I would never do that to you
All of the girls that I do must be beautiful
Inside and out, meaning your mouth
Girl I'm just playin', this is what I'm sayin'
If you like real, then give me a go
If you never try, then you'll never know

[Hook]
Ooh it's alright, ooh it's okay
Let them all know that I got this way
Cause I miss you girl
I wanna be with you, yeah
And if the sun don't come out
Ooh it's okay
Let them all know that I got this way
Cause I miss you girl
I wanna be with you, yeah
Never, ever, ever let me go
Do you love me? Girl I need to know
Cause you're my sunshine girl
Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh
Baby girl, you're always on my mind
Baby girl, it's time to make you mine
Cause you're my sunshine girl
Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh

[Verse 2]
Look, I'm the man to know
I'm the one to give you more
Ma, you got that stupid flow
I talk about moms like Margaret Cho
And I'mma go, minus the "o"
So I'm a g, sportin' a V-
Neck and a check, on my shoes
Cause I got nothin' to lose, uh
I'm in it to win it
Money so long I get business from Guinness
Diving in green, I'm swimming in spinach
And I'm in the race, who cares about finish?
I’m going vintage, and I’m an advantage
I’m what you need girl, you need an advantage
And nothing is heinous so I can work for ya
Couldn't stand out, girl

[Hook]
Ooh it's alright, ooh it's okay
Let them all know that I got this way
Cause I miss you girl
I wanna be with you, yeah
And if the sun don't come out
Ooh it's okay
Let them all know that I got this way
Cause I miss you girl
I wanna be with you, yeah
Never, ever, ever let me go
Do you love me? Girl I need to know
Cause you're my sunshine girl
Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh
Baby girl, you're always on my mind
Baby girl, it's time to make you mine
Cause you're my sunshine girl
Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh

She sipping on my styrofoam cup
Telling me she wanna bone but I ain't got no condoms on me
She claiming I'm a Pimp C
Cause I'm sipping Big Moe when I'm on that Screw juice
She sip it 'til it's empty
Purple on the mustache, now it's time to screw you
And I wanna chop and screw you, girl
Moving like it's turtle time, feeling like the world is mi-mine
And I be on my Fergenstein
I stay on my money grind then I'm going outta my mind
Flying through the purple sky
And I'm in a different world and you kinda look like Jasmine Guy
And I'm kissing on that pink juice
Sipping on that Pimp juice (She's all that I want)

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Life after death, death after life
Made mistakes before, I swear I wasn't gonna do it twice
You love me and it wouldn't change
So I'm by myself which will remain the same
And it was just one girl who left me sprung
And it was just one girl who had me going dumb
And it was just one girl who was where I was from
Gave me her feelings and I left that bitch with none

[Verse 2: Tyler the Creator]
I was in love, but I jumped out quick
Gave her my heart, she broke it, put it in the bucket
On another level I'm bitter, I wanted to keep her
But now this shit is coming out your speaker
Wish that you could meet her
But she's chopped up in my freezer
By the mixed vegetables, I'll eat her
Looking in the iris, I knew she was lying
Cuz she wasn't crying, laughing
So I starting grabbing
And she started gasping for air
She told me the truth, I didn't care
The dead made me win
And her death made me grin
Like a mouth with a side of nipples and limbs
This the end, yeah
Potatoes and grits on the plate of her
I should have stayed away from her
But she cheated
And now she's in my freezer bleeding
Her parents looking for her, good luck
You dirty bitch

[Verse 3: Tyler the Creator]
Met the bitch, tied the bitch up
And then I ate her up because she want to go and fuck my cousin up
Nigga's balls in the room and now this bitch is mad at me cause I made a song with autotune with my nigga G
She looking at me all mad and all sad
But now I'm glad that she's wrapped up in that Glad bag
And that shit's all black and I'm wearing all black
And now she mad cause I found out she was fucking, sucking other niggas
Busting, cumming, running, here I'm coming with a motherfucking knife and now I'm gunning
And now this bitch is screaming for help, yelp, dealt, the motherfucking card that she dealt
But that's her fucking fault, I don't give a fuck
I fucking more, she fucking one and now these cases that I caught
Shit, but I ain't even fucking tripping
I need a new chick, I'm sick of dealing with these bitches

[Outro]
In the club, niggas in the club

[Verse: Syd The Kyd]
What happened to make you, to make you start to hate me?
I once was your heart; we were in love, and you were my﻿ everything
Sometimes I wonder why I still try
Don't say it's over

Cause we both know no ones perfect, baby, I feel like this could be worth it
Ohhh

Cause I haven't felt much myself lately, what I got to do to get back my lady?
Ohh ohhhh ohhh ohh

[Verse 1 - Syd tha Kyd]
They say that every day is a struggle and it takes time
But do they, do they have a clue?
How do I, do I tell the truth from a lie now?
They're trying to say hello, it's goodbye tomorrow
Throw a little weed up in the bowl... and you'll be all right
You'll be all right

[Bridge - Syd tha Kyd]
Just think if things were perfect
Would it be worth it if even at all
So don't act like you can't take it
You were meant to be greatness
You can weather the storm

[Hook - Syd tha Kyd & Tay Walker]
I know how easy, it is to give up
But don't let people to hold you down
And I know sometimes it'll amaze you (it'll amaze you)
Don't let it faze you
Just hold your ground
They say, they say hmmm
They say, they say hmmm
They say, they say hmmm

[Verse 2 - Tay Walker]
Oh, oh
Why do we judge those we don't know
There's no need to hide
You know what's inside
What do we hate when there is love to spare
Why don't we understand
That the only way to grow is with love

[Bridge - Syd tha Kyd]
Just think if things were perfect
Would it be worth it if even at all
So don't act like you can't take it
You were meant to be greatness
You can weather the storm

[Hook - Syd tha Kyd & Tay Walker]
I know how easy, it is to give up
But don't let people to hold you down!
And I know sometimes it'll amaze you (it'll amaze you)
Don't let it faze you
Hold your ground (hold your ground)
They say they say

Respect that, and I'mma rep that 'til I D-I-E
To get a pass, you gon' need a ID, to come through
Pussy nigga lookin' sideways like he don't like me

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Verse 2: NH]

Imaginary line, you don’t wanna cross mine
Found a clock in the street, I’m making up for lost time
Third eye blind but it’s still fuck the bullshit
Knowing what I got but more conscience of what I could get
Tired of the same shit, don’t know who to blame, shit

Try and refrain, dying in vain
Soon as I'm replyin' your name
I be the nigga in the Shelter who be eyein' your chain

[Verse 2: Njeri Earth (Parking Lot Rapper #3)]
Yo, yo
313 area, bound to bury ya with vengeance
My rhymes sentences'll put an end to your existence with

[Verse 3: Mekhi Phifer (as Future)]
You forced to listen to the individual, the metaphysical
The Mac Mitten, rhyme ritual, heterosexual
Syllables they sound complex to you, lines perplexin' you
With words that could put a hex on you, snap that neck on you
Murder you, boil you, we keep a white boy or two
Let my man grab the mic, you see how Bunny Rabbit do

[Interlude: Mekhi Phifer (as Future) & Eminem (as B-Rabbit)]
Come on, man. Come on, man
Kick that shit, baby, come on
Come on, man

Uh
Alright, speed it up a little bit, Iz
Come on, baby
Alright, look
Yo, yo

[Verse 4: Eminem (as B-Rabbit)]
Your style is generic, mine's authentic-made
I roll like a renegade, you need clinic aid
My technique's bizarre and ill; I scar and kill
You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill
As I proceed to cook and grill ya, that's all it took to kill ya
You better recognize me like I look familiar
You wanna battle? You beat around the bush
Like you're scared to lick pussy, so you eat around the tush
I need a clown to push, someone that I can bully
Wait a minute, I don’t think you understand fully
See me without a style's like mustard without the Heinz
I lead the new school, you're a Busta without the rhymes
I crush the shit out your line

[Verse 5: Omar Benson Miller (as Sol George)]
Now I'm the Rashiki, smokin' the lick-licky
Ten freaky girls inside The Chin Tiki
Girl, when you see me, you better believe me
This ain't a game and pimpin' ain't easy
Anything goes when it comes to hoes
I'm the kingpin when it comes to flows
You better ask someone if you don't know
When you see me, girl, say "What up, though?
Ten freaky girls
Ten, ten, ten freaky girls

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Justin Bieber
Damn damn J.B, where the hell you been
Yeah I got a new necklace, diamonds
2 big face Rollies, no I ain't lyin'
Making momma so proud that she cryin'
Yeah you say I'm crazy? Guess that makes two
But I never knew that dreams really came true
Started playing drums when I was only 2
Now we kick it in Japan, kung-fu
So I'm heading for the gold, I'm sweating
I swear Otis Redding will be oh-so ready
I already got ahead-y of the game, I'm with Kenny
And we steady getting many, I mean money
Riding in an all-black Benz with the all black rims
And we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses

Wait...I'm not done

[Verse 2]
I thanked Jesus at the awards I'm never going to hell
Call me Zack Morris, I'm saving you by the bell
My girl says I'm perfect she just loves an imperfect person perfectly
Personally I think she is perfectly perfect
I get it done abundantly, she wants to get up under me
I swear I got a hun' of these cause baby I'm a money tree
So be my little honey be my little-bitty bunny
I got honeys all up on me baby I just get it done-y
Possibly you're probably thinking this type of swag is impossible
And logically will probably but you just take me lyrically
Try to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally
There's a bigger me inside this little me
Screaming out I should make history
I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me
Run up on my enemies see if they remember me
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory
Can't you see the private jets flying over you?
I ain't even notice but my focus on my photos
Might be bogus, no they shouldn't be a photoshoot
It's funny how you wanna take my picture and it's like your first time
Playing with camera claiming that "It's not mine"
Just calm down, you don't gotta hurry
Don't be nervous, you don't gotta worry
And my fans are like my glasses, yeah without them I'd be blurry

[Verse 1: Syd tha Kyd]
Hey Baby. Where you going?
You look good to me
You look good to be
Walking by yourself
Maybe I can help

[Hook 1: Syd tha Kyd]
I wanna, I wanna
Do you wanna do some cocaine?
I wanna, I wanna
Do you wanna do some cocaine?

[Hook 2: Syd tha Kyd]
Baby just ignore
The consequence
You look like you can use a little confidence
So follow me, just let it be your paradise
And now that you know what this feelings like
You know you can have it for the rest of your life
Just follow me, just follow me

[Verse 2: Left Brain]
She high as fuck up in my truck
Shocked up looking for a bitch to fuck
I'm high on coke, she high on coke
Coast to coast baby float my boat
Got coke to sniff and weed to roast
And no need to boast, let's snort

[Bridge: Syd tha Kyd]
2 in the back, one in the front
Do you wanna ride in my car?

[Break: Syd Tha Kyd]
Ayee
Don't trip
Just try it once
Don't worry (I wanna I wanna)
Just follow me (I wanna I wanna)

[Hook 2]

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Come they told me, pa rum pum pum pum
A newborn king to see, pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the king, pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum pum
Yeah, I'm on the drum, yeah, I'm on the snare drum
Yeah, I'm on the beat 'cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat 'cause I'm playing for the Son
Playing for the king, playing for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight I might go psycho
Christmas time, so here's a recital
I'm so bad like Michael, I know
I'm still young, but I go, I go
Stupid, stupid, love like Cupid
I'm the drummer boy, so do it, do it

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & (Busta Rhymes)]
Little baby, pa rum pum pum pum (Yeah)
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum
(Let's gather 'round the mistletoe real quick)
I have no gifts to bring, pa rum pum pum pum
(Matter fact, let's gather 'round the fireplace, it's about to get hot in here)
Nothing to give our king (Bieber, what up?), pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
(I'ma needa get straight to it)

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, at the table with the family, havin' dinner
BlackBerry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back, despite I had some food up on my fingers
Sippin' eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, I'm pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said, "Let's make it hot up in the winter", I said "Cool"
You know I'ma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work, I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we 'bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
Merry Christmas, Kwanza, Happy Hanukkah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah, yeah, I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say they, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they're warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
Not thinkin' there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe, globe, globe, globe, globe

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it

[Intro]

[Verse 2]
She said the pain runs deep cause she thought they had something for real
You can't blame all men for the things one nigga did (ooooh)
She said she hate em
But she love her new girlfriend
Baby you just caught up in a whirlwind (Trey's Woman Voice: But niggas crazy)
Not as crazy as you women be

How many times does this scene realize
Tried to put her on my team
She play for the other side
She say all these niggas crying
"I can fuck you right, I can fuck you right"
Damn you just read my mind (mind, mind, mind, MIND)
Say she never was into girls
But you don't understand cause you never been a girl
She say not just any girl

Dammit it's a miracle, please adjust the temperature
I switched up the interior in my European vehicle
Damn Gucci lyrical, nah I ain't lyrical but my bracelet is crazy but my necklace is a miracle
Blacker than Nigeria, with brand new material
Counting a quarter million while I'm pouring a bowl of cereal
Fresher than your ever were, richer than a year ago
With three dollars a skittle but it's eight hundred a cheerio
I was arrogant, Muls' same color as a prune
Yellow chain look like the moon and my old school is maroon
Room, hear it ert-ert when it skrt
26's on the skirt's and a bird with a flirt
You can chirp, I got twerk, I keep work in my birds
I got bird, I got brickss, I got pounds of that herbs
"Yeahhhh" used to be my favorite word now my ice game is superb
So them hoes be just like, "Burr, burr"

Ask Rocko, ask Gucci, ask Gucci, Gucci bandana (Uh)
I'm a star, I'm the black Hannah Montana (Woo)

[Verse 3: Rocko]
Man, I'ma step my swag up, don't fly commercial, I'm private
Step my rank up, so salute me, fuckin' private
Remember the days I used to keep my coat in my private
Now I'm with my partners smokin' kush on autopilot
I just bought a boat, and I don't even know how to drive it
But it's all gravy, I just coast on autopilot
I'm on another coast, you ain't even in my time zone
By the time you go to bed, I'm gettin' my shine on
Yeah, it's all good, baby, go on and climb on
Then ride it like a rodeo, get your grind on
Tell how I spend money, I be gettin' my grind on
Tell how I'm limpin' when I walk, I got my .9 on
Ayy, your girl lovin' you, but she with me, know what her mind on?
Don't make me do it hard, I get it done, it cost a dime, homie
Watch fifty stacks, and it don't even have a diam' on
Rocko The Don, I done got my time gone

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Gucci Mane]
Daddy tryin' hard, but it's easy (Huh)
Tighten up on your job, 'cause it's easy (Huh)
I’m Nicki Minaj, so be easy (Yeah)

[Intro]

DJ Drama: Aye Trigga
Trey Songz: What up Dram?
DJ Drama: I know you been on this rap thing for a minute right?
Trey Songz: Right
DJ Drama: Can we show 'em the lyrics?
Trey Songz: You think they ready?
DJ Drama: Can we show 'em the greatness?
Trey Songz: yeah..
DJ Drama: I'll handle the beats
Trey Songz: Niggas ain't ready man
DJ Drama: Holla at 'em

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]

Ungh, A nigga never been as dope as me
Like my veins and my brain run on coca leafs
I say they fly well they fly, well these niggas popery
Mind capacity as wide as the open sea
Put these niggas in they place where they 'spose to be
Plus I get these bitches buck like gopher teeth
So respect it or check it, fuck your hypothesis
I'mma write the play no Socrates, pardon me, nobody alarmin' me
They all rap commonly as if they hold drugs like a pharmacy

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]

Watch came up, what you 'wan see?
I made the time change up, yeah quantum leap
And I'm still tryna figure where I 'wan be

So many fish in the sea, life is vagina beach
I don't sleep much, paper thoughts waking me

Talkin' to a nigga like, trigga keep makin' me
They can't see me when they do I'm what they hate to see
I eat good, they just 'wan salt shaker me

Bread on the rise, I ain't talkin' 'bout a bakery
Devils in disguise everywhere, yeah pray for me

Know you niggas pussy but get off my dick
And don't quote me boy cause I ain't said shit
I ain't said nuttin', I'm too busy frontin, ungh

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Cruisin' down the street in my benzo, couple of freaks
Couple of hoes, I only met 'em all like a couple ago
Still I treat 'em like stacks, got a couple to blow

Nobody takin' nothin' from Songz except a loss
Nobody puttin' fear in my heart except for god
Competitors R.I.P, dead as a bitch, lyrics spit one hell of a clip

A.R. say that they hard, leave 'em in graveyards
One big diamond, call a nigga basegod, get it? baseball
Don't know if they draw or they just trey stall

Number one to get the number two and then erase y'all
Grass cut fool, never lose where the snakes are
Motherfuck school, nigga never had a day job

[Verse 4: Trey Songz]

Shout to all the niggas faced off with the jacob
Fuck pool, on the corner pocket full of 8 balls

And fuck you nigga, I be droppin' napalm
And it's cool nigga gon' get yo hate on
Got a big dick and she gon' put her face on
Ass so big and the shit is like her waist, gone
Swingin' from a pole, pussy poppin' in the Bronx
Then I made it rain like the Cartegena Don
Do it so big they should call a nigga Pun
All I do is win, they should call a nigga won(Juan), ungh

Hol' up chula, I'm all about that loot
But I'll knock that boot, drop top that coup
Swoop, hoop (swish), miss that booth

[Verse 5: Trey Songz]

If I don't R.I.P that booth, then I don't know who do
I don't know, who you? Different city errday and I don't know you beau
I don't owe you beau, prolly know my crew

Get around like I came to the bar with a group to get wet
Respect the hoes that don't oppose to let me hold they necks in sex

And she sittin' right next to me
So I don't know why the girl keep textin' me
Talkin' bout she love me, forever thinkin' of me
Trust me, just come in the bathroom and fuck me

Wake up in the mornin' and my eyes all crusty ungh
She will and she still wan' touch me
But we gotta catch a flight, another show tonight
Say it gotta be wrong cause it felt so right when she bust it

Now she got a problem sayin' bye-bye
Tryna ask a nigga 'bout the wi-fi

She just wanna skype, and I just wanna pipe
Was only one night, baby go back to ya life
Life, it's a gamble, we just roll dice
That shit'll be in shambles if you don't roll right

And you know how I get, couple side bets
Fuck is a entrée if yain't got a side dish

Then dessert is what they serving
Treating rappers like a server
Leave 'em murdered then deserted
You watchin', are you observing?

Nigga I'mma get mine and you know that I deserve that
Lemme hol' dat, lemme hol' dat

Yeah, lemme hol' dat, lemme hol' dat ... 2 WOOP

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think
That the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
That life's a bore
So full of the superficial

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Verse 2: Usher with Alicia Keys]
Some people search for a fountain
Promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them
Listen baby, hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

[Chorus: Usher & Alicia Keys, Both]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Outro: Alicia Keys & Usher, Both]
If I ain't got you with me baby (With me, baby)
Said nothin' in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby
Just us

I see my dream, son!
Every time I dive in my pool, it's hard to be humble
When I do the breaststroke through an underground tunnel
And come up on the other side in a Jacuzzi
Being greeted by two naked models with suds on their booties
They give me hugs and lots of kisses and they ask me what my wish is
I say go and call your bitches cause there's gonna be a party
Next they wash my body as a team
And they say "Foo, your royal penis is clean!"
And I'm like

Wakin' up next to a beautiful girl
Step outside and say hello to my beautiful world
Grandma's cooking breakfast; she makes pancakes the best
I check my MySpace and I've got a lot of friend requests
Yes!
I get to dancing as I, walk through my mansion cause I
Own property from California to the Hamptons and I
Sip from my water fountain that dispenses soda
Look out the window and wave at my next door neighbor Oprah
I check to see how my album's doing today
The group LMFAO goes double platinum, hey
I gotta party, man, that's how I live
So I take my elevator to the club in my crib like

Forever young, forever young

[Intro: Chace Infinite]
Shit, nigga

Fuck these niggas man, go get it (A$AP, niggas)
Ya feel me? (Uh) Keep it G

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
This is music for the villains, sophisticated children
A$AP in the house, now we're finna run the building
Working never chilling 'til I get a million
To the ceiling, now my niggas gunning for a billion
They ask me how I'm living, I say I'm gold grilling
Niggas acting different, mothafuck' a friendship
These bitches is persistent, talking 'bout I'm distant
Lost my mind a long time ago to find it, need forensics
For instance, I get-get my dick licked
Red bone, complexion like a piglet, kiss-kiss
Fuck Ace, we sip Cris, afford it cause I'm getting it
Drip-drip, the thought of it is ignorant, isn't it? (Hahahah)
I'm ticklish, stunting is my business
Swagging on you hoes and I'm shitting on you niglets
So little homie, peep game
Cause these other rappers lame and don't care to do the same
Young blood

[Chorus: SpaceGhostPurrp & A$AP Rocky]
(Ay, young blood) Stay true to the game
Fuck them lames, keep it motherfuckin' G
(Ay, young blood) Nigga I'ma tell you
Like a mothafuckin' G told me
(Ay, young blood) Stay true to yourself
Every day, low-motherfuckin'-key
(Ay, young blood) Cause at the end of the day
Fuck what you say, nigga I'ma keep it G (Uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 2: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Well, let me tell you 'bout a nigga like me
I be smoking, choking, black locing with the OE
She wanna take a dick ride, we slide
Straight to the telly, shaking her jelly with my dick inside
Hit it in motion, in slow motion, hit it
Nigga she open, nigga I'm poking, split it
With it, get it right there in the bed
Open up your legs, let me beat that pussy red
Fuck what you said, I'ma still do me
Groupies, be sucking and fucking, porno movie
Do we have a problem in here?
Look a nigga in the eye as I notice the fear
I am severe, my style is hella sharp like a spear
All I do is sit back and think with the 40 beer
And you gotta feel the funk
While the bass plays loud, booming all in your damn trunk

[Chorus: SpaceGhostPurrp & A$AP Rocky]
(Ay, young blood) Stay true to the game
Fuck them lames, keep it motherfuckin' G
(Ay, young blood) Nigga I'ma tell you
Like a mothafuckin' G told me
(Ay, young blood) Stay true to yourself
Every day, low-motherfuckin'-key
(Ay, young blood) Cause at the end of the day
Fuck what you say, nigga I'ma keep it G (Uh, uh, uh)

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Ooh, ooh
Woah, yeah
Ooh (Yeah)

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fuckin' sing-along
So, girl, what you singin' for?
It's 'cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowin' like a C4
Twenty, keep the bar rollin'
Fake IDs in the trash, we goin'
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash comin' straight from Poland

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Why? 'Cause they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew, woah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
Smokin' weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know where Harvard gets us
But seein' my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times where I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers, just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say, "Your lyrics do shit for me"
I told my story and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for twenty
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathin'
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Loving the crew, oh
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Woah

[Outro: The Weeknd]
'Cause we blowin' like a C4
Got my whole crew blowin' like a C4
(If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city)

[Intro]
Yeah
You ever prayed for something your whole life?
I mean, all you dreamed about was this one thing
I mean, you know it’s coming
You have faith and all that
But sometimes
Sometimes you second guess yourself
That’s human nature I suppose, second guessing
When life seems to take you through more downs than ups
Seems like it gives you more losses than wins
But do you stand tall and be bold
Or do you fold?
Do you believe?
See, me, I came a long way
Way too far for me to stop now
Not that I would stop anyways, but
I’m so close, I can feel it
Can you feel it?
Warm Up

[Verse 1]
I told you how you hurt me, baby
But you don't care
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby
But you don't care
Ain't nobody tell me this is love
When you're immune to all my pain
I need you to tell me this is love
You don't care?
Well, that's okay

[Chorus]
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

[Verse 2]
Ever since you knew your power, you made me cry
And now everytime our love goes sour, you won't sympathize
You see these tears falling down to my ears
I swear you like when I'm in pain, yeah
I try to tell you all my fears
You still don't care?
That's okay

[Chorus]
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

[Bridge]
Boy, maybe if you cared enough
I wouldn't have to care so much
What happened to our trust?
Now you're just given up
You used to be so in love
Now you don't care no more

[Interlude]
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, whoa

[Chorus]
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

[Outro]
I still care
I still care
I still care

[Intro]
Cam Erlim, is that it?
Oh no, Cam Rellim, haha
Cam Rellim at your service, with these verses

[Verse 1]
Ayo, I'm park bench chillin', burger patty grillin'
Everybody love to say my name is Rumpelstiltskin
Call up Wolfgang Puck, tell him come and bring a meal in
My stomach full, I'll go against the world like Scott Pilgrim
Way above the buildin', bungee jumpin' down
They say I'm gettin' trendy like I come after a pound sign
Hashtag Mac, this ain't backpack rap
Give a fuck 'bout what you sayin' after platinum-plated plaques
Take it back, cookin' on them hoes, you can make a casserole
Mad that I can rap so well, and everything all factual
Ain't worth it, if not laughable, I'm off the wall as racquetball
Dick that keep your girl awake all night, they call it Adderall
Youngin' on his grind, workin' harder than your dad work
Black shirt, Rellim Cam, that's my name said backwards
Ask first, hell nah, treat 'em like a bellhop
Let 'em hold my bags and give a tip for that ass, boy

[Chorus]
I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Never be too old to be chillin' at the playground
Shorty come and kick it at the swings (At the swings)
I'm way too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Cops comin', muthafucker, stay down
Girl, I'll be waitin' at the swings (Hey) (At the swings)

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I'm Blue Park slidin', go-cart drivin'
Got this rap shit down to a science
My Louis belt way nicer than Orion's, confined to an assignment
You won't finish in the kitchen, like appliance
Is just a muthafuckin' kid, say my head is gettin' big
No, that's my ego, trippin' somewhere where they need a ski-slope
Rockin' in the fall like a pea-coat, freaks with a deep throat
Students run the class, y'all should keep notes
Drunk then I'm hard to understand, Don Vito
Ace in the Casino, I'm Robert De Niro
I be low, key though, young nino with my jeans low, heh
Your girl love it when I speak slow, she go *Woman moans*
You can hear the way she's moanin'
Started back at midnight, at it 'til the mornin'
Wake up with some mornin' wood
Hit it before work, yeah, I'm sure she would
All my female fans like, "I'm sure it's good," haha

[Chorus]
I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Never be too old to be chillin' at the playground
Shorty come and kick it at the swings (At the swings)
I'm way too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Cops comin', muthafucker, stay down
Girl, I'll be waitin' at the swings (At the swings)

Smoke
Ty Beats (Ty)

[Verse 1: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Back in this bitch mothafucka', yeah it's me
SpaceGhostPurrp and I put your bitch to sleep
Me and my twin at it again with this phonk
Sipping on gin, living in sin, lean in the trunk
RIP to Screw, rest in peace to Pimp C
Shout out to the H and that fucking SUC
My fucking brain is purple, nigga

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (ASAP, swag, swag, swag)
I said everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
It be that pretty mothafucka' sipping that throwed
Gripping my pistol, my chrome
Hidden to hit you then splitting your wig into something
I spit it and flip it like Bone
Niggas ain't ready for the flow switch
Only Harlem nigga on his Bone shit
Tippin 4s since back in 06
Won't you see a nigga getting throwed bitch?
Two middle fingers to the showbiz
Cause they selfish and they show bus'
Cause they shelf kids and it's hopeless
Career dying quicker than a goldfish
I be the fly young fella (Yeah) Maison Martin Margiela (Uh)
Bitches Cinderellas under my umbrella, I go and tell her

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
I said everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

[Verse 3: A$AP Nast]
Uh, all hell here, bitch it's Satan talking
Told her to take it off, give her the D, she take the offense
Skinny nigga balling, trip but never falling
Who said to make it rain (rain)? Bitch I make it pouring
I'm a cake-o-saurus, go study my nature
Big chain on me like Treach from Naughty by Nature
Fuck what you saying, no way
A hater don't faze a gangster
Brought up in danger, all about paper
Smoking on purple, bitch, I'm dangerous, nasty crazy
90s baby, momma I made it
Up to the sky, goodbye to the pavement
Hoes get caught in amazement
I'm stuck in my ways
So fuck 'em up, I fuck 'em and duck 'em for days
What more can I say? (Yeah) I'm chasing this paper
That's purple, nigga

[Intro]
I just, I just live
I live day by day, fighting demons

[Verse]
I smoked away my brain, I think I’m going dumb
Cocaine up on my gums, I think they’re going numb
I’m having stomach pains, now I’m throwing up
'Cause I’m a microphone fiend, give me the bass
Give me the beat, and let me lean, tap the vein, let it stream
Feel the pain, young Martin Luther King, with a dream
That one day that my team, we can make it with this rappin'
Now we swaggin', makin' money in Manhattan, trick, what’s happenin'?
They try to intellect with indirection just to test you
A rebel 'til my death, it’s in my flesh, it’s in my vessels
Fuck the clique you with, I’m finna fuck the bitch you next to
Fuck a metrosexual, suck a dick, I’m disrespectful
You know the kid get it, get-get sick
Spit clip, spit quick, split shit, hit kid's women
Oh, that’s your girl, huh? Well, I just hit it
It’s A$AP nigga, live with it, swag

[Chorus]
Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
(Thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you) Add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they start to drown me
Lord, don't leave me all alone
(Thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you) Add it to your thoughts
Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
(Thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you) Add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they start to drown me
Lord, don't leave me all alone
(Thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you) Add it to your thoughts

[Interlude]
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah (Let the beat chill)
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah (Let the beat chill)
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah (Let the beat chill)
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah (I'm a hipster by heart, but I can tell you how the streets feel)

[Chorus]
Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone

These evil thoughts, they start to drown me
Lord, don't leave me all alone

[Intro]
I don't want nobody more than you
Just want your body on this morning dew
I got these covers laying right for us
Ain't nobody looking, it's just mother nature watching while I'm...

[Verse 1]
My baby dear, this feeling here
Can't be described, but I'mma try
Nails in my back, grabbing your ass
Grinding slow hearts beating fast

[Hook]
Sweat dripping off your body onto mine
Ain't nothing better than when I'm inside
She got her legs on my shoulders
Looking in my eyes
Not the bed or the sofa
Getting it in outside
Knew that you were scared
You ain't even want to try
But girl it's no surprise
Feels so good I'm bout to cry
While I'm inside
Deep inside your love (Deep deep)
Deep inside your love (Deep deep)
Deep inside your love (Deep deep deep deep)
Inside
Deep inside your love (Deep deep)
Deep deep deep up in deep inside
Deep inside your love
Deep inside your love

[Verse 2]
Your legs start to shiver girl
You talking with your eyes
I hear you girl (I hear you baby)
I listen when you tell me
Ain't no words necessary girl
Girl we doing what we doing very well

[Hook]

[Outro]
Inside, inside--
Inside--
Yeah--

[Verse 1]
Ran into you yesterday
Memories rushed through my brain
Its starting to hit me
Now you're not with me
I realized I made a mistake
Thought that I needed some space
I just let love go to waste
Its so crystal clear now
That I need you here now
Got to get you back today

[Hook]
This time I want it all
This time I want it all
I'm showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take a chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me

[Verse 2]
I hit the bar every night
Looking to score a good time
Its not like I planned it
But left empty handed
Cause I'm still alone in my mind
Now what will it take to feel right
Can I come see you tonight
Is there someone new now
What can I do now
Cause I need you back by my side

[Hook]
This time I want it all
This time I want it all
I'm showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take a chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me

[Bridge]
Last time I wasn't sure
This time I will give you more
I'm more than sure
I'll show you
Last time I didn't know
I messed up when I let you go
I need you, don't say no

[Middle 8]
Lying alone in this room
All that is missing is you
Pick up the phone
Won't you come home

[Hook]
This time I want it all
This time I want it all
I'm showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take a chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me

[Verse 1]
Let me take your clothes off
And lay you on this bed
My hands around your neck girl
Your body soaking wet
Yea

Asap tat is on a nigga permanent
Long hair a nigga might just throw a perm in it
Maserati ridin' catch a nigga swervin' in
I'm moving fast, you can't catch up to my turbulence
Smoking lemon kush, yeah I'm eating good
I see the limit push, and I'ma leave for good
L-lil mama lookin' she heard I eat it good
They call me Hollywood, but I'm a keep it hood

Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke, "I'm out in Miami, too"
Clubbin' hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fuckin' with her, I don't really need her, aw
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
One time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted, door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet, niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet, skeet, skeet, water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt, Tunechi!

[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO

[Verse 3: Tyga]
T-Raww, skinny nigga, big balls
Fuck around and get dragged: RuPaul
You funny little nigga, Duval
Out of this world, Total Recall
Call a bitch, ride dick like a seesaw
Sorta like a donkey, act a ass nigga hee-haw
Ridin round in the ‘rarri wit the top off
While you in the window, man I’m probably on my next car
Aight, mighty duck with the ice on
Real LA nigga, chucks with the gun drawn
Drawing on your face you’re a clown jack in the box
Boy that’s your bop, she my new pum pum star
Stars in the back, them my homies, they don’t act
Acting brand new, fuck her never call her back
Matt Forte got the bitch running back
Damn, That’s the motto you don’t know it’s like that

[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]

I woke up feelin' like the mother fuckin' man
2005 I had a fuckin' master plan, 2011 I hold a Hundred Million
In my hand, Im the king, yes, yes, yes I am
Niggas talkin' down, but bitch im goin' up
Ridin' through my damn city like what, the fuck
I'm a god damn mother fuckin' prophet
Niggas hatin' on my clique I tell a bitch, stop it
Hold that, ho fast ima getta ho thangs
Chicken one swing and it look like propanes
Goddamn its Lil' Dre, swag bout a hundred k
Any rapper, any beat, im hittin' nigga Hundred times
Lil' Dre a Hundred riding drum on that clip through
Tell em what that shit do, that whole thang will flip you
Your whole crew gon' miss you, missle
Nigga the hollow tip will hit you from narrow bone to your tissue, what up?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]

I woke up, Anotha day
I might hit the mall and spend about a Hundred K
They call me Soulja Boy, or Lil' Dre
If ye ain't talkin' money, get the fuck up out my face
If its a murder scene, there ain't no witness
I ain't bein' mean bitch, I'm just bout business
Go an rep where you from, nigga throw it up
In my Bugatti, police trynna slow me up
If I ran for the damn election, I would get elected
Swag so meticulous
I lived to see a black president, I lived to see a 20 million dollar residence
Its Lil' Dre, man I feel great
Fuck your life, fuck your bitch, fuck your mama too
Fuck Any nigga hatin' on my fuckin' crew
SOD money gang, bitch I thought you knew

[Hook]
I be nothing but ???boy ???boy
Thank God I'm a Country Boy

Thank God, Thank God I'm a Country Boy, boy
